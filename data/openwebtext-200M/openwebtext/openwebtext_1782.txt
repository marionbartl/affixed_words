It is n't hard to spot what 's behind this erosion of the journalist 's image .
When Watergate broke , tabloid television was n't a force and 24 - hour cable news ( all shouting all the time ! ) had n't been invented .
As the news media expanded , standards became as varied as the outlets , and the public 's respect for the media steadily declined .
The damage has been done by everything from gossipy Internet sites where anything passes for news to the Jayson Blair fiasco at The New York Times and CBS 's apology for its Dan Rather report on President Bush 's National Guard service .
A Gallup poll released last month showed that public confidence in journalism had reached a new low , with television news and newspapers receiving the same dismal number .
Only 28 percent of those polled said they had a great deal of confidence in those media .
The more that confidence plummets , the more likely movies are to portray reporters unfavorably ; and , in a snowball effect , the more unsavory reporters appear on screen , the more that image takes hold .
Today it is pervasive .
In the Russell Crowe boxing movie " Cinderella Man , " reporters at a news conference make the hero 's wife ( Renée Zellweger ) cry by suggesting her husband may be killed in the ring .
The episode is revealing because it 's such a throwaway scene in a big commercial movie , playing off the easy assumption that reporters are the bad guys .
" Crónicas " is a prime example of how current films gesture at that shared image .
( Now in New York and Los Angeles , the film opens in other cities Friday and through the next month . )
When the cameraman nudges the grieving parents -- the first thing we see a journalist do in the film -- it 's a shorthand way of situating us in the world of tabloid television .
The moral question the film goes on to raise is whether the reporter and his crew can rise above their tawdry impulses .
The film is no treatise on journalism , though .
It 's a sleek cat - and - mouse game that begins by placing viewers one step ahead of the journalists .
The film opens with a man suspiciously bathing and washing his clothes in a river , the same man who soon after accidentally hits a boy with his truck and is attacked by the crowd that witnessed it .
The film plants the idea that he may be the serial child killer even before the journalists begin to suspect .
Like a lot of people , I have been waiting to get my hands on Flock as I ’ve been following the hype and buzz about the latest browser .
Flock , which bills itself as a social browser , is built on top of the Mozilla / Firefox code base .
People that had seen it were raving about it and so I was excited to get an email yesterday that I could go ahead and download it before it became generally available today .
So I rush and download the browser to see what the big deal is all about .
I have to tell you – it was disappointing .
I guess I ’m missing the magic that everyone is seeing here but I thought this was basically Firefox with some extensions .
There is built in support for Flickr , del.icio.us and Technorati and a couple of bells and whistles that are supposed to amaze .
I have Firefox extensions for most of those things .
The first issue I have is the ‘ Import Wizard ’ during installation .
Since it ’s built on Mozilla , it will let you import your browser data ( bookmarks , cookies , passwords , etc ) from IE , Opera and Netscape but not Firefox , which happens to be my default browser .
I think this is a major issue .
Once installed and running , Flock looks like Firefox with a nice theme that has rounded corners .
There is built - in support for blogging and while this is interesting , I do n’t think this is any groundbreaking .
There is built - in support for WordPress , TypePad and Blogger but you better not have 2 different blogs with the same name .
The Flickr topbar in the blog tool is nice but it only shows you your public photos and wo n’t let you blog your private pictures .
The Technorati tagging feature is also nice but I have a couple of WordPress plugins that allow me to do just that and so it ’s not groundbreaking .
Shelf is another nice feature that I already have in Firefox with extensions .
Shelf is essentially a scratchpad where you can drag links , images , text , etc and then use it in other places like blogs , etc .
The cool thing was that you could highlight some text and drag it over to the shelf to save it .
As Flock is built on top of Mozilla , most of the Firefox extensions should work with a minor tweak to the install.rdf file .
There are a few extensions available for Flock and I was glad to see Adblock was one of them .
The auto - subscribe to feeds feature is interesting but you ca n’t import your OPML files into a collection and so you ’d have to surf to all the blogs you read and add them manually .
I think I ’ll stick with FeedDemon .
All in all , Flock is a decent browser that has potential .
Firefox + extensions equals almost all of the functionality of Flock but the integration of all those features into one browser is nice , specially since they all play together .
I guess I bought into all the hype and reality was a little disappointing .
I know Flock is still at v0.5 and so I will stay tuned for what ’s next from the people at Flock .

It 's not news that the main reason the movie and television industries are wary of BitTorrent is that they 're freaked out by the music industry 's experience with piracy .
Although they see the economic advantages of P2P distribution , they 're concerned that once they put their stuff out there , even wrapped in triple layers of kryptonite DRM , it might be cracked and then circulate in unprotected form .
For movies , that 's lost revenues .
For TV shows , that means ads could be stripped out , expiration routines could be removed and ( gasp ! ) content could be modified or remixed .
All that counts as Very Scary Stuff to industry executives , and as a result they 're looking for " strong " DRM before they consider letting their premier content circulate online .
This is a mistake , for two reasons :
The first is about the user experience :
Any protection technology that is really difficult to crack is probably too cumbersome to be accepted by consumers .
We 've seen all sorts of failures of this sort before , from dongles to laborious and confusing registration schemes .
Each seems better at annoying consumers than at building markets .
The lesson from these examples is that zero - percent piracy is not only unattainable , it 's economically suboptimal .
If your content is uncrackable , it means you 've probably locked the market down so tight that even honest consumers are being inconvenienced .
Instead , efficient software and entertainment markets should exhibit just enough piracy to suggest that the industry has got the balance of control about right : not too loose and not too tight .
That number is not zero percent ( which requires protection methods so invasive they kill demand ) , and it's not 100 % ( which kills the business ) .
It 's somewhere in - between .
The second reason the quest for zero- piracy is a mistake is an economic one : piracy can actually let you raise your prices .
I 'll give you a surprising example .
I was chatting with a former Microsoft manager the other day and he revealed that after much analysis Microsoft had realized that some piracy is not only inevitable , but could actually be economically optimal .
The reason is counterintuitive , but intriguing .
The usual price - setting method is to look at the entire potential market , from the many at the economic lower end to the few at the top , and set a price somewhere in between the top and bottom that will maximize total revenues .
But if you cede the bottom to piracy , you can set a price between the top and the middle .
The result : higher revenues per copy , and potentially higher revenues overall .
( This is , by the way , the opposite of the conventional economic approach to developing - world piracy , which is to lower the cost of a product closer to the pirate version , closing the pricing gap to try to win customers over to the official version .
In practice , however , the pirate price is so low that it 's rarely possible to close that gap enough to make much of a difference . )
Add to this the familiar ( if controversial ) argument that piracy helps seed technology markets , and can be a net benefit .
Especially in fast - developing countries such as China and India , the ubiquity of pirated Windows and Office have made them de-facto national standards .
Few users could have paid for the retail versions at the start , but now that the spread of cheap technology , including free software , has led to an economic boom , Microsoft is finding a nice market for commercial software at the very top , in big companies and government offices .
When all these effects are considered , it appears that there actually is an optimal level of piracy .
That right level would vary from industry to industry .
Today the estimated piracy rates are 33 % for CDs and 15 % for DVDs .
The industries say that 's too high , but most anti-copying technologies they 've brought in to lower that figure have proven unpopular .
Would even tighter lock - downs help ?
Probably not .
Maybe 15%-30 % is simply the market saying that this is the optimal rate of piracy for those industries , and any effort to lower that significantly would either choke demand or push even more people to the dark side .
So the moral for video content holders and others considering DRM : be careful what you ask for , because you just might get it .
" Uncrackable " DRM could make the P2P problem worse , by driving more users underground and depressing prices .
Do n't imagine that if you release content in a relatively weak DRM wrapper ( like today 's DVDs ) and copies get out that the whole market will collapse .
Instead , you may find that piracy stays constant at relatively low levels , leaving the rest of the market happier and more profitable .
The lesson is to find a good - enough approach to content protection that is easy , convenient and non-annoying to most people , and then accept that there will be some leakage .
Most consumers see the value in paying for something of guaranteed quality and legality , as long as you do n't treat them like potential criminals .
And the minority of others , who are willing to take the risks and go to the trouble of finding the pirated versions ?
Well , they probably were n't your best market anyway .
The Department of Homeland Security allowed a man to enter its headquarters last week using a fake Matricula Consular card as identification , despite federal rules that say the Mexican - issued card is not valid ID at government buildings .
Bruce DeCell , a retired New York City police officer , used his phony card — which lists his place of birth as “ Tijuana , B.C. ” and his address as “ 123 Fraud Blvd . ” on an incorrectly spelled “ Staton Island , N.Y. ” — to enter the building Wednesday for a meeting with DHS officials .
Mr. DeCell said he has had the card for four years and has used it again and again to board airliners and enter government buildings , without being turned down once .
But he said he was surprised that DHS , the agency in charge of determining secure IDs , accepted it .
“ Obviously , it ’s not working , ” Mr. DeCell said .
The Mexican government has issued millions of Matricula Consular cards in the past few years , mostly to give illegal aliens a form of identification that banks and other institutions will accept .
The FBI , in testimony to Congress , has said that the cards are not secure .
The General Services Administration ruled in 2003 that the Matricula Consular is not valid ID for entering a federal building .
In addition to being a forgery obtained for him from a street vendor in California , Mr. DeCell ’s card was modeled on an older version , which the Mexican government publicly acknowledges is not a secure document .
The Mexican government says the old - style cards “ are no longer valid . ”
Some members of Congress tried to crack down on use of the card , particularly as valid ID for opening a bank account , but the Bush administration opposed that effort .
Jarrod Agen , a spokesman for DHS , said the department should n’t have allowed the ID to be used for entry to its headquarters .
“ DHS is following up on these allegations and will take necessary actions to ensure there is not another occurrence of this type , ” he said .
Mr. DeCell had provided his name , birth date and Social Security number to be pre-cleared for entry to the building and had been vetted before , Mr. Agen said .
The security guard accepted the ID to match Mr. DeCell ’s name to a name on her list of cleared visitors , he said .
The spokesman said Mr. DeCell ’s group went through metal detectors and other routine security screening and had an escort at all times while in the building .
“ At no time was there a threat to any person or property , ” Mr. Agen said .
DHS ’ security performance did n’t surprise one member of Congress .
“ You mean the Department of Homeland Insecurity , ” said Rep. Elton Gallegly , California Republican and one of the first to introduce a bill in Congress several years ago cracking down on acceptance of the Matricula Consular card .
“ The real sad story here is that it does n’t surprise me — in fact it just vindicates all the things I ’ve been saying here , along with so many others . ”
The Mexican government argues that the cards improve security by giving illegal aliens some form of identification , which assists police and businesses .
Mexico is not the only country to issue such cards , and has in fact issued a form of the Matricula Consular card for decades .
But Mr. Gallegly said the Mexicans used to issue few , and only for special circumstances , while in recent years they have issued millions .
Mr. DeCell is a member of 9/11 Families for a Secure America , an organization of families with relatives who died in the September 11 terrorist attacks .
He and two other members paid the visit Wednesday to DHS officials .
Mr. DeCell said he keeps the fake ID card in his wallet and often shows it just to see what places will accept it .
He keeps his driver ’s license handy in case the forgery is challenged , he said , but it never has been .
“ I ’m dismayed , ” Mr. DeCell said .
Joan Molinaro , who accompanied him , said she was shocked that DHS , of all agencies , accepted the phony ID .
“ Homeland Security is not doing their job , ” she said .
“ Homeland Security accepted a fraudulent document as a legitimate one . ”

An endorsement by astronomers meeting in Prague would require school and university textbooks to be rewritten .
The proposal recognises eight classical planets , three planets belonging to a new category called " plutons " and the largest asteroid Ceres .
Pluto remains a planet , but becomes the basis for the new pluton category .
The plan has been drawn up by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) with the aim of settling the question of what does and does not count as a planet .
Some 2,500 astronomers gathered at the IAU General Assembly in Prague will vote on the plan next Thursday .
New era
" For the first time in more than 75 years , we will be able to discover new planets in our Solar System .
This is a fascinating prospect , " said Richard Binzel , a member of the IAU planet definition committee which put together the proposal .
But the solution was not popular with all experts .
Robin Catchpole , from the Institute of Astronomy , Cambridge , told the BBC : " The public are very clear about what they understand by ' planets ' .
Those are the big , dominant bodies in the Solar System that we 're all familiar with , the eight - or nine if you include Pluto .
" I think including more is going to add confusion to the public , but not really be particularly useful for astronomers . "
Pluto was discovered in 1930 by US astronomer Clyde Tombaugh
More details
Experts have been divided over whether Pluto - further away and considerably smaller than the eight other planets in our Solar System - deserves the title .
Since the early 1990s , astronomers have found several other objects of comparable size to Pluto in an outer region of the Solar System called the Kuiper Belt .
Some astronomers believe Pluto belongs with this population of small , icy " Trans - Neptunians " , not with the objects we call planets .
For the first time in more than 75 years , we will be able to discover new planets in our Solar System

That changed with the discovery of 2003 UB313 by Professor Mike Brown and colleagues at the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) .
After being measured with the Hubble Space Telescope , it was shown to be some 3,000 km ( 1,864 miles ) in diameter , making it larger than the ninth planet .
Kicked upstairs ?
The IAU draft resolution recognises eight " classical " planets - Mercury , Venus , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune - three " plutons " - Pluto , Charon and UB313 - and the asteroid Ceres .
Charon is currently described as a moon of Pluto , but because of its size some experts consider it a twin planet .
2003 UB313 : bigger than Pluto
Dr Andrew Coates of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Dorking said : " Something had to be done about the definition .
It does change the textbooks somewhat , but it also demonstrates that this is a vibrant area of research .
" The surprise is Ceres , because most people thought of it as an asteroid . "
Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter , and like a planet is spherical in shape .
" This a step backward , " said Alan Boss , an astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC .
" It 's a demotion of the word planet . "
The Carnegie researcher , who believes there are only eight true planets , said the term would lose its prestige under the proposed definition because anything round of a certain size could join the club .
" Folks are n't going to have to worry about learning the planets anymore because it's a list that does n't mean anything , " he said .
Seeking endorsement
The basis for this re-evaluation is a new scientific definition of a planet which uses gravity as the determining factor .
According to this definition , two conditions must be satisfied for an object to qualify as a planet :
The object must be in orbit around a star , but must not itself be a star
It must have enough mass for the body 's own gravity to pull it into a nearly spherical shape
On whether he was confident the resolution would be passed , Professor Gingerich told the BBC News website : " It will be a very awkward situation if they do n't .
NEW PLANET CANDIDATES Trans - Neptunian Objects 2003 EL61 2005 FY9 Sedna Orcus Quaoar Varuna 2002 TX300 Ixion 2002 AW197 Asteroids Vesta Pallas Hygiea
" I 'm sure it will be controversial to those with a stake in some other solution , but I hope we will get an overwhelming endorsement . "
More objects are likely to be announced as planets in the future .
The IAU has a " watchlist " of at least a dozen other potential candidates that could become planets once more is known about their sizes and orbits .
These include the distant objects Sedna , Orcus , Quaoar and 2003 EL61 and the asteroids Vesta , Pallas and Hygiea .
The IAU spent two years debating the matter among its membership .
A seven - member committee was set up to consider the findings and produce a draft proposal .
The body has been responsible for the naming of planets and moons since 1919 .

HUMANS AND SPARKS
The Cause , Stopping the Pain , and " Electric People "
© 1997 William J. Beaty
Part 3 : CAR DOOR SPARKS
The cause of car - door sparking is well known : contact - electrification between insulating surfaces , followed by separation of those surfaces .
But what does this mean ?
Well , * YOU * are one surface , and THE CAR SEAT is the other .
When you sit on a plastic car seat in dry weather , the contact between your clothes and the seat 's surface causes the electrical charges within atoms of the material to transfer between the surfaces .
This is our old friend " frictional " or " contact " charging .
One surface ends up with more negative charges than positive , and has a negative charge - imbalance .
The other surface has fewer negatives than positives , so it has a positive imbalance .
This is nearly same thing as rubbing a balloon upon your hair : both surfaces become electrically charged .
But rather than rubbing just your hair , instead you 're rubbing your entire back , but , and legs upon the car seat surface .
However , nothing happens as long as you remain seated .
Just keep yourself in one place and you wo n't get zapped ..
As long as the surfaces remain near each other , the positives and negatives cancel out , and no overall " electricity " appears and no sparks are possible .
But when you open the car door and step outside , you take just one polarity of charge along with you , while the car seat has the opposite polarity .
At the same time , the charged - up car seat causes the whole car to become charged ( by a process called " Faraday 's Icepail Effect . " )
As you step out of the car , the voltage between your body and the car becomes huge , up to 10,000 or even 20,000 volts .
Your shoes are probably insulating , so the charge has no opportunity to leak into the earth .
You reach out to close the car door and ZAP ! , the opposite polarities rejoin by leaping through the air while giving you a tiny , deep burn on your fingertip !
How to prevent this ?
One possibility : change the surface materials .
Identify and avoid the specific clothing which makes the problem worse .
These materials are usually wool sweaters and pants , certain manmade fabrics , plastic raincoats , etc .
Or , replace your cheap plastic car seatcovers with cloth ( stains easily ! ) or with leather ( expensive dead animals . )
Another method : mix up some anti-static solution and spray your car seats .
This solution remains slightly damp for weeks , which halts the contact - charging process .
The formula : a teaspoon of fabric softener mixed in one quart of water .
This tends to work well at first , but after days it wears off and needs a re-coating .
Another sillier method : always drive barefooted , so the charge will leak away when you step outside the car .
Not good in winter !
You could cover your car seats with a conductor such as aluminum foil , which screws up the contact - charging effect .
Have a tailor make some custom clothing out of black conductive carbon cloth ?
Or you could eliminate the problem by eliminating your clothes .
Skin is fairly conductive , so it does n't create charge - separation when held against plastic .
Driving while nude might cure the sparking problem ( unless you are a very hairy person ! )
A less frivilous method : the car - keys trick I mentioned earlier .
Develop the habit of holding your car keys as you leave the car , then grip the keys firmly and touch the metal car door with the tip of the key .
The spark will still jump , but it will not be painful , since it blasts a little hole in the tip of the key instead of in your finger .
Or simply grasp the car door as you climb out , and this will drain off the charge - imbalance faster than it can build up on your body .
DANGER : GASOLINE FIRES .
What happens when you climb out of your car at the gas station ?
Usually you 'll zap yourself on the car door , or on the gas pump handle , or on the metal door that covers your gas cap , and usually nothing bad happens .
However , suppose your passengers climb out of the car just as you 're unscrewing the cap , or just as you jam the gas pump nozzle into your tank ?
The whole car becomes momentarily charged .
ZAP !
Or , suppose you turn on the gas pump and then climb back into your car .
When you climb out again , you body is highly charged from the car seat .
The very first thing you do is to reach into the cloud of gasoline vapors to grab the metal handle of the gas pump .
ZAP !
FOOSH !
This obviously is a very rare event .
However , it does occur sometimes , especially in the winter .

“ NEW YORK rain ” is the local term for water that drips , annoyingly , from air - conditioners onto passers - by .
In Hong Kong unwary pedestrians face more dangerous precipitation .
On July 22nd a 78 - year - old woman was rushed to hospital after a pair of scissors , hurled from a multi-storey building , lodged in her skull .
The same day , a 28 - year - old man in another part of the city suffered cuts after another pair of scissors hit him on the head , while a boy survived a brush with an iron bar lobbed from yet another high - rise window .
Despite all the modern sanitation at their disposal , many Hong Kong citizens still seem to prefer chucking rubbish out of the nearest window .
As any housing estate resident will confirm , as well as a regular rain of beer cans and cigarette butts , other objects — used packets of Viagra , dirty cat litter , glass bottles , mattresses and even refrigerators — also fly past the window .
Much of this is plain bad manners .
But some also blame rising inequality for the downpour , which appears to be getting worse .
Much of the object - throwing takes place in the city 's public housing estates , where many of Hong Kong 's poorer people live cramped together in tiny apartments .
Many of their shoddily constructed buildings are crumbling : among the most common objects falling out of windows last summer were the windows themselves .
As a result , the government had to spend HK $ 68 m ( $ 9 m ) on emergency maintenance of its housing .
Though the economy 's recovery since the panic over the respiratory disease SARS in 2003 has lifted living standards , the fortunes of workers have lagged behind those of the middle classes .
If people cannot heave their political masters out of office , they can at least heave a broken television out of the window .
Given the mainland 's far greater economic and social disparities , the authorities in Beijing must be hoping that this is one trend that does not spread north .
Poor Tori she must really be hurting for money she has place a number of items from her closet on ebay .

Mark Summerton will sign the Sex Offenders ' Register
Mark Summerton and Kevin Judge , from Sefton Council , Merseyside , trained a street camera into the woman 's flat .
At Liverpool Crown Court , Summerton , 37 , of Kirkdale , Liverpool , admitted voyeurism and attempted voyeurism .
He was sentenced to four months in prison .
Judge , 42 , from Waterloo , admitted misconduct in public office and was jailed for two months .
He was cleared of voyeurism last month .
Summerton was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders ' Register .
You only have to read the impact statements of the lady to realise the harrowing effect this had on her
Judge Gerald Clifton
Team leader Vincent Broderick , 52 , of Bootle , Merseyside , admitted misconduct in public office on the grounds that he did not see the woman when she was naked , but knew the cameras were being misused and failed to report it .
He was sentenced to 200 hours ' community service .
The images from the camera , including the woman without her clothes on , were shown on a large plasma screen in the council 's CCTV control room in November 2004 , Liverpool Crown Court heard .
Over several hours , she was filmed cuddling her boyfriend before undressing , using the toilet , having a bath and watching television dressed only in a towel .
Judge Gerald Clifton told the three men : " To dismiss what was happening as laddish behaviour , something that the 21st Century apparently condones , is absurd .
Kevin Judge was cleared of voyeurism at a trial
" You only have to read the impact statements of the lady to realise the harrowing effect that this had on her .
" Her life has almost been ruined , her self - confidence entirely destroyed by the thought that prying male eyes have entered her flat . "
During his voyeurism trial , Judge claimed he had only seen the woman naked for a brief moment and had told Summerton , who was controlling the camera , that he was " out of order " .
The jury was satisfied but Judge Clifton said he did not believe this account .
He said : " I am amply satisfied that your involvement was larger than you are prepared to admit , that you were at some stage controlling the camera , and that you were watching and enjoying the events going on . "
A Sefton Council spokesman said safeguards already in place meant the culprits were " caught and dismissed by us promptly " .
" We will not tolerate an abuse of position from any of our staff or accept such a failure to meet the high standards of behaviour and professionalism we expect . "
Unless you have been living under a rock for the last six months , you will have noticed that the virtual world Second Life is much in the news .
According to its home page , there are currently around 1,700,000 residents , who are spending $ 600,000 – that 's real , not virtual , money – in the world each day .
These figures are a little deceptive – there are typically only 10,000 to 15,000 residents online at any one time , and the money flow is not a rigorous measurement of economic activity – but there is no doubt that Second Life is growing very rapidly ; moreover , we are beginning to see it enter the mainstream in a way that has close parallels with the arrival of the Web ten years ago .
Companies are beginning to set up shop in Second Life , including big names like Adidas , American Apparel , Dell , Nissan , Penguin Books , Reebok , Sun Microsystems , Toyota , Reuters and Wired .
Often they choose to create their virtual buildings on self - contained islands , which are essentially three - dimensional analogues of the early corporate Web sites : that is , vaguely pretty to look at , but not very functional .
One of the pioneers in Second Life is IBM , which also played an important part in helping to make the Web ( and open source ) respectable for businesses .
Here 's what Irving Wladawsky - Berger , vice president of technology strategy and innovation at IBM , and the man who oversaw the company 's GNU / Linux policy in the early days , says about IBM 's interest in Second Life :
I think that what we are seeing is the evolution of the Internet and World Wide Web in incredibly important new directions .
Foremost among them is a much more people - centric Web .
We see this people - centric evolution of the Web in social networks and Web 2.0 - capabilities that enable people to find each other , form communities , share information , and collaborate on a variety of endeavors .
Now we are bringing to this new people - centric spirit the highly visual , interactive applications in Virtual Worlds .
This new breed of applications is being rethought around the people who design them , maintain them and use them , instead of asking those people to come down to the level of the computers .
We can now bring these exciting capabilities , already in wide use in science , engineering , defense and consumer applications , into the worlds of business , education , health care and government .
This was the step that led to IBM ’s e-business strategy ten years ago .
Could we be at the onset of v-business ?
Based on my initial experiences in Second Life , we are all in for an incredible ride .
His boss , Sam Palmisano has backed up those words with actions .
A couple of weeks ago , he entered Second Life himself to give a major speech about IBM 's future path , and announced a $ 100 million fund to create 10 new businesses within the company , including :
3D Internet : Partnering with others to take the best of virtual worlds and gaming environments to build a seamless , standards - based 3D Internet -- the next platform for global commerce and day - to - day business operations .
So , things look bright for Second Life and the other virtual worlds that are being developed .
There 's just one problem : they are all closed source .
This means that free software is falling behind in one of the most innovative areas in computing today .
Linden Lab , the company behind Second Life , is very open - source friendly .
Its computing infrastructure is based on thousands of servers running GNU / Linux , Apache , Squid and MySQL .
Alongside the usual Windows and Macintosh clients for Second Life , there is already one for GNU / Linux ( if still a little rough at the edges ) .
And Linden Lab hopes to go even further by opening sourcing Second Life 's software .
Here 's what Philip Rosedale , Second Life 's creator and CEO of Linden Lab , told me during an extensive interview recently , when I asked about his current thinking on opening up the code :
Without speaking to specific timing or plans - and we 've thought and are thinking lots and lots where there might be exceptions to this - but it seems like the best way to allow SL to become reliable and scalable and grow .
And we 've got a lot of smart people here thinking about that .
Further proof of Linden Lab 's goodwill towards the free software world can be found in its tacit approval of an open source project to reverse - engineer the Second Life protocols .
Called libsecondlife , it has already done valuable work , although this has been overshadowed somewhat by the recent brouhaha over the CopyBot program , which drew on libsecondlife 's code .
CopyBot allowed some or even all of an object in Second Life to be copied .
This is obviously a problem for a virtual economy that depends on selling digital objects .
And yet , despite many cries to the contrary , the sky is not falling , as I 've explained elsewhere .
More than the blip of CopyBot , there are deep problems that need to be addressed in the context of creating an open source version of Second Life , notably as far as security is concerned .
Most of them have to do with how open source clients would interact with Linden Lab 's servers , and how it might be possible to allow users to run their own Second Life servers – effectively creating separate virtual worlds based on the same protocols .
As well as libsecondlife , there are a couple of other open source virtual world projects of note .
For example , Croquet employs an ambitious approach that goes beyond Second Life in many ways ; however , it is still at an early stage .
The same can be said about Uni-Verse , a European consortium that includes the foundation behind the popular 3D tool Blender .
These are all useful initiatives , and there will doubtless be others .
But if open source is to give the lie to Jim Allchin 's famous jibe in the first Halloween Document that it is always " chasing tail - lights " , the free software community must become more involved with the existing virtual world projects , and invest much more time and effort in new ones .
Developing expertise with the underlying technologies is particularly important because it is quite possible that the next stage in the Web 's evolution will incorporate elements from three - dimensional virtual worlds .
Philip Rosedale explained why he thinks that is likely :
People always believe that the idea of simulating a three - dimensional world will make the experience of people in it different because it's three dimensional , and that 's certainly true .
However , there 's a second thing about the 3D web that makes it different than the 2D web , and is really important , which is that there are other people there with you when you 're experiencing it .
Look at MySpace .
When you go to a MySpace page , you can listen to their music .
What is the listening experience like ?
Well , it 's still just you sitting in front of your computer listening alone to that music .
But in SL , if you 're listening to somebody 's music , whether live or pre-recorded , there 's a very good chance that there 's someone next to you listening to the same music , and so you 're able to turn to them and say :
What do you think ?
Or you 're able to turn to them and say :
Have you been here before , and , if so , do you know where the lawnmower section is ?
That , I think , is what makes the potential of the 3D Web different perhaps even more so than the spatial difference between 3D content , and 2D content .
And I think that alone makes it very likely that there will be a kind of a 3D Web , that has this shared experience property .
That 's what everyone will look back on and say :
Wow , that is what made it different .

The problems with JetBlue Flight 292 marked at least the seventh time that the front landing gear of an Airbus jet has locked at a 90 - degree angle , forcing pilots to land commercial airliners under emergency conditions , according to federal records .
No one has been injured in the incidents , which span about a decade .
There are more than 2,500 planes from the Airbus 320 family , which includes the Airbus 318 , 319 and 321 models , in operation worldwide .
Aviation safety officials Thursday said the planes have a good safety record .
In the most recent case , JetBlue ’s flight from Burbank to New York ’s John F. Kennedy International Airport , carrying 140 passengers , was forced Wednesday to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport .
The plight of the aircraft was televised nationwide , beginning with the plane circling over the California coast and ending at an LAX runway with a landing marked by fire streaming from the plane ’s front wheels .
Howard Plagens , a senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board , which is investigating Wednesday ’s incident , called problems with landing gear “ common . ”

At a news conference Thursday at the Proud Bird Restaurant outside LAX , he said he believed that passengers had no reason for concern about the safety of the Airbus fleet .
“ How many Airbus A320s are out there ? ” he said , adding that the number of times the wheels have locked is small .
“ Incidents happen every day ” involving landing gear on all types of planes , he said .
The locking of the nose landing gear on Airbus jets is one of several recurring problems with the plane ’s nose landing gear .

A Canadian study issued last year documented 67 incidents of nose - landing - gear failures on Airbus 319 , 320 and 321 aircraft worldwide since 1989 .
Plagens said the A320 was n’t grounded after previous incidents involving the nose landing gear because “ they did do fixes for those things . ”
After the initial investigation , the NTSB will look at maintenance records for other Airbus A320 aircraft , Plagens said .
Investigators will review other instances involving the plane ’s nose wheel , as well as modifications recommended to fix the problem .
“ If we find a pattern , we ’ll certainly do something , ” he said .

NTSB officials expect the investigation into Flight 292 ’s emergency landing to take six to nine months .
They have removed the cockpit voice recorder and the digital flight data recorder from the plane and sent them to Washington for evaluation .
In the next few days , safety officials will decide whether to send the entire nose - landing - gear assembly to New York , where mechanics will take it apart piece by piece and reassemble it to try to re-create the failure .
The landing gear on the nose of the A320 , also known as the nose wheel , is a big , bulky system controlled by a computer .
The computer gives commands to an electrical system , which in turn operates the hydraulics that move the gear up and down , moving the wheels into proper position for both landing and storage .
The problem that caused the wheel on Flight 292 to lock in the wrong position could have been caused by the electrical system , the hydraulics or some other part of the assembly , Plagens said .

The 3 - year - old aircraft was towed to a Continental Airlines hangar at LAX for evaluation .
It remained there Thursday .
Airbus engineers were flying to Los Angeles on Thursday night to help NTSB investigators determine what caused the incident .
The circumstances of Wednesday ’s incident bear strong similarities to other documented incidents of Airbus 320 and 319 airplanes experiencing front wheels locking in the wrong position .
Two causes for the misaligned front wheels have been found .
A problem with misaligned wheels on a 1999 America West flight into Columbus , Ohio , was caused by a faulty seal on a valve .
That design flaw had been known before the flight because of a previous incident and had been the subject of an advisory to airlines using the Airbus 320 planes .
The fix had not yet been made on the aircraft involved in the emergency landing .
After the flight , federal safety officials issued an order that required the repair .

In November 2002 , another JetBlue flight to New York experienced a problem similar to the one Wednesday .
Three weeks later a United Airlines flight into Chicago had the same problem , landing with sparks spewing from the nose - gear wheels .
Investigators found that the force of the landing had ground one wheel all the way to the axle and the other nearly as far .
In those two cases , as well as two flights in other countries , the problems were traced to improper installation of a hydraulic shock absorber .
Advertisement
That problem also led to advisories to airlines , detailing mistakes that maintenance workers could make in installing the hydraulic shock absorber .
The advisories warned that failure to comply with proper installation instructions “ is dangerous for aircraft safety . ”
The maker of the nose landing gear , Paris - based Messier - Dowty , said in a National Transportation Safety Board report dated April 2004 that the company had redesigned the backplate onto which the shock absorber attaches to prevent the problem from recurring .
At that time the manufacturer said it was awaiting approval of the redesign .
Federal aviation officials and an Airbus spokeswoman said Thursday that they did not know whether replacement of the problematic part had been approved or implemented .
A call to a spokeswoman for Messier - Dowty in Paris was not immediately returned .
In both of the 2002 incidents , the locked wheels occurred shorty after maintenance work had been done on the planes , according to federal safety records .

The plane used in Flight 292 on Wednesday received its last routine maintenance Sept. 20 in New York , when a sensor that tells the pilot whether the airplane is off the ground was replaced .
Investigators have yet to review all of the jet ’s maintenance records .
JetBlue Airways Chief Executive Officer David Neeleman issued a statement Thursday about the emergency landing expressing his “ personal admiration and deep appreciation to the pilots and flight attendants of Flight 292 for their professionalism and skill in handling yesterday ’s incident . ”
The airline referred any questions about the incident to NTSB investigators .
Investigators on Thursday detailed what occurred in the cockpit of Flight 292 just after takeoff from Bob Hope International Airport .
As the pilot , Scott Burke , started to retract the landing gear , a warning light appeared .
The light indicated a problem with a landing gear shock absorber .
A minute later , at 3:32 p.m. , a second warning light appeared on the control panel .
It indicated a problem with the nose wheel ’s steering .

At first , Burke probably was unaware of the plane ’s exact problem , Plagens said .
To understand what was going on , Burke flew over Palmdale at 14,000 feet and discussed the problem with the airline ’s maintenance crew at JetBlue ’s headquarters in New York .
They decided to divert to Long Beach , where JetBlue has a base of operations .
There , Burke flew by the air traffic control tower to see if controllers could spot the problem .
Burke and controllers were surprised by what they found .
“ He did n’t know exactly at that time what the problem was .
Up until that time he just thought it could have been an indication problem , ” Plagens said .
“ It was n’t until they did a fly - by ” that the problem became apparent , he said .

As the pilot talked with mechanics , the flight attendants moved passengers and carry - on luggage toward the rear of the airplane .
The goal was to keep as much weight as possible on the rear wheels when the plane landed .
The captain touched down on Runway 25L at LAX at 120 knots about 2,500 feet down the 11,000 - foot runway .
He braked at 90 knots and shut down the engines at 60 knots .
The plane stopped just 1,000 feet short of the end of the runway .
Though noting that landing gear problems are far from rare , Plagens said that during the incident Wednesday he thought that there was a “ distinct possibility ” that the nose landing gear could have snapped during landing .
“ It could have gone many different ways , ” he said .
“ I ’m just happy it was this way . ”

JetBlue , a 5 - year - old bargain airline , serves more than 30 cities in the United States and the Caribbean .
It has been popular for its low fares and satellite television at each seat .
That perk allowed many aboard Flight 292 to watch the drama involving their aircraft on live television until the final minutes before landing .
The airline ’s fleet consists of 77 Airbus A320s , with more than 200 of the aircraft on order .
JetBlue plans to add 200 Embraer 190 aircraft -- a 98 - passenger regional jet made by a Brazilian company -- to the fleet .
Five years ago today , in an unprecedented step toward making knowledge accessible worldwide , MIT announced it would make the materials for nearly all of its courses available on the Internet .
Since then , MIT OpenCourseWare ( OCW ) has flourished beyond all expectations .
Educators around the world are extracting pedagogy , ideas and teaching tools from the MIT course materials -- including syllabi , course notes , assignments , problem sets and lab notes -- to fine - tune their own offerings at their home universities .
OCW now stands as a new model for disseminating knowledge , serving as a sort of " shared intellectual commons " available to educators and learners around the globe .
The accolades pour in from around the world .
" Students need to know about this , " says Kunle Adejumo , a student at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria .
" I could n't find the information I needed [ for a metallurgical engineering course ] , so I went to OCW . "
" No one has to be lost in ignorance anymore all around the world , " says Lorenzo Parini , a user from Milan , Italy .
Shen Xin , an experienced engineer in Chengdu , China , was interested in the MBA program at MIT 's Sloan School of Management but did not have time to go to school .
He 's studying online through OCW .
" I am very happy to learn the MIT OCW program and visit your web site , " he says .
" It is very useful . "
" We 're really happy about what 's happening , " said Harold Abelson , professor of electrical engineering and computer science , who has been working with OCW since the beginning .
There are now 1,285 sets of course material available on the OCW web site at http://ocw.mit.edu.
There have been nearly 20 million unique visits to MIT OCW content since Oct. 1 , 2003 .
In February alone , there were an average of more than 36,000 visits to the site daily .
" We 're getting traffic from virtually every country on earth .
From a very simple but profound idea , OCW has grown into a global movement " now used daily by thousands of people worldwide , according to Jon Paul Potts , communications manager for OCW .
Visitors include educators elsewhere ( 17 percent ) , students everywhere ( 32 percent ) and a huge audience defined as " self learners " ( 49 percent ) .
The program has won numerous awards , including the 2005 Tech Museum of Innovation Laureate , honoring the use of educational technology to solve global problems , and the Computerworld Laureate , honoring OCW as the best IT education initiative of 2004 .
The impact of OCW is indeed global , with nearly 80 mirror sites of OCW installed on university campuses around the world .
MIT course materials have been translated into Chinese , Spanish , Portuguese and Thai .
And , more than 50 other universities and colleges have launched their own OCW projects , offering their own course materials free , via the Internet , to anyone , in various languages .
The growing list includes major universities and other learning centers in the United States , plus many more in China , Spain , Portugal , Japan , France and Vietnam .
One educator from Indonesia summed it up : " I was surprised that such a renowned university as MIT would freely give access to almost all of its educational information to the world , " said Triatno Harjoko , an architecture professor at the University of Indonesia in Depok .
" Critical thinking and creativity demand the liberalization of learning and information , " he said .
" But I also believe that it 's not simply the information that 's valuable , but also the glimpse it offers into how MIT has structured its teaching and research to become such a prestigious institution . "

Word first hit the wires yesterday that IBM had announced the long - awaited 970MP and 970FX processors at a forum in Japan .
For those who do n't follow the Apple scene obsessively , the 970MP is a dual - core G5 and the 970FX is a low - power G5 intended for use in portables .
The Japanese press release was linked at Xlr8yourmac.com , with the English press release following it in the Ars forums this morning .
Here are the basics on the two chips , ripped from M. Isobe 's Xlr8 yourmac post .
970 MP dual core
1.4-2.5GHz
each core has 1MB L2 cache ( 2MB total )
one core can be switched off for low power operation Low Power 970FX 13W @ 1.4 GHz , 16W @ 1.6GHz ( Typical )
The announcement raises a number of questions about timing , like , when will these parts be available ?
how long has IBM been sitting on them ?
if they 're to be available soon then why did Apple switch ?
why the sudden leap in performance per Watt on the same process after a year with so little improvement ?
I hope to be able to address these questions in a subsequent post , but for now my only comment is that the announcement seems to have caused a minor flare - up of the old platform wars in the MA .
Enjoy it while it lasts , folks .
I 'm sort of sad to see it all go .
For what it 's worth , I have reason to believe that the 970FX announcement could 've been made sooner than today , and that IBM has been sitting on it for at least a month .
As I said in my previous coverage of the Apple - Intel transition , Apple 's jumping ship was less about IBM 's roadmap and more about Intel 's volume discounts , especially on non-PC chips like the XScale .
But maybe I 'll be able to write more on that later .

When she was pictured snorting cocaine and her career appeared to be over , Kate Moss did what was demanded of her and finally ended her relationship with her junkie rocker lover Pete Doherty .
But now , as more modelling work than ever piles in for her , Miss Moss is officially back with the Babyshambles frontman .
The pair were pictured out together for the first time in months after openly kissing and touching each other during a recording of a music television show .
And a flashy bauble on her wedding finger led to speculation that the pair may have even got engaged , with rumours that Jade Jagger is throwing a party for them in Ibiza this week .
Their renewed relationship has devastated Miss Moss 's mother , said sources last night , as she believes the troubled rocker is nothing but bad news for her model daughter who has a two - year - old daughter from a previous relationship
' When Kate said she was going to give the relationship with Pete a proper try , she and her mum Linda had a furious row , ' said one .
' Linda thinks
Pete has only been a disaster for Kate she tried to tell her not to be so stupid .
' But Kate 's response was that she loves Pete and knows she can't be happy without him . '
Miss Moss , 32 , first got together with heroin addict Doherty , 27 , at her 31st birthday party in January last year .
Just a few months later the supermodel was pictured snorting cocaine while in a recording studio with him and a group of other friends .
As her fashion contracts began dropping off , Miss Moss was forced to take drastic action .
She announced she was going into rehab and when Doherty walked out of a rehab clinic that she was paying for , she publicly dropped him .
But while she has dated other men since then , friends yesterday said that her heart had always been with Doherty .
' Even when she was supposed to be with the comedian Russell Brand she was still secretly seeing Pete , ' said one .
' She may be off the cocaine but Pete is like a drug for her - he 's an addiction that she can't cure herself of . '
However it is only now that she feels confident enough to make public their relationship .
Career wise she has gone from strength to strength - and she has so many modelling deals that it is estimated she is earning three times as much as she was before the cocaine scandal .
While Doherty is at least trying to make attempts to clean himself up after being warned he faced jail if he did not come off the drugs .
Last week he had new implants which make him vomit when he has taken heroin and he has talked of his hopes to get clean .
Not surprisingly , Miss Moss 's aides are desperate to play down news of the pair 's reconciliation .
One said yesterday : ' They are seeing each other as friends as she has promised to do as part of supporting him and helping him try to beat drugs .
There is nothing more than that going on . '
And their fears are hardly unwarranted :
eyewitnesses at the Friday night recording of new Channel 4 music show Transmission said he was behaving erratically and at one point threw up in the ladies bathroom .
Pictured after the recording on Friday night , the pair went on to party at Miss Moss 's heiress friend Davinia Taylor 's house in North West London .
After spending the night there , they left her house together on Saturday afternoon .
Orthogonality and the DRY Principle
A Conversation with Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas , Part II
by Bill Venners
March 10 , 2003

Summary
Pragmatic Programmers Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas talk with Bill Venners about maintenance programming , the DRY principle , code generators and orthogonal systems , and a story about one highly coupled control system : the helicopter .
Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas are the Pragmatic Programmers , recognized internationally as experts in the development of high - quality software .
Their best - selling book of software best practices , The Pragmatic Programmer : From Journeyman to Master ( Addison - Wesley , 1999 ) , is filled with practical advice on a wide range of software development issues .
They also authored Programming Ruby : A Pragmatic Programmer 's Guide ( Addison - Wesley , 2000 ) , and helped to write the now famous Agile Manifesto .
In this interview , which is being published in ten weekly installments , Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas discuss many aspects of software development :
In Part I. Do n't Live with Broken Windows , they discuss the importance of software craftsmanship and the importance of staying on top of the small problems in your projects .
In this installment , they discuss the importance of keeping your system orthogonal , and the real meaning the DRY , or Do n't Repeat Yourself , principle .
All Programming is Maintenance Programming
: You say in your book , The Pragmatic Programmer ( Addison - Wesley , 1999 ) , that " programmers are constantly in maintenance mode . "
Why ?
Dave Thomas :
All programming is maintenance programming , because you are rarely writing original code .
If you look at the actual time you spend programming , you write a bit here and then you go back and make a change .
Or you go back and fix a bug .
Or you rip it out altogether and replace it with something else .
But you are very quickly maintaining code even if it's a brand new project with a fresh source file .
You spend most of your time in maintenance mode .
So you may as well just bite the bullet and say , " I 'm maintaining from day one . "
The disciplines that apply to maintenance should apply globally .
Andy Hunt :
It 's only the first 10 minutes that the code 's original , when you type it in the first time .
That 's it .
The DRY Principle
Bill Venners :
What 's the DRY principle ?
Dave Thomas : Do n't Repeat Yourself ( or DRY ) is probably one of the most misunderstood parts of the book .
Bill Venners :
How is DRY misunderstood and what is the correct way to understand it ?
Dave Thomas :
Most people take DRY to mean you should n't duplicate code .
That 's not its intention .
The idea behind DRY is far grander than that .
DRY says that every piece of system knowledge should have one authoritative , unambiguous representation .
Every piece of knowledge in the development of something should have a single representation .
A system 's knowledge is far broader than just its code .
It refers to database schemas , test plans , the build system , even documentation .
Given all this knowledge , why should you find one way to represent each feature ?
The obvious answer is , if you have more than one way to express the same thing , at some point the two or three different representations will most likely fall out of step with each other .
Even if they do n't , you 're guaranteeing yourself the headache of maintaining them in parallel whenever a change occurs .
And change will occur .
DRY is important if you want flexible and maintainable software .
The problem is : how do you represent all these different pieces of knowledge only once ?
If it 's just code , then you can obviously organize your code so you do n't repeat things , with the help of methods and subroutines .
But how do you handle things like database schemas ?
This is where you get into other techniques in the book , like using code generation tools , automatic build systems , and scripting languages .
These let you have single , authoritative representations that then generate non-authoritative work products , like code or DDLs ( data description languages ) .
Building Code Generators
Bill Venners :
If you build a code generator to avoid duplication , you must invest the time to build and maintain the code generator .
You have to explain the code generator to other team members .
Therefore , creating a code generator has costs as well as benefits .
How do you decide when the return on investment is great enough to actually justify building one ?
Dave Thomas :
You never build a code generator just because you feel like it .
You build one because you are motivated by some underlying principle , like avoiding duplication .
Or , sometimes you might want to encapsulate the knowledge of an expert and make it available to other people .
For example , you can tell a Microsoft IDE that you want a new MFC ( Microsoft Foundation Classes ) application , and it will generate 2000 lines of code for you .
Most people who use it , to their shame , do n't understand that code .
Some expert at Microsoft said this is the way it should be , and the whole world followed suit .
Do n't use code generators because you fancy doing it .
Use them because there 's a business benefit to doing so .
That 's true for all the tools we recommend using .
Do n't use them just because they 're there .
Use them because they fit into the overall philosophy of how you want to develop .
Andy Hunt : Creating a code generator is an investment .
You 're banking that it will be cheaper in the long run to build the code generator , because as changes come up you can simply tweak the input to the code generator and regenerate the byproducts .
Without a code generator , you will have to manually make changes by hand each time to all the byproducts .
If you expect a lot of volatility , a code generator can be a good investment .
Dave Thomas :
In fact , I 'd go further .
Typically , if I build a code generator , chances are good I will generate the products manually first .
And only when I come back to it will I say , " I 'm now in a situation where I need to automate this . "
That approach has two benefits .
First , I might never come back , in which case I do n't have to write the code generator .
If I do come back , I 've already validated the code generator 's output .
So I do n't just march off into the unknown , I actually aim at a definite target .
Bill Venners : I once had a manager who discouraged me from making a code generator tool by using the argument , " But then we 'll have to maintain the tool . "
I later decided he was right in that case , because it was better for the company that I just write the code by hand .
In a different case , though , I created a code generation tool that paid for itself .
We had a database whose schema changed from release to release .
My code generator read in an SQL database schema , that we had to create anyway to change the database , and generated the layer , a C module , between the database and the code .
Every time we changed the database , boom , we just regenerated the layer .
It saved time and bugs , because once we got the bugs out of the code generator , the C code it generated never contained any bugs .
Dave Thomas :
There 's also a subtle effect that comes about when you create a code generator .
If you remove the friction for change , you 'll find yourself making changes you need to make more often .
That 's a good thing .
Andy Hunt :
You 're not resisting the process .
Dave Thomas : Right .
Maybe a schema change is not a great example , because you do n't make gratuitous schema changes .
But if you have a code generator that makes something painless , then you 're more likely to use it .
That means you 're more likely to keep things tidy and clean .
And you 'll extend the life of your software .
It 's a good habit to follow .
Andy Hunt :
This relates to working with metadata , an idea presented later in the book .
The idea is to work closer to the level of what you want to express .
In the case of schema change , you 'll go into an SQL file and make a schema change .
You do n't have to change member variables and data fields just because the schema changed , the code generator does that for you .
When you need to make a schema change , you make it and hit the button .
Metadata keeps the act you must perform commensurate with the change itself .
You want to avoid , at all costs , a little change that requires a bunch of other tasks .
That kind of magnification kills many projects .
The simple code generator or equivalent metadata technique keeps the actions commensurate .
Dave Thomas :
This extends to the idea of orthogonality .
If you have a truly orthogonal system , unrelated elements are expressed independently .
Here you have a business - level change : one thing changes at the business level and one thing changes in the system .
If the boss says , I want negative numbers red , you change one thing and suddenly all the negative numbers in the system are red .
Andy Hunt :
That sounds a lot like DRY :
One piece of knowledge in the domain changes , one piece of the system changes .
Dave Thomas :
That almost happened to me about a month ago .
I was working with a large web application that dealt with registrations in an online membership system .
The numbers started out small , a couple hundred here and there .
As it grew to tens of thousands , the client found the numbers difficult to read , so they requested commas in all the numbers .
Luckily , I only had one change to make , and every number the system outputted then had commas in it .
That 's an important thing to think about .
Code generators let you do that , because they let you have one expression of something .
Be Orthogonal
Bill Venners :
What does orthogonality mean and why is it good ?
Andy Hunt :
The basic idea of orthogonality is that things that are not related conceptually should not be related in the system .
Parts of the architecture that really have nothing to do with the other , such as the database and the UI , should not need to be changed together .
A change to one should not cause a change to the other .
Unfortunately , we 've seen systems throughout our careers where that 's not the case .
Dave Thomas :
For example , when one client changed the number of lines on the screen , they had to change the database schema too .
Andy Hunt :
This is what computer scientists call coupling , one thing is tied — or coupled — to another .
There are exceptions and tradeoffs , but in most cases you want to minimize coupling between things that are otherwise unrelated .
It is easy in an OO system to accidentally introduce coupling .
You can do it just by the way you set up libraries , if you 're working in a language like C or C++ , where you link things together .
If you want to make a little program to test out one API or interface and you have to link in every library in the system , you have too much coupling .
Your system is not orthogonal .
Orthogonality is one of those creeping viral problems .
If you introduce some new functionality and you realize you 've coupled it to something unnecessarily , you might say , " These two things should n't really know about each other , but it 's OK .
It 's just these two things . "
But the next functionality you add might also know about something it should n't .
Soon you have four things that know about each other that should n't .
The problem grows somewhat unexpectedly .
You get a system that quickly becomes a nightmare .
One way we illustrate a highly coupled system in the book is the helicopter story .
Bill Venners : I thought the helicopter story was a great illustration .
Why do n't you tell it ?
Dave Thomas :
A helicopter has four main controls : foot pedals , collective pitch lever , cyclic , and throttle .
The foot pedals control the tail rotor .
With the foot pedals you can counteract the torque of the main blade and , basically , point the nose where you want the helicopter to go .
The collective pitch lever , which you hold in your left hand , controls the pitch on the rotor blades .
This lets you control the amount of lift the blades generate .
The cyclic , which you hold in your right hand , can tip one section of the blade .
Move the cyclic , and the helicopter moves in the corresponding direction .
The throttle sits at the end of the pitch lever .
It sounds fairly simple .
You can use the pedals to point the helicopter where you want it to go .
You can use the collective to move up and down .
Unfortunately , though , because of the aerodynamics and gyroscopic effects of the blades , all these controls are related .
So one small change , such as lowering the collective , causes the helicopter to dip and turn to one side .
You have to counteract every change you make with corresponding opposing forces on the other controls .
However , by doing that , you introduce more changes to the original control .
So you 're constantly dancing on all the controls to keep the helicopter stable .
That 's kind of similar to code .
We 've all worked on systems where you make one small change over here , and another problem pops out over there .
So you go over there and fix it , but two more problems pop out somewhere else .
You constantly push them back — like that Whack - a - Mole game — and you just never finish .
If the system is not orthogonal , if the pieces interact with each other more than necessary , then you 'll always get that kind of distributed bug fixing .
The funny thing about the helicopter story is that I 'm not a helicopter pilot .
When I wrote the helicopter story , I wanted to make sure it was accurate .
I knew of a USENET group on helicopters , so I posted the helicopter story saying , " This is what I 'm intending to write about how helicopter controls work .
Is it correct ?
A helicopter pilot emailed me and said , " I read what you wrote about controlling helicopters .
I did n't sleep all night . "

While most of us thought the country was trying to curb smoking , and the rapacious habits of the tobacco companies , it turns out the industry has been sneakily making cigarettes more addictive .
Evidence of what looks like an increasingly desperate effort to hook new young smokers and prevent older ones from quitting has been uncovered by a Massachusetts law that forces tobacco companies to report test results showing how much nicotine is inhaled by typical smokers of their various brands .
This week , the Massachusetts Department of Public Health revealed that from 1998 through 2004 , as public health campaigns were mounted to curb smoking , the manufacturers increased the amount of addictive nicotine delivered to the average smoker by 10 percent .
Of 179 cigarette brands tested in 2004 , an astonishing 166 brands fell into the state ’s highest nicotine yield range , including 59 brands that the manufacturers had labeled “ light ” and 14 described as “ ultra - light . ”
The three most popular brands chosen by young smokers  Marlboro , Newport and Camel  all delivered significantly more nicotine as the years passed .
Virtually all brands were found to deliver a high enough nicotine dose to cause heavy dependence .
This trend has escaped notice because the standard government test uses a smoking machine that fails to mimic real - life smoking .
A manufacturer , for example , can design a cigarette that will score low in nicotine delivery to the machine by placing tiny ventilation holes in the filter to dilute the smoke .
But in real life a smoker will often cover the vents with lips or fingers , thereby inhaling a higher dose of nicotine .
When Massachusetts required the manufacturers to use what it considered a more realistic method , the nicotine yields were more than twice those found on the standard test .
The Massachusetts approach may not be perfect , but it is surely a lot more accurate than the traditional test , which virtually all independent experts consider deficient .
I can not believe how popular my blog is getting – and how quickly .
A few months back it had less than 2.000 visitors a month .
And now ?
Just look at this :
The numbers boggle my mind .
110.000 people read the blog .
In august alone .
Wow .
And Yay !
How did it happen ?
Well , the main reason is simple : reddit .
One night back in may I could n’t sleep .
It was the night before my birthday and I must have been too excited about my presents to sleep , so I got up to surf the net instead .
On a whim i submitted a post I ’d written a while back on the top 10 mistakes managers of geeks make to reddit .
For those who do n’t know reddit , it ’s a social bookmarking site .
If you find a good article , blogpost , joke , video , whatever on the net you can submit it to reddit and other users can see it on the “ New ” page .
People who like it vote it up , people who do n’t vote it down .
If it gets enough up - votes it appears on the front page and a lot of people will read it .
I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I submitted that link .
The post quickly made the front page of reddit and somebody submitted it to digg where it also made the frontpage .
After which the blog promptly died :o ) I wrote about the experience here .
Since then several of my posts have made it to the front page – five six posts in august alone .
From there they sometimes make it onto digg and to del.icio.us but it always starts on reddit .
You can see my most popular posts on reddit here .
If you have written something you ’re proud of and want to share , I highly recommend submitting it to reddit as a way to spread the message .
There ’s no guarantee that it will get much attention , many of my posts get almost no votes and quickly disappear off the site , but give it a shot .
The reddit community appreciates new , surprising , thought - provoking , inspiring ideas .
That ’s in addition to IT - related articles and sneezing pandas :o )
The best things about this surge in readership have been :
Infecting people with the idea of happiness at work – Here ’s an example that made me very proud .

The only bad thing I can come up with about all of this is the occasional bout of reddit - withdrawal :
The feeling you get when you ’ve just had three posts in a row on the front page and now none of your posts make it there :o )
You crave the high that comes from knowing that 20.000 people read your latest post .
So a great big thank you from me to everyone who reads this blog and to reddit for bringing them here .
Thank you !
If you want to try using reddit to bring attention to your site , here are a few tips :
Read reddit for a while ( both the front page and the new page ) to get a sense of what the community tends to vote up or down .
Contribute actively by reading submissions and voting and commenting on them .
Read the reddiquette for the dos and donts of reddit .
Try submitting links from other sites to see how they do and to practise writing good titles .
Then submit some of your own links .
According to the reddiquette , it ’s perfectly OK to promote your own stuff on reddit so do n’t be shy .
Remember that even if a link disappears off the new page in minutes , that does n’t mean it ’s a bad entry .
Whether or not a submission gets noticed is equally a matter of timing and luck and many perfectly fine submissions sink without a trace .
Have fun and be a part of the community .

LONDON , Aug. 27 — On Aug. 9 , in a small second - floor apartment in East London , two young Muslim men recorded a video justifying what the police say was their suicide plot to blow up trans -Atlantic planes : revenge against the United States and its “ accomplices , ” Britain and the Jews .
“ As you bomb , you will be bombed ; as you kill , you will be killed , ” said one of the men on a “ martyrdom ” videotape , whose contents were described by a senior British official and a person briefed about the case .
The young man added that he hoped God would be “ pleased with us and accepts our deed . ”
As it happened , the police had been monitoring the apartment with hidden video and audio equipment .
Not long after the tape was recorded that day , Scotland Yard decided to shut down what they suspected was a terrorist cell .
That action set off a chain of events that raised the terror threat levels in Britain and the United States , barred passengers from taking liquids on airplanes and plunged air traffic into chaos around the world .
The ominous language of seven recovered martyrdom videotapes is among new details that emerged from interviews with high - ranking British , European and American officials last week , demonstrating that the suspects had made considerable progress toward planning a terrorist attack .
Those details include fresh evidence from Britain ’s most wide - ranging terror investigation : receipts for cash transfers from abroad , a handwritten diary that appears to sketch out elements of a plot , and , on martyrdom tapes , several suspects ’ statements of their motives .
But at the same time , five senior British officials said , the suspects were not prepared to strike immediately .
Instead , the reactions of Britain and the United States in the wake of the arrests of 21 people on Aug. 10 were driven less by information about a specific , imminent attack than fear that other , unknown terrorists might strike .
The suspects had been working for months out of an apartment that investigators called the “ bomb factory , ” where the police watched as the suspects experimented with chemicals , according to British officials and others briefed on the evidence , all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity , citing British rules on confidentiality regarding criminal prosecutions .
In searches during raids , the police discovered what they said were the necessary components to make a highly volatile liquid explosive known as HMTD , jihadist materials , receipts of Western Union money transfers , seven martyrdom videos made by six suspects and the last will and testament of a would - be bomber , senior British officials said .
One of the suspects said on his martyrdom video that the “ war against Muslims ” in Iraq and Afghanistan had motivated him to act .
Investigators say they believe that one of the leaders of the group , an unemployed man in his 20’s who was living in a modest apartment on government benefits , kept the key to the alleged “ bomb factory ” and helped others record martyrdom videos , the officials said .
Hours after the police arrested the 21 suspects , police and government officials in both countries said they had intended to carry out the deadliest terrorist attack since Sept. 11 .
Later that day , Paul Stephenson , deputy chief of the Metropolitan Police in London , said the goal of the people suspected of plotting the attack was “ mass murder on an unimaginable scale . ”
On the day of the arrests , some officials estimated that as many as 10 planes were to be blown up , possibly over American cities .
Michael Chertoff , the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , described the suspected plot as “ getting really quite close to the execution stage . ”
But British officials said the suspects still had a lot of work to do .
Two of the suspects did not have passports , but had applied for expedited approval .
One official said the people suspected of leading the plot were still recruiting and radicalizing would - be bombers .
While investigators found evidence on a computer memory stick indicating that one of the men had looked up airline schedules for flights from London to cities in the United States , the suspects had neither made reservations nor purchased plane tickets , a British official said .
Some of their suspected bomb - making equipment was found five days after the arrests in a suitcase buried under leaves in the woods near High Wycombe , a town 30 miles northwest of London .
Another British official stressed that martyrdom videos were often made well in advance of an attack .
In fact , two and a half weeks since the inquiry became public , British investigators have still not determined whether there was a target date for the attacks or how many planes were to be involved .
They say the estimate of 10 planes was speculative and exaggerated .
In his first public statement after the arrests , Peter Clarke , chief of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police , acknowledged that the police were still investigating the basics : “ the number , destination and timing of the flights that might be attacked . ”
A total of 25 people have been arrested in connection with the suspected plot .
Twelve of them have been charged .
Eight people were charged with conspiracy to commit murder and preparing acts of terrorism .
Three people were charged with failing to disclose information that could help prevent a terrorist act , and a 17 - year - old male suspect was charged with possession of articles that could be used to prepare a terrorist act .
Eight people still in custody have not been charged .
Five have been released .
All the suspects arrested are British citizens ranging in age from 17 to 35 .
Despite the charges , officials said they were still unsure of one critical question : whether any of the suspects was technically capable of assembling and detonating liquid explosives while airborne .
A chemist involved in that part of the inquiry , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was sworn to confidentiality , said HMTD , which can be prepared by combining hydrogen peroxide with other chemicals , “ in theory is dangerous , ” but whether the suspects “ had the brights to pull it off remains to be seen . ”
While officials and experts familiar with the case say the investigation points to a serious and determined group of plotters , they add that questions about the immediacy and difficulty of the suspected bombing plot cast doubt on the accuracy of some of the public statements made at the time .
“ In retrospect , ’’ said Michael A. Sheehan , the former deputy commissioner of counterterrorism in the New York Police Department , “ there may have been too much hyperventilating going on . ”
Some of the suspects came to the attention of Scotland Yard more than a year ago , shortly after four suicide bombers attacked three subway trains and a double - decker bus in London on July 7 , 2005 , a coordinated attack that killed 56 people and wounded more than 700 .
The investigation was dubbed “ Operation Overt . ’’
The Police Are Tipped Off
The police were apparently tipped off by informers .
One former British counterterrorism official , who was working for the government at the time , said several people living in Walthamstow , a working - class neighborhood in East London , alerted the police in July 2005 about the intentions of a small group of angry young Muslim men .
Walthamstow is best known for its faded greyhound track and the borough of Waltham Forest , where more than 17,000 Pakistani immigrants live in the largest Pakistani enclave in London .
Armed with the tips , MI5 , Britain ’s domestic security services , began an around - the - clock surveillance operation of a dozen young men living in Walthamstow — bugging their apartments , tapping their phones , monitoring their bank transactions , eavesdropping on their Internet traffic and e-mail messages , even watching where they traveled , shopped and took their laundry , according to senior British officials .
The initial focus of the investigation was not about possible terrorism aboard planes , but an effort to see whether there were any links between the dozen men and the July 7 subway bombers , or terrorist cells in Pakistan , the officials said .
The authorities quickly learned the identity of the man believed to have been the leader of the cell , the unemployed man in his mid-20 ’s , who traveled at least twice within the past year to Pakistan , where his activities are still being investigated .
Last June , a 22 - year - old Walthamstow resident , who is among the suspects arrested Aug. 10 , paid $ 260,000 cash for a second - floor apartment in a house on Forest Road , according to official property records .
The authorities noticed that six men were regularly visiting the second - floor apartment that came to be known as the “ bomb factory , ” according to a British official and the person briefed about the case .
Two of the men , who were likely the bomb - makers , were conducting a series of experiments with chemicals , said the person briefed on the case .
MI5 agents secretly installed video and audio recording equipment inside the apartment , two senior British officials said .
In a secret search conducted before the Aug. 10 raids , agents had discovered that the inside of batteries had been scooped out , and that it appeared several suspects were doing chemical experiments with a sports drink named Lucozade and syringes , the person with knowledge of the case said .
Investigators have said they believe that the suspects intended to bring explosive chemicals aboard planes inside sports drink bottles .
In that apartment , according to a British official , one of the leaders and a man in his late 20 ’s met at least twice to discuss the suspected plot , as MI5 agents secretly watched and listened .
On Aug. 9 , just hours before the police raids occurred in 50 locations from East London to Birmingham , the two men met again to discuss the suspected plot and record a martyrdom video .
As one of the men read from a script before a videocamera , he recited a quotation from the Koran and ticked off his reasons for the “ action that I am going to undertake , ” according to the person briefed on the case .
The man said he was seeking revenge for the foreign policy of the United States , and “ their accomplices , the U.K. and the Jews . ”
The man said he wanted to show that the enemies of Islam would never win this “ war . ”
Beseeching other Muslims to join jihad , he justified the killing of innocent civilians in America and other Western countries because they supported the war against Muslims through their tax dollars .
They were too busy enjoying their Western lifestyles to protest the policies , he added .
Though British officials usually release little information about continuing investigations , Scotland Yard took the unusual step of disclosing some detailed information about the investigation last Monday , when the suspects were charged .
A Trove of Evidence
“ There have been 69 searches , ” Mr. Clarke , the chief antiterrorist police official from Scotland Yard , said Monday .
“ These have been in houses , flats and business premises , vehicles and open spaces . ”
Investigators also seized more than 400 computers , 200 mobile phones and 8,000 items like memory sticks , CD ’s and DVD’s .
“ The scale is immense , ” Mr. Clarke said .
“ Inquiries will span the globe . ”
He said those searches revealed a trove of evidence , and officials and others last week provided additional details .
Four of the law firms that are defending suspects declined to comment .
When police officers knocked down the door to the second - floor apartment on Forest Road , they found a plastic bin filled with liquid , batteries , nearly a dozen empty drink bottles , rubber gloves , digital scales and a disposable camera that was leaking liquid , the person with knowledge of the case said .
The camera might have been a prototype for a device to smuggle chemicals on the plane .
In the pocket of one of the suspects , the police found the computer memory stick that showed he had looked up airline schedules for flights from London to the United States , a British official said .
The man is said to have had a diary that included a list that the police interpreted as a step - by - step plan for an attack .
The items included batteries and Lucozade bottles .
It also included a reminder to select a date .
In the homes of a number of the suspects , the police found jihadist literature and DVD ’s about “ genocide ” in Iraq and Palestine , according to British officials .
In one house searched by the police in Walthamstow , the authorities found a copy of a book called “ Defense of the Muslim Lands . ”
A “ last will and testament ” for one of the accused was said to have been found at his brother ’s home .
Dated Sept. 24 , 2005 , the will concludes , “ What should I worry when I die a Muslim , in the manner in which I am to die , I go to my death for the sake of my maker . ”
God , he added , can if he wants “ bless limbs torn away !!! ”
Looking for Global Ties
In addition , the British authorities are scouring the evidence for clues to whether there is a global dimension to the suspected plot , particularly the extent to which it was planned , financed or supported in Pakistan , and whether there is a connection to remnants of Al Qaeda .
They are still trying to determine who provided the cash for the apartment and the computer equipment and telephones , officials said .
Several of the suspects had traveled to Pakistan within weeks of the arrests , according to an American counterterrorism official .
At a minimum , investigators say at least one of the suspects ’ inspiration was drawn from Al Qaeda .
One of the suspects ’ “ kill - as - they - kill ” martyrdom video was taken from a November 2002 fatwa by Osama bin Laden .
British officials said many of the questions about the suspected plot remained unanswered because they were forced to make the arrests before Scotland Yard was ready .
The trigger was the arrest in Pakistan of Rashid Rauf , a 25 - year - old British citizen with dual Pakistani citizenship , whom Pakistani investigators have described as a “ key figure ” in the plot .
In 2000 , Mr. Rauf ’s father founded Crescent Relief London , a charity that sent money to victims of last October ’s earthquake in Pakistan .
Several suspects met through their involvement in the charity , a friend of one of them said .
Last week , Britain froze the charity ’s bank accounts and opened an investigation into possible “ terrorist abuse of charitable funds . ”
Leaders of the charity have denied the allegations .
Several senior British officials said the Pakistanis arrested Rashid Rauf without informing them first .
The arrest surprised and frustrated investigators here who had wanted to monitor the suspects longer , primarily to gather more evidence and to determine whether they had identified all the people involved in the suspected plot .
But within hours of Mr. Rauf ’s arrest on Aug. 9 in Pakistan , British officials heard from intelligence sources that someone connected to him had tried to contact some of the suspects in East London .
The message was interpreted by investigators as a possible signal to move forward with the plot , officials said .
“ The plotters received a very short message to ‘ Go now , ’ ” said Franco Frattini , the European Union ’s security commissioner , who was briefed by the British home secretary , John Reid , in London .
“ I was convinced by British authorities that this message exists . ”
A senior British official said the message from Pakistan was not that explicit .
But , nonetheless , investigators here had to change their strategy quickly .
“ The aim was to keep this operation going for much longer , ” said a senior British security official who requested anonymity because of confidentiality rules .
“ It ended much sooner than we had hoped . ”
From then on , the British government was driven by worst - case scenarios based on a minimum - risk strategy .
British investigators worried that word of Mr. Rauf ’s arrest could push the London suspects to destroy evidence and to disperse , raising the possibility they would not be able to arrest them all .
But investigators also could not rule out that there could be an unknown second cell that would try to carry out a similar plan , officials said .
Mr. Clarke , as the country ’s top antiterrorism police official in London with authority over police decisions , ordered the arrests .
But it was left to Mr. Reid , who has been home secretary since May and is a former defense secretary , to decide at emergency meetings of police , national security and transport leaders , what else needed to be done .
Mr. Reid and Mr. Clarke declined repeated requests for interviews .
Prime Minister Tony Blair was on vacation in Barbados , where he was said to have monitored events in London ; Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott did not attend the meeting .
“ While the arrests were unfolding , the Home Office raised Britain ’s terror alert level to “ critical , ” as the police continued their raids of suspects ’ homes and cars .
All liquids were banned from carry - on bags , and some public officials in Britain and the United States said an attack appeared to be imminent .
In addition to Mr. Stephenson ’s remark that the attack would have been “ mass murder on an unimaginable scale , ” Mr. Reid said that attacks were “ highly likely ” and predicted that the loss of life would have been on an “ unprecedented scale . ”
Two weeks later , senior officials here characterized the remarks as unfortunate .
As more information was analyzed and the British government decided that the attack was not imminent , Mr. Reid sought to calm the country by backing off from his dire predictions , while defending the decision to raise the alert level to its highest level as a precaution .
In lowering the threat level from critical to severe on Aug. 14 , Mr. Reid acknowledged : “ Threat level assessments are intelligence - led .
It is not a process where scientific precision is possible .
They involve judgments . ”
This is an edited version of a post to python - list .
And , if they are willing to go offsite [ to find Python programmers ] , why not go to India and save lots of bucks ?
In general , Python requires you trust your programmers .
People give Java grief about its restricted environment and static typing , but if you do n't trust the programmer to do a good job , at least with Java they ( maybe ) can't mess things up as badly for everyone else working on a project .
You can mess things up royally with Python .
I like working with a language that respects my intelligence -- no final classes , no type restrictions , no ( truly ) private methods -- but that 's not without its costs .
In general , Python rewards highly - skilled programmers with a considerably increased productivity , moreso than in low - level languages .
We talk about how Python is also easy to learn and maintain , and that 's still true , but it does n't mean that it evens out the differences in productivity between programmers .
In fact , quite the opposite , it makes those most productive programmers more productive and more valuable .
That Python is easy to learn and maintain means that there 's less risk in using a highly skilled , highly productive programmer .
In other languages you risk being left with a program that only another highly skilled programmer can maintain , and that 's less likely to occur with Python ( for an appropriate definition of " highly skilled " ) .
Also , Python encourages agile methodologies , even if you are n't explicitly trying to use agile methodologies .
They just work well .
Agile methodologies also work well when you can have a more intimate relationship between developer and project manager or customer .
Hiring in India or elsewhere makes that intimate relationship harder to create .
Finally , to be frank , Python is not the language for companies who expect mediocrity in their programmers , and I think that outsourcing is for companies that expect mediocrity .
I do n't mean to insult Indian programmers -- certainly there are Indian programmers who are just as good as a good programmer in the U.S. : able to communicate well , able to work independently , able to intelligently judge tradeoffs , etc .
But those are n't the cheap Indian programmers .
This is n't about nation of origin .
Outsourcing is about turning programmers into a commodity , and you can only make a commodity out of something where quality is n't an issue .
In the case of programming , that means you must expect the lowest common denominator of quality given the constraints .
Because shitty code is always shitty ( even in Java ) the constraints for outsourcing typically include heavy - weight methodologies and a high degree of formality .
I think it 's stupid to look at programming as a commodity , but it 's way more stupid with Python .
I do n't think outsourcing will hurt the Python community .
The corollary : if you do n't want to be outsourced , focus on methodologies and tools that respect you as a programmer , that respect your intelligence , judgement , and motivations .
If you do , you put a bit more power in your hands , away from institutions .
You do n't want to be a sharecropper and you do n't want to be a commodity .
While Monopoly is the paragon of good ' ole fashioned board game fun , the " old fashioned " part had to go .
Parker Brothers is phasing out the cash - based version 's funmoney and replacing it with an " Electronic Banking " flavor that could leave Mr. Moneybags turning his pockets inside out as his stash is replaced by a magnetic strip .
New kits are completely devoid of the famous multi-colored bills ; instead , you 'll find phoney Visa debit cards and a calculator / reader which keeps a running tabulation of your riches -- or lack thereof .
A deal was struck with Visa to design the mock cards and readers , presumably after surveys showed that 70 % of adults used cash less often now than they did a decade ago ( no surprise there ) .
When asked about the dramatic change , Parker said replacing cash with plastic " showed the game was moving with the times . "
For those anxious to get their swipe on , or if you 've simply forgotten how to use bills , the new version will set you back £ 24.99 , while the now " antiquated " cash version can be had for £ 12.99 , but only while supplies last .

We have n’t been able to have hand carries since 1990 .
We also cannot have batteries in any of our equipment checked or otherwise .
At least we have been able to carry our laptops on and recently been able to actually use them ( with the batteries ) .
But , if things keep moving in this direction , and I ’m sure it will , we need to start thinking now about checking our cameras and computers and how to do it safely .
This is a very unpleasant idea .
Two years ago I ordered a Canon 20D and had it “ hand carried ” over to meet me in England by a friend .
My friend put it in their checked bag .
The bag never showed up .
She did not have insurance and all I got $ 100 from British Airways for the camera and $ 500 from American Express ( buyers protection ) that was it .
So now it looks as if we are going to have to check our cameras and our computers involuntarily .
OK here are a few thoughts .
Pretty basic stuff , and we all know about the risks of putting expensive stuff in your checked luggage .
The interesting part is one of the blog comments , about halfway down .
Another photographer wonders if the TSA rules for firearms could be extended to camera equipment :
Why not just have the TSA adopt the same check in rules for photographic and video equipment as they do for firearms ?
All firearms must be in checked baggage , no carry on .
All firearms must be transported in a locked , hard sided case using a non-TSA approved lock .
This is to prevent anyone from opening the case after its been screened .
After bringing the equipment to the airline counter and declaring and showing the contents to the airline representative , you take it over to the TSA screening area where it it checked by a screener , relocked in front of you , your key or keys returned to you ( if it ’s not a combination lock ) and put directly on the conveyor belt for loading onto the plane .
No markings , stickers or labels identifying what ’s inside are put on the outside of the case or , if packed inside something else , the bag .
Might this solve the problem ?
I ’ve never lost a firearm when flying .
Then someone has the brilliant suggestion of putting a firearm in your camera - equipment case :
A “ weapons ” is defined as a rifle , shotgun , pistol , airgun , and STARTER PISTOL .
Yes , starter pistols – those little guns that fire blanks at track and swim meets – are considered weapons … and do NOT have to be registered in any state in the United States .
I have a starter pistol for all my cases .
All I have to do upon check - in is tell the airline ticket agent that I have a weapon to declare …
I ’m given a little card to sign , the card is put in the case , the case is given to a TSA official who takes my key and locks the case , and gives my key back to me .
That ’s the procedure .
The case is extra - tracked … TSA does not want to lose a weapons case .
This reduces the chance of the case being lost to virtually zero .
It ’s a great way to travel with camera gear … I ’ve been doing this since Dec 2001 and have had no problems whatsoever .
I have to admit that I am impressed with this solution .

Doctors will this week declare war on America 's soft drinks industry by calling for a ' fat tax ' to combat the nation 's obesity epidemic .
Delegates at the powerful American Medical Association 's annual conference will demand a levy on the sweeteners put in sugary drinks to pay for a massive public health education campaign .
They will also call for the amount of salt added to burgers and processed foods to be halved .
The moves come as U.S. doctors - like their British counterparts - are becoming increasingly alarmed at the growing number of deaths linked to obesity .
The resolution will put doctors on a collision course with Coca - Cola and Pepsi , plus the likes of McDonald 's and Burger King .
Sales of soft drinks in U.S. schools are in decline ahead of the introduction of guidelines allowing only healthier low - calorie drinks , plus milk and certain fruit juices , over the next two years .
But the medical association wants to go further .
Delegates at its Chicago conference are gunning in particular for high fructose corn syrup , the sweetener which is added to everything from ketchup to cola .
One American politician labelled it the ' crack of sweeteners ' because it is so widespread .
Some U.S. cities and states already levy taxes on soft drinks or junk foods that raise £ 500 million a year , said Michael Jacobsen , director of the Centre for Science and the Public Interest , an independent health watchdog .
But earmarking tax revenue for programmes promoting better diet would be a first , he added .
American doctors are seeing the same alarming trends as those in Britain where obesity is considered to be a ' ticking timebomb of epidemic proportions ' .
More than 30,000 Britons die each year because of obesity .
In England , 47 per cent of men and 33 per cent of women are overweight , with around a fifth being obese .
The problem costs the Health Service £ 500 million in consultations , drugs and other therapies .
Life insurance companies are considering increased premiums for overweight clients because so many are dying prematurely from heart disease and cancer .
Cancer Research UK has warned that obesity will soon cause more cancers than smoking .
Just as alarming is the rapid growth in childhood obesity .
Among six - year - olds , one in ten is classed as obese , rising to one in five among 15 - year - olds .
The Government has warned that the current generation of schoolchildren could be the first to live shorter lives than their parents .
Well - informed scuttlebutt on Capitol Hill has it that Kansas Sen .
Pat Roberts may be looking for an exit from the Senate Intelligence Committee , which he has chaired since 2002 and which Democrat West Virginia Sen .
Jay Rockefeller will chair in the 110th Congress .
Those in the know say this editorial from the Lawrence Journal - World is worth a close read on Roberts ' intentions , especially the " he has told some " sentence .
With the soon - to - be- minority Senate GOP determining committee assignments for the next Congress right now , things could shake out as early as next week .
Roberts has drawn partisan barbs for years for his stewardship of the committee .
Critics say he did all he could to protect the Bush Administration from oversight ; Rockefeller once memorably accused him of taking " all his talking points from the White House . "
But Roberts points to his committee 's investigations - some completed , some ongoing - of the uses of pre-war intelligence as evidence of his commitment to effective oversight .
The Roberts move also means Missouri Sen .
Kit Bond could become the committee 's top Republican , depending on where and how various chips fall .
Stay tuned ...

Some customers are willing to have microchip implants as a means of paying in stores , a report out today says .
Teenagers are more open to the idea of having a high - tech shopping experience , the Tomorrow 's Shopping World report suggests .
Around 8 per cent of 13 to 19 - year - olds were open to the idea of microchip implants while 16 per cent wanted trolleys to be fitted with SatNav systems .
This compared to just 5 per cent and 12 per cent respectively for adults asked the same questions .
Two thirds of teenagers and 62 per cent of adults questioned for grocery think tank IGD 's report wanted self - scanning systems at shop check - outs .
Some 7 per cent of people in both age groups were willing to use biometric iris or retina recognition payment systems .
On a more low - tech note , 61 per cent of adults and 57 per cent of teenagers wanted staff to pack their bags in shops .
And a " cashless society " is not expected to have materialised within the next decade .
The report says 39 per cent of teenage respondents and 30 per cent of adults said they would still be using cash in 10 year 's time .
It adds : " The current and future progress of technology services in store is counter - balanced by the need for shopping with some form of ' human contact ' . "
One third of adults and 40 per cent of teenagers wanted lots of staff involvement with the shopping experience .
The report , sponsored by technology services company EDS , followed an IGD poll of 500 teenagers and a similar number of adults about their predicted grocery shopping habits for the next decade .
He 's everywhere these days and many nerds love him .
To me , he seems like manboy who has managed to ride his Segway Polo - playing well beyond his 15 minutes of fame .
He preoccupies himself with toys , is an awkward conversationalist ( see here ) and generally resembles a larger , mouth - breathing version of The 40 Year Old Virgin .
Seriously ... what 's the deal ?
1 in 4 Iraq vets ailing on return
By Gregg Zoroya , USA TODAY
Related : Troops screened as never before )
More than one in four U.S. troops have come home from the Iraq war with health problems that require medical or mental health treatment , according to the Pentagon 's first detailed screening of servicemembers leaving a war zone . (
Almost 1,700 servicemembers returning from the war this year said they harbored thoughts of hurting themselves or that they would be better off dead .
More than 250 said they had such thoughts " a lot . "
Nearly 20,000 reported nightmares or unwanted war recollections ; more than 3,700 said they had concerns that they might " hurt or lose control " with someone else .
These survey results , which have not been publicly released , were provided to USA TODAY by the Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine .
They offer a window on the war and how the ongoing insurgency has added to the strain on troops .
Overall , since the war began , about 28 % of Iraq veterans — about 50,000 servicemembers this year alone — returned with problems ranging from lingering battle wounds to toothaches , from suicidal thoughts to strained marriages .
The figure dwarfs the Pentagon 's official Iraq casualty count : 1,971 U.S. troops dead and 15,220 wounded as of Tuesday .
A greater percentage of soldiers and Marines surveyed in 2004 - 05 said they felt in " great danger " of being killed than said so in 2003 , after a more conventional phase of fighting .
Twice as many surveyed in 2004 - 05 had fired a weapon in combat .
IMPACT OF WAR
Of servicemembers returning from the Iraq war this year : 47 % saw someone wounded or killed , or saw a dead body .
14 % had an experience that left them easily startled .
6 % wanted help for stress , emotional , alcohol or family problems .
2 % had thoughts of hurting someone or losing control .
1 % had thoughts that they might be better off dead or could hurt themselves .

" The ( wartime ) deployments do take a toll , " says Lt. Col.
Ellen Krenke , a Pentagon spokeswoman .
" We send them to austere locations , places that are extremely hot , extremely cold , very wet , very dry ... where they may also encounter an armed enemy . "
The Pentagon 's goal is to identify all troops in need of care in part by screening every servicemember on a wide range of issues before and after overseas duty .
Begun in 1997 and expanded in 2003 , it is the most detailed health assessment of deployed troops ever .
It came in response to ailments that surfaced after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Jim Benson , a spokesman at the Department of Veterans Affairs , says comparable data from previous wars do n't exist .
In October 2004 , a federal panel of medical experts that studied illnesses of Gulf War veterans estimated that one in seven suffer war - related health problems .
Benson said the percentage of troops back from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with health issues is close to the portion of former servicemembers coming to the VA for mental health or medical care .
He says 101,000 of the 431,000 war vets who have separated from the military , or about 23 % , have sought help .

My logic goes like this :
First , we have planes today that can take off , fly and land without a pilot .
Pilots are there only in case something untoward happens .
Second , we already have remotely controlled aircraft , which we 've seen , for example , in the Afghanistan war .
Third , computers themselves , over the next 18 years -- if we stay on this Moore 's law kick -- will be about 4,000 times more powerful than they are today .
The next step in this logic is that with computers increasingly a part of critical infrastructure , the industry is going to have to focus a lot more on making machines that just do n't fail .
If we go at that hot and heavy for five or ten years , I imagine arriving at a methodology for system design that yields as much dependability , on an everyday basis , as the triple - redundant computer that flew guys to the moon .
Finally air traffic control will no longer be based on staticky communications with people staring at radar screens ; it 'll be completely computerized and recast .
What The Silicon Valley Startups In My Life Taught Me
At this very minute , there are lots of little startups dotting Silicon Valley and beyond , going about their frat style living except with less money , more caffeine and zero socials .
Average age : 24 .
That is the stereotypical picture of a startup that the public has grown to know and love .
However , startups do have many faces and are as diverse as the different communities that reside in the valley .
Let me share with you what I ’ve seen in my time :
Startup that hires interns to do all the dirty work
I worked as an intern at this place where the gurus and head honchos comprised the top half of the corporate hierarchy .
The bottom half of the corporate structure was made up of cheaply paid highly skilled interns from a top university in the college town they were headquartered at .
They recycled interns every semester to keep fresh wits and low salaries in that office .
One interesting point : the CEO ended up canoodling with one of the female interns in my batch and my intern “ friend ” is now Mrs. Fricken I Own This Place .
Average Age : 25
My Take : $ 2,000 / month and not a penny more ; and my name in some old tech manuals , now obsolete
Outcome :
Went public , did well at one point and was worth several hundred million in the NASDAQ .
Startup that meandered for 10 years but barely made it by the seat of its pants
Here ’s one that took 5 years to get venture capital .
That was because the founders worked on their idea part - time for that first 5 years before they got noticed .
Yes folks , you CAN end up working for a long time and not get any money nor recognition and you MAY possibly end up in oblivion despite all your hard work .
But if you ’re a true entrepreneur , you will keep working on the product and that exit strategy .
Eventually , someone bigger may come along and offer you a pittance but you ’ll take it , happy you got a bit of a consolation prize .
Average Age : 30
My Take : Standard contractor ’s wages of $ 75/ hour
Outcome : Acquisition price was not too exciting but acquiring company was ( it had a great reputation ) .
Startup that took hundreds of millions in venture capital and blew it all
This was a fun one .
I loved this startup where I spent the final years of the past century .
This was the classic dot - com story that truly represented the epitome of the internet bubble .
Money was no object then , for this company with a burgeoning engineering team of 100 strong and another 150 in corporate roles of unknown nature or significance .
In 2 years , we had a revolving door of CEOs ( 3 to be exact ) and a vision that remained muddied and unclear .
Yet , I had a great time , made great friends and continue to be awed by the brilliance of some of the PhDs they brought into the company to comprise the R & D team .
That was a time when patents = gold .
The more patents you churned out , the more respected and rewarded you became .
Today , many members from that elite engineering team are now real estate agents .
Average Age : 32
My Take : $ 90,000 annually to start ; $ 125,000 by the time I was laid off ; 100,000 stock options worth squat
Outcome :
There were 3 rounds of lay offs and I am proud to say I was kept till the very end ; the place eventually imploded
Startup that knows not what it is doing but is raking it in big time
Here ’s a private company where under the covers , nobody knows what ’s going on ; purchase orders are misplaced ; employees bicker and finger - point .
Yet …. their profit is sky - high .
This company does something very specialized so it makes gobs of money .
What gives ?
The answer : the company is small and they ’re in a niche space .
So you see , you do n’t have to know what you ’re doing to make it , you just have to be the only one doing it .
Average Age : 50
My Take :
Very good pay at $ 100 / hr especially after the dot - com bust , but hours were erratic
Outcome :
Will continue its chaotic path until the founders retire or as they themselves say : “ drop dead ” .
So what did these companies teach me ?
That talent , genius and hard work in the region where I work is common - place , and what separates a company from the rest of the pack is innovation , the demand in the space it finds itself in , timing , and loads of luck .

They have nothing to do with the Fourth of July , Alan Greenspan , economics , or financial markets , but they do demonstrate just how insignificant fireworks and money really are in the grand scheme of things .
There are similar cases to be made for time and space , a small book atop the Empire State building representing man 's time on earth serving well for the former , the latter being nearly impossible for any human to comprehend - too few individuals have a proper appreciation for any of this .

=======================================
UPDATE : Sept. 7 , 2006 - 9:15 PM
PST
As stated in the original post , these images came in the mail .
No source was cited by the sender .
Now that someone has indentified their origin , I 'm happy to provide the link at Rense , lest anyone remain under the mistaken impression that I photographed these myself .
When it comes to explaining the roots of intelligence , the fight between partisans of the gene and partisans of the environment is ancient and fierce .
Each side challenges the other ’s intellectual bona fides and political agendas .
What is at stake is not just the definition of good science but also the meaning of the just society .
The nurture crowd is predisposed to revive the War on Poverty , while the hereditarians typically embrace a Social Darwinist perspective .
A century ’s worth of quantitative - genetics literature concludes that a person ’s I.Q. is remarkably stable and that about three - quarters of I.Q. differences between individuals are attributable to heredity .
This is how I.Q. is widely understood — as being mainly “ in the genes ” — and that understanding has been used as a rationale for doing nothing about seemingly intractable social problems like the black - white school - achievement gap and the widening income disparity .
If nature disposes , the argument goes , there is little to be gained by intervening .
In their 1994 best seller , “ The Bell Curve , ” Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray relied on this research to argue that the United States is a genetic meritocracy and to urge an end to affirmative action .
Since there is no way to significantly boost I.Q. , prominent geneticists like Arthur Jensen of Berkeley have contended , compensatory education is a bad bet .
But what if the supposed opposition between heredity and environment is altogether misleading ?
A new generation of studies shows that genes and environment do n’t occupy separate spheres — that much of what is labeled “ hereditary ” becomes meaningful only in the context of experience .
“ It does n’t really matter whether the heritability of I.Q. is this particular figure or that one , ” says Sir Michael Rutter of the University of London .
“ Changing the environment can still make an enormous difference . ”
If heredity defines the limits of intelligence , the research shows , experience largely determines whether those limits will be reached .
And if this is so , the prospects for remedying social inequalities may be better than we thought .
When quantitative geneticists estimate the heritability of I.Q. , they are generally relying on studies of twins .
Identical twins are in effect clones who share all their genes ; fraternal twins are siblings born together — just half of their genes are identical .
If heredity explains most of the difference in intelligence , the logic goes , the I.Q. scores of identical twins will be far more similar than the I.Q. ’s of fraternal twins .
And this is what the research has typically shown .
Only when children have spent their earliest years in the most wretched of circumstances , as in the infamous case of the Romanian orphans , treated like animals during the misrule of Nicolae Ceausescu , has it been thought that the environment makes a notable difference .
Otherwise , genes rule .

A provision in the " PATRIOT Act " creates a new federal police force with the power to violate the Bill of Rights .
You might think that this cannot be true , as you have not read about it in newspapers or heard it discussed by talking heads on TV .
Go to House Report 109-333 USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and check it out for yourself .
Sec. 605 reads :
" There is hereby created and established a permanent police force , to be known as the ‘ United States Secret Service Uniformed Division . ’ "
This new federal police force is " subject to the supervision of the Secretary of Homeland Security . "
The new police are empowered to " make arrests without warrant for any offense against the United States committed in their presence , or for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States if they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such felony . "
The new police are assigned a variety of jurisdictions , including " an event designated under section 3056 ( e ) of title 18 as a special event of national significance " ( SENS ) .
" A special event of national significance " is neither defined nor does it require the presence of a " protected person " such as the president in order to trigger it .
Thus , the administration , and perhaps the police themselves , can place the SENS designation on any event .
Once a SENS designation is placed on an event , the new federal police are empowered to keep out and arrest people at their discretion .
The language conveys enormous discretionary and arbitrary powers .
What is " an offense against the United States " ?
What are " reasonable grounds " ?
You can bet the Alito / Roberts court will rule that it is whatever the executive branch says .
The obvious purpose of the act is to prevent demonstrations at Bush / Cheney events .
However , nothing in the language limits the police powers from being used only in this way .
Like every law in the U.S. , this law also will be expansively interpreted and abused .
It has dire implications for freedom of association and First Amendment rights .
We can take for granted that the new federal police will be used to suppress dissent and to break up opposition .
The Brownshirts are now arming themselves with a Gestapo .
Many naïve Americans will write to me to explain that this new provision in the reauthorization of the " PATRIOT Act " is necessary to protect the president and other high officials from terrorists or from harm at the hands of angry demonstrators : " No one else will have anything to fear . "
Some will accuse me of being an alarmist , and others will say that it is unpatriotic to doubt the law ’s good intentions .
Americans will write such nonsense despite the fact that the president and foreign dignitaries are already provided superb protection by the Secret Service .
The naïve will not comprehend that the president cannot be endangered by demonstrators at SENS at which the president is not present .
For many Americans , the light refuses to turn on .
In Nazi Germany , did no one but Jews have anything to fear from the Gestapo ?
By Stalin ’s time , Lenin and Trotsky had eliminated all members of the " oppressor class , " but that did not stop Stalin from sending millions of " enemies of the people " to the Gulag .
It is extremely difficult to hold even local police forces accountable .
Who is going to hold accountable a federal police protected by Homeland Security and the president ?
Magnatune is the non-evil record label who gives away 128 kbps mp3s of all their artist ’s songs for free .
You can then choose ( or not ) to purchase DRM - free higher quality versions at a price you set and they allow you to share their purchased songs with 3 friends .
The label splits revenues 50/50 with their ( carefully picked ) signed artists , while these artists keep all of the rights to their music with a non-exclusive contract .
Today , we are very happy to feature an interview with John Buckman , the founder and owner of Magnatune , to help us understand better their revolutionary business model .
1 .
This is the question that pops up on most people ’s minds : do you and your artists make enough money ?
You are giving away the ( good - enough for most people ) 128 kbps mp3 afterall .
John Buckman : 1 in 42 people who visit Magnatune buy .
That ’s among the best visitor - to - customer ratios I ’ve ever seen .
The 128k has a spoken credit on the mp3 , immediately pass the song .
You can legally remove the spoken credit ( the mp3 is Creative Commons license and allows a derivative use ) but why bother when you can buy the album for just $ 5 .
Besides , even when we did n’t have the spoken ending , we had a great purchaser ration , because I believe that people are willing to pay for music if they are buying something like like , which means a ) good music for them b ) no DRM , fair rights c ) a company they do n’t despise ( for a change ) and d ) supporting the artist
2 . Some audiophiles do n’t listen to enough free music because they believe that the quality of the tracks is not as well - crafted or produced as on major label ’s work is .
What do you reply to that ?
John Buckman :
That ’s why we only accept 2 % to 3 % of what we get submitted , because we want the best stuff , and we only release things that we think compete with major label sound quality , but in my experience the music and musicianship is at least as good , if not better , since we ’re willing to give artistic freedom and a do n’t committee - manage the release process like majors do .
3 . How is Magnatune decides if you are going to sign an artist or not ?
Is there a procedure ?
John Buckman :
You send the music in ( email to a URL , ftp or CD ) and if we like it , we sign you up ( and exchange of faxed , signed agreements ) .
What we sign is what blows our mind , what we would ourselves buy if we heard on the radio .
4 . What is your policy regarding playing the distributed 128 kbps mp3 versions of your music in coffee shops and bars ?
Do these public places need a license before they can play your artist ’s music for the 128 kbps versions too ?
John Buckman :
Those would be commercial spaces and thus not under the Creative Commons license we use .
They ’d either have to pay ASCAP / BMI ( evil ) or get a very low cost public space license from us .
5 . Let ’s say that a kid buys one of your albums and shares it with 3 friends at school ( as it ’s allowed by your terms and conditions ) .
Can that kid also share that album with his immediate family members ( e.g. siblings , parents ) , or the 3 - friend rule includes the family members ?
John Buckman :
Hey , no - one ’s counting , if you want to share it with 5 people , fine , great , you introduced more people to Magnatune .
The point is not to put the files up on your web site as a torrent for the world to take .
6 . Are there any plans to offer statistics on individual songs , or maybe even just sell individual songs instead of full albums ?
John Buckman :
For now , we just sell albums because $ 1 songs are hard to sell on a visa card , given the $ 0.50 fee per charge we have to pay .
We personally like albums , so that ’s what we sell , and since you can pay as little as $ 5 or get a compilation , there are ways to get the music if you like it .
7 . Do you have any plans to offer to your artists more than just a way to sell music or merchadise ?
For example , if you recognize that a certain artist is a rare but raw talent , would you try to find him a good producer ?
John Buckman :
Yes , we ’ve done that before , for example pairing producer Victor Stone ( who wrote and manages CC Mixter , BTW ) up with C. Layne .
C. Layne ’s first album was brilliant songwriting , but poor audio quality , his 2nd sounds amazing .
We also did this with Lisa DeBenedictis , who now has the tech chops to produce herself at a much higher level .
She also knows all about CC now and is one of the top remixed artists on CC Mixter , and she participates avidly in it , as well as speaking at Creative Commons panels .
8 . Do you think that the major labels will eventually “ see the light ” and release at least 64 kbps mp3s of their artist ’s albums for free , or do you think that they are in such legal and contract maggling trouble that such idea would never fly for them ?
John Buckman : I doubt they ’ll ever release control .
If they release free music , it ’ll be DRMed .
They ’ll DRM til they destroy their market share and other labels become the new majors .
9 . What is your opinion on RIAA sueing music sharers ?
Are they justified to do so or over the top ?
John Buckman : I love it , there ’s no better way to create an audience for Magnatune than to have the majors destroy any good feelings in their audience and to be so thoroughly disgusted with the majors that people will do anything not to give them any money .
It ’s gotten so bad the major labels can’t even buy a Senator , they ’re that despised .
10 .
Have any of your artists gone on to sign with other labels ?
Would you discourage that or do you think it is like ‘ graduating ’ from your label into something more mainstream ?
John Buckman : A few have , but mostly we pay so much more than indie labels do ( which is typically zero ) a musician getting $ 4000 a year from us is very unlikely to do any better with an exclusive deal , except off an advance from a major indie or major label .
And frankly , Magnatune is radical enough that people who want to sign up with it want nothing to do with the traditional evil music business .
11 . It ’s obvious that your website does a good job at distributing music to people who visit , but what types of services do you offer to help promote artists ( outside of your website ) ?
John Buckman : Check this out .
12 . There are sites out there , like this , that feature free download links of independent artists on a daily basis .
Do you have any sort of affiliation program that might exchange revenue for mindhare in the blogosphere ?
John Buckman : I ’m not really into affiliate networks , I find that people who are paid to recommend music do n’t really do an honest job .
I much prefer bloggers and podcasters , and we have very generous podcasting terms ( allowing , for example , commercial but poor podcasters to play our music , in addition to all the noncommercial use )
13 . Finally , the 1 million dollar question : why no WMA ?
In Italy , red lights come in many varieties .
A rare few actually mean stop .
Others , to the Italian driver , suggest different interpretations .
At a pedestrian crossing at 7 a.m. , with no pedestrians around , it is a “ negotiable red , ” more like a weak orange .
At a traffic intersection , red could mean what the Florentines call rosso pieno , or full red , but it might , with no cars coming , be more of a suggestion than a command .
It all depends .
The red - light mentality , as the journalist Beppe Severgnini sees it , explains volumes about Italy and the Italians .
“ We think it ’s an insult to our intelligence to comply with a regulation , ” he writes in “ La Bella Figura , ” his witty , insightful tour of the Italian mind .
“ Obedience is boring .
We want to think about it .
We want to decide whether a particular law applies to our specific case .
In that place , at that time . ”
This principle applies to traffic regulations , taxes , solemn laws and personal behavior .
Everything is personal and open to discussion .
As a result , Italy totters along in a state of amiable chaos , its situation desperate but not serious , which is more or less the way Italians like it , those in charge and those , in principle , being led .
“ Controllers and controlled have an unspoken agreement , ” Mr. Severgnini writes .
“ You do n’t change , we do n’t change , and Italy does n’t change , but we all complain that we ca n’t go on like this . ”
Mr. Severgnini , a columnist for the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera , turned a fond eye on the United States in his last book , “ Ciao , America ! , ” but this time around , on his home turf , he bites harder and deeper .
The paradoxes of Italian life engage him .
They bring out the reflective wit that , he argues , is native to most Italians and may be their most potent weapon in the struggle with bureaucracy and social dysfunction .
Intertwined with native wit is a strong sense of self - esteem enjoyed by even the humblest Italian , as well as a fatal weakness for beauty and surface appeal , “ la bella figura . ”
By Neil Boorman
I am addicted to brands .
For as long as I can remember , they have occupied my thoughts during the waking day .
What they look like , what they do , what they mean .
The majority of my modest income has been spent on them and I 've gone to great lengths to acquire and be around them .
I am a music promoter and style magazine editor by trade .
In the first case that means putting on events that are often sponsored by brands .
In the second it means understanding , keeping up with and talking about brands .
Constantly .
As a young teenager , all I ever wanted to do was to work with my favourite brands - Adidas , Technics , Budweiser , Sony - the names that were plastered over the things I craved to own .
Insurance firm AIG paid Man Utd £ 56 m to put its name on their shirts
But in less than a month 's time , I am going to burn every branded thing in my possession .
Gucci shoes , Habitat chairs , even Simple soap .
I have reached the point in my life where I can no longer be around these things , no matter how special they make me feel .
Yes , it is going to be a terrible waste , yes I 'll no doubt feel lost when they 're gone , but at this moment in time , it seems the only thing I can do .
Brands are all around us .
In our homes , on our way to work , in the places we socialise and plastered over the things that entertain us .
Some brands are causes for celebration , being symbols of status or objects of beauty ( BMW ) .
Others are the subject of ridicule , somehow signifying a state in life which we cannot slip below ( Skoda ) .
In both cases , we take for granted that brands and their messages ( advertising ) are ever - present in our lives .
This is what has come to worry me .
I belong to a generation that has been continually sold - to , almost from birth .
If someone had taken the time to videotape my life , in a Truman Show type of way , there would be less than a few hours of tape in which there were no brands on the screen .
On my food , on my clothes , on the telly and in my brain .
In my world , the implications of wearing a crocodile as opposed to a polo player on the breast of one 's shirt are of crucial importance
Neil Boorman
From an early age , I have been taught that to be accepted , to be loveable , to be cool , one must have the right stuff .
At junior school , I tried to make friends with the popular kids , only to be ridiculed for the lack of stripes on my trainers .
Once I had nagged my parents to the point of buying me the shoes I was duly accepted at school , and I became much happier as a result .
As long as my parents continued to buy me the brands , life was more fun .
Now , at the age of 31 , I still behave according to playground law .
I have been topping up my self - esteem and my social status by buying the right branded things , so that I feel good about myself , so that people can know who I am .
In my world , the implications of wearing a crocodile as opposed to a polo player on the breast of one 's shirt are of crucial importance .
Understanding the differences between Dualit and Dyson , and what they say about their owners is reflection of style and good taste .
By now you 're thinking that I am a particularly shallow individual , and to a certain extent , you 'd be right .
But I think that in small ways , we all behave like this in our daily lives .
A stranger waves as they drive past in the same model car as our own .
Snap judgments are made on youths dressed in white Reeboks and hoodies .
That little bit extra spent on our favourite name brands in the supermarket is a small price to pay because we 're worth it .
Cashing in on brands by association , Chinese style
These brands offer us a set of beliefs and goals which we can aspire to .
Is this sounding far fetched ?
Do n't take it from me , here 's Kevin Roberts , worldwide CEO of Saatchi & Saatchi .
" For great brands to survive , they must create loyalty beyond reason .
The secret is the use of mystery , sensuality and intimacy ... the power to create long term emotional connections with consumers . "
Being the gullible fool that I am , I believed in the promises that these brands made to me ; that I would be more attractive , more successful , more happy for buying their stuff .
However , the highs of consumerism have been accompanied by a continual , dull ache , growing slowly as the years have gone by ; a melancholy that until recently I could not understand .
I now realise that it 's these damn brands that are the source of the pain .
For every new status symbol I acquire , for every new extension to my identity that I buy , I lose a piece of myself to the brands .
I placed my trust , even some love with these companies , and what have I had in return for my loyalty and my faith ?
Absolutely nothing .
How could they , they 're just brands .
So , this is why I am burning all my stuff .
To find real happiness , to find the real me , I must get rid of it all and start again , a brand - free life , if that is indeed possible .
Perhaps if I consume on the basis of need instead of want , on utility instead of status , I might start to value material things for the right reasons .
For the time being , I can only hope .
Maybe I am the only one in Britain who does n't buy branded .
I eat branded spaghetti or not as I please .
Much of my clothes are bought in Romania and South Africa if I am there , it helps the local economy .
I drive whatever car my son buys me and am grateful .
perhaps mr boorman would like a few days with me to see how it is done .

One small point , instead of burning his unwanted branded goods perhaps Neil Boorman could give them to a charity or recycle them instead .
Burning them is such a waste and bad for the climate .
Perhaps it might support Neil 's plan if his Gucci or Nike was recycled into something unbranded or was given to someone who just needs shoes / clothes of any type , branded or not .
Joe Hale , York , North Yorkshire
Just a small thought - why burn it all ?
There are many charitable organisations that would be thrilled to get donations of clothing and furniture .
I can't help thinking that the intended funeral pyre is intended to shout " Look at me " as much as the brands are themselves .
Chris Waldock , London
A plain Polo shirt £ 10 a polo shirt with designer logo £ 50 .
It all goes to prove the saying that a fool and their money are soon parted .
Ian , UK
Instead of burning it why not give it to a charity shop , so at least some one else can benefit from this stunt !
It wouldnt take much effort to bag everything up .
In fact I 'm sure they wouldnt even mind collecting it from you , if you have too much stuff to do it yourself .
Jules , UK
I am interested to see how the most basic of Neil 's tasks turn out - he says he is getting rid of things such as Simple soap , so what does he expect to wash with ?
Surely even a supermarket 's own product counts as branded ?
The same goes for food , clothing , and pretty much everthing we come into contact with on a day - to - day basis .
I understand this is point of the article , but how can anyone live a ' non- branded ' lifestyle unless they go right back to basics , growing and cooking their own food and making toiletries and other cleaning products from natural ingredients found in nature .
I 'm looking forward to an update !
Sarah , London
I support your actions to stop buying and using brands wholeheartedly .
So often we are tricked into believing that something is better or cooler simply because of a name or logo attached .
Go for it Neil but may I suggest donating your branded goods to charity rather than burning them as that way some good comes out of the situation for others ?
Miriam , Durham >
Good luck !
I 've always thought that brands should pay the consumer for advertising them , not the other way around .
I hate the whole branding thing and will do my utmost to avoid having a label on me .
Yes , some things are aspirational but more in terms of quality than " happiness " .
I 'd love to know how you get on .
It wo n't be easy and you 'll go through some suffering but you 'll end up stronger .
Caroline Banks , London UK and Delhi India
How will you get to and from places ?
You could take the badge off your car but it will still look and feel like a ( bmw perhaps )
We buy brands to be reassured of quality too / or avoid them to get something cheaper .
You cant avoid brands so its better just to accept that and instead simply keep in mind what your requirements of a product are so that you are never paying for the name alone !
If cheap works then buy cheap .
If you need the brand - for whatever reason : quality ; features ; even status - then buy that !
David , Aberdeen
What took you so long to wake up and smell the unbranded coffee ?
d.a.humphreys , UK
Do n't burn it , you idiot .
Give it away .
That 'll be a bigger gesture , and avoid an appalling waste .
Maggie ,
I can't believe you are going to burn all your branded belongings .
PLEASE auction them on e-bay with all the profits going to a charity , or at the very least take them to a few charity shops who can sell them to raise money .
I can't bear to think that no - one else will be able to benefit from your project .
Perhaps burn your one favourite item if you have to , but not all of them !!

Nothing was off limits for Richard Pryor
He died at the age of 65 of a heart attack at Encino hospital near Los Angeles , his wife Jennifer Pryor said .
A series of hit comedies in the 1970s and 1980s - including Stir Crazy and Silver Streak - helped make him one of Hollywood 's highest - paid stars .
He blazed a trail for black performers , earning enough clout to negotiate his own deals in Hollywood .
A five - year contract with Columbia Pictures in 1983 earned him $ 40 m ( £ 23 m ) .
Foul - mouthed
But he first came to prominence as a pioneering stand - up comic .
His uncompromising , foul - mouthed brand of humour focused on his personal insights into modern life and race relations .
" I live in racist America and I 'm uneducated , yet a lot of people love me and like what I do , and I can make a living from it .
You can't do much better than that , " he said .
HAVE YOUR SAY
He could make you laugh so hard that it hurt
James , Warrenton
In quotes : Richard Pryor Send us your tributes
His comedy influenced black artists such as Eddie Murphy , Arsenio Hall and Damon Wayans , as well as Robin Williams , David Letterman and others .
His health also became material for his stand - up routines .
In 1992 he asked an audience : " Is there a doctor in the audience ? "
Finally , when a hand went up , he said : " Doctor , I need to know one thing .
What the [ expletive deleted ] is MS ? "
The condition he wanted described is a degenerative disease of the nervous system .
In 1995 , he played an embittered multiple sclerosis patient in an episode of TV series Chicago Hope .
The role earned him an Emmy nomination as best guest actor in a drama series .
' I got greedy '
He also became addicted to drugs and alcohol .
In 1980 , he suffered serious burns over about half his body when he set himself on fire while freebasing cocaine - dissolving it over a flame and inhaling the fumes .
He later said the incident was actually a suicide attempt .
But he later incorporated the event into his routine , joking that igniting yourself " sobers you up pretty fast " .
He admitted that some of his later films were weaker than his earlier ones .
" I did n't think Brewster 's Millions [ 1985 ] was good to begin with , " he said .
" I 'm sorry , but they offered us the money .
I was a pig , I got greedy . "
He followed that film with the autobiographical work Jo Jo Dancer , Your Life is calling , which he also directed and co-wrote .
His wife Jennifer said he was not in pain when he died .
" He did not suffer , he went quickly and at the end there was a smile on his face , " she said .
" I 'm honoured now that I have an opportunity to protect and continue his legacy because he 's a very , very , very amazing man and he opened doors to so many people . "
Let 's Reconsider

Test Driven Development ?!
by Michael Feathers
November 17 , 2005
Summary
Scott Bellware just posted a link to Microsoft 's guidelines for TDD on the TDD mailing list .
< sigh >
Advertisement
Well , here 's the link :
Now , let 's talk about it .
The crux of Test Driven Development is that you use tests to drive the creation of your code , and in that loose sense , the guidelines pass muster , but there 's more to it than that , really .
The key advantage that TDD gives you is feedback .
You write a failing test case , make it pass , and then you formulate the next test case .
The wonderful thing is that when you get to that next test case , you have the feedback from getting the first one to pass to draw upon .
Often that feedback will lead you to formulate the next test case in a different way .
It could even lead you to produce a different interface for the class you were writing .
Now , what I 've described might sound bad .
It might sound like , well , maybe the decisions that you make during development will drift a bit .
Drifting might not sound very good but the fact is it is good in this case .
It 's good because we control it .
We are able to incorporate the things that we learn immediately when we learn them .
The alternative is to ignore things that we learn or not learn them at all , and that 's not a very clever strategy .
The style of TDD described in the guidelines would have us jump ahead and write five , ten , maybe twenty test cases before getting the first one to pass .
You can do that , but it 's like putting on a set of blinders .
When you do n't have to formulate the next test case right after passing the last one , there is n't much chance to think about improvements .
Worse , there is a disincentive to thinking about them : if you find any , you have to delete all of the speculation you 've hardcoded in the tests and interfaces you created in advance .
Just for the record , I 'm not a Microsoft - basher .
I 've met quite a few people who work there and they are very smart , people I have a lot of respect for , but there is something mysterious that happens in nearly all large organizations .
Ideas get passed from person to person through a grapevine , and the form that they end up in is rarely the form they start in .
It 's a lot like politics , really .
Politicians can't send nuanced messages because they know that only the most simplified version of what they say will propagate , and they have to be very careful that the simplified version of what they say is n't counter to their intentions .
But , that 's probably a topic for another blog .
Right now , I hope that MS revisits their guidelines .
Yes , they have a tool that generates test stubs , but using it for TDD looks counter - productive .
Adding stubs to legacy code ?
That would be great , but getting in the way of the feedback cycle ?
Bad. Bad. Bad .
Talk Back !

Technology continues to evolve but some things are meant to last for a long time .
If you are an adult reading this article , it is safe to say that you have witnessed for yourself the evolution of technology – most especially when it comes to computers .
Our modern world right now thrives because of them , including RAID servers , which host many major websites .
Even RAID servers are protected , frankly , with the advent of solid RAID data recovery services .
The Internet of Things did a great job in integrating itself to the core being of society , where people will no longer just see it as a luxury but a must in their daily lives .
No wonder wherever you go today , there are tech contrivances of all sorts that promises to make people ’s lives better , easier , and more fulfilling .
But as you ’ve probably noticed , the cloud is rising to superstardom and people are seeing just how useful it can possibly be in fueling our modern life especially now that digital data reigns supreme .
Many have thought previously that computers are becoming outdated especially with computer hardware .
The thing is we are actually seeing a major comeback for computer hardware as some businesses still struggle in completely migrating all their data and services to the cloud .
And even if they do , the servers that keep the cloud running at all times is operated through a computer , so we still ca n’t disregard the importance and relevance of computer hardware in today ’s digital era .

Potential readers can make snap decisions in just 50 milliseconds .
Quickly now : like what you see ?
Like the look of our website ?
Whatever the answer ( and hopefully it was yes ) , the chances are you made your mind up within the first twentieth of a second .
A study by researchers in Canada has shown that the snap decisions Internet users make about the quality of a web page have a lasting impact on their opinions .
We all know that first impressions count , but this study shows that the brain can make flash judgements almost as fast as the eye can take in the information .
The discovery came as a surprise to some experts .
" My colleagues believed it would be impossible to really see anything in less than 500 milliseconds , " says Gitte Lindgaard of Carleton University in Ottawa , who has published the research in the journal Behaviour and Information Technology1 .
Instead they found that impressions were made in the first 50 milliseconds of viewing .
Lindgaard and her team presented volunteers with the briefest glimpses of web pages previously rated as being either easy on the eye or particularly jarring , and asked them to rate the websites on a sliding scale of visual appeal .
Even though the images flashed up for just 50 milliseconds , roughly the duration of a single frame of standard television footage , their verdicts tallied well with judgements made after a longer period of scrutiny .
In the crowded and competitive world of the web , companies hoping to make millions from e-commerce should take notice , the researchers say .
" Unless the first impression is favourable , visitors will be out of your site before they even know that you might be offering more than your competitors , " Lindgaard warns .
First impressions last
For a typical commercial website , 60 % of traffic comes from search engines such as Google , says Marc Caudron of London web - design agency Pod1 .
This makes a user 's first impression even more critical , he explains .
" You 'll get a list of sites , click the top one , and then either say ' I 've engaged ' and give it a few more seconds , or just go back to Google , " he says .
The lasting effect of first impressions is known to psychologists as the ' halo effect ' : if you can snare people with an attractive design , they are more likely to overlook other minor faults with the site , and may rate its actual content ( such as this article , for example ) more favourably .
This is because of ' cognitive bias ' , Lindgaard explains .
People enjoy being right , so continuing to use a website that gave a good first impression helps to ' prove ' to themselves that they made a good initial decision .
The phenomenon pervades our society ; even doctors have been shown to follow their initial hunches , Lindgaard says , relying heavily on a patient 's most immediately obvious symptom when making a diagnosis .
" It 's awfully scary stuff , but the tendency to jump to conclusions is far more widespread than we realize , " she says .
Beauty and beholders

So what are the key ingredients of a good - looking website ?
Caudron suggests that the amount of graphics on the page should be strictly limited , perhaps to a single eye - catching image .
" It 's not about getting as much stuff on the page as possible , " he says .
These days , enlightened web users want to see a " puritan " approach , Caudron adds .
It 's about getting information across in the quickest , simplest way possible .
For this reason , many commercial websites now follow a fairly regular set of rules .
For example , westerners tend to look at the top - left corner of a page first , so that 's where the company logo should go .
And most users also expect to see a search function in the top right .
Of course , says Caudron , the other golden rule is to make sure that your web pages load quickly , otherwise your customers might not stick around long enough to make that coveted first impression .
" That can be the difference between big business and no business , " he says .

Nate was excited .
He landed his first " Fortune 500 " contract at , not just a Fortune 500 company , but a Fortune 50 one .
It was a fairly small project and a great foot in the door .
Today an interactive brochure website , tomorrow a global content management system that leverages collective synergy to drive " outside of the box " thinking and formulate key objectives into a win - win game plan with a quality - driven approach that focuses on empowering key players to drive - up their core competencies and increase expectations with an all - around initiative to drive up the bottom - line .
Nate could almost taste the enterpriesy goodness .
Though Nate 's application did n't utilize any security or authentication , it was part of The Extranet and needed to follow a " strict set of Enterprise Security guidelines . "
No big deal .
The guidelines were straight forward and mostly common sense : avoid SQL Injection , do n't assume client - side code will run , etc .
The only thing Nate needed was the " SecurityInclude.asp " file that all pages were required to include .
" Oh , no no no , " the Corporate Information Technology Liaison chuckled , " that 's a * secure * code file ; we do n't release * secure * code to vendors ! "
No big deal .
Nate used a dummy include file , developed the application , and sent it off to Corporate IT Liaison for deployment .
Unfortunately , the application did n't work .
It seemed to be a problem with the secret security include file .
The liaison suggested that Nate " try making various changes " to ensure that the application could accommodate the added security code .
As you might imagine , this got him nowhere .
He needed the secret security code .
Nate begged and pleaded with Corporate IT .
No luck ; it was simply too secure .
Nate 's client begged and pleaded with Corporate IT .
Still , no luck .
Nate 's client 's boss ' boss begged and pleaded with Corporate IT .
Finally !
They gave in and allowed Nate to go on site and diagnose the problem in their testing environment .
And finally , Nate had a chance to see this secret security code file ...
' '' BEGIN SecurityInclude.asp Dim userID userID = Request .
Cookies ( " userid " ) . Value If ( Len( userID ) = 0 or Trim( userID ) = " " ) Then Response .
Redirect ( " / default.asp " ) End If ''' END SecurityInclude.asp
... though it was n't the cause of the problem , it sure gave Nate an idea of what type of enterprisey coding he 'll need to soon master .
あーなんか言語紹介といえばこんなのがあったのでした。sed ってなんなのかという、とてもよくある疑問に対して私なりの回答です。まず実用を考えると、
sed 's /hoge /hage /'
このためだけに存在している言語です。メリットは perl - pe 's /hoge /hage / ' より 4 byte 短くてすむことだけです。これ以外の機能はスクリプト言語で十分なように思います。たまに勘違いしてる人がいる気がしますが、 y コマンドはカウンタを作るために存在しています。小文字を大文字に変換する、などと考えるとどのような時に使うのか皆目検討もつかず、ドツボにはまることうけあいです。気をつけましょう。ちょうど
OOP を犬とか猫で教えるような話に似てるかもしれません。
で、 sed in depth 。 sed とはなにか？ 誰がなんと言おうと、 sed は VM です。以下に VM の仕様を示します 。
無限bitのレジスタ1 本
無限bitのメモリ領域がひとつだけ
メモリへの直接演算は不可
正規表現でのレジスタへの演算
レジスタへの正規表現を使った条件分岐
命令セット( レジスタやメモリの移動系 )
x メモリとレジスタの入れ替え h レジスタからメモリにコピー g メモリからレジスタにコピ ー H レジスタからメモリのケツに追 加 G メモリからレジスタのケツに追加 d レジスタをクリ ア
はい、どう見ても VM です。これ以降の命令はあんまり VM ぽくないので適当に。 : label で label ってラベルを作れて、 b label でそこに飛べます。おおアセンブラぽい。直前のマッチに成功していたらジャンプ、というのが t label でできます。えーとあとは p( rint ) とか q( uit ) とかはわかるかと。 print がある VM ってめずらしいねというツッコミは却下です。なぜなら ICFPC の UM はあったから 。
で、とにかく重要なのは、普段 s/hoge/hige / とかでやってる処理はレジスタでの処理だということです。で、
CISC なアセンブラ書く人はわかってると思いますが、レジスタなんつーものは極めて短命です。 sed VM でも例外じゃないです。というかなんせ、1個しかレジスタが無いのですから、その大事度合いは x86 の 6 倍くらいになると予想されます。そこでメモリ領域があるのですが、恐ろしいことにこれも 1 つしかありません。しかし幸い、レジスタもメモリも文字列領域なので、基本的に無限長です。そこで、 1 つの空間を複数にわけて活用することになります。
そこまでわかっちゃえば、後は適当にメモリ内の
1行目はあの情報、2行目はあの情報、というような約束を決めて、毎回メモリから全データコピー→適当に正規表現で必要な情報を切り出す→処理→メモリのトップに返す→またメモリから拾ってる→とりあえずトップに返した情報を正しい位置に置く→メモリに返す、というサイクルを繰り返せば、とりあえず割と普通にプログラムができます。あとはエルフヘッダの知識と無駄に消費するための時間、ちょっとした工夫くらいがあればコンパイラも書けます！
で、えーと一応お約束なので。

シリコンバレーでソフトウェア産業に携わる人たちを見て感心するのは、「地に足の着いたこまごまとした開発」と、「個別の開発を思い切り抽象化した包括的ビ
ジョンの構築」との間を、自在に行ったり来たりする能力だ。アプリケーションの開発は、コードをがりがりと書く仕事。一方で、アーキテクチャをしっかりと
作り上げるには、個別の開発から何段階も次元を上げ、高いところから俯瞰する哲学的思考が求められる。そしてその両方を行き来することで技術が進歩する。
「 現実の泥沼をかき分けて進む力」と、「体系化する力」の両方が求められる、知的力仕事だ。
一方、これをソフトウェアを使うユーザの側から見ると、「概念形成期には抽象的で難しいものでも、それがアプリケーションに落とし込まれた暁には、非常に簡単でわかりやすいものになっている」ということが起こる。
例えば、XML 。「メタデータ情報を付加し、さらに非同期やサブスクライブ・パブリッシュといったメッセージングモデルを実現する」といった、何がなんだかよくわからない概念として語られていたのが90年代半ば。しかし、これが現実のニーズに落としこまれてみると、「お気に入りのブログを登録しておくと、その内容が新しくなるたびに自動的に表示されます」といった、ユーザに優しいサービスになっている。
そして今着々と進んでいるのが「リアルタイムエンタープライズ」の流れだ。数年前から、「これからのコンピューティングの姿」としていろいろな名前で語られているもの。製造、物流、金融、顧客といったさまざまなサプライチェーン参加者の間のシステムを結合、全参加者にすべてのデータが常に「リアルタイム」で提供されるようにする、という壮大なビジョンである。
そうした 「
リアルタイム・エンタープライズ」化が最近とみに目に付くのは、インターネットサイトである。しかしその姿は、壮大さなど微塵もないユーザーフレンドリーなもの。たとえばOpenTableというサイトがある。「レストラン予約サイト」だが、感心するのは10分後の空席状況まで「リアルタイム」にわかること。ちょっとまともなレストランが予約で一杯になる金曜の夜に、突然外食を思い立っても心配ない。地域と時間を指定すれば、すぐに空席のある店がリストアップされ、その場でオンライン予約をして店に直行できる。レストラン内で利用される予約システムと、OpenTableのオンライン予約システムとがリアルタイムでつながれているからできる芸当である。
Amazonをはじめとした物売りのサイトでは、もはや在庫の有無が瞬時に出てくるのは当然。「いったん予約を受けてしまってから在庫がないことが判明、顧客にその旨を伝えて処理をする」という人的手間を考えれば、リアルタイムなシステムを導入したほうが安上がりなのに加え、顧客満足も向上する。
さらには、顧客サポートもリアルタイム化、ショッピングしながら、オンライン・チャットでユーザーサポートスタッフと対話できるサイトも増えている。中には、こちらが何も質問しなくても、品定めをし始めて一定時間がたつとチャット画面が開き「何かお探しですか」などと聞いてくる、というリアル店舗さながらのオンラインショップまである。
ビル管理会社では、テナントからのメンテナンス要求をオンライン受付しているところもある。テナントがサイトで「壊れた空調の修理をして欲しい」といった要求を出すと、それが管理会社の適切な部署に直接連絡される仕組みになっている。管理会社の人たちはみな携帯端末を持ち歩いており、リアルタイムで直接要求を受け、処理状況を入力する。しかもその経緯は顧客であるテナントからも見えるようになっていて、誰が何をしているかが随時わかって安心できる。
もちろん、システムの開発にはそれなりの期間がかかる。たとえば、OpenTableのサービスを実現するには、単に見た目のよいサイトを作るだけでなく、サイトと連結した予約システムを作り、しかもそれをレストランに設置していかなければならない。それには準備期間がずいぶんかかる。
リアルタイム・エンタープライズに限らず、「概念は難しいがアプリケーションは使いやすい」というのはどんなIT技術にもいえること。抽象的なビジョンが語られている間に、それを手の届く実際の機能に落とし込んで作りこめる「知的体力」が、ITの作り手にも使い手にも求められる時代となったのである。
He is a most unlikely national hero , a man who has barely spent any time in South Korea , speaks little of the language and who under other circumstances might be looked down upon in this society .
Ever since Hines Ward was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl last week , the half - Korean Pittsburgh Steeler wide receiver has been the toast of the town .
People are talking about throwing parades in his honor .
His name dominates the television and radio talk shows ; his photo is splayed across the front pages of the newspapers .
Especially popular are close - up shots of his muscular upper arm , tattooed with his name spelled in Korean .
South Koreans ’ fascination with Hines is not simply a matter of pride , but of curiosity .
The 29 - year - old athlete is something of a novelty in that his mother is Korean , but his father was an African American GI .

In ethnically homogenous South Korea , such mixed - race offspring are generally viewed with contempt .
And because social status is based on being registered under the father ’s name , children raised by their mothers alone in effect are treated as nonpersons .
Biracial men have been banned from the South Korean military , although the Defense Ministry announced Friday , in a move that some attributed to the Hines Ward phenomenon , that the policy is being changed .
“ If he had grown up here instead of the United States , he would have had a hard time , ” said Park Mi Na , a 17 - year - old mixed - race high school student .
Park , who bears a strong resemblance to the African American father she has n’t seen since she was 2 , said she has been taunted by children her entire life and stared at strangely by adults “ as if I were an alien from outer space . ”
Park speaks no English and does n’t know the difference between Washington , D.C. and the state of Washington .
( Her father , she said , lives in one of the Washingtons . )
But she hopes to study in the U.S. , if only to be someplace where she does n’t draw attention .
Advertisement
Ward ’s situation could have been much the same as Park ’s except that he has lived most of his life in the U.S .
His parents met when his father was stationed in South Korea and his mother was working as a waitress in a nightclub .
They moved to the U.S. when Ward was a toddler .
After the couple divorced , a court awarded custody to his father because his mother spoke little English .
But Ward ran away when he was 7 to live with his mother , Kim Young Hee , who managed to support herself and her child by working three jobs .
In interviews with the media here , Kim said she did not move back to South Korea because of discrimination against herself and her child .
When she visited in 1998 to attend her mother ’s funeral , she told the Chosun Ilbo newspaper , people spat at her because she had been married to an African American .
Even in the United States , Korean immigrants excluded her son from their gatherings because of his racial background .
“ After that , I told Hines never to hang out with Korean kids , ” Kim said .

Ward ’s newfound celebrity has prompted some soul - searching in South Korea .
“ I nearly cried when I read the story of his mother in the paper , ” said Yun Nam Jung , a taxi driver .
Ward should be welcomed with a parade through the center of Seoul , he said , adding : “ He ’s a superb man .
We ’re so proud of him . ”
In fact , South Koreans might get their chance to celebrate Ward ’s success .
The MVP has said he will visit in April , perhaps with his mother .
Already , the country ’s two leading airlines are competing to fly them over and foot the bill for the trip .
Among the many South Koreans who want to see him in Seoul are the administrators of Pearl S. Buck International , a foundation that provides support to biracial children .

“ He is an American basically , not a Korean .
But the way that he overcame the hardships of his childhood could be an inspiration to our children too , ” said Lee Ji Young , a social worker at the Seoul office .
There are an estimated 35,000 mixed - raced South Koreans , most of them half Caucasian , according to the Pearl Buck Foundation .
Discrimination is far worse against those who have African American fathers , although several such people have achieved prominence as entertainers .
Insooni , a well - known biracial singer , said that despite her success she made sure that her 12 - year - old daughter was born in the U.S. and thus could get an American passport .

“ I could bear any discrimination and taunting myself -- but as a mother , I did n’t want my child to have the same experience , ” said Insooni , who goes by one name .
Many South Korean newspapers in recent days have run editorials calling for an end to discrimination .
Among them , the JoongAng Ilbo opined that “ pure hearts ” are more important than “ pure blood . ”
The paper called on South Koreans to “ open our minds ... to raise the second and third Hines Wards in Korea . ”
The Chosun Ilbo ran a cartoon of a construction worker musing , “ I wonder what would have become of Hines if he stayed in Korea ? ”
Underneath him a biracial worker is struggling to climb up a beam with bricks on his back .

Jinna Park of The Times ’ Seoul Bureau contributed to this report .
Google 's blockbuster announcement last week that it would pay $ 1.65 billion in stock for YouTube , an online video company that has yet to turn a profit , pumped air into the theory that another Internet bubble has inflated .
Certainly tech 's new boom , which has been labeled Web 2.0 by some , has many similarities to the dot - com days of the late 1990s , when twentysomething millionaires rode their scooters through the corridors of short - lived startups and companies with little or no real revenues were commanding obscene valuations on Wall Street .
[ Podcast : Wired Magazine 's Craig Anderson and entrepreneur Andrew Keen with Alan T. Saracevic on Web 2.0 . ]
Upon closer inspection , this latest Internet run-up has a deeper grounding , with millions of people online -- and millions of dollars in advertising being spent to reach them .
" A gigantic gush of consumer products advertising dollars is moving online , " said Paul Kedrosky , a venture capitalist and author of the Infectious Greed blog .
Consumer product companies represent 11 percent of the $ 145 billion global advertising market , but they spend only 1 percent of their ad budgets online , Kedrosky said .
" That 's absurdly low , " he said , but it 's changing , and " a gigantic sluice is opening up .
And that 's allowing all these bubbly , frothy things to happen . "
Much of the first bubble , which reached a feverish pitch before popping in 2000 , was based on speculation about how big the Internet would become , and what kind of companies would make big money on it .
While that speculation still exists , no one now disputes that the Internet has changed the way much of business is conducted , to say nothing of how people interact or how entertainment is broadcast .
And the Internet has been broadly adopted , with the Pew Internet and American Life Project finding that 42 percent of Americans have high - speed Internet connections at home , and nearly three - fourths of all U.S. adults are regular Internet users .
" We should all be worshiping at the altar of the bubble blowers of 1998 , " Kedrosky said .
" It turns out they were right .
They were just way too early . "
Other key differences :
-- Startups now tend to sell themselves to bigger firms , rather than have an overly hyped initial public offering on the stock market .
-- Entrepreneurs can start companies with a lot less money due to technological advances , therefore diminishing the importance of venture capitalists looking for big gains .
-- A new emphasis on social networking and connecting people , rather than e-commerce , which was foisted on consumers before they trusted the medium .
-- Big media companies that sued to stop or slow technology the first time around , as the recording industry did when faced with the threat of online song piracy , are now embracing the Internet , signing deals and seeing potential for new revenue with services like Apple 's iTunes Store and YouTube .
On the other hand , some of the same issues that emerged in the dot - com era remain today , albeit in different form :
-- Companies are still using their stock as currency to make other acquisitions .
While Google is sitting on $ 10 billion cash , it chose to buy YouTube using its stock -- the same sort of so - called " funny money " that AOL used to buy TimeWarner at the end of the last bubble .
--
The big challenge remains figuring out how to wring money out of all the people using the Internet -- in dot - com parlance , the " monetizing eyeballs . "
While Google appears to have hit on the solution with ads targeted to searches , analysts are wondering whether growing concerns about fraudulent clicks on those ads could bring this new gold mine down like a house of cards .
--
While venture capitalists have learned some lessons , they are still running like sheep into crowded competitive landscapes .
Some analysts estimate there are more than 240 online video firms out there , and the number of social networking startups -- read MySpace copycats -- is in the dozens .
" I absolutely think we 're in a bubble , but the bubble we 're in is very different , " said Joe Kraus , chief executive officer of JotSpot , a Web 2.0 company that provides software that businesspeople use for collaboration .
Kraus knows bubbles :
He founded Internet portal Excite , a classic example of the first dot - com go - round that included a stratospheric stock offering and a sobering collapse .
" A huge number of companies are being created and funded right now , " Kraus said .
" It 's so much cheaper to bring a product to market these days .
Computers are 100 times cheaper .
The software you use to develop your software is free .
You have access to offshore labor like never before .
... ( Google ) AdWords allow you to reach small markets . "
That means entrepreneurs do n't need to go to the public market .
Kraus said too many " fifth - tier companies " ( he named Theglobe. net as an example ) had big public stock offerings in the late 1990s , which he does n't see happening now .
Wall Street drove much of what then - Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan termed " irrational exuberance " in the late 1990s , and it was the onset of a bear market that finally burst the bubble .
" The great thing in this bubble is , it 's not accessible to retail investors , " Kraus said .
Last time , " investors like my mom and dad could invest in speculative companies .
My mom and dad have no access this time .
It 's all funded by private capital and private equity .
The only people who get hurt are people who can afford to get hurt . "
According to venture capital research firm Dow Jones VentureOne , 49 Web 2.0 companies received $ 262.3 million in the first half of 2006 , compared to 51 companies getting $ 199 million in all of 2005 .
VentureOne defined Web 2.0 companies as those consumer - oriented Web sites with open interfaces specializing in user - generated content and social networking .
But Web 2.0 still represents a tiny portion of where venture capitalists are putting their money .
Overall , according to Josh Grove , a senior research analyst at VentureOne , firms invested $ 13 billion in a range of industries , primarily the more traditional tech mainstays like software , semiconductors , hardware , networking , and biotech and medical devices .
The median size of a Web 2.0 investment is $ 4.63 million , Grove said , compared to $ 7.5 million for all venture investments .
" While there is more interest than there has been in these Web 2.0 companies , it still has n't reached bubble proportions yet , " he said .
Tristan Louis learned a thing or two about the bubble during his time in 1999 at Boo.com , a fashion site that was one of that era's more spectacular flameouts , burning through $ 120 million in six months , according to some reports .
Louis , who now works in New York , leading a team of innovators at a large financial institution , compiled a list on his blog of many of the top deals of the Web 2.0 era .
While a small handful , such as Google - YouTube and eBay 's acquisition of Internet telephony firm Skype for $ 2.6 billion last fall , reached stratospheric proportions , most of them fell in the $ 30 million to $ 50 million range .
Many of the deals were so small that the Securities and Exchange Commission did n't even require the acquiring companies to disclose the purchase price , and Louis relied on rumored numbers ; all were certainly below $ 100 million .
The deals , which date back to 2003 , included Google 's acquisitions of Blogger , Picasa , Dodgeball , MeasureMap and Writely , as well as rival Yahoo 's acquisitions of Flickr , del.icio.us , Oddpost and Upcoming.org .
Sony bought video site Grouper in August for $ 65 million .
The comparatively low sale prices indicated to Louis that the air has not yet inflated this bubble .
" The data does not support that conclusion yet , " he wrote on his blog at www.tnl.net.
Louis even joins a growing chorus arguing that Google 's deal for YouTube makes perfect sense .
YouTube , after all , plays 100 million video clips a day , owns 46 percent of the online video market ( as calculated by market research firm Hitwise ) , and is the eighth most popular site on the Internet ( as measured by Alexa.com ) .
" I think the acquisition makes incredible sense , " said George Zachary , a partner at venture capital firm Charles River Ventures .
He compared the deal to Microsoft 's acquisition of Hotmail in 1998 for a reported $ 400 million , saying that people thought the software giant overpaid , only to see Hotmail become a hugely popular Web - based e-mail service .
" I think the same thing is happening with online entertainment services , " Zachary said .
Consumers are spending more and more time on the Internet , rivaling the time they spend in front of the television .
Realizing this , Internet and media companies are racing to find ways to capture their attention .
" The future of entertainment is online and they need to line up their properties , " Zachary said .
In an almost parallel argument , Kedrosky , of the Infectious Greed blog , compares the YouTube deal to Disney 's purchase of Fox Family Worldwide in 2001 for $ 5.3 billion .
That deal made sense , he said , because it was a media deal -- and so is Google - YouTube .
" People are in the bad habit of looking at YouTube as a technology company , " he said .
" It is n't .
The technology is trivial .
It 's a media company . "
Google stands to make millions in advertising revenue from its acquisition of YouTube , said Kyle Mashima , CEO of FilmLoop , a site that lets people share photos and scroll pictures across their screens .
" Google is pretty good at math , " he said .
" I do n't think they 'll be making purchases out of their realm .
...
Though the numbers are high and expensive , they have at least some sound economic basis for coming up with that value . "
Dmitry Shapiro , founder and CEO of Veoh , an online video site , concurred : " We 're going to look back and say they got a bargain . "

What this Document is About
This document covers how I have set up my Linux box to work as a Mail Server .
The details will be specific to Arch Linux , but it will be be general enough for any *nix distribution if you have a knowledge of installing software packages , finding the location of configuration files , and starting / stoping services ..
My goals in creating this mail system are to have all of my mail , from various email accounts , stored locally on my machine so I can access it anytime via SSH , the web , or imap .
I wanted all of my mail delivered to my local user account and I wanted the spam to be sucked out and launched into space .
The backbone of the mail system is the Mail Transport Agent ( MTA ) .
It will handle receiving mail addressed directly to your machine , sending it to the correct users mail box , and sending mail out from the machine .
I determined Postfix to be the best choice for my MTA and after some reading found Procmail for sorting mail , SpamBayes for detecting spam , and Fetchmail for grabbing mail from my pop mailboxes .
Bellow is a flow diagram for mail moving through the system :
The SpamAssassin and sa-learn can be ignored .
I will describe how to use it with SpamBayes since I was not happy with Spam Assassin 's performance and had made the diagram when I was still using it .
Software Used
Installing the Software
Installing Postfix
A note for those with dynamic IP addresses : Before installing Postfix we must first consider if it will need to make use of Simple Authentication and Security Layer ( SASL ) .
If you have a dynamic IP address and are using a service like dyndns.org you will need to have Postfix send your mail through your ISP 's mail server ( with authentication ) making use of SASL for the connection .
This is because many domains that you will send email to will recognize your hostname as pointing to a dynamic IP address and send the mail back .
Check if your distributions
Postfix package was built with SASL support or if you are compiling Postfix from scratch add SASL with a ./ configure option .
If you 've determined you do not need SASL support in postfix : $ pacman - Sy postfix
If you do need SASL support we need to install cyrus- sasl and use the Arch Build System ( abs ) utility for building Postfix .
Follow the instructions bellow or follow these Arch Wiki instructions : http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostFix_Howto_With_SASL
$ pacman - Sy cyrus-sasl
$ abs
$ cd /var / abs
$ mkdir -p local / postfix
$ cp - v extra / daemons / postfix /* local / postfix Now edit / var / abs/ local / postfix / PKGBUILD .
Under the build ( ) section change : make OPT = " $ { CFLAGS} " || return 1 to : make OPT = " $ { CFLAGS} " \ CCARGS= " - DUSE_SASL_AUTH
- I/usr / include /sasl / " \ AUXLIBS= " - L/usr/lib/sasl2 - lsasl2 " || return 1 Now run : $ makepkg
$ pacman - A postfix-*.pkg.tar.gz Note : Substitute - A with - U on newver versions of pacman / arch
Then copy the package into a directory under / var / lib / pacman so there is access to all of the abs built packages later : $ mkdir / var/lib/ pacman/abs_built
$ cp postfix-*.pkg.tar.gz /var/lib/pacman/abs_built
Installing Fetchmail $ pacman -S fetchmail Installing Procmail $ pacman - S procmail Installing SpamBayes SpamBayes is not yet in the pacman repository .
Download it , extract , and install ( substitute version numbers with most current ) : $ wget http://dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge\
/spambayes/spambayes-1.1a1.tar.gz $ tar zxvf spambayes - 1.1a1.tar.gz $ cd spambayes - 1.1a1 $ python setup.py install Installing Mutt $ pacman - S mutt Installing courier - imap and courier - authlib SquirrelMail as well as other mail clients ( evolution , outlook , cell phone , etc. ) will use this to connect to the mail box .
Courier - imap also depends on courier - authlib , so this command will install that as well .
$ pacman - S courier - imap Installing SquirrelMail $ pacman -S squirrelmail Installing pop-before - smtp
You are going to want to consider using Postfix / TLS or pop - before - smtp if you are interested in users connected via IMAP being able to send mail ( using your mail server as a SMTP relay ) .
I recommend using Postfix / TLS but will not cover how to install / configure it in this document .
Pop - before - smtp is not in pacman repositories .
Substitute version numbers with the most current .
$ wget http://dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/popbsmtp/pop-before-smtp-1.38.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf pop - before - smtp-*.tar.gz
$ cd pop - before - smtp -*
Read the README in this directory and then read README .
QUICKSTART in the contrib directory for where to copy the necessary files to .
Postfix Configuration
main.cf
Now change to the ' / etc / postfix ' directory and open up main .cf for editing .
The domain name for my machine is through dyndns.org .
Set your myhostname and my domain to something like this : myhostname = example.com mydomain = example.com
Next we are going to want to set Postfix up for using qmail - style delivery with Maildir ( where each email is stored in its own file ) .
This is for courier - imap which SquirrelMail will be using to access the mail and will have other advantages .
Do n't forget the ending forward slash .
home_mailbox = Maildir /
Set it up so that incoming mail is sent through procmail and so we can alias names / users to mailboxes .
mailbox_command = /usr / bin/ procmail - a " $ DOMAIN "
alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases
If you have a dynamic IP or have trouble with mail being returned from large ISP 's or mail systems you are going to have to take a few extra steps .
We will set it up so that mail will go through a relay host .
In this example I will use my ISP 's ( SBC ) smtp server as an example .
Make these additional changes to main .cf relayhost = [ smtp.sbcglobal.yahoo.com ]
# authentication for sbc yahoo
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
That wraps up our changes to main.cf .
We just need to create the hash aliases databases that we defined above .
Add these lines to the top of /etc / postfix / aliases ( replacing hypexr with your user account of course ) :
root : hypexr spam : hypexr ham : hypexr
Generate the database .
From /etc / postfix dir :
$ postalias aliases
Set up smtp server and authentication for SBC mail relay .
sasl_passwd :
smtp.sbc.mail.yahoo4.akadns.net my_username@sbcglobal.net :my_passw
Note : Server name can change from time to time .
There is a CNAME that points to this name but CNAMEs do not work here .
Generate the database :
$ ./ postmap sasl_passwd
Start the postfix server and we are done with postfix !!!!
$ /etc/rc.d / postfix start
Having problems getting it to start ?
Check out the Postfix log file usually in / var / log / mail or / var / log / maillog .
Fetchmail Configuration
We are going to run our fetchmail daemon from user root .
So create the file / root /. fetchmailrc :
set postmaster " postmaster "
set bouncemail
set no spambounce
set properties " "
set daemon 60
poll pop.example.com with proto POP3
user ' user_name ' there with password ' my_password ' is ' local_user_to_deliver_to ' here options flush
poll pop.gmail.com with proto POP3 port 995
user 'my_gmail_un@gmail.com ' there with ssl with password ' my_password ' is ' hypexr ' here options keep
This tells fetchmail to check every minute for mail at pop.mypop.com and also at my gmail account .
The flush option at the end of the mypop entry tells it to remove the mail after it is downloaded .
I do not want the mail removed from my Gmail account so I use the keep option .
Google also uses ssl , hence the " with ssl " .
Fetchmail comes with its configuration utility fetchmailconf which makes setting up your . fetchmailrc file easy .
I do n't believe that Arch Linux has a rc script for fetchmail .
The one that I made ( /etc/rc.d/ fetchmail ) looks like this ( stat_busy , stat_fail , stat_done are specific to Arch Linux .
You could take these out ) :
#!/bin/sh .
/etc/rc.conf .
/etc/rc.d/functions DAEMON_NAME=" fetchmail " DAEMON_CONF= " /root/.fetchmailrc " DAEMON_PATH=" /usr/bin/fetchmail " PID=`pidof -o %PPID $ {DAEMON_NAME}` case " $ 1 " in start ) stat_busy " Starting $ {DAEMON_NAME} " [ -z " $ PID " ] && $ {DAEMON_PATH} -f $ {DAEMON_CONF} -d 60 &> / dev / null if [ $ ? - gt 0 ] ; then stat_fail else add_daemon $ {DAEMON_NAME} stat_done fi ; ; stop ) stat_busy " Stopping $ {DAEMON_NAME} " [ ! -z " $ PID " ] && kill " $ PID " &> / dev / null if [ $ ? - gt 0 ] ; then stat_fail else rm_daemon $ {DAEMON_NAME} stat_done fi ; ; restart ) # calling ' stop ' and ' start ' without the $ 0 fails ... $ 0 stop sleep 3 $ 0 start ;; *) echo " usage : $ 0 { start|stop|restart} " esac exit 0
And start the fetchmail daemon :
$ /etc/rc.d/ fetchmail start
Or if you do n't want to create / modify an rc script you can start the fetchmail daemon like :
$ /usr/bin/fetchmail -d 60
Spambayes and Procmail Configuration
We are going to be using Spambayes to train and determine if mail is spam and Procmail to sort the mail into folders when they enter our mail system .
These two go together as far as Procmail is going to use Spambayes to help sort the mail .
I had used SpamAssassin for a year and had not been very happy with its performance .
I have only been using Spambayes for a few weeks and have been pleasantly surprised by how well it has worked and how quickly it adapts .
In fairness I had been training SpamAssassin on all of my spam , the spam it had caught and the spam it had missed as well .
It was also an older version and I was not using all of the features .
With that being said if you are curious give it a try .
Many other excellent programs exist .
A quick search on Google will turn them up .
When Spambayes is installed it is going to move several files that start with sb_ into your /usr / bin directory .
We are going to be interested in sb_mboxtrain .py and sb_filter .py .
The former trains the spam filter and the later classifies incoming spam .
There are two methods I tried for the initial training :
Since I already had thousand of spam and ham ( non spam ) messages saved up I first tried initially training on this older mail .
The results were okay but it was miss sorting mail .
These problems would have sorted them selves out with the continued training of the misclassified mail but it would have also took a little while because the database had already been trained so much .
The second method I used was extremely effective .
I started out with no training on initial messages .
I simply let Spambayes work with no information .
I then sent the spam and ham messages that ended up in the wrong mailbox to a designated folder .
I then run the Spambayes training program on these miss classified messages .
The results from the second method have been amazing .
Without even having to manually classify very many messages Spambayes has been performing at superior levels .
Check out Spambayes Wiki for many other training methods .
I will discuss easy methods of sorting miss classifications in the Mutt and Squirrel Mail sections .
Spam System Initial Setup
We are going to want Maildir folders to hold our regular mail , mail classified as spam , mail classified as unsure , missed spam , and missed ham .
If the standard Maildir directory ( ~ / Maildir ) does n't already exist lets create it with the necessary sub directories to make it a mail box .
Run these commands from your user account who will be receiving the mail .
$ mkdir ~/ Maildir
$ mkdir ~/ Maildir / {new , cur , tmp}
And now the other 4 directories that we are going to use for dealing with spam ( Making the directories hidden is going to be done for integration with Squirrelmail ) : $ mkdir ~/ Maildir/{.MissedSpam , .MissedHam , .CaughtSpam , .
Unsure}
$ mkdir ~/ Maildir/.MissedSpam/{new,cur,tmp}
$ mkdir ~/ Maildir/.MissedHam/{new,cur,tmp}
$ mkdir ~/ Maildir/.CaughtSpam/{new, cur,tmp}
$ mkdir ~/ Maildir /.
Unsure/{new , cur , tmp}
The messages that we are going to be training as spam are going to be in ~/ Maildir / .
MissedSpam and ham will be in ~/ Maildir /.
MissedHam .
Lets create the script and cron job that will take care of training the Spambayes db .
Create a file ~/ Maildir / train_spambayes and add this : #!/bin/sh #
Script to copy mail missed spam and ham into correct folders # and run sb_mboxtrain .py to train spambayes #
Training will be done only on missed spam and ham #
Files we saved or bounced may be in the new directory #
We want them in cur for training mv /home / hypexr / Maildir/.MissedSpam/new/* \ /home / hypexr / Maildir/.MissedSpam/cur 2>/dev/null mv /home / hypexr / Maildir/.MissedHam/new/* \ /home / hypexr / Maildir/.MissedHam/cur 2>/dev/null /usr/bin/sb_mboxtrain.py -d /home/ hypexr/.hammie.db \ -g /home / hypexr / Maildir/.MissedHam \ -s /home / hypexr / Maildir/.MissedSpam
Make the script executable : $ chmod +x ~/Maildir/train_spambayes
Set up our database that will be consulted for new email and trained on new spam / ham : $ /usr/bin/sb_filter.py -d $ HOME/.hammie.db -n
You will want cron installed so that it can launch the script above , which trains Spambayes , every night at 3:21 am .
Edit your cron jobs with the command crontab -e and add : 21 3 * * * ~/Maildir/train_spambayes Procmail Configuration for Spambayes
These are basic procmail recipes that will sort the spam from ham .
From Spambayes on Unix or Linux .
Add these lines to your mail recipient 's ~/. procmailrc : SHELL=/ bin/sh MAILDIR=$HOME / Maildir DEFAULT=$HOME / Maildir/ CAUGHT_SPAM=$MAILDIR/CaughtSpam/ UNSURE=$MAILDIR/Unsure / # Spambayes process :0 fw: hamlock | /usr/bin/sb_filter.py -d /home/ hypexr/.hammie.db :0 * ^X - Spambayes - Classification : spam $ {CAUGHT_SPAM} :0 * ^X - Spambayes - Classification : unsure $ {UNSURE} # Catches everything else .
#
Anything left over goes into the DEFAULT folder :0 : $ {DEFAULT}
So incoming mail is not filtered through procmail 's rules where Spambayes 's sb_filter decides whether it is spam or ham .
The mail is now sitting in the correct directories and ready to be accessed by whatever reader / front - end you would like .
Next I going to describe setting up Mutt and SquirrelMail for viewing your mail .
Mutt will be the most powerful option combining speed and sleekness but SquirrelMail will be able to match functionality .
Mutt Configuration
First we need to set the MAIL variable so that Mutt will know where to look for your mail .
In your ~/. bashrc ( create if does not exist ) add the line :
MAIL ='~ / Maildir '
Exit out of your shell and log back in so that the variable will be set or run export MAIL ='~ / Maildir ' .
On some systems mutt will not use $ MAIL to determine the location of your mail box .
When trying to start mutt if it reports a message that no mail directory exists you can try setting the MAILDIR variable or just create the directory that it wants to use and make it a valid Maildir : mkdir -p ~/. maildir / {cur , new , tmp} where .
maildir is the folder that mutt wants to use .
If you use a directory other than ~/ Maildir remember to substitute that wherever I reference Maildir in this document .
Now for the fun part .
Lets make everything look pretty and integrated in Mutt .
If you start up Mutt right now you will see any mail that your system has received since you have completed the steps above .
If no mail shows up in Mutt and there should be mail you need to first check if Spambayes has filtered it into your .
Unsure or .
CaughtSpam directories .
Type 'c ' to change directories and enter ~/ Maildir / Unsure and check out the mail thats been classified as spam : ' c ' ~/ Maildir / CaughtSpam .
If you still have not found the mail that you are expecting to have received make sure that you have configured Postfix , Fetchmail , and Procmail correctly .
Also , try sending mail directly to your_user_accunt@example.com and see if it shows up in one of the directories above .
Now mail is flowing into your system and we can check how Spambayes has classified it by checking the different mail folders .
The miss classified mail just needs to be moved into the correct folders for the training .
To manually move the misclassified spam mail :
From you Maildir inbox tag each message that has arrived that is spam .
Do this by pressing 't ' and an asterisk will appear by the messages .
After all of the messages have been tagged , press '; m ' and enter ~/ Maildir / MissedSpam and the spam messages in your inbox will be moved to the MissedSpam mailbox for training by spambayes .
When looking at the mail that it has classified as spam in ' ~ / Maildir / CaughtSpam ' , tag all of the messages it considered spam that were ham and press '; C ' and enter ~/ Maildir / MissedHam .
Now tag them again and press '; m ' and enter ~/ Maildir to move them into your inbox , where they should have been placed in the first place .
Of course all of this manual stuff is a huge pain so lets automate all of it in .muttrc .
.muttrc Configuration
This .muttrc file is going to save you a quazillion .. thats right a quiazalliona hours in productivity in dealing with our current setup .
Here it is : # Emacs is my editor of choice .
I have mostly read that people like # using emacs - client here and using an emacs server so that the # editing opens up in an existing emacs session but I prefer # loading up a fresh instance .
The default editor is some ' vi ' set editor = " emacs " #
Setting these macros is going to save us all of that time I was # talking about .
Now instead of having to type all of those # characters to move the mail around we will can just tag the messages # and , for the instance of spam in your inbox , hit ' S ' . #
Move mail to correct directories macro index S " ;s~/Maildir/.MissedSpam\r\r$\r " macro pager S " ;s~/Maildir/.MissedSpam\r\r$\r " macro index H " ;C~/Maildir/.MissedHam\r\r;s~/Maildir\r\r$\r " macro pager H " ;C~/Maildir/.MissedHam\r\r;s~/Maildir\r\r$\r " macro index M " ;s~/Maildir/\r " macro pager M " ;s~/Maildir/\r " #
This one lets me quickly move job search related emails to the # correct directory .
Want to give me a job ? :) macro index B " ;s~/Maildir/.Job\r\r$\r " macro pager B " ;s~/Maildir/.Job\r\r$\r #
This is how we are going to move around to the different # mailboxes .
Hitting ' alt - 1 ' will take us to our inbox # ' alt - 2 ' and we are looking at the mail Spambayes classified # as spam .
etc. #
The extra mailboxes I have in here are for mailing lists I am on .

New Mutt Commands
Here are the most useful ( as far as dealing with spam ) commands that we can now use in mutt : t Tag messages to be manipulated S Send message /s to spam training folder H Send message /s to ham training folder and to inbox alt - 1 Change mailbox to Maildir / ( inbox ) alt - 2 Change mailbox to .
CaughtSpam alt - 3 Change mailbox to .
Unsure alt - 8 Change mailbox to .
MissedSpam alt - 9 Change mailbox to .
MissedHam
So for example , if a couple of spam messages show up in your inbox you can now tag them and hit ' S ' ( remember its uppercase s ) and have them vanished into .
Missed Spam for training .
SquirrelMail Configuration
To configure SquirrelMail go into your html_base_directory / squirrelmail / config and run ./conf.pl .
Edit the options to fit your needs .
If you want to test your config cruise over to http://localhost/squirrelmail/src/configtest.php.
Now go to http://localhost/squirrelmail/ and login using your user account .
If you have any email in your in box you should see it after you log in .
Now click on the Folders option that is along the top , select all of the mailbox folders that we created earlier ( they are listed here because we prefixed them with a period ) , and click on subscribe .
Hit refresh and the mailboxes should be listed in the side panel .
Now you can use SquirrelMail for almost all of you mail needs including tagging messages and moving them to the correct folders for Spambayes training and checking on the mail that Spambayes has classified as spam and unsure .
The only functionality from our mutt setup that can't be duplicated in SquirrelMail is copying missed ham into its training folder and then moving it into your inbox .
This is due to the lack of copying ability .
So you will have to go into the ham training folder to see some of the mail that should be in your inbox .
!!!
IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE !!! - Using SquirrelMail like this is not secure !
Sending the plain text passwords that you use for your Unix account can be accessed by by a 3rd party , which would them access to your account .
You should set up a secure server with SSL and have Courier - imap use passwords that differ from the users system password using Courier Authlib , which I will demonstrate in the next session .
Excellent documents exist all over the net for setting up your web server with ssl .
Courier Authentication
Now is a good time to address a bit of essential security .
As of now when a user connects via the SquirrelMail or IMAP interface the passwords are being sent in plain text and if these are sniffed that users system account is compromised .
Without adding secure connections we can minimize the threat by using alternate passwords for imap connections .
The snoop would then have access to your mail , but not be able to log in to the system .
Edit your authdaemonrc file .
If your on Arch Linux this will be in /etc / authlib .
Under authmodulelist I commented out :
authmodulelist= " authpam authpwd authuserdb authshadow ... "
And replaced it with :
authmodulelist=" authuserdb "
I believe that adding authuserdb to the front of the list may work , but I am only using this method of authentication so it is all I need in my list .
Lets create the user account entry :
$ userdb " some_user_name " set home=/home/user_dir \ mail=/home/user_dir/Maildir \ uid=users_userid gid=users_groupid
$ userdbpw | userdb " some_user_name " set systempw
You will now be prompted for this pseudo users new password .
Next make sure that /etc / authlib / userdb has read / write / execute access for the owner .
If not chmod 700 /usr / authlib / userdb .
Now create the user database that courier is going to look to for authentication :
$ makeuserdb
Again look to using Postfix / TLS for a tunneling the connection through a secure connection .
Pop - before - smtp Configuration
To successfully configure pop -before - smtp follow the straight forward instructions in contrib / README .
QUICKINSTALL .
When you are done and everything is working it is important to make sure that you have not some how made your mail server an open relay !
This would cause your mail server to be flooded with traffic and be put on the open relay ban lists .
!!!
IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE !!! -
I will not use the pop - before - smtp method because it involves sending a password over an insecure connection .
Use Postfix through a SSL connection , Postfix / TLS , to accomplish this .
Since your local machines are likely already allowed to use your Postfix as a mail relay the only time that you would be using this method is from a non-trusted server where you password can be sniffed .
If you still choose to use this method make sure that you have changed the users courier password as described in Courier Authentication .
Additional Simple Procmail Recipes and Mailbox Config
If you are a member of any news letters / mailing lists you can have them automatically sorted to their own mailbox using Procmail .
First create the new mail directory in your ~/ Maildir directory .
Lets call it .
Sbayes and pretend that we are on the Spambayes mailing list .
So exactly as before with the spam related mailboxes :
mkdir -p ~/ Maildir /.Sbayes /{cur,new,tmp}
Now add this new rule to your ~/. procmailrc :
# spambayes-dev@python.org mailing list
:0
* ^X-BeenThere : spambayes@python.org
$ {MAILDIR} /. Sbayes /
In the .mutrc example above it shows an example of setting alt - 5 as the macro to see your Spambayes emails .
A slightly different method can be used to send spam and ham for training .
Adding the following lines will allow you to bounce spam messages to spam@localhost ( localhost or your mail_domain.com ) and ham messages to ham@localhost :
# Mail has been bounced to spam@localhost :0 * ^ Resent - To :.* spam $ {MAILDIR}/.MissedSpam # Mail has been bounced to ham@localhost :0 * ^ Resent - To :.* ham $ {MAILDIR}/.MissedHam
If you want to bounce messages to the spam and ham addresses like this , you will need to make sure that the headers stay intact .
Do not try using this or a similar technique for forwarding mails to an address because the email 's headers would not be intact and this is a large part of the spam classification .
This method works because above we specified spam and ham as aliases for hypexr in the Postfix aliases file .
Conclusion
For Arch Linux users ,
Add saslauthd authdaemond courier - imap postfix fetchmail to DAEMONS in your / etc/rc.conf file and they will be started automatically when your machine boots .
If you are running a web server have the httpd service listed after the services we are adding .
/etc/rc.conf
DAEMONS =(... saslauthd authdaemond postfix courier - imap fetchmail ...)
Enjoy your new mail system and centralized mailbox .
If you are handling a large number of users for you email system this is just the tip of the iceberg and you are going to mostly be interested in virtual users , security , and a system wide spam classifier .
There are many good documents on various setups to accomplish this , see the links section .

The government is funding the roll out of fingerprint security at the doors of pubs and clubs in major English cities .
Funding is being offered to councils that want to have their pubs keep a regional black list of known trouble makers .
The fingerprint network installed in February by South Somerset District Council in Yeovil drinking holes is being used as the showcase .
" The Home Office have looked at our system and are looking at trials in other towns including Coventry , Hull & Sheffield , " said Julia Bradburn , principal licensing manager at South Somerset District Council .
Gwent and Nottingham police have also shown an interest , while Taunton , a town neighbouring Yeovil , is discussing the installation of fingerprint systems in 10 pubs and clubs with the systems supplier CreativeCode .
Bradburn could not say if fingerprint security in Yeovil had displaced crime to neighbouring towns , but she noted that domestic violence had risen in Yeovil .
She could not give more details until the publication of national crime statistics to coincide with the anniversary of lax pub licensing laws on 24 November .
She was , however , able to say that alcohol - related crime had reduced by 48 per cent Yeovil between February and September 2006 .
The council had assumed it was its duty under the Crime and Disorder Act ( 1998 ) to reduce drunken disorder by fingerprinting drinkers in the town centre .
Some licensees were not happy to have their punters fingerprinted , but are all now apparently behind the idea .
Not only does the council let them open later if they join the scheme , but the system costs them only £ 1.50 a day to run .
Oh , and they are also coerced into taking the fingerprint system .
New licences stipulate that a landlord who does n't install fingerprint security and fails to show a " considerable " reduction in alcohol - related violence , will be put on report by the police and have their licences revoked .
Offenders can be banned from one pub or all of them for a specified time - usually a period of months - by a committee of landlords and police called Pub Watch .
Their offences are recorded against their names in the fingerprint system .
Bradburn noted the system had a " psychological effect " on offenders .
She said there had been only been two " major " instances of alcohol - related crime reported in Yeovil pubs and clubs since February .
One was a sexual assault in a club toilet .
The other occurred last Friday when an under - 18 Disco at Dukes nightclub got out of hand after the youngsters had obtained some alcohol from elsewhere .
A fight between two youngsters escalated into a brawl involving 435 12 to 16 year olds
A major incident is when 15 police attend the scene , said Bradburn .
She was unable to say how many minor incidents there had been , but acknowledged that fights were still occurring in the streets of Yeovil .
The Home Office paid for Yeovil 's system in full , with £ 6,000 of Safer , Stronger Communities funding .
Bradburn said the Home Office had paid her scheme a visit and subsequently decided to fund similar systems in Coventry , Hull and Sheffield .
The Home Office distanced itself from the plans .
It said it provided funding to Safer , Stronger Communities through the Department for Communities and Local Government 's Local Area Agreements .
How they spent the money was a local decision , said a HO spokeswoman . ®

United States Marine Corps seal
According to the New York Times " Congressional , military and Pentagon officials " said Thursday that it is expected an investigation will find that the deaths of more than 20 civilians in Iraq were a war crime .
According to NYT source a group of US Marines " carried out extensive , unprovoked killings of civilians " and the killings were " methodical in nature . "
The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is expected to call for criminal charges , including murder , negligent homicide , dereliction of duty and filing a false report .
Lawyers involved in discussion thought it could lead to charges of murder , an offense carrying the death penalty .
The incident happened in the Iraqi town of Haditha on November 19 , 2005 , after an attack on a convoy when one US marine was killed .
According to NYT source evidence indicates sustained operation by marines that lasted three to five hours .
Civilians , including women and children were killed inside two or more homes , as well as five men standing near a taxi at a checkpoint .
Military Officials initially indicated that 15 Iraqi civilians had died when gunmen attacked a convoy with a roadside bomb and small arms fire , prompting the Marines to return fire .
On Thursday , General Hagee , the commandant of the Marine Corps , said without referring to any specific incident " Recent serious allegations concerning actions of marines in combat have caused me concern " in a speech emphasizing the rules of lawful combat .
John Kline , a Representative from Minnesota ( R ) and retired Marine colonel said about the allegations " this was not an accident .
This was direct fire by marines at civilians " .
He continued " This was not an immediate response to an attack .
This would be an atrocity " .
John Sifton of Human Rights Watch said " If the accounts as they have been alleged are true , the Haditha incident is likely the most serious war crime that has been reported in Iraq since the beginning of the war " .
He continued " Here we have two dozen civilians being killed — apparently intentionally .
This is n't a gray area .
This is a massacre " .
The US Marines are from Camp Pendleton , located in southern California .
Three Marine officers , the battalion commander and two company commanders who were stationed in Haditha at the time , have been relieved of duty , although statements by military officials have not linked the action to the incident .

How I Like to Cut Onions – Dice or Slice
One of the most basic and fundamental tasks you will perform in the kitchen over and over again is cutting an onion .
There are so many recipes calling for diced , sliced and chopped onions .
Think about how many times you cut an onion each week and you ’ll understand why it is so important you learn how to do it safely and properly .
Below are two informative videos demonstrating the proper way to cut onions as well as a step - by - step description .
They show you a more effective and efficient way to cut an onion with less risk of cutting yourself .
The first one is from me and shows you how I like to dice an onion .
Tips to Consider When Dicing an Onion
I start by carefully cutting the onion in half longways .
By this I mean from the tip of the root to the tip of the bulb .
If I want the onion to sit firmly on the table so it does n’t move around when cutting in half , I might make a small , straight cut off the bulb end so I can sit the onion flat on the table .
This way I do n’t have to worry about the onion rolling around on me .
You do n’t cut from the root end because the root is what ’s going to keep the onion together when I make my dice cuts .
After cutting the onion in half , I peel all the outer layer skin off it .
Lay each onion half down on the cut side .
Carefully make 3 , 4 , or 5 cuts parallel to the table from the bulb end to the root end but do not cut all the way through .
The number of cuts will depend on the size of the onion and the size of the dice you are using .
Now carefully make cuts from the top of the onion half through the onion but do not cut all the way back to the root end .
Again , depending on how large or small you want the dice , make the appropriate number of cuts .
The more cuts you make both vertically and horizontally , the finer the dice .
When making the cuts parallel to the table , place your hand flat on top of the onion to keep it firmly in place and away from the blade .
When making the cuts from top to bottom , keep your fingers away from the blade .
One way is to curl them under and use your hand as a guide for the knife blade .
Remember – safety first .
Torrents are great , they are the best way to share large files with your friends , or even with people you do n't know at all .
But surprisingly enough , not many people create torrents when they need to share something .
I have " a lot of " friends who know how to download torrents , but when they need to send me their latest 200 MB vacation picture collection , they ask me to " get on msn " .
It ’s not that I have anything against msn ( although the file transfer sucks ) , but why do n’t just use BitTorrent ?
Especially if you want to send something to more than one person , or if you want to share high quality HDTV files , because then you can share the bandwidth .
So how do you do this ?
Well it ’s very simple .
Open your favorite BitTorrent client and do the magic trick :
file > create torrent
That ’s all ?
Well almost .
All you need to do now is put in the tracker info and tick some boxes .
This can differ somewhat from client to client but it all comes down to the same thing .
uTorrent
1. File > Create new Torrent ( or CTRL + N )
2. Select the files and or directories
3 . Trackers :
This is probably the hard part for most people .
But it ’s pretty easy , just put in one of the popular public trackers .
You can use one or more trackers , but in general one is enough .
Here are some good trackers you can use :
http://open.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
http://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce
udp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce
http://www.sumotracker.com/announce
Put one of these in the tracker box
4 . Do NOT tick the private torrent box ( unless you ’re using a private tracker )
5 . Save the torrent and send it to your friends
Bitcomet
1. File > Create Torrent ( or CTRL + M )
2. Select the files and or directories
3. Select “ enable public DHT network ” from the dropdown box
This way you can be your own tracker if the public tracker goes down .
4 . Tracker server and DHT node list
Again ,
This is probably the hard part for most people .
But it ’s pretty easy , just put in one of the popular public trackers .
You can use one or more trackers , but in general one is enough .
Here are some of the most popular trackers at the moment :
http://open.tracker.thepiratebay.org/announce
http://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce
http://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce
udp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce
http://www.sumotracker.com/announce
Put one of these in the tracker box
5 . Save the torrent and send it to your friends
Azureus
1. File > New Torrent ( or CTRL + N )
2. Tick “ use an external tracker ” .
And again ,
This is probably the hard part for most people .
But it ’s pretty easy , just put in one of the popular public trackers .
Here are some of the most popular trackers at the moment :
http://tracker.prq.to/announce
http://inferno.demonoid.com:3389/announce
http://tracker.bt-chat.com/announce
http://tracker.zerotracker.com:2710/announce
Put one of these in the tracker box
3 . Select single file or dicectory , click NEXT and point to the file or directory you want to share , and click NEXT
4 . Do NOT tick “ private torrent ”
5 . Do tick “ allow decentralized tracking ”
6 . Save the torrent and send it to your friends
Happy sharing .
Note that you do n’t need to upload the torrent to a website or a tracker .
This means you control who gets the file and who does n’t , and it wo n’t be visible to others !.

Herewith the story of my attempts to buy a Dora the Explorer Mr. Face Plush Backpack from ToysRUs using Google Checkout .
In short , Google now has my credit card number .
( It ’s one I use for testing , however ) .
It feels kind of odd , to be honest .
It seems Google is obviating the merchant entirely vis the ongoing data relationship with the buyer .
The registration screen states : “ ” Google ” will appear by the charge on your credit card statement .
Your card number will not be shared with the seller . ”
Why on earth would anyone want this to be the case ?
To lose your relationship with the buyer ?
What information * is* passed back to ToysRUs ?
What rights do I have to that information , and to know how it ’s used between Google and the merchant ?
I clicked on the TOS , which is here .
What I found noteworthy ( GPC is Google Payment Company , the company Google created to drive Checkout ) :
You acknowledge and agree that your purchases of Products are transactions between you and the Seller , and not with GPC , Google or any of GPC ’s affiliates .
GPC is not a party to your purchase of Products , and GPC , Google , or other GPC affiliates are not a buyer or a seller in connection with any Payment Transaction , unless expressly designated as such in the listing of the Product on a Google Web Site .
Also , found this :
You agree that you will not use the Service to process Payment Transactions for any Products that violate this Terms of Service , other policies or rules applicable to the Service , or applicable law .
The current policy that establishes the Products and other transactions that may not be paid for with the Service is provided here .
Failure to comply with these limitations may result in suspension or termination of your use of the Service .
A quick check of what Google finds not worth selling shows expected stuff , like porn and drugs , but also this :
Offensive goods
Literature , products or other materials that :
* Defame or slander any person or groups of people based on race , ethnicity , national origin , religion , sex , or other factors
* Encourage or incite violent acts
* Promote intolerance or hatred
Which I suppose means that you cannot use Google Checkout to buy a DVD of this or this .
In section 7 , they get to a privacy policy , which I read with interest , given my questions above .
I wonder if any more than a handful of folks ever read this policy , as it ’s a link inside a link inside a link , but here it is .
Noteworthy :
Google clearly states that its master privacy policy applies .
That can be found here .
( Now that ’s a link inside a link inside a link inside a link … ) .
So to recap what Google can do with your information under that policy :
* Providing our products and services to users , including the display of customized content and advertising ;
* Auditing , research and analysis in order to maintain , protect and improve our services ;
* Ensuring the technical functioning of our network ; and
* Developing new services .
…. We may process personal information to provide our own services .
In some cases , we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party , such as our advertising partners .
…. We have a good faith belief that access , use , preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to ( a ) satisfy any applicable law , regulation , legal process or enforceable governmental request , ( b ) enforce applicable Terms of Service , including investigation of potential violations thereof , ( c ) detect , prevent , or otherwise address fraud , security or technical issues , or ( d ) protect against imminent harm to the rights , property or safety of Google , its users or the public as required or permitted by law .
Whew .
OK , back to the Checkout specific policy terms :
They collect a lot of data on you , and they keep it in one place – your Google Account .
That ’s pretty much what I expected .
All your reg info goes there ( credit card , address , etc ) and then Google reserves the right to add third party data ( credit reporting agencies , for example ) and – here ’s the nub :
… Transaction information – When you use Google Checkout to conduct a transaction , we collect information about each transaction , including the transaction amount , a description provided by the seller of the goods or services being purchased , the names of the seller and buyer , and the type of payment used .
Nowhere does it say that this information is shared back to the merchants .
Were I a merchant , I ’d be very wary of this .
Now , here ’s the thing that might make you think .
Once you start a data trail in Checkout , it stays for good , at least , it stays as long as Google wants it to :
You can disable Google Checkout by contacting us .
If you do so , your payment information and transaction history will no longer be viewable through Google Checkout .
However , in order to meet our reporting and auditing obligations , and to detect , deter , and prevent fraud or other misconduct on our systems , the information will be retained in our systems .
If you disable Google Checkout , your personally identifiable information will not be used by Google or shared with third parties except for these purposes .
We may delete these records over time if permitted or required by law .
Disabling Google Checkout does not close or cancel your Google Account .
For more information about how to manage your Google Account preferences , please click here .
This Privacy Policy continues to apply to the personal information we maintain after you disable Google Checkout or close or cancel your Google Account .
Put another way , do n’t step in the mud if you do n’t want the tracks to stay forever .
Lastly , federal law does interfere with Google using your info in certain marketing - related ways , and the privacy policy allows you to opt out .
Details :
We operate the Google Checkout service through a company called Google Payment Corporation ( “ GPC ” ) , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Google .
The information we collect , including information obtained from third parties , is shared between GPC and Google to operate the service .
Neither GPC nor Google will share your information with others except as described in this Privacy Policy .
Under federal law , you have the right to opt out of certain sharing between affiliated companies such as GPC and Google .
Specifically , you may choose to opt out of :
* The sharing between GPC and Google of information that does not pertain to your transactions or experiences with Google Checkout ( also called “ non-transactional information ” , e.g. , information we may obtain from third parties to verify your identity ) , and
* The use by Google of information shared between GPC and Google to promote Google products and services .
Please remember , regardless of whether you choose to opt out of this sharing or not , we will never sell or rent your personal information , and we will not share your personal information with anyone outside of GPC and Google except as described in this Privacy Policy .
If you do n’t want us to share non-transactional data between GPC and Google , please click here ( this is a email address ) .
If you do n’t want us to use any information shared between GPC and Google to promote Google products and services to you , please click here .
( also an email , I sent both of them mail and asked to opt out ) .
OK , so I have now read ( or re-read ) three separate privacy policies , and it ’s time to complete my purchase .
I hit “ agree ” and , still on Google ’s servers , get the confirmation page , hit “ sign in ” again and … shit , it ’s not working !
What did I do wrong ?
I head over to where they tell me to go – https://www.google.com/accounts/ForgotPasswd – and give them the email I use for my Google account .
( It worked before , to log me in in the first place , very odd ! ) .
I reset my password , and now … where do I go ?
There ’s not a screen inviting me back to complete my purchase !
There ’s no way to get back to my order !
My daughter ’s beloved Dora the Explorer Mr. Face Plush Backpack from ToysRUs is totally MIA !
Hmmm .
I sign into my Google Checkout account , maybe that will have the purchase history .
After all , they had all the information – but no .
While Google did manage to capture and save my credit card info , there ’s no history of my attempt to purchase the Dora backpack .
Hmmm .
How about I use my Firefox history to go back to the original page where my account did not work in the first place !
( Not that this is something most shoppers would ever do , but … ) .
Hey , that should work !
Nope .
“ Oops !
Your shopping cart has expired . ”
Shit .
So I ’m starting over .
No , wait , this has been way too much of a trial .
I ’ll get back to it later .
Or , I ’ll just go to Amazon .
Sorry Google , but mark this one in your metadata as “ abandoned cart . ”

It was the year corporate and university data spills just kept coming , and the Supreme Court decided technology companies can be held responsible for the bad behavior of their users .
Big firms lined up to help repressive governments ; governments helped themselves to private phone calls and e-mail .
A medical miracle transformed , overnight , into heartbreaking scandal .
On balance the tech world 's triumphs far outweighed its failures in 2005 .
But those who do n't write top - 10 lists about the passing year are doomed to repeat its mistakes .
So here 's our pick for the year 's nastiest moments in technology .
TiVo boxes betray their owners :
Yeah , we already knew in theory that TiVo was granting cable providers the power to block or expire our pay - per - view recordings at will .
But that did n't prepare us for the shock of seeing free TV like King of the Hill , or , here at Wired News , a Lost rerun , suddenly marked with a bright red flag and a stern notice that our saved show would be deleted in a week whether we liked it or not .
The PVR - maker explained the September spate of rebellious TiVos as a glitch : the newly deployed Macrovision self - destruct mechanism was intended for use on premium content only , but had been accidentally triggered by noisy cable TV lines for a handful of customers .
That 's plausible enough , and no repeat offenses have been sighted since the company pushed a software fix .
But the real damage is the liquefaction of TiVo 's bedrock promise : that it would give consumers control of what we watch and when .
We 've now seen with our own eyes how the company has handed the sinuous , hourglass - shaped remote to the same content industry that tried to keep Sony from selling the VCR .

But when ICANN decided to carve out a new one for adult content , a Christian group called the Family Research Council saw red , predicting the move would double the amount of smut available online , and , in the words of council attorney Patrick Trueman , " the porn industry would become twice the menace it is today . "
When conservative groups start using the word " menace , " look out .
Prompted by a flood of mail from the Republican base , Michael Gallagher , assistant secretary at the U.S. Commerce Department , drafted a letter to ICANN chairman Vint Cerf asking for the new domain to be delayed .
It was , and in that moment any illusion that the internet 's critical domain - name system was immune from U.S. political whims evaporated .
Gallagher 's meddling in what was supposed to be a technical decision by an impartial body added fuel to an international diplomatic rebellion against the United States ' unique role in internet stewardship , and an ill - conceived proposal to put the net under multilateral control was narrowly curbed on the eve of a U.N. summit in November .
But it 's a small price to pay to keep smut peddlers in their place – or , really , out of their place .
In any case , the Family Research Council has moved onto other menaces , like gay marriage and the threatening practice of retailers saying " Happy Holidays " instead of " Merry Christmas . "
PayPal blocks Katrina aid : PayPal has always been a little squirrelly – fraud - wary to a fault and quick to lock up other people 's money .
But the service hit a new low in 2005 when it froze an account created by the proprietor of the popular Something Awful website to gather donations for Hurricane Katrina victims .
PayPal delayed the transfer of over $ 25,000 to the American Red Cross .
What did it think ?
That the Red Cross was trying to scam it ?
We do n't know – the eBay - owned service declined to explain itself at the time , citing " privacy concerns . "
Space shuttle Discovery : Nearly 2.5 years after a flying chunk of foam insulation triggered the Columbia disaster , NASA got a new shuttle off the ground – and within seconds , a flying chunk of foam insulation ripped off one of its fuel tanks .
This time the debris did n't hit the spacecraft 's hull , and the mission was ultimately a success .
But NASA was forced to bench the program , and a review panel went on to slam the agency for slipshod work .
In December NASA announced its plan to fix the problem and try again in 2006 .
We 'd rather they do something interesting , or safe .
__Bush corrupts the NSA : __
It 's hard to be surprised by the revelation that this president ordered the long - term warrantless surveillance of U.S. citizens ' international phone calls and e-mail , but it is sad to see the National Security Agency at the heart of the scandal .
After the 1975 Church Committee hearings exposed domestic spying abuses at NSA and elsewhere , the agency seemed to reform itself nicely , to the point that even some former critics spoke well of its ethics and professionalism – if not its fading technological glory .
NSA 's information - assurance branch emerged as a serious and respected voice in the computer - security community , even developing and releasing the source code to its own secure version of Linux .
And when the 1998 film Enemy of the State cast the Puzzle Palace as villains , then - NSA director and Air Force general Michael Hayden led the agency into its own era of glasnost , publicly explaining its charter and acknowledging the mistakes of the past .
Today you can visit the NSA kids page , where Disney - esque cartoon characters will walk you through code - breaking Flash games , or catch the agency at a tech conference screening its own dramatic anti-cyberterror mini-films .
One stars Sylvester Stallone .
Now Hayden , in his new role as deputy director of national intelligence , is most easily identified as the man standing behind the White House podium alongside torture - memo author Alberto Gonzales to defend Bush 's lawless surveillance order .
The other unheralded victims of the administration 's hubris : new U.S. college graduates hoping to serve their country in the high - tech spy biz , who are rapidly running out of career options that do n't demand a sacrifice of long - held American principles .
Do you join the NSA to illegally spy on U.S. citizens , or the CIA to help run the secret Eastern European torture prisons ?
The National Reconnaissance Office has never looked so good .

The blogosphere 's dark places ; Apple sues journalists while Yahoo helps jail them .
Hwang Woo - suk 's fall :
In May , Hwang published what seemed to be a breakthrough research paper in the journal Science showing how he and his team at Seoul National University successfully cloned 11 embryonic stem - cell lines , each genetically matched to an individual patient .
The paper seemed to mark a giant leap toward the ability to grow replacement tissue for patients with failing organs or spinal - cord damage .
Then the scandals started .
First , it came out that Hwang misrepresented the source of the eggs used in the experiment , some of which came from paid donors and staff members , raising ethical issues .
Then in December , paper co-author Roh Sung Il accused Hwang of faking the results for nine of the 11 stem cells .
Hwang , who was hospitalized for stress , has acknowledged " fatal errors " in the paper and asked for its withdrawal .
The jury is still out on what went wrong here , but with Hwang 's earlier genetic triumph , the world 's first cloned dog , now being tugged into the investigation , we 're starting to despair .
Et tu , Snuppy ?
The Sony rootkit :
As if there were n't enough paths into our Windows machines already , now we have to worry about malware coming in on the new Neil Diamond CD ( What ?

Sony BMG 's endless problems with its digital rights management schemes , and then its botched efforts to set things right , were an early Christmas gift for DRM opponents .
But when the smoke and lawsuits clear , we may be stuck with settlements that give consumers nothing more than longer and more verbose click - wrap license agreements – a lump of coal if we ever saw one .
Yahoo helps China imprison a dissident :
When it comes to Western tech firms appeasing China 's repressive government , Microsoft 's " seven words you can't say on a Chinese blog " routine is a hard act to follow .
But Yahoo brought down the house when it helped Beijing track a dissident journalist who used the company 's services to forward a government censorship order to a New York website .
Shi Tao , 37 , was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison as a result .
Apple attacks bloggers : Steve Jobs got 2005 off to a litigious start by suing the Mac enthusiast site Think Secret for scooping Apple on some product announcements , while two other sites with similar track records , AppleInsider and PowerPage , found themselves fighting company subpoenas aimed at unmasking their confidential sources .
In a pitched court battle , Apple argued that bloggers are n't journalists and therefore do n't have a right to protect anonymous tipsters .
The county judge hearing the latter case went further and said even mainstream reporters can't get away with revealing corporate secrets – a decision that 's now under appeal .
Accused killer blogs his descent into madness :
In his first blog entry in January 2004 , convicted sexual predator Joseph Duncan wrote that he was taking up blogging to document his comings and goings , in case he was " falsely accused of some crime or another . "
Indeed .
By May of 2005 Duncan was a fugitive from fresh child molestation charges , but he did n't stop blogging , and police watched helplessly as the 42 - year - old computer programmer 's posts grew increasingly fraught and disturbed .
A May 11 entry titled " The Demons Have Taken Over " was typical .
" I am scared , alone and confused , and my reaction is to strike out toward the perceived source of my misery , society , " Duncan wrote .
" My intent is to harm society as much as I can , then die . "
Four days later the brutalized bodies of 40 - year - old Brenda Groene , her son Slade and her boyfriend Mark McKenzie were found at Groene 's home near Coeur d'Alene , Idaho .
Duncan turned up nearly a month later at a 24 - hour diner just a few miles from the murder site , in the company of Groene 's 8 - year - old daughter Shasta , who had been missing since the attack .
Duncan was arrested and charged with the Idaho murders , and is now suspected of having abducted and killed Shasta 's 9 - year - old brother Dylan as well .
After Duncan 's arrest , netizens spontaneously converged on his blog and occupied its comment system , filling it with a thousand messages angrily condemning Duncan , praising law enforcement or sending thoughts and prayers to Shasta and her surviving family members .
By winter only the detritus remained .
The most recent comments are all message board spam for low - cost mortgages , travel sites , sex dolls and Viagra .
Isaac
Hayes did not participate in the new episode
The opening episode of the 10th series , screened in the US on Wednesday , appeared to be a satire on Scientology .
Hayes , a Scientologist , quit the animated comedy after a different episode ridiculed the religion .
In the new show , Chef is brainwashed by the " Super Adventure Club " - thought to be a veiled reference to Scientology .
The other characters are angry at " that fruity little club for scrambling his brains " .
Patched together
Hayes did not participate in the episode but his lines were apparently patched together from previous recordings .
Chef arrives after travelling the world with the Super Adventure Club and repeatedly tells the children he wants to " make sweet love " to them .
The children take him to a psychiatrist and then a strip club , where he remembers his love for women and is cured .
But he is brainwashed by the Super Adventure Club again - before falling off a bridge and being burned , stabbed and mauled by a lion and a grizzly bear .
' Hurt and confused '
At his funeral , one of the children says : " A lot of us do n't agree with the choices the Chef has made in the last few days .
" Some of us feel hurt and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us .
" But we can't let the events of the past few weeks take away the memories of how Chef made us smile . "
Isaac Hayes was admitted to hospital with exhaustion in January
But co-creator Matt Stone said : " In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park , Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians , Muslim , Mormons or Jews .
" He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show . "
US TV network Comedy Central then pulled a different episode , which mocked Tom Cruise and more explicitly lampooned Scientology .
That prompted rumours that Cruise had demanded that the episode be dropped , which were denied by his representatives .
Hayes , 63 , was admitted to hospital with exhaustion in January .
A selection of cartoons from the media of seven Arab countries ( Jordan , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Oman , Bahrain , Syria and Egypt ) and from the Palestinian Authority is displayed below .
A number of these countries are regarded as moderate or allied to the West .
Most print media in the Arab world are under the full or partial control of the ruling regimes .
The cartoon above , clearly depicting the railroad to the death camp at Auschwitz - Birkenau – but with Israeli flags replacing the Nazi ones – is from the Jordanian newspaper Ad - Dustur ( October 19 , 2003 ) .
The sign in Arabic reads : “ Gaza Strip or the Israeli Annihilation Camp . ”
This accentuates the widespread libel that Israel ’s policies towards the Palestinians have been comparable to Nazi actions towards Jews .
Jordan is supposedly a moderate country at peace with Israel .
In this cartoon , from Al - Watan newspaper in Qatar ( June 23 , 2002 ) , Ariel Sharon is shown watching on the sidelines as an Israeli plane crashes into New York ’s World Trade Center .
The Arabic words alongside the Twin Towers are “ The Peace . ”
This cartoon restates the widely held myth in the Arab world that Israel and the Jews were responsible for the 9/11 attacks which were in fact of course carried out by al - Qaeda .
The cartoon above , from Arab News ( April 10 , 2002 ) , shows Ariel Sharon wielding a swastika - shaped axe to chop up Palestinian children .
Arab News is a Saudi - based English language daily which is supposedly one of the Arab world ’s more moderate papers .
In September 2005 , at a time when non-Arab Moslem - majority states like Pakistan and Afghanistan were making peace overtures to Israel , even supposedly moderate Arab states like Qatar were continuing their anti-Semitic approach .
Above , Israeli jets over Gaza form a swastika in this cartoon published on September 27 , 2005 in Al - Watan ( Qatar ) .
This cartoon from the Internet site of Omayya Joha , portrays an Israeli soldier who , having chopped off the foot of a Palestinian man , holds up a bloody hand to the camera and orders “ No photographs . ”
Omayya Joha is one of the staff cartoonists employed by Al - Hayat Al - Jadeeda , the Palestinian Authority ’s official daily newspaper .
Her cartoons continue to regularly appear in the official Palestinian press .
Above , Ariel Sharon is shown sitting in a large cup overflowing with blood .
This cartoon , also by Omayya Joha , appeared in Al - Hayat Al - Jadeeda , the Palestinian Authority ’s official daily newspaper , on April 22 , 2003 .
In this cartoon , from Al - Watan ( Oman ) ( August 10 , 2002 ) , Jewish acts are equated with those of the Nazis .
This Nazi - type anti-Semitic caricature of a Jew has a hooked nose , a hunched back , has no shoes , and is sweating .
In the above cartoon , from Akhbar Al - Khalij ( Bahrain ) ( June 10 , 2002 ) , the anti-Semitic caricature of a Jew on the right says : “ Say : ‘ I hate the Arabs ! ’ ” and American president George W. Bush , made to resemble a parrot , repeats : “ I hate the Arabs , I hate the Arabs . ”
Above , another cartoon from the Internet site of official Palestinian Authority cartoonist Omayya Joha , showing alleged Jewish control ( in the form of snakes ) of the United States .
The snake was often used to portray Jews in historic European anti-Semitic images .
This cartoon , from May 13 , 2005 ( a month when many western papers were claiming that the Palestinian Authority media had adopted a more moderate tone ) , shows a Jew impaling the northern region of a map of the Islamic world with the flag of Israel , with blood spurting out .
At the lower end is what seems to be an Arab man hanging upside down , holding a white flag of surrender .
This cartoon appeared in Al - Hayat Al - Jadeeda , the official daily newspaper of the Palestinian Authority .
This cartoon , from the Syrian newspaper Al - Ahram ( May 29 , 2002 ) , shows an anti-Semitic caricature of a Jew with a long beard and hooked nose , fuelling the “ World Media ” with “ Zionist Media ” propaganda , while in the background bombs are falling on the Moslem al - Aqsa shrine on Jerusalem ’s Temple Mount .
This cartoon stereotypes Jews , repeats the anti-Semitic myth that the Jews control the world media , and adds the lie that the Israeli government has damaged the al - Aqsa complex on the Temple Mount .
The cartoon above , with text in English designed for a foreign audience , was posted on the official website of the Palestinian Authority State Information Center on April 6 , 2003 .
The Palestinian Authority State Information Center regularly posts ugly anti-Israel and anti-American cartoons , including this reiteration of the anti-Semitic blood libel that Jews kill non-Jewish children .
The cartoon above , from the Egyptian weekly Al - Ahram al - Arabi ( June 8 , 2002 ) , shows not only members of the Likud party murdering Arabs , but long - time Labor Party leader and Israeli “ dove ” Shimon Peres standing aside and applauding with bloody hands .
Egypt is the second highest recipient of U.S. aid in the world .
The U.S. senate has approved a $ 1.84 billion aid package for Egypt for 2006 .
This cartoon is from Al - Watan ( Qatar ) , May 13 , 2003 .
The U.S. and Israel are shown eating from two sides of an apple that represents “ the Arab states ” .
This cartoon is also noteworthy since it was published in Qatar , home to the influential Al Jazeera TV network .
Qatar is considered by many in the U.S. State Department to be a U.S. ally and a relatively moderate state .
The cartoon above , from Arab News , depicts rats wearing Stars of David and skullcaps .
They scurry backwards and forwards through holes in the wall of a building called “ Palestine House . ”
Arab News , an English - language daily widely read by expats in Saudi Arabia , is widely - regarded as a moderate publication .
It is published by a state - owned Saudi corporation .
The imagery in the cartoon may well be inspired by a well - known scene from the Nazi film “ Jew Suess , ” to which it bears a close resemblance – a scene in which Jews are depicted as vermin to be eradicated by mass extermination .

Researchers have found that the curry spice turmeric holds real potential for the treatment and prevention of prostate cancer , particularly when combined with certain vegetables .
The scientists tested turmeric , also known as curcumin , along with phenethyl isothiocyanate ( PEITC ) , a naturally occurring substance particularly abundant in a group of vegetables that includes watercress , cabbage , winter cress , broccoli , Brussels sprouts , kale , cauliflower , kohlrabi and turnips .
PEITC and curcumin , alone or in combination , demonstrate significant cancer - preventive qualities in laboratory mice , and the combination of PEITC and curcumin could be effective in treating established prostate cancers .
The discovery was announced in the Jan. 15 issue of the journal Cancer Research by Kong and his colleagues at Rutgers ’ Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy .
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States , with a half - million new cases appearing each year .
The incidence and mortality of prostate cancer have not decreased in past decades despite tremendous efforts and resources devoted to treatment .
This is because advanced prostate cancer cells are barely responsive even to high concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy .
The authors noted that in contrast to the high incidence of prostate cancer in the United States , the incidence of this disease is very low in India .
This has been attributed to the dietary consumption of large amounts of plant - based foods rich in phytochemicals – nonnutritive plant chemicals that have protective or disease - preventive properties .
Consequently , scientists have been investigating intervention options based on compounds found in edible and medicinal plants .
They have had some success , and a majority of patients with prostate cancer are now combining the conventional therapies with these compounds as alternative , supplementary or complementary medications .
For Kong ’s study , researchers used mice bred so that their immune systems would not reject foreign biological material and injected the mice with cells from human prostate cancer cell lines to grow tumors against which the compounds could be tested .
“ Despite convincing data from laboratory cell cultures , we knew little about how PEITC and curcumin would perform in live animals , especially on prostate cancer , ” Kong said .
“ So we undertook this study to evaluate how effective PEITC and curcumin might be – individually and in combination – to prevent and possibly treat prostate cancer . ”
The researchers injected the mice with curcumin or PEITC , alone or in combination , three times a week for four weeks , beginning a day before the introduction of the prostate cancer cells .
They found the injections significantly retarded the growth of cancerous tumors .
Using PEITC and curcumin in tandem produced even stronger effects .
The group went on to evaluate the therapeutic potential of curcumin and PEITC in mice with well - established tumors , and the results showed that PEITC or curcumin alone had little effect , whereas the combination of curcumin and PEITC significantly reduced tumor growth .

The paper , “ Combined Inhibitory Effects of Curcumin and Phenethyl Isothiocyanate on the Growth of Human PC - 3 Prostate Xenografts in Immunodeficient Mice , ” will be available at January 15th issue of Cancer Research
Let 's hear from an habitual perpetrator , in his own words ... " when showing visitors around the property they say , what are those little red oval berries ?
Are they edible ? '
So we give them a taste and admit they are pretty insignificant .
Then when we get to a lime tree we announce .
This is a special Jambolana Lime — very sweet !'
Disbelief is in their eyes , because they 've got lime trees in their gardens , and they can't see any difference — and there is n't !
So we snip off a fat green lime , cut it in half and say .
Try it . '
There 's a tentative lick , then an incredulous smile , then more licks .
Everyone wants to taste it .
' Wonderful , where did you get it ?
Did you grow it from seed ?
Or was it grafted ?
Will you let us have some scions ?
Will you make a marcotte for us ? '
Etc. , and so the hoax goes on . "
And so Jack Rolley of Jambolana Farm in Tahiti boasts of his habitual duplicity .
Even a founder of the Rare Fruit Council , William Whitman , admits to falling for the sweet lime trick .
In 1952 , he was being given a tour of the Panama Canal Zone Summit Gardens by the Director , W. R. Lindsay , when they encountered a five foot bush , covered with small , dark green leaves and attractive red fruit about the size of olives .
Sampling a couple of the berries , Mr. Whitman found them rather nondescript , and they moved to the next specimen , a Key lime which Director Lindsay asserted was a wonderful and very rare sweet lime .
After some urging to sample it , Mr. Whitman tasted this lime and found it absolutely living up to its advance billing — incredibly sweet and delicious .
Only after eating several more of these delightful sweet limes did he finally ask for information .
Has this happened to you , or someone you know ?
I certainly hope so — because that kind of magical , although admittedly duplicitous , experience is one not easily forgotten .
And it should make you into an enthusiastic devotee — although NOT of the " sweet lime " , which still , at this writing , dwells amongst unicorns and other mythical beasts — but of the small red berries that are the real heroes of this tale .
Members of the Rare Fruit Council should be much more familiar than the general public with these red berries , which are most commonly called the Miracle Fruit ; and seldom was a common name more correct !
No one knows for sure when the first person made the discovery about the taste reversing properties ... but it was probably many centuries ago .
The plant was discovered in West Africa , where the native diet revolved around a few basic foods , none of which were remotely sweet .
Their soups and porridges were sour , their crude cornbread sour , their fermented palm beer and wine extremely sour .
Sweeteners were at a premium .
Can you imagine the delight of these people when someone ate a few red berries and later ate a meal of these foods , to find everything suddenly sweet and very palatable ?
One hopes that the connection was made right away !
This practice was first reported in 1725 by the French explorer Des Marchais , although he made no recorded attempt to name the fruit or describe it fully .
This West African wonder was not botanically identified and named until the middle of the 19th century as Synsepalum dulcificum , a member of the Sapotaceae family , relative of the sapodilla ( Manilkara zapota ) .
In the Pharmaceutical Journal , Vol. Xl , published in 1852 , Dr. W. F. Daniell called it the " miraculous berry " .
He was stationed at an outpost in West Africa , and described the taste - reverse properties in great detail .
Contemporary botanists were very naturally excited by his writings and possibilities for commercial exploitation were eagerly discussed .
A great deal of time , thought , planning , dreaming , and money have been spent on that very idea during the last century and a half .
Yet the general public is still unaware of this rare fruit and the effect it could have on enhancing the quality of their lifestyle .
One of the first problems encountered was that the berries are perishable , and once picked , last but a few days .
In their native habitat , two large crops are available yearly , each after a rainy season .
The mature bushes , which can reach 20 feet , usually have a few fruits hanging around all year .
Methods of shipment in the last century were not conducive to marketing the fruits and cultivation of the plants in other countries was also unsuccessful .
However , a few very rare plants made it around the globe — such as to Summit Gardens , Plant Introduction Station in Panama , where one hundred years later , their encounter with one very dedicated fruit enthusiast has made all the difference for their future in the diets of people everywhere .
Space does not permit many details in the most extensive — and most expensive — endeavour to introduce and market the miracle fruit .
Please refer to the magazine , " Horticulture " , January 1985 , where author Nathaniel Tripp more fully delves into this mid 1970 's entrepreneurial disaster , involving dedicated dreamers , horticultural expertise , brilliant marketing ideas , millions of dollars ( private , corporate , and governmental ) , thorough research , countless hours in laboratories , greenhouses , fields and offices , industrial espionage , propaganda and frightener techniques , thousands of miles of air travel , foot - weary jungle exploration , shrewd native peoples ... in short , everything needed for a Hollywood block buster !
In a nutshell , although the miracle fruit had been proven to be absolutely and totally safe in the most thorough testing done on every thing from guinea pigs to school children , the company set up to market the fruit and its taste reversing property , Miraculin , was denied crucial FDA approval .
This was quite ironically , on the eve of its major introduction into the marketplace , and after ongoing communication with the Food and Drug Administration that had always seemed positive and optimistic .
Consumers are rarely cognizant of the life - and - death struggle going on in the food industry ; and nowhere is the battle more bloody than when it comes to sweetening our food .
Cane sugar alone is a multi-billion - dollar , international industry .
And when it comes to artificial sweeteners ... we are talking major war !
The lovely and graceful branches of Synsepalum dulcificum are hardly material to fashion weapons of battle .
But for a while there , diabetics , dentists , the overweight , children and all of us who crave our sweets with no retribution were very close to a major improvement in lifestyle .
There are no artificial sweeteners proven absolutely safe .
( Although THEY are FDA - approved . )
They are used with fingers crossed .
Sugar and other " natural " sweeteners are hardly to be considered as food with no ill effects .
Hundreds of pounds per person are consumed yearly in more foods that we can suspect or easily detect .
A teaspoonful in every tablespoonful of ketchup , for example !
Anyone with knowledge of diabetes will comprehend the power of sugar in the diet , with the dangers of this disease to include blindness , stroke , dizziness , blackouts , coma , painful neuropathy , kidney failure , amputation and death .
Ask a diabetic about the difficulty of balancing — or detecting — sugar in his diet ; an imbalance can prove to have disastrous results .
Ask any little kid in the dentist 's chair about the sugar that caused his cavities .
Ask any one of us " civilized " folks who could stand to lose a few pounds about the difficulty of resisting the onslaught of advertising designed to make us eat sugar in some form or the other .
Studies have shown human beings crave and need sugar from earliest infancy .
We need it for growth and energy .
But only up to a point — most of us , being human , overindulge ; and thereby pay the price .

Dear John ,
I remain enthusiastic about the benefits of licensing Mac technology .
Currently I think the following companies are the best choices :
Northern Telecom -- a separate letter copied to NT describes my thinking here .
This is a first class company .
Motorola -- their Four - Phase subsidiary is committed to the 68000 .
They are n't doing well .
Their direct sales force is good but not so large that it will threaten the retail channel .
Motorola loves the Macintosh and being in partnership with your chip designer is a natural .
AT&T -- I know you are working on this .
The key is that their 68000 UNIX PC is not selling .
They need a way to make Mac software run on their box .
They will confuse things by trying to involve UNIX in the discussion .
The mac interface should be viewed as a separate application interface that they can put on top of UNIX if they want .
They will have to change the disk drive in the current UNIX PC .
I believe that will be the only hardware change required .
We recently sent Chris Larson down to discuss making your 3.5 " disk compatible with MS - DOS .
Unfortunatley the people he talked to did n't agree with us on the importance .
I want to help in any way I can with the licensing .
Please give me a call .
Best regards ,

Re : Apple Licensing of Mac Technology
cc : Jon Shirley
Apple 's stated position in personal computers is innovative technology leader .
This position implies that Apple must create a standard on new , advanced technology .
They must establish a " revolutionary " architecture , which necessarily implies new development incompatible with existing architectures .
Apple must make Macintosh a standard .
But no personal computer company , not even IBM , can create a standard without independent support .
Even though Apple realized this , they have not been able to gain the independent support required to be perceived as a standard .
The significant investment ( especially independent support ) in a " standard personal computer " results in an incredible momentum for its architecture .
Specifically , the IBM PC architecture continues to receive huge investment and gains additional momentum .
( Though clearly the independent investment in the Apple II , and the resulting momentum , is another great example . )
The investment in the IBM architecture includes development of differentiated compatibles , software and peripherals ; user and sales channel education ; and most importantly , attitudes and perceptions that are not easily changed .
Any deficiencies in the IBM architecture are quickly eliminated by independent support .
Hardware deficiencies are remedied in two ways :
expansion cards made possible because of access to the bus ( e.g. the high resolution Hercules graphics card for monochrome monitors )
manufacture of differentiated compatibles ( e.g. the Compaq portable , or the faster DeskPro ) .
The closed architecture prevents similar independent investment in the Macintosh .
The IBM architecture , when compared to the Macintosh , probably has more than 100 times the engineering resources applied to it when investment of compatible manufacturers is included .
The ratio becomes even greater when the manufacturers of expansion cards are included .
Conclusion :
As the independent investment in a " standard " architecture grows , so does the momentum for that architecture .
The industry has reached the point where it is now impossible for Apple to create a standard out of their innovative technology without support from , and the resulting credibility of other personal computer manufacturers .
Thus , Apple must open the Macintosh architecture to have the independent support required to gain momentum and establish a standard .
The Mac has not become a standard
The Macintosh has failed to attain the critical mass necessary for the technology to be considered a long term contender :
a . Since there is no " competition " to Apple from " Mac- compatible " manufacturers , corporations consider it risky to be locked into the Mac , for reasons of price AND choice .
b.
Apple has reinforced the risky perception of the machine by being slow to come out with software and hardware improvements ( e.g. hard disk , file server , bigger screen , better keyboard , larger memory , new ROM , operating software with improved performance ) .
Furthermore , killing the Macintosh X/L ( Lisa ) eliminated the alternative model that many businesses considered necessary .
c. Recent negative publicity about Apple hinders the credibility of the Macintosh as a long term contender in the personal computer market .
d. Independent software and hardware manufacturers reinforced the risky perception of the machine by being slow to come out with key software and peripheral products .
e . Apple 's small corporate account sales force has prevented it from having the presence , training , support , etc. that large companies would recognize and require .
f. Nationalistic pressures in European countries often force foreign to consumers [ sic ] choose local manufacturers .
Europeans have local suppliers of the IBM architecture , but not Apple .
Apple will lose ground in Europe as was recently exhibited in France .
Recommendation
Apple should license Macintosh technology to 3 - 5 significant manufacturers for the development of " Mac Compatibles " :
United States manufacturers and contacts : ideal companies --- in addition to credibility , they have large account sales forces that can establish the Mac architecture in larger companies : AT&T , James Edwards Wang , An Wang Digital Equipment Corporation , Ken Olsen Texas Instruments , Jerry Junkins Hewlett Packard , John Young
other companies ( but perhaps more realistic candidates ) : Xerox , Elliott James or Bob Adams Motorola , Murray A. Goldman Harris / Lanier , Wes Cantrell NBI , Thomas S. Kavanagh Burroughs , W. Michael Blumenthal and Stephen Weisenfeld Kodak 3M CPT
European manufacturers Siemens Bull Olivetti Phillips
Apple should license the Macintosh technology to US and European companies in a way that allows them to go to other companies for manufacturing .
Sony , Kyocera , and Alps are good candidates for OEM manufacturing of Mac compatibles .
Microsoft is very willing to help Apple implement this strategy .
We are familiar with the key manufacturers , their strategies and strengths .
We also have a great deal of experience in OEMing system software .
Rationale
月末までメンテしないと言いつつ気になってちょくちょく手直ししています。前回遅延が長すぎて話すのが大変だったので、音質を犠牲にしても遅延を減らしてみました。WikiPhone の使い方については先日の日記で書きましたが、コンセプトについてちょっとだけ書きます。
WikiPhone は VoIP に必要な機能のうち、通話以外の機能を取り除き、通信に HTTP を利用した物です 。
通話以外の機能、例えば特定の個人を呼び出す方法は用意されていません。そんな事で使い物になるのかって？私たちは人を呼び出すのに、すでにメッセンジャーやメールなど他のアプリを持っています。WikiPhone では、似たような機能を作るのではなく、他のプロトコルと連携する方向を目指しています。
現行の VoIP、IP電話システムでは、音声通話から呼出、暗号化まで、ワンセットで面倒を見てくれます。しかしこれは単に、既存の電話を
IP に模倣する為に必要なだけであり、模倣に囚われなければもっとシンプルな形で
IP 上の音声通話をデザイン出来るはずです。呼出や暗号化には他の仕組みと連動すれば良いです。
WikiPhone では個人を特定できる電話番号ではなく、同時に話せる場である
URL チャンネルを指定します。サンプルにある。http://languagegame.org:9090/phone
は URL チャンネルの一つの例ですが 、URL にはサーバ内のどのような文字列でも指定出来ます(例 : http://languagegame.org:9090/secret)
。チャンネルは動的に生成されます。もしもあなたが個人的な会話を友人としたい場合は、URL
としてもっと謎めいた文字列を選び、その
URL を友人に送ればバレないです 。WikiPhone の名前は、同じく動的にウェブサイトを生成する wiki から取りました 。
プロトコルは HTTP ベースです。HTTP は遅いだろうと言われましたが、しかしそれはムーアの法則が解決してくれます。なぜ
HTTP かと言うと 、WikiPhone はハッカーによるハッカーの為の電話だからです。電話全体を提供する物ではなく、リアルタイム通信の部分だけを出来るだけシンプルな形で提供します。それを電話に使おうがラジオを作ろうがゲームに使おうがハッカーの自由です。それを可能にするために、最もメジャーなプロトコルである
HTTP/1.1 に出来るだけ合わせています。興味のある方は
http://languagegame.org:9090/phone をブラウザで空けるか telnet でアクセスしながら WikiPhone してみてください 。
現在すべてのコードは Squeak Smalltalk で書かれていますが、仕組みは単純なので多言語への移植は簡単だと思います。また面白い改造の仕方や応用も書きます。( Florian さんの言うようにステレオにして、ゼーレごっこも簡単に出来ると思います)。月末あたり時間を取って再度プロトコルを見直し、とりあえずのリリースに出来れば良いかなと思ってます。
Package administration commands
Basic Configuration
As part of its operation , APT uses a file that lists the ' sources ' from which packages can be obtained .
This file is /etc/apt/sources.list .
The entries in this file normally follow this format :
deb http://host/debian distribution section1 section2 section3
deb -src http://host/debian distribution section1 section2 section3
Of course , the above entries are fictitious and should not be used .
The first word on each line , deb or deb-src , indicates the type of archive : whether it contains binary packages ( deb ) , that is , the pre-compiled packages that we normally use , or source packages ( deb- src ) , which are the original program sources plus the Debian control file ( .dsc ) and the diff.
gz containing the changes needed for `debianizing ' the program .
We usually find the following in the default Debian sources .
list :
# See sources.list ( 5 ) for more information , especially
# Remember that you can only use http , ftp or file URIs
# CDROMs are managed through the apt - cdrom tool .
deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US
stable /non-US main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org stable / updates main contrib non-free
# Uncomment if you want the apt - get source function to work
#deb-src
http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
#deb-src http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US
stable /non-US main contrib non-free
These are the lines needed by a basic Debian install .
The first deb line points to the official archive , the second to the non-US archive and the third to the archive of Debian security updates .
The two last lines are commented out ( with a `# ' in front ) , so apt - get will ignore them .
These are deb-src lines , that is , they point to Debian source packages .
If you often download program sources for testing or recompiling , uncomment them .
The /etc/apt/sources.list file can contain several types of lines .
APT knows how to deal with archives of types http , ftp , file ( local files , e.g. , a directory containing a mounted ISO9660 filesystem ) and ssh , that I know of .
Do not forget to run apt - get update after modifying the /etc/apt/ sources .
list file .
You must do this to let APT obtain the package lists from the sources you specified .
When you install a package APT retrieves the needed files from the hosts listed in /etc/ apt / sources .
list , stores them in a local repository ( / var / cache / apt/archives / ) , and then proceeds with installation

How to know what packages may be upgraded
apt - show - versions is a program that shows what packages in the system may be updated and several useful information .
The -u option displays a list of upgradeable packages :
# apt -show - versions -u
aptitude is now the preferred text front end for APT , the Advanced Package Tool .
It remembers which packages you deliberately installed and which packages were pulled in through dependencies ; the latter packages are automatically de-installed by aptitude when they are no longer needed by any deliberately installed packages .
It has advanced package - filtering features but these can be difficult to configure .
aptitude update :
Update the local cache of available packages ( formerly apt - get update .
aptitude upgrade : Upgrade available packages ( formerly apt - get upgrade ) .
aptitude dist - upgrade : Upgrade available packages even if it means removing stuff ( formerly apt - get dist - upgrade ) .
aptitude install pkgname : Install package ( formerly apt - get install ) .
aptitude remove pkgname : Uninstall package ( formerly apt - get remove ) .
aptitude purge pkgname : Uninstall package and config files ( formerly apt - get – purge remove ) .
aptitude search string : Search for a package with “ string ” in the name or description ( formerly apt - cache search string ) .

The dpkg - divert command
File diversions are a way of forcing dpkg not to install a file into its default location , but to a diverted location .
Diversions can be used through the Debian package scripts to move a file away when it causes a conflict .
System administrators can also use a diversion to override a package 's configuration file , or whenever some files ( which are n't marked as conffiles ) need to be preserved by dpkg , when installing a newer version of a package which contains those files .
# dpkg - divert [ - - add ] filename # add " diversion "
# dpkg - divert -- remove filename # remove " diversion "
if the dpkg command is broken follow this
A broken dpkg may make it impossible to install any .deb files .
A procedure like the following will help you recover from this situation .
( In the first line , you can replace " links " with your favorite browser command . )
$ links http:// http.us.debian.org /debian/pool/main/d/dpkg/
... download the good dpkg_ version _ arch .deb
$ su
password : *****
# ar x dpkg_ version _ arch .deb
# mv data.tar.gz /data.tar.gz
# cd /
# tar xzfv data.tar.gz
For i386 , http://packages.debian.org/dpkg may also be used as the URL .
Local package archive
In order to create a local package archive which is compatible with APT and the dselect system , Packages needs to be created and package files need to be populated in a particular directory tree .
A local deb repository similar to an official Debian archive can be made in this way :
# aptitude install dpkg-dev
# cd /usr / local
# install -d pool # physical packages are located here
# install -d dists / unstable / main / binary - i386
# ls - 1 pool | sed 's / _.*$/ priority section /' | uniq > override
# editor override # adjust priority and section
# dpkg - scanpackages pool override /usr / local / \
> dists / unstable / main / binary - i386 / Packages
# cat > dists / unstable / main / Release << EOF
Archive : unstable
Version : 3.0
Component : main
Origin : Local
Label : Local
Architecture : i386
EOF
# echo " deb file : /usr / local unstable main " \ >>
/etc/apt/sources.list
Alternatively , a quick - and - dirty local deb repository can be made :
# aptitude install dpkg-dev
# mkdir /usr/ local / debian
# mv / some / where/package.deb /usr/local/debian
# dpkg - scanpackages /usr / local / debian / dev/null | \
gzip - > /usr/local/debian /Packages.gz
# echo " deb file : /usr/local/debian ./ " >>
/etc/apt/sources.list
These archives can be remotely accessed by providing access to these directories through either HTTP or FTP methods and changing entries in /etc/apt/ sources .
list accordingly .
auto - apt command
auto - apt is an on - demand package installation tool .
$ sudo auto - apt update
... update database
$ auto - apt -x -y run
Entering auto - apt mode : / bin/ bash
Exit the command to leave auto - apt mode .
$ less /usr / share / doc / med - bio / copyright # access non-existing file
... Install the package which provide this file .

Package Management Common errors
Errors will always happen , many of them caused by users not paying attention .
The following is a list of some of the most frequently reported errors and how to deal with them .
If you receive a message that looks like the one below when trying to run apt - get install package
Reading Package Lists ...
Done
Building Dependency Tree ...
Done
W : Could n't stat source package list ' http://people.debian.org unstable / Packages ' ( /var/state/apt/lists/people.debian.org_%7ekov_debian_unstable_Packages ) - stat ( 2 No such file or directory )
W : You may want to run apt - get update to correct these missing files
E : Could n't find package penguineyes
you forgot to run apt - get update after your last change to the /etc/apt/sources .
list file .
If the error looked like :
E : Could not open lock file / var / lib / dpkg / lock - open ( 13 Permission denied )
E : Unable to lock the administration directory ( / var/lib/dpkg / ) , are you root ?
when trying any apt - get method other than source , you do n't have root permission , that is , you 're running as a normal user .
There 's an error similar to the above which happens when you run two copies of apt - get at the same time , or even if you try to run apt - get while a dpkg process is active .
The only method that can be used simultaneously with others is the source method .
If an installation breaks in the middle of the process and you find that it's no longer possible to install or remove packages , try running these two commands :
# apt - get -f install
# dpkg -- configure -a
And then try again .
It may be necessary to run the second of the above commands more than once .
This is an important lesson for those adventurers who use `unstable ' .
If you receive the error " E : Dynamic MMap ran out of room " when running apt - get update ,
add the following line to /etc/ apt/ apt.conf :
European scientists are preparing to monitor the neighbour from hell .
Venus Express , a robot spacecraft little bigger than a fridge , is to be the first mission to the second rock from the sun in 15 years .
Venus is 4.6bn years old , of similar diameter and mass to the Earth , and made of the same rocks .
It occupies the same neighbourhood and should be warm and welcoming , like Earth .
But it is not .
Fred Taylor , of the University of Oxford , said : " It 's very disturbing that we do not understand the climate on a planet so much like the Earth .
It is telling us that we really do n't understand the Earth .
We have ended up with a lot of mysteries . "
Venus Express will take off on October 26 , from Baikonur in Kazakhstan , aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket .
A second upper - stage Fregat rocket will push it on to a 162 - day trajectory towards Venus .
During
April the spacecraft will be sent pirouetting as close as 155 miles around its partner , and then soaring 41,000 miles away .
It will do this for 500 Earth days .
One day on Venus , which alone of all the planets rotates backwards , lasts 243 Earth days .
The planet 's air is thick , at 90 times the pressure at sea level on Earth , and there are dense clouds of sulphuric acid .
Violent winds race around 50 times faster than the planet spins , and vast hurricanes hang over each pole .
The surface is paved with basalt dating from planet - wide eruptions no more than 500 m years ago .
There have been more than 30 missions to Venus but the last visitor to stay longer than a few hours was the US orbiter Magellan , in 1990 .
Scientists over the years have confirmed that the landscape has high domes and rolling plains , with what look like old ocean basins and riverbeds , but there is no liquid water .
The rock of Venus is hot enough to melt lead or tin , so hot that even the dark side of the planet glows faintly through the clouds .
There is also a second reflected gleam from the planet 's mountaintops , as if they were capped by a kind of metallic " snow " .
But right up till the arrival of the first Russian and US spacecraft in 1959 and 1962 , scientists and fiction writers imagined Venus had tropical rainforest .
It is not known why there is a mix of sulphuric acid , water vapour and carbon dioxide - but the atmosphere amounts to a shining example of the greenhouse effect .
After the moon , Venus is the brightest thing in the night sky , so bright it can be seen sometimes by daylight .
But though 90 % of the sun 's radiation on Venus bounces back to space , 10 % of it is trapped , which racks up the temperature to incinerating levels .
David Southwood , director of science for the European Space Agency , said : " For me Earth and Venus were born as alike as twins ... if you had seen the solar system half a billion years into its life you would have seen two planets form and you would not have known which would be the habitable one . "
High - level languages are not intrinsically slow !
David Chisnall explains how programming in a low - level language can make a compiler 's job harder , essentially wasting effort and slowing down your program 's processing .

The closer to the metal you can get while programming , the faster your program will compile — or so conventional wisdom would have you believe .
In this article , I will show you how high - level languages like Java are n't slow by nature , and in fact low level languages may compile less efficiently .
What Is a ’ High - Level ’ Language ?
A computer language is a way of representing a program that can be translated into something that a computer can execute .
A language is described as low - level if it ’s close to instructions executed by the hardware .
The lowest - level language that can be used is raw machine code — a string of numbers representing instructions and operands understood by the CPU .
Note that in most modern microprocessors this is still one layer of abstraction away from the " real " instructions .
A modern x86 CPU , for example , will split each of these instructions into a series of micro-operations ( μOps ) and then execute the μOps individually .
The next layer up is assembly languages , which are semantically equivalent to the raw machine code ; one assembly language statement translates directly to one machine instruction .
Assembly languages are slightly easier to read than machine code , because they substitute mnemonics for numbers .
They often have some syntactic sugar , such as the ability to define macros — code segments that are reused frequently — and insert them by name .
They also have the ability to define jump targets symbolically , rather than having to change an address everywhere in your program when you insert an instruction before a jump .
Moving slightly further up , we get to languages like C. Early versions of UNIX were written in Assembler , but this proved to be a hindrance when porting it to new platforms , because assembly languages are machine - specific .
Existing high - level languages , such as LISP , provided too much abstraction for implementing an operating system , so a new language was created .
This language , C , was a very slightly abstracted form of PDP - 11 assembly language .
There is almost a 1:1 mapping between C semantics and PDP - 11 machine code , making it very easy to compile C for the PDP - 11 ( the target machine of UNIX at the time ) .
For a long time , LISP was the archetypal high - level language .
It provides a very flexible syntax in which many complex design patterns can be represented in a reusable fashion .
LISP is generally categorized as a functional language , but this is n’t entirely accurate ( although it does support functional programming language ) .
The definition of a high - level language is a moving target .
Languages that were considered high - level when I learned to program are now considered low - level .
In general , a programming language provides a midway point between how you think about a program and how a computer executes the program .
Languages that are closer to you than to the computer are considered high - level , while others are considered low - level .
WASHINGTON , Aug. 29 - The reason people with red hair have higher rates of skin cancer than people with black hair likely lies in the different photochemical properties of their melanin pigments , researchers reported here .
Because of slight variations in its chemical structure , red pigment loses electrons relatively easily when hit by ultraviolet light ( UV ) .
Black pigment , on the other hand , requires a jolt of high - energy UV , which is usually screened out by the atmosphere , to knock off its electrons , reported John D. Simon , Ph.D. , of Duke University in Durham , N.C .
Electron loss is the first step to generating oxygen free radicals , which in turn cause damage to DNA that can lead to skin cancer , Dr. Simon said Sunday at a presentation at the American Chemical Society Annual Meeting .
Action Points
Advise redheaded patients that there is a scientific explanation for why they have a greater propensity for skin cancer .
No such photochemical analysis of red and black pigments has been done before , in part because of the extreme difficulty of removing melanin granules from human hair and tissue without altering their natural chemical properties , Dr. Simon said .
However , Dr. Simon and colleagues were able to isolate red and black pigment from hair samples using a new technique developed by Italian scientists .
" We spent a year characterizing these pigments so that we could establish that we had optimized the isolation to yield as close to natural pigments as possible , " Dr. Simon said .
The researchers then bombarded the pigments with varying frequencies of UV light and determined the resulting electron loss with a technique called photoelectron emission microscopy .
" The red pigment is more pro-oxidant under normal atmospheric UV exposure and more prone to cause oxidative stress in cells , " Dr. Simon said .
" The work suggests that the photochemical properties of the pigments themselves may contribute to the different incidence of cancer between tissues containing the different pigments , " he concluded .

From mountains of butter and beef to imaginary cows , the European Union 's Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) proves to be an ongoing wreck , despite perpetual reforms .
According to the recent press release by the European Court of Auditors , " the agricultural spending ( €48.5 billion in 2005 ) is still materially affected by errors " and the Times reported that the auditors refused to sign off the accounts for the twelfth year .
The European Union has been reforming the CAP over the last fifty years but unless its existence is seriously challenged , the fiasco will only continue .
Moving with the Times
The CAP was launched in the 1950s to overcome the food shortages in Europe .
The Treaty of Rome in 1957 established the basics of the CAP with the following objectives : increased productivity , a fair standard of living for the agricultural population , stabilized markets , regular supplies of food , and reasonable prices for consumers .
The core principle behind the CAP is the maintenance of a system of free and undistorted competition .
However subsidizing production and guaranteeing prices to farmers inevitably distorted the market , resulting in surpluses of certain commodities — mountains of butter and rivers of milk .
To deal with surpluses , the EU then subsidized product storage , exported surpluses or simply disposed of them .
Further measures were implemented to curb the production of these commodities : compulsory set - asides where farmers keep a percentage of their land uncultivated , fixed quotas on milk production with penalties for exceeding the quotas , limits on the area of crops and numbers of animals for which farmers claim subsidies .
Since food shortages are no longer a major concern in the EU member states , the CAP is now geared toward the preservation and management of natural resources .
Their central role currently involves " support for farmers ' incomes while also encouraging them to produce high quality products demanded by the market and encouraging them to develop additional ways of improving their businesses in harmony with the environment . "
Public Benefits of Payments to Farmers
The environmental goals have been integrated into the CAP since the 1980s .
Increasingly , farmers are encouraged to take care of the countryside rather than to focus on production of foodstuff through a recent reform called " decoupling " ( i.e. , payments to farmers are unrelated to production , as they are " decoupled " from output ) .
Decoupling was introduced so that farmers are free to produce any commodity they wish and unlike previous subsidies for production of certain commodities , direct payments are given as farm aids .
The Common Agricultural Policy Explained published by the European Commission in 2004 states that financial assistance is given " to reduce the number of animals per hectare of land , leaving field boundaries uncultivated , creating ponds or other features , or by planting trees and hedges and so going beyond conventional good farming methods . "
Further aid may be given to farmers who voluntarily sign up to agri-environment commitments for a minimum period of five years , which would be a steady source of income for those who register .
At the Congress of European Farmers in Strasbourg , Mariann Fischer Boel , the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development , stated that most European citizens are still prepared to pay public money to farmers .
In her speech , which is full of inconsistencies , she makes a flimsy distinction between private goods and public goods .
According to Boel , while private goods such as farm products are for the market , responsible stewardship of the land and compassionate treatment of farm animals are public goods .
This statement raises some questions .
If farm products should be left to the market as private goods , why have farmers been subsidized to produce foodstuff ever since the inception of the CAP ?
Surely Boel 's statement undermines the role that the CAP has been playing in the last fifty years .
Moreover , what does she mean by the public benefit of farm aid ?
Who exactly benefits in what way from these supposedly public goods ?
I faintly see the benefit of the scenery one might enjoy while traveling through the fields of Europe .
Let us say that I travel through the countryside in France .
As I travel by train , I derive satisfaction from the scenery .
For this purpose , however , it is insignificant to me who owns the fields or who funds the upkeep , since what I enjoy here is the landscape that I pass by .
If we follow Boel 's logic , such landscape belongs to all of us and travelers like me would not be able to enjoy it if these farmers were not subsidized to make their farms beautiful .
Therefore aid toward " the responsible stewardship of the land " are justified as passersby might derive satisfaction from the positive externality of the beautiful scenery .
But why would this apply to landscapes and not cityscapes ?
If I argued that people would not be able to enjoy the skylines of Manhattan if the property owners were not subsidized to maintain such remarkable facades , would n't that strike us as absurd ?
The assumption that the maintenance of the countryside is impossible without financial aid is questionable .
Furthermore , let us say that farmers maintain their farms beautifully with the subsidies and open them up for agri-tourism .
Visitors to these farms would have to pay ; therefore I fail to see any public good element ( namely , non-excludable and non-rivalrous ) .
If I entered one of these farms saying , " I paid toward the upkeep of your farm with my tax payment and now I would like to stay here to enjoy your nice farm please , " I would be trespassing .
Boel 's distinction between private goods and public goods and benefits is elusive .
There are high standards imposed on farmers in the EU member states only .
Boel believes " it is logical that public money should cover the extra costs which these obligatory standards impose on our farmers , because it is the public that benefits from those standards — not , primarily , whoever buys the product . "
Her argument is not persuasive because effectively she is saying that the farmers have to meet the EU - created standards and need help meeting them , again by the EU and taxpayers , and some public but not the actual consumers of products will benefit from all these .
Addicted to the Reforms
As already demonstrated by the measures to deal with surpluses and the EU subsidies paid to farmers to meet the EU standards , it appears that the CAP is perpetually being reformed to fix problems that are self - generating .
The reforms to simplify rules and reduce market intervention , however , have not diminished the role of the CAP .
In fact Boel has stated that " simplification is not about scrapping the CAP , nor is it about weakening controls over how we spend taxpayers ' money . "
For instance , every year , the member states report to the European Commission on the results of the milk quota scheme , in a specific questionnaire format .
If they exceed two reference quotas — one for deliveries to dairies , the other for direct sales to consumers — the levy of € 0.3091 / kg of overrun must be paid .
This year , nine member states exceeded the quotas by 1.2 million tonnes , amounting to a levy of €377 million .
Other examples include : the Cereals Management Committee recently voting on a proposal " to change the eligibility of maize for intervention " ; the aid scheme for banana producers being revised ; the European Commission voting on the €450 million aid to restructuring and conversion of vineyards .
So where is the simplification and where is decoupling ?
One simplification agenda is aimed at a single Common Market Organisation ( CMO ) .
A CMO is a set of rules for a particular agricultural product .
Examples are the " cereals CMO " and the " beef CMO . "
The Commission for Agriculture and Rural Development wants to consolidate twenty - one existing CMOs into one legal document .
To simplify the detailed implementation of policies , the commission is currently reviewing twenty proposals .
Another simplification agenda is related to claiming farm subsidies , which involves a complex administrative procedure .
Previously farmers could claim up to eleven different payments .
Decoupling led to the Single Payment Scheme , launched in 2003 .
However , even such " simple " payment proves to be complex in reality .
The Rural Payments Agency is an organization responsible for payments to farmers in the UK .
The payments were delayed and government ministers and civil servants are pointing fingers at each other for the delay .
And the report from auditors ?
While inspecting the 2005 European Union budget , auditors have discovered that some farmers were claiming subsidies on imaginary cows .
Siim Kallas , the Administrative , Audit and Anti-fraud Commissioner , responded to the auditors by stating that the auditing standards of the EU are stringent , samples taken for the audit were not representative , and they ignored the fact that the EU claim back any money wrongly paid out .
Indeed , the commission announced in October 2006 that it is to recover €317 million from the member states that was wrongly claimed by farmers prior to 1999 .
To recover this sum , a task force was set up in 2002 and the EU is unhappy that the member states implemented inadequate recovery procedures .
Conclusion
The CAP takes up a large share of the EU budget — it used to be 70 % of the budget but for the next financial cycle of 2007 – 2013 , it is aimed at 34.9 % — and the commissioners have no intention of abolishing it despite the fact that the initial objective of overcoming food shortages has long been redundant .
On the contrary , they justify its existence based on unconvincing ideas of public benefits and interests and the actual expansion of the EU means the CAP is unlikely to diminish .
As always , it will continuously be reformed .
Meanwhile , the taxpayers have no choice but to contribute toward these eternal reforms .

Adolf Hitler did n't do many favours for German culture .
Goethe , Beethoven and Dürer will never be enough to lift the curse he put on it - not least because he praised them all .
And that 's before we start on Wagner .
How many people go on holiday to see the art treasures of Nuremberg ?
There 's as much artistic greatness in Germany as anywhere .
But we do n't want to know .
Now there 's a small exhibition of German art at Tate Modern that offers a way to recognise what we 're missing .
And , bizarrely , our excellent guide is the führer .
I 've got to admit , I had n't ever paid much attention to Karl Schmidt - Rottluff - he painted the kind of lozenge - eyed portraits and angular nudes that have always tended to blur into my vague image of " German expressionism " .
Schmidt - Rottluff 's Frau mit Tasche ( Woman with Bag ) , in the Tate show , looks innocent enough , if a little distorted .
Then you see it - her face is hard and elongated , jutting in space , awkwardly placed on her body .
There 's something foreign here , and then you realise : this woman 's head is an African mask .
To many spectators today , this might seem a comparatively gentle modernist work .
But try to see its disorder , eroticism and racial impurity through Hitler 's eyes .
In 1937 Schmidt - Rottluff , one of the founder - members of the Dresden avant - garde group the Brücke - the Bridge - had more than 50 of his works exhibited in the most notorious art event of the 20th century .
The Entartete Kunst - Degenerate Art - exhibition opened in Munich in July of that year .
It was the most successful modern art exhibition of all time .
In six weeks it had a million visitors , and a million more caught it on tour .
This is what all the hep people would be doing if the Nazis had won the war , said Hunter S Thompson of Las Vegas .
What all the hep people were doing in Nazi Germany in 1937 's summer of unlove was sneering at Schmidt - Rottluff 's paintings - not to mention those of Ernst Ludwig Kirchner , Edvard Munch , Emil Nolde , Franz Marc , Lyonel Feininger and Marc Chagall .
It was shameful , and the Tate documents it as such .
All the artists in this room had works in the Degenerate Art exhibition .
Nolde 's 1930 painting
The Sea B is so German - a morbid , romantic landscape , echoing Caspar David Friedrich , or a Wagner prelude - and yet Nolde had no fewer than 1,052 works of his removed from German museums in 1937 .
His prominent inclusion in the Entartete Kunst exhibition baffled him all the more in that he was a Nazi .
The Tate show presents this story as tragedy ; and of course it is .
One great painter , Kirchner , committed suicide within a year of the Degenerate Art exhibition .
The fascinating archive documents build up a picture of misery ; the spiritual - minded Wassily Kandinsky writes of his confusion , as an apolitical person , about what is going on .
It 's a story of defeat - but it could be told differently .
It would be great to see a full - scale exhibition .
In fact , it would be worth reconstructing the entire Degenerate Art exhibition .
The restaging would , I suspect , profoundly alter our view of modern art .
We would see how German it is .
There 's a crucial aspect of the Degenerate Art exhibition I had never understood before .
I always pictured it as a global denunciation of modernism .
At the 1933 Nuremberg Rally Hitler lambasted futurism ( despite its fascist affiliations ) and dada .
So I pictured the Nazi art connoisseurs marching contemptuously through rooms filled with Picassos and Duchamps . . . but that is not what it was like at all .
The degenerates on view were mostly homegrown .
When Nazi art experts ransacked German public collections for anything modernist to put in the show , of course they grabbed plenty of treasures by Picasso and Van Gogh , to be sold abroad or destroyed .
But Hitler had other views .
He wanted to abolish German modern art .
Hitler 's decree of June 30 1937 , authorising Goebbels to ransack museums , specified " German degenerate art since 1910 " .
Talk about knowing your enemy .
Like a lot of failed artists , Hitler fancied himself an art critic - and in picking 1910 as the year when all the good old - fashioned values of realism and beauty had been brutally overturned in German art , he was right .
That was the year German expressionists founded the New Secession in Berlin .
Newspapers in that year were full of scornful attacks on the sensationalism of these young German artists - perhaps the would - be artist Hitler read the reviews .
The Degenerate Art show was not just an attack on modernism , it was an attack on a version of Germany .
It was German artists Hitler denounced as sick : " In the name of the German people it is my duty to prevent these pitiable unfortunates , who plainly suffer from defects of vision , from attempting to persuade others by their chatter that these faults of observation are indeed realities and present them as ' art ' . "
And so , if we could put this exhibition back together again - which is impossible because it would mean resurrecting destroyed masterpieces such as Marc 's Tower of Blue Horses - it would not be some disgusting exercise in Nazi kitsch .
Despite its loathing and violence - because of its loathing and violence - Degenerate Art was the most revealing exhibition ever staged about German modernism .
The fact this art was hated and even feared by Hitler is high praise .
And what the Munich show catalogued was the subversive energy and revolutionary brilliance of the Germany killed by Hitler .
From now on , the world would not think of Germany as the nation of George Grosz and John Heartfield , of Hannah Höch 's dada collages , but as a small - minded country of beer - swigging Bavarian mediocrity .
Hitler won - in most people 's perceptions , he has still won .
The Tate Modern exhibit is n't big or bold enough to change that .
But the Degenerate Art show had the power to change how we see Germany .
Look how Hitler hated what Berlin really was - look at it his way .
German modern art was incredible .
Schmidt - Rottluff is a perfect example - that disjunctive quality , a certain intellectual toughness , connects the icy fire of the expressionist palette with the dadaists who rebelled against expressionism itself .
More than anywhere else , this art was confrontational - and there 's the rub .
You might even say German artists were asking for it .
French modernism , by and large , inhabits a world of its own , confident in its own significance .
German artists could not draw on the Paris tradition of bohemia and knew they were a radical youthful minority in a nation of - as Otto Dix and Grosz depict it - crippled nationalist war veterans and drunken Prussians .
German modern art was n't accidentally fragmentary and disturbing ; it set out to fragment and disturb .
As the Nazi party fought for a new order , artists aggressively created disorder .
In fact , if you want a word to unify all the currents in German modern art in the first three decades of the 20th century , then " degenerate " is quite good .
But instead of abuse , this is a term of praise .
Modern art has never looked as degenerate as it did in Germany before Hitler imposed his vision of banal beauty .
Ugliness is life and beauty is death , might be our conclusion , if we could really revive the Degenerate Art exhibition .
Modern art is ugly - and alive .
Hitler praised quiet landscapes and classical nudes , and he was death .
· Degenerate Art is at Tate Modern , London SE1 ( 020-7887 8008 ) , until October 30 .
We all understand temptation – or at least we think we do .
Alexander Woolcott is supposed to have said , “ All the things I really like to do are either illegal , immoral , or fattening , ” while the Bible says we should “ enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . ”
But the simple truth is this : most of us have gotten really good at resisting most kinds of temptation .
If you do n’t believe me , check to see if you ’re currently in jail , or compare your behavior against that of a randomly selected two year - old child !
Those of us who did n’t master basic impulse control probably became criminals well before the age of 18 .
Sure , you probably have some “ temptations ” that you give into : maybe you procrastinate or overspend a little or eat some things you should n’t .
But do you actually enjoy these things ?
If you think about it , you ’ll quickly realize that most of the things we call “ temptation ” really are n’t very pleasurable .
When we give in to the temptation to overeat , for example , it ’s rarely to enjoy a gourmet meal !
And when we procrastinate , we rarely “ waste ” our time by doing something we actually enjoy .
To add insult to injury , whatever enjoyment we might have gotten will usually be ruined by guilt – before , during , and afterward !
So what ’s really going on here ?
Why do we seem so tempted to do these things that we do n’t even like ?!
Why Are n’t We Tempted To Do FUN
Things ?
Some people theorize that it ’s because the things we ’re tempted to do are actually ways of avoiding doing something else .
We procrastinate because the thing we “ should ” be working on is hard or scary .
But there ’s a minor flaw in this theory .
Why do we also procrastinate doing things that we want to do ?
Somehow I never “ find the time ” to read a book or play a game or even go to the movies .
But none of those activities are difficult or scary in the least !
Now in the last 6 months , I ’ve been learning that having goals is a really powerful tool for personal improvement .
Whether I achieve the goals or not , they help to set up useful internal conflicts – the kind of conflicts that help me identify “ broken thinking ” .
When I ’m working on a goal , and struggling with myself , it ’s a lot easier to see which of my thought processes are interfering .
And last weekend , I was working on recording my Instant Willpower course , with a goal of recording an entire lesson ( about 30 - 40 minutes of audio corresponding to about an hour or so of actual “ lesson time ” ) .
And I did n’t meet that goal , not by a long shot .
I did get about 7 minutes down in one continuous error - free take : a personal best for the project so far .
When I recorded that seven minutes , it was right after I ’d had an idea and was feeling inspired to record a segment , even though I did n’t yet know where it would fit in the material overall .
But after I finished , and started trying to “ manage ” the remainder of the project , all my interest seemed to go away , along with my concentration .
Somehow I kept getting “ distracted ” and doing all kinds of other stuff .
I met the Enemy – and it was not my laziness !
So the next day , I began trying to identify the problem .
I knew that if I used the techniques I was putting in the Instant Willpower course , I could just “ willpower ” my way through it .
But after studying the thought processes I was using , I was shocked to realize that my recently - improved level of willpower was actually making the problem worse !
The real problem was what I ’ve previously referred to as my “ inner drill sergeant ” : the mental tyrant who thinks I should be doing everything , all the time , and that my desires for things like food , water , sleep , bathroom breaks , practice , preparation , and adequate ventilation are just the lazy whinings of a good - for - nothing weakling .
It seems that this crazy little martinet living in my head had decided that since I now had more willpower , I certainly did n’t need anything like an actual completed lesson plan before recording anything !
The fact that this was making the recording process ten times more difficult than it needed to be was being conveniently ignored .
“ Quit your whining and cowboy up ! ” the inner sergeant would bark .
“ You ’ll just have to figure it out as you go along ! ”
It was at this point that I realized that he was quite insane , as was I for listening to him all these years !
Although this part of me was claiming to be trying to improve me and motivate me , it was in fact constantly urging me to withhold affection from myself until I had accomplished the impossible .
But no accomplishment has ever been good enough for my inner drill sergeant , and none ever would be .
His only function was to withhold the goodies until things got done , gradually moving the carrots further and further away until I gave up in despair and started frittering away my time on nothing in particular .
The Vicious Cycle of Inverse Temptation
So this has pretty much been the story of my life .
I get motivated and start moving towards a project .
At first , I enjoy myself , because I ’m feeling inherently interested or motivated by what I ’m doing .
Then the drill sergeant weasels his way into running the project .
If I ’m doing it , he says , I ought to do it right .
Then he starts taking away my liberties , because I do n’t really “ deserve ” them until the project is finished .
Before long , I ’m starving myself of anything that feels good , and even if I try to take time off or get involved in other enjoyable things , he wo n’t let up .
He keeps telling me I should be working on the project , no matter what else I ’m doing .
Finally , I give up , feeling frustrated , deprived , and exhausted .
Then I gradually bring myself back into balance by doing some things I actually enjoy … until the sergeant senses it ’s the right time to take over again .
This weekend , for the first time , I realized that while this part ’s intention may have been to motivate me , its actual effect was to deliberately starve myself of anything enjoyable , on the theory that such things were antithetical to accomplishing anything .
And I recognized that this part was just a reflection of what I learned as a child : “ Do X to get Y ” , where X is something you do n’t want , and Y is something you do want , because someone in authority wo n’t let you have Y until they get X .
There are two catches to this “ Do X to get Y ” theory , however .
The first is that in my childhood , I often did n’t get the Y after I did the X .
Instead , a new X was presented , and the price to get Y increased again and again until finally , it might turn out that Y just was n’t going to happen at all , no matter that I already had done several X’s to pay for it !
Suffer Now , Suffer Later
The second catch in this theory is that it leads to believing you can suffer enough to obtain happiness .
However , you cannot ever buy ( your own ) happiness with suffering .
It is true that you can be happy while you are suffering , if that suffering has some personal meaning for you , but you ca n’t get happiness later by suffering now .
An aspect of my inner self , however , had been deluded into believing that I really did n’t deserve to be happy until I was perfect .
And in a fit of circular logic , it concluded that since I ’m not perfect , I do n’t deserve to become perfect , because then I would be able to be happy , and I do n’t deserve to be happy , because I ’m not perfect !
Therefore , the same part of me that was trying to hold me to an impossible standard also wanted me to fail to live up to it , because clearly success would demotivate me by making it possible for me to have selfish pleasures !
Therefore , it was better to make me give up , because then I could also punish myself with guilt .
Just the thing for an undeserving wretch like me !
Once I figured this out , it was finally clear to me why , after so very many years of self - improvement efforts , I continue to have such a cyclical approach to achievement .
As my abilities have developed , my inner torturer simply raised the bar for what was expected of me !
Thus , I could always manage to fall short of my own expectations , and still get to beat myself up .
And the better I get at accomplishing my own goals , the worse I beat myself up for the ones I do n’t accomplish !
“ After all , ” reasons the inner tyrant .
“ You ’re writing all this stuff about how other people should live their lives , but you ’re not perfect , you hypocritical phony !
You only accomplished fifteen goals in one month out of thirty that you set – never mind that a year ago you ’d have been lucky to accomplish five ; you failed !
No soup for you ! ”
And by “ soup ” , of course , he really means love .
Time Travelling for a Better Tomorrow
So this last weekend I finally came face to face with the degree of contempt and even loathing that I actually had for myself – and the fact that it would never , ever matter what I did .
Nothing I could ever do would ever be good enough for the inner tyrant .
He would never love me – I would never love myself – as long as this went on .
I would never be comfortable letting myself have anything good , except as a way to bribe myself out of depression in order to trick myself back onto the tyrant ’s treadmill .
It has taken me a few days to figure out a way past this block , and I ’m not entirely sure I ’m done with it yet .
Using the techniques from You , Version 2.0 , I began unraveling most of the memory imprints that formed the basis of the inner drill sergeant , but I also found an imprint that resisted my efforts to find its origin .
As it turned out , this was because it was an imprint from a time before I had any language or much in the way of cognitive experience .
I had to use a slightly different technique called a Doyletic Trace in order to destabilize the imprint .
Apparently , there are some differences in how memories work before the age of 5 , and after the age of 5 .
For imprints formed after the age of 5 , it ’s relatively easy to get conscious access to them , and then to change them using the techniques I described in You , Version 2.0 .
For imprints formed below the age of 5 , however , conscious access is difficult or impossible .
But luckily , just tracing them back to their origin is enough to suppress their automatic nature .
So as it happened , I had a “ doyle ” ( i.e. , an emotional body state cluster ) that was a full - body defensive posture , my arms and legs drawn inward , my body curling to protect my stomach , coupled with an intense feeling of weakness and helplessness and a sense that I would not survive .
I still do n’t know what actually caused this imprint , although I have a few suspicions .
Fortunately , it does n’t matter ; just tracing it back was enough to keep it from being an automatic response to stress any more .
Breathe , breathe in the air ; Do n’t be afraid to care …
Tracing this imprint back also had an interesting effect on my breathing .
I realized for the first time that I almost never breathe with my chest , but instead only with my belly , tending towards deep sighs .
After the trace was complete , I found that I could breathe with my whole body , leading to an immediate feeling of greater confidence .
That feeling of weakness and helplessness was something that I had carried with me nearly all the time without really noticing it .
Indeed , it was that very feeling of weakness that my inner tyrant exploited , even as he was contemptuous of me for having it !
My feeling of weakness was “ proof ” that I would never amount to anything , no matter what I did .
Because no matter what I did , it was always there .
At least , until now .
My inner tyrant has fallen mostly silent now , and raises no objection when I choose to give myself small gifts .
Gifts like reading , or even exercising .
You see , the funny thing about the tyrant was this : he could n’t bear me exercising because I wanted to .
It was only acceptable to exercise if I forced myself to , because then that was at least an accomplishment in his eyes .
He had to turn all my “ want to ”s into “ have to ”s , because otherwise I would be showing love and appreciation for myself .
If I expended effort for my own gain , that would be saying that I am worth the effort !
And that just was n’t allowed .
I ’m not quite sure where I go from here .
I sense that , even though the tyrant has lost the primary target of his contempt , there are still many tangled webs of belief remaining in me , around the subjects of self - worth , compassion , and caring .
I have come to realize that my previous sense of weakness has tended to keep me from empathizing with others as much as a healthy person would , and to be more defensive and fearful in my interactions with people than I would prefer .
I am also starting to relearn how to use and carry my body , which was restricted in its ability to move gracefully by the deep - seated tension I felt .
I ’m experimenting with my voice , especially my singing voice which seems to have a whole new resonance now , now that I ’m really breathing .
Some of my personal projects are on a temporary hold while I sort through these adjustments .
I get the feeling that some of my priorities will shift , and that learning how to actually enjoy myself is probably going to be a top priority for at least a little while .
There ’s selfish , and then there ’s SELFISH
So this experience has taught me many things , but the one I want to leave you with is this .
There are two kinds of selfishness : one that comes from a self that is small , the other from a self that is large .
One is demanding and pushy , because it believes there will be nothing left for it otherwise .
The other is generous and kind , because it is based in actual love for one ’s self , rather than contempt .
One kind of selfishness hurts – itself and others – and the other one heals .
And then there are two kinds of temptation .
There are the temptations to indulge the self , and those to betray it , deny it , and withhold every good and precious thing from it .
The second kind is far more deadly to the soul , no matter what anyone may tell you .
Deliberate indulgence as a gift to yourself , as you might give a gift to your child or your lover , will do you no harm .
After all , why would you gift yourself with something harmful ?
Would you give your child something that would hurt him or her ?
Would you give something harmful to a friend ?
In truth , the two kinds of temptation are opposite sides of the same coin .
When we fall prey to the temptation to indulge , it is not because we desire the thing that “ tempts ” us , but because we seek escape from the prison the second kind of temptation has built for us .
We divide ourselves in two : a “ good ” half and a “ bad ” half , one to be the jailor , and one to be the prisoner .
Is it any wonder that the prisoner tries to escape whenever the jailor ’s back is turned ?
As always , I have a lot more to say on this subject than I have room for in a single blog post .
Some related materials will be going into lesson five of Instant Willpower , including some exercises related to the work I did to make these changes .
I also expect to say more on the subject in future articles here .
But for now , I ’m going to continue my new habit of generous self - indulgence by getting some more sleep .
And for once , I find myself looking forward to the sheer pleasure of going to sleep – instead of griping inside at how much more I could get done if I did n’t have to go to bed yet !
In the meantime , I encourage you to look for the door to your self - imposed jail cell , and at the same time give up the job of being your own jailor .
Love yourself , and you will be free .
A HARDLINE cleric linked to Somalia 's powerful Islamist movement has called for Muslims to " hunt down " and kill Pope Benedict XVI for his controversial comments about Islam .
Sheikh Abubukar Hassan Malin urged Muslims to find the pontiff and punish him for insulting the Prophet Mohammed and Allah in a speech that he said was as offensive as author Salman Rushdie 's novel The Satanic Verses .
" We urge you Muslims wherever you are to hunt down the Pope for his barbaric statements as you have pursued Salman Rushdie , the enemy of Allah who offended our religion , " he said in Friday evening prayers .

Everything that the human race has done and thought is concerned with the satisfaction of deeply felt needs and the assuagement of pain .
One has to keep this constantly in mind if one wishes to understand spiritual movements and their development .
Feeling and longing are the motive force behind all human endeavor and human creation , in however exalted a guise the latter may present themselves to us .
Now what are the feelings and needs that have led men to religious thought and belief in the widest sense of the words ?
A little consideration will suffice to show us that the most varying emotions preside over the birth of religious thought and experience .
With primitive man it is above all fear that evokes religious notions - fear of hunger , wild beasts , sickness , death .
Since at this stage of existence understanding of causal connections is usually poorly developed , the human mind creates illusory beings more or less analogous to itself on whose wills and actions these fearful happenings depend .
Thus one tries to secure the favor of these beings by carrying out actions and offering sacrifices which , according to the tradition handed down from generation to generation , propitiate them or make them well disposed toward a mortal .
In this sense I am speaking of a religion of fear .
This , though not created , is in an important degree stabilized by the formation of a special priestly caste which sets itself up as a mediator between the people and the beings they fear , and erects a hegemony on this basis .
In many cases a leader or ruler or a privileged class whose position rests on other factors combines priestly functions with its secular authority in order to make the latter more secure ; or the political rulers and the priestly caste make common cause in their own interests .
The social impulses are another source of the crystallization of religion .
Fathers and mothers and the leaders of larger human communities are mortal and fallible .
The desire for guidance , love , and support prompts men to form the social or moral conception of God .
This is the God of Providence , who protects , disposes , rewards , and punishes ; the God who , according to the limits of the believer 's outlook , loves and cherishes the life of the tribe or of the human race , or even or life itself ; the comforter in sorrow and unsatisfied longing ; he who preserves the souls of the dead .
This is the social or moral conception of God .
The Jewish scriptures admirably illustrate the development from the religion of fear to moral religion , a development continued in the New Testament .
The religions of all civilized peoples , especially the peoples of the Orient , are primarily moral religions .
The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in peoples ' lives .
And yet , that primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard .
The truth is that all religions are a varying blend of both types , with this differentiation : that on the higher levels of social life the religion of morality predominates .
Common to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of their conception of God .
In general , only individuals of exceptional endowments , and exceptionally high - minded communities , rise to any considerable extent above this level .
But there is a third stage of religious experience which belongs to all of them , even though it is rarely found in a pure form : I shall call it cosmic religious feeling .
It is very difficult to elucidate this feeling to anyone who is entirely without it , especially as there is no anthropomorphic conception of God corresponding to it .
The individual feels the futility of human desires and aims and the sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves both in nature and in the world of thought .
Individual existence impresses him as a sort of prison and he wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole .
The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear at an early stage of development , e.g. , in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets .
Buddhism , as we have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer , contains a much stronger element of this .
The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling , which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man 's image ; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it .
Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists , sometimes also as saints .
Looked at in this light , men like Democritus , Francis of Assisi , and Spinoza are closely akin to one another .
How can cosmic religious feeling be communicated from one person to another , if it can give rise to no definite notion of a God and no theology ?
In my view , it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it .
We thus arrive at a conception of the relation of science to religion very different from the usual one .
When one views the matter historically , one is inclined to look upon science and religion as irreconcilable antagonists , and for a very obvious reason .
The man who is thoroughly convinced of the universal operation of the law of causation cannot for a moment entertain the idea of a being who interferes in the course of events - provided , of course , that he takes the hypothesis of causality really seriously .
He has no use for the religion of fear and equally little for social or moral religion .
A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man 's actions are determined by necessity , external and internal , so that in God 's eyes he cannot be responsible , any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it undergoes .
Science has therefore been charged with undermining morality , but the charge is unjust .
A man 's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy , education , and social ties and needs ; no religious basis is necessary .
Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death .
It is therefore easy to see why the churches have always fought science and persecuted its devotees .
On the other hand , I maintain that the cosmic religious feeling is the strongest and noblest motive for scientific research .
Only those who realize the immense efforts and , above all , the devotion without which pioneer work in theoretical science cannot be achieved are able to grasp the strength of the emotion out of which alone such work , remote as it is from the immediate realities of life , can issue .
What a deep conviction of the rationality of the universe and what a yearning to understand , were it but a feeble reflection of the mind revealed in this world , Kepler and Newton must have had to enable them to spend years of solitary labor in disentangling the principles of celestial mechanics !
Those whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived chiefly from its practical results easily develop a completely false notion of the mentality of the men who , surrounded by a skeptical world , have shown the way to kindred spirits scattered wide through the world and through the centuries .
Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have a vivid realization of what has inspired these men and given them the strength to remain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures .
It is cosmic religious feeling that gives a man such strength .
A contemporary has said , not unjustly , that in this materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are the only profoundly religious people .
" I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation , whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God , in short , who is but a reflection of human frailty .
Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body , although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms . "

The Endless Search © 2004 - 2017 Ian C. MacFarlane
So far , at least , neither the carrot nor the stick has worked .
Politicians talk of tighter immigration controls .
Yet the reality is that a Europe in demographic freefall needs more , not fewer , immigrants if it is to maintain its prosperity .
Tony Blair just proposed new laws allowing the deportation of radical mullahs and the shutting of mosques and other sites associated with Islamic extremism .
But given the sheer size of the Muslim population in England and throughout the rest of Europe , the security services are always going to be playing catch - up .
Working together , and in a much more favorable political and security context , French and Spanish authorities have , after more than 20 years , been unable to put an end to the terrorism of the Basque separatist group ETA .
And there are at least twice as many Muslims in France as there are Basques in Spain .
At the same time , it is difficult to see how the extremists ' grievances can ever be placated by conciliatory gestures .
It is doubtful that the British government 's proposed ban on blasphemy against Islam and other religions will have a demonstrable effect .
( What would have happened to Salman Rushdie had such a ban been in force when " The Satanic Verses " was published ? )
Meanwhile , the French government has tried to create an " official " state - sanctioned French Islam .
This approach may be worth the effort , but the chances of success are uncertain .
It will require the enthusiastic participation of an Islamic religious establishment whose influence over disaffected youth is unclear .
What seems clearer is that European governments have very little time and nowhere near enough knowledge about which members of the Islamic community really are " preachers of hate " and which , however unpalatable their views , are part of the immigrant mainstream .
The multicultural fantasy in Europe -- its eclipse can be seen most poignantly in Holland , that most self - definedly liberal of all European countries -- was that , in due course , assuming that the proper resources were committed and benevolence deployed , Islamic and other immigrants would eventually become liberals .
As it 's said , they would come to " accept " the values of their new countries .
It was never clear how this vision was supposed to coexist with multiculturalism 's other main assumption , which was that group identity should be maintained .
But by now that question is largely academic : the European vision of multiculturalism , in all its simultaneous good will and self - congratulation , is no longer sustainable .
And most Europeans know it .
What they do n't know is what to do next .
If the broad - brush anti-Muslim discourse of Jean - Marie Le Pen 's National Front in France or the Vlaams Belang Party in Belgium entered the political mainstream , it would only turn the Islamic diaspora in Europe into the fifth column that , for the moment , it certainly is not .
But Europeans can hardly accept an immigrant veto over their own mores , whether those mores involve women 's rights or , for that matter , the right to blaspheme , which the Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh so bravely asserted -- and died for .
Figuring out how to prevent Europe 's multicultural reality from becoming a war of all against all is the challenge that confronts the Continent .
It makes all of Europe 's other problems , from the economy to the euro to the sclerosis of social democracy , seem trivial by comparison .
Unfortunately , unlike those challenges , this one is existential and urgent and has no obvious answer .

AIRFOIL DIAGRAMS
1996 W. Beaty Fig. 1
Incorrect diagram in grade K - 6 textbooks .
In the lefthand diagram above , the air approaches the wing horizontally and also leaves the wing horizontally .
This is incorrect ; it violates Newton 's laws , since by F=ma there cannot be a lifting force unless air is accelerated downwards .
The wing must deflect the horizontally - moving air downwards , as shown in the right - hand diagram .
( Note that the right - hand diagram is actually a 2D slice of a 3D flow , not a purely 2D depiction . )
Fig. 2
Actual windtunnel photographs show that wing surface - length is irrelevant .
Pulsed smoke streams illustrate that the air flowing above the wing is greatly outracing the air flowing below .
Parcels of air which are divided by the leading edge DO NOT recombine at the trailing edge .
Therefore the " equal transit time " explanation ( " wing shape " explanation ) of lifting force falls apart .
( The above image was made by late Aerodynamicist Alexander Lippish , The German Me-163 creator , at Collins Radio windtunnels , USA , in 1953 .
It was published in his book .
Alexander Lippish was an expert on smoke in windtunnels and his smoketrails were world - famous . )

The above flim clip of a windtunnel experiment depicts a single " plane " of smoky air as it approaches a thin airfoil and is sliced into upper and lower portions .
Note that this airfoil is NOT " curved above and flat below . "
Instead the upper and lower surfaces are approximately equal in length .
Note that the air flowing above the wing quickly outraces the air flowing below .
The air flowing above and below the wing never rejoin again .
The real reason for the rapid flow of air above the wing is never explained in textbooks using the " wing shape " explanation of lift .
( This image is made by Aerodynamist Martin - Ingelman Sundberg at KTH windtunnels in 1992 .
Sundberg , who first saw syncronized smokepulses when visiting a windtunnel maker in USA 1962 , made this smokepulse video to show how ICAO pilot education was wrong in explaining winglift with " airflow longer path over wing " . )
Fig. 4
The confusing aspects of " airfoil shape " shown above can totally obscure the true nature of aerodynamic lift .
Many authors point out that asymmetrical airfoils give positive lift even if the angle of attack is zero .
They offer this in order to prove that " wing shape " , and not " attack angle " should be the explanation of choice .
But there is a problem here .
To determine if an airfoil is tilted , we can not rely on construction of the geometrical attack angle .
Geometrical attack angle is very sensitive to tiny bumps on the wing 's leading edge , since tiny bumps can change where we draw the main ' chord . '
Yet tiny bumps on the leading edge can have little effect on deflection of air , while the tilting of the airfoil shown in the fourth section can have an enormous effect upon the deflection of air and upon lifting force .
" Kutta Condition " shows that the angle of the trailing edge is critical to production of lifting force .
SMALL FEATURES ON THE LEADING EDGE CAN CAUSE US TO TILT THE ENTIRE WING , WHILE WE DENY THAT WE HAVE DONE SO .
To determine the effective attack angle , we cannot trust the simple geometrical rules .
To determine whether an asymmetrical wing is REALLY set to zero angle of attack , we instead must take seriously the concept of " Kutta condition , " and inspect the trailing edge of the airfoil to see if it directs the air downwards .
Or put simply : the angle of the trailing edge IS the angle of attack , and the angle made by the main chord of the airfoil has little effect on the lifting force .
Fig. 5
The above fluid simulation from Saab Aircraft shows phase lag between upper and lower air parcels after an airfoil has passed .
Air travels much faster over the top of the airfoil , and then it never rejoins the air which has travelled below .
Note that the airfoil has deflected the air downwards .
( This image is a Navier - Stokes 2D airflow calculation around a SAAB 340 wing made by Aerodynamist Krister Karling , SAAB Aerospace )
Fig. 6
The above air flow simulation is from J. S. Denker 's SEE HOW IT FLYS , in the Airfoils chapter .
Note that the asymmetrical ( cambered ) wing at the top of the diagram has been adjusted to produce zero lifting force .
There is no " slip " or " phase delay " between upper and lower airflows .
In the middle and bottom diagrams , the angle of attack is progressively increased , which also creates an increasing lifting force .
The increasing angle of attack also increases the phase delay between upper and lower air flows .
So not only is the common " wing shape " or " path length " explanation wrong , but it even conceals some of the most interesting phenomena in airfoil physics : the fact that the time delay between upper and lower airflows is proportional to the attack angle and the lifting force !
656 Fig. 7
Prof Klaus
Weltner notes that in the famous publication in NACA report 116 , Prandtl may have become the origin of the " Transit - Time Fallacy . "
Prandtl depicts a lack of circulation in a flow diagram producing significant lift .
The roughly vertical lines in this diagram are incorrect , and only show the flow for a zero - lift condition .
Yet the rest of the diagram depicts " Kutta Condition " and strong lift .
Those vertical lines instead should be drawn to show an enormous offset or " phase delay : " where the upper parcels vastly outrace the lower parcels , and never meet up after passing the trailing edge of the airfoil .

Mr. Libby discussed some of the conclusions of the intelligence report with Judith Miller , then a reporter for The New York Times , in a meeting on July 8 , 2003 , the court documents say .
The previous day , the White House , for the first time , had publicly admitted that Mr. Bush 's statement in the State of the Union address earlier that year , alleging that Mr. Hussein had sought uranium in Africa , should not have been in the speech .
A little more than a week later , under continuing pressure , the White House published a declassified version of the executive summary of the estimate , in an effort to make the case that Mr. Bush 's statement had been justified by the intelligence community 's best judgment .
The disclosure on Wednesday night was part of the legal maneuvering over documents Mr. Libby has sought from the government to make his defense .
But the political impact of the disclosure could be more significant than the legal impact .
The court filing said Mr. Libby testified that the " vice president advised defendant that the president had authorized defendant to disclose certain information in the N.I.E . "
The prosecutors said Mr. Libby testified that he recalled " getting approval from the president through the vice president to discuss material that would be classified but for that approval " and that those events " were unique in his recollection . "
The leak was intended , the court papers suggested , as a rebuttal to an Op - Ed article in The New York Times on July 6 , 2003 , by Joseph C. Wilson IV , a former United States ambassador and the husband of Ms. Wilson .
Mr. Wilson wrote that he traveled to Africa in 2002 after Mr. Cheney raised questions about possible nuclear purchases by Iraq .
Mr. Wilson wrote that he concluded it was " highly doubtful " Iraq had sought nuclear fuel from Niger .
At Mr. Cheney 's office , the Op - Ed article was viewed " as a direct attack on the credibility of the vice president ( and the president ) on a matter of signal importance : the rationale for the war in Iraq , " according to the court papers filed by the prosecutor , Patrick J. Fitzgerald .
The filing was intended to limit the number of documents that the government has to turn over to Mr. Libby and his defense team .
Most of New Orleans was flooded in the aftermath of the storm
They show Federal Emergency Management Agency ( Fema ) officials scrambling for supplies and personnel .
Fema 's then - head , Michael Brown , at one point seemed not be aware that the agency was evacuating storm victims .
The e-mails were requested by the committee investigating the crisis , and obtained by the AP news agency .
Michael Chertoff , the head of the Department of Homeland Security - of which Fema is a branch - is to appear in front of the congressional panel on Wednesday .
Mr Brown appeared before the panel last month .
Hurricane Katrina devastated parts of Louisiana and Mississippi on 29 August , killing about 1,200 people .
' All you can send '
The e-mails show that the government 's hurricane response plan ran into difficulties even before the storm hit the Louisiana coastline .
Mr Brown 's deputy chief of staff , Brooks Altshuler , complained in an e-mail about White House pressure to form an interagency crisis management group , which was a key part of the plan .
" None of them have [ sic ] a clue about emergency management or economic impacts for that matter , " he wrote .
Michael Brown resigned amid mounting criticism
After the storm hit , the problems continued .
Then - Fema recovery co-ordinator William Carwile wrote to a state official : " Biggest issue : resources are far exceeded by requirements ...
Getting less than 25 % of what we have been requesting from HQ daily . "
Mr Carwile also e-mailed Florida officials , begging for relief aid .
" Food is also critical .
Need MRE [ ready - to - eat meals ] and / or heater meals if you have any .
Water , ice , food in eastern counties should be your priority ...
Also know FL [ Florida ] is providing law enforcement .
Need all you can send . "
Five days after the storm , Mr Brown - who resigned in the wake of the crisis - e-mailed an aide , saying that there had been " no action from us " to evacuate storm victims .
Less than 30 minutes later , Fema deputy operations director Michael Lowder replied : " This is flat wrong .
We have been flying planes all afternoon and evening . "
Earlier , a Fema official in Mississippi received an e-mail asking for Mr Brown 's satellite telephone number so that a senior military official could call him .
" Not here in MS [ Mississippi ] .
Is in LA [ Louisiana ] as far as I know , " Mr Carwile replied .
One of the components of MIT 's micro gas - turbine engine .
Photo courtesy : MIT
MIT researchers are putting a tiny gas - turbine engine inside a silicon chip about the size of a quarter .
The resulting device could run 10 times longer than a battery of the same weight can , powering laptops , cell phones , radios and other electronic devices .
It could also dramatically lighten the load for people who can't connect to a power grid , including soldiers who now must carry many pounds of batteries for a three - day mission -- all at a reasonable price .
The researchers say that in the long term , mass - production could bring the per-unit cost of power from microengines close to that for power from today 's large gas - turbine power plants .
Making things tiny is all the rage .
The field -- called microelectromechanical systems , or MEMS -- grew out of the computer industry 's stunning success in developing and using micro technologies .
" Forty years ago , a computer filled up a whole building , " said Professor Alan Epstein of the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics .
" Now we all have microcomputers on our desks and inside our thermostats and our watches . "
While others are making miniature devices ranging from biological sensors to chemical processors , Epstein and a team of 20 faculty , staff and students are looking to make power -- personal power .
" Big gas - turbine engines can power a city , but a little one could ' power ' a person , " said Epstein , whose colleagues are spread among MIT's Gas Turbine Laboratory , Microsystems Technology Laboratories , and Laboratory for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems .
How can one make a tiny fuel - burning engine ?
An engine needs a compressor , a combustion chamber , a spinning turbine and so on .
Making millimeter - scale versions of those components from welded and riveted pieces of metal is n't feasible .
So , like computer - chip makers , the MIT researchers turned to etched silicon wafers .
Their microengine is made of six silicon wafers , piled up like pancakes and bonded together .
Each wafer is a single crystal with its atoms perfectly aligned , so it is extremely strong .
To achieve the necessary components , the wafers are individually prepared using an advanced etching process to eat away selected material .
When the wafers are piled up , the surfaces and the spaces in between produce the needed features and functions .
Making microengines one at a time would be prohibitively expensive , so the researchers again followed the lead of computer - chip makers .
They make 60 to 100 components on a large wafer that they then ( very carefully ) cut apart into single units .
The MIT team has now used this process to make all the components needed for their engine , and each part works .
Inside a tiny combustion chamber , fuel and air quickly mix and burn at the melting point of steel .
Turbine blades , made of low - defect , high - strength microfabricated materials , spin at 20,000 revolutions per second -- 100 times faster than those in jet engines .
A mini -generator produces 10 watts of power .
A little compressor raises the pressure of air in preparation for combustion .
And cooling ( always a challenge in hot microdevices ) appears manageable by sending the compression air around the outside of the combustor .
" So all the parts workŠ .
We 're now trying to get them all to work on the same day on the same lab bench , " Epstein said .
Ultimately , of course , hot gases from the combustion chamber need to turn the turbine blades , which must then power the generator , and so on .
" That turns out to be a hard thing to do , " he said .
Their goal is to have it done by the end of this year .
Predicting how quickly they can move ahead is itself a bit of a challenge .
If the bonding process is done well , each microengine is a monolithic piece of silicon , atomically perfect and inseparable .
As a result , even a tiny mistake in a single component will necessitate starting from scratch .
And if one component needs changing -- say , the compressor should be a micron smaller -- the microfabrication team will have to rethink the entire design process .
For all the difficulties , Epstein said the project is " an astonishing amount of fun " -- and MIT is the ideal place for it .
" Within 300 feet of my office , I could find the world 's experts on each of the technologies needed to make the complete system , " he said .
In addition , the project provides an excellent opportunity for teaching .
" No matter what your specialty is -- combustion or bearings or microfabrication -- it 's equally hard , " he said .
" As an educational tool , it 's enormously useful because the students realize that their success is dependent upon other people 's success .
They can't make their part easier by making somebody else 's part harder , because then as a team we do n't succeed . "

Mr Martin has lambasted the US approach to climate change
Mr Martin was responding to comments made by US Ambassador David Wilkins .
On Tuesday , the diplomat urged Canadian politicians to watch what they said about the US while campaigning for January 's general election .
Mr Martin is fighting for re-election after his minority government was ousted in a no-confidence vote .
Relations between the two neighbouring countries suffered after Canada refused to support the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Last week , Mr Martin lambasted Washington over its decision not to join the global effort to combat climate change .
Irked
After calling on Canadian politicians to calm the rhetoric , the American ambassador said : " Canada never has to tear the US down to build itself up . "
I will make sure that Canada speaks with an independent voice now , tomorrow and always
Paul Martin
Although Mr Wilkins did not mention Mr Martin by name , he suggested he was irked by his criticism of the US at the climate - change conference in Montreal last week .
But the Canadian PM said he was not trying to score political points by slamming the US but had every right to speak out in favour of his country 's interests .
" I am not going to be dictated to as to the subjects I should raise , " he told reporters .
" I will make sure that Canada speaks with an independent voice now , tomorrow and always , and you should demand nothing less from your prime minister . "
Conservative leader Stephen Harper described Wilkins 's criticisms as " inappropriate " and said no foreign ambassador should be intervening in another country 's election campaign .
Canadians will go to the polls to elect a new parliament on 23 January , after Mr Martin lost a no -confidence vote .
The minority Liberal government had been in power only 17 months .

The American Revolution marked the beginning of modern democracy .
The American Revolution raged between 1765 and 1783 .
It ’s a straightforward fight for independence by the American colonies .
But the historical part about the revolution is the ideas behind it .
The revolutionaries took inspiration from the ancient Greek city - states and the Roman Republic .
American patriots fought for freedom , equality , and the right to govern themselves .
Those ideas got vindicated in the rise of the United States .
They would also pass on to the French Revolution decades later .
Inspired by the Americans , the French drew up the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen .
And from there , modern democracy would only grow and spread around the world .
The Protestant Reformation broke the power of the Roman Catholic Church .
We ’re sure you know how influential the church was during the Middle Ages .
They kept this influence into the Renaissance and seemingly held on to it .
The Protestant Reformation in the 16th and 17th centuries proved that wrong .
A disagreement over doctrine and the pope ’s authority turned into something more .
The rise of the various Protestant churches across Europe and beyond was one result .
Another was that of nations and societies breaking free of the church ’s influence .
This secularization of society led to the 18th century ’s Scientific Revolution .

For decades , many East Berliners tried to cross the wall and escape to freedom .
Some succeeded , but others did not .
This became symbolic of the desire for freedom in Communist countries .
It all came to an end in 1989 when the wall ’s guards got ordered to stand down .
East Berliners rushed to the wall to escape to the west .
West Berliners cheered them on , but it did n’t stop there .
Within days bulldozers on both sides of the wall tore it down to cheers from the people .
The wall ’s fall became symbolic worldwide in more ways than one .
It showed the German people ’s desire for unity as a single nation .
It showed the weakness and failure of the Communist system .
And more than anything else , it began the end of the Cold War .
Only two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , the Soviet Union itself had fallen .
World War One is also remembered as the Great War .
This is usually seen in sources dating back to before WWII .
There are several reasons why World War 1 got that name .
One reason is that all the great nations of the world at the time fought in the war .
Another reason is the sheer number of dead at its end , about 40 million .
Finally , the end of the war saw the world ’s map redrawn .
Four empires had fallen : Germany , Russia , Austria - Hungary , and the Ottomans .
New nations had risen from their ruins , particularly in Eastern Europe .
The Marco Polo Bridge Incident set off the Second Sino - Japanese War .
Here ’s something little - known from historical events facts .
To most people , WWII started in 1939 with the German invasion of Poland .
For Japan and China , it started in 1937 .
On July 7 , 1937 , an argument over a missing Japanese soldier led to a battle at Wanping .
Attempts by both sides to negotiate failed .
On July 25 , the Battle of Beiping - Tianjin began .
The Second Sino - Japanese
War had also begun and ended only with Japan ’s surrender in 1945 .
World War
Two was the most devastating war in history .
It ’s not hard to see why .
70 million people died all over the world in that war .
The worst part of it all was that more than half of those who died were civilians .
And most of those 40 million dead civilians were targets of both parties .
Most infamous of all is the Holocaust when the Germans rounded up and killed 6 million Jews .
The German invasion of the Soviet Union also saw over 19 million civilians killed .
In the Pacific , the Japanese killed over 10 million civilians over the course of the war .
But the Allies also killed their fair share of civilians .
Over 500,000 people died in Germany alone during the bombings of 1943 - 1944 .
And the US nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 also killed 300,000 people .
The poison gas used in the Holocaust was Zyklon - B . It means Cyclone - B in English .
It ’s made from hydrogen cyanide and was a pesticide .
The Nazis instead used it in the gas chambers of the death camps like Auschwitz during the Holocaust .
It was estimated that Zyklon - B caused 1.1 million deaths in the death camps .
This is still in use today , but no longer as a pesticide .
Instead , it ’s used as a raw material in the chemical industry .
The name Zyklon - B is no longer in use and is known as Cyanosil today .
A grim example from historical events facts , to be sure .
The only nuclear attacks in history were on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 .
The USA developed nuclear weapons towards the end of WWII .
President Truman then decided to use them against Japan to force them to surrender .
He did this hoping to convince the Japanese to surrender immediately .
The alternative was to invade , with the expectation of tens of millions of casualties .
Hiroshima got bombed on August 6 , 1945 .
Three days later on August 9 , Nagasaki also got bombed .
The bombings killed an estimated 300,000 people .
But the President ’s gamble worked .
On August 15 , Emperor Hirohito of Japan surrendered to the Allies .

Johannes Gutenberg invented a printing press in 1440 .
Believe it or not , that simple invention changed world history .
Gutenberg ’s printing press was the first of its kind in Europe .
Before his invention , books and other written materials were handmade .
This made production slow and a luxury afforded only by the rich and powerful .
Thanks to his printing press , large amounts of written materials became available .
The public had access to literature whether religious , political or otherwise .
Literacy across Europe rose in the years and decades that followed .
This led to reasoned thinking and new ideas no longer limited to a small and privileged elite .
Everyone could now reason and come up with new ideas on their own .
The height of the Roman Empire was also known as the Pax Romana .
This is among the more well - known historical events facts .
In English , that means the Roman Peace .
It lasted for two hundred years , between the 1st and 2nd centuries AD .
It began with the reign of Emperor Augustus and ended with the reign of Emperor Commodus .
The legions kept the empire ’s enemies away and maintained the rule of law in the empire .
Traders and travelers alike could go from one end of the empire to the other .
The peace and prosperity were such that writers of this age thought it would last forever .
The poor reign of Emperor Commodus brought the Pax Romana to an end .
A century of civil wars , foreign invasions , and outbreaks of plague followed , but the Pax Romana was not forgotten though .
Instead , it became a golden age that many looked back to as inspiration for the future .
The Renaissance brought an end to the Middle Ages .
This period of history dominated the 15th and 16th centuries .
Its name means ‘ reawakening ’ .
This is because of the perception made in comparison to the Middle Ages that came before .
In the Renaissance , people did n’t limit themselves to living from one day to the next .
Neither did they spend so much time on matters of faith and religion .
Humanism , the idea that Man was the master of their fate and the world around them , was the rule of the day .
This was further encouraged by the rediscovery of the art and culture of Greece and Rome .
Forgotten and ignored since the fall of Rome , they inspired the people to new heights .
Art , history , law , music , and philosophy flourished .
The Renaissance only lasted two centuries and ended in war .
But its achievements set the stage for the rise of the modern world in the coming centuries .
Ancient Greece ’s victory in the Persian Wars allowed western civilization to rise .
The Persian Wars were a series of campaigns and battles between 499 and 449 BC .
At the time the Persians attempted to conquer Greece .
We ’re sure you ’ve watched the film 300 , which is a dramatization of the Battle of Thermopylae .
This battle was at the height of the Persian Wars , and the only one the Greeks lost .
Even then , it only inspired them to fight harder and win against the Persians .
If not for the Greek victory , western civilization would likely not exist .
The Roman Empire would never have arisen , and people may be speaking Persian in Europe today .
Something to think about from historical events facts .
Alexander the Great conquered his empire in only 13 years .
This empire was also the largest in the entire ancient world , 5000 km from west to east .
It stretched from Greece and Macedonia in the west , to India in the east .
And from Central Asia in the north , it stretched south to the Persian Gulf .
The empire did not last long , though .
Alexander ’s death at the age of 33 meant he failed to build a proper government for his empire .
After his death , his generals divided the empire between them .
Genghis Khan built the largest land empire on Earth .
Genghis Khan united the Mongols in the 13th century and led them out of their country .
In the following decades , they conquered the Mongol Empire .
Covering 14.7 million km2 of territory , it stretched from the Sea of Japan in the east to Kiev in the west .
And from Russia in the north , it stretched south to Vietnam .
Much like Alexander the Great ’s empire , the Mongol Empire got divided after Genghis Khan ’s death .

The Black Death killed between 75 to 200 million people across the world .
One of the most devastating pandemics in history was the Black Death of the 14th century .
The name comes from how the lymph nodes of the infected turned black and swollen .
It was thought that the disease came from China and spread with the Mongol invasions .
The Mongols brought the plague with them across the Middle East to Kaffa on the Black Sea .
Rats with infected fleas slipped aboard Italian ships , who brought them back to Italy .
And from there , the disease spread to the rest of Europe .
Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453 .
You ’ve heard of the city of Istanbul in Turkey .
That was n’t always its name though .
Before 1923 , the city ’s name was Constantinople .
It means the City of Constantine , who founded the city in the 4th century AD .
After Emperor Theodosius died , it became the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire .
The empire lasted until the 15th century when it was finally conquered by the Ottomans .
Colonialism lasted for 500 years .
The first western colonial empires were the Portuguese and Spanish Empires .
They rose during the 16th century but began to decline in the 17th century .
This was because of competition from other European nations .
This included Britain , France , Holland , and later on Germany , Italy , and even Belgium .
Colonialism brought western civilization and modern innovations to all corners of the world .
But with the good came the bad , such as exploitation and racism .
The deaths and cost of WWI weakened colonialism , but it only ended after WWII .
Even then the scars and legacy of the colonial era continue to haunt the world .
At least 17,000 people died in the Reign of Terror .
The French and American Revolutions saw the beginning of modern democracy .
But the French Revolution also saw the Reign of Terror and its infamous guillotine .
Aristocrats , the rich , and those with royalist sympathies died in the name of public order .
But royalist sympathies soon became an excuse to kill those on whom the mob ’s displeasure fell .
By the time the Reign of Terror ended , an estimated 17,000 people died in executions .
The most famous victims were the former King Louis XVI and his wife , Marie Antoinette .
The American Civil War brought an end to slavery .
Before the civil war , the USA had been the biggest market for slaves from Africa .
This led to controversy across the country , especially in the north .
Their industrialization and American ideals of freedom and equality drove the issue .
In the south though , slavery became necessary to work the fields .
The election of Abraham Lincoln who was a known abolitionist led to a crisis .
This , in turn , led to the secession of the Confederacy and the beginning of the civil war .
The Union ’s victory not only ended the Confederacy but ended slavery once and for all .
The end of the demand for slaves in America collapsed the slave market worldwide .
The Industrial Revolution completely changed both civilization and society .
For most of human history , civilization and society were agrarian in nature .
Most people worked in farms growing crops or watched over herds of animals .
The 19th century ’s Industrial Revolution changed that .
Farming machinery meant farming no longer needed as many laborers as before .
Jobless men migrated to the cities , where they found new work .
This new work involved operating the machines that make up the modern industry .
While the Industrial Revolution had many effects , this was the start of it all .
That is the reorientation of civilization and society from agriculture to industry .

The Medical Revolution began with the development of vaccines .
The first vaccine was against smallpox , developed by Edward Jenner in 1798 .
Other doctors would follow his lead in the decades to come .
Vaccines for diseases like anthrax , measles , mumps , and rabies among others soon followed .
These developments were often accompanied by laws requiring vaccination .
But vaccines were only the beginning of modern medicine .
Germ theory and the field of bacteriology only sped up the growth of modern medicine .
The assassination of Archduke Franz - Ferdinand started WWI .
Big things have small beginnings .
We ’re sure you ’ve heard of that before , and usually in a good way .
This time it ’s not .
In June 1914 , Archduke Franz - Ferdinand of Austria - Hungary rode an open car in Sarajevo .
A Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip shot the archduke and his wife dead .
This simple act of nationalism started a war that would kill 40 million people .
Like we here at historical events facts said , big things have small beginnings .
The October Revolution began the Soviet takeover of the former Russian Empire .
By now it seems a given that revolutions end with the rise of freedom and democracy .
The October Revolution of 1917 in Russia would prove that wrong .
There were actually two revolutions that year .
The first was in February and saw the Tsar abdicate and Russia become a republic .
The republic ’s decision to keep fighting WWI caused public anger , as the people had grown tired of the war .
Preying on this , the Soviets gained support in the October Revolution .
Their taking power and making peace with Germany started the Russian Civil War .
And following the civil war ’s end in 1922 , the Soviet Union was born .
A sad example of a dream of freedom betrayed , from historical events facts .
The Great Depression is the worst economic depression in history .
Well , it ’s not called the ‘ Great Depression ’ for nothing .
Making it even worse was how it began .
The years before the depression were prosperous with low unemployment and high growth .
Then on October 24 , 1929 , the New York Stock Exchange crashed .
This started bankruptcies , layoffs , and the like which saw unemployment reach record highs .
It would take a decade of economic and financial reforms for the economy to recover .
And even then , it took the industrial demands of WWII for that recovery to finish .
The Soviet Union put the first manmade satellite in space on October 4 , 1957 .
That satellite ’s name was Sputnik .
In Russian , it means ‘ traveling companion ’ , though it could also mean ‘ satellite ’ .
Sputnik ’s launch came as a shock for the USA .
No one had expected the Soviets capable of such a feat ahead of them .
Now there ’s something interstellar from historical events facts .
Yuri Gagarin was the first man in space .
On April 12 , 1961 , Yuri Gagarin rode Vostok - 1 to space .
He completed one orbit around the Earth before returning on the same day .
Once again , the news shocked the USA , and for the same reason as with Sputnik .
That said , thousands of Americans sent letters of congratulations to Yuri Gagarin .
Despite the Cold War and being from the Soviet Union , he had made history .

The assassination of US President John F. Kennedy was on November 22 , 1962 .
A tragic , but unforgettable example from historical events facts .
At the time the president was parading in an open car in Dallas , Texas .
Also with him was his wife Jacqueline Kennedy and the Governor of Texas , Jon Connally .
At 12:30 PM , Lee Harvey Oswald shot the president and governor with a rifle from a nearby building .
The president and governor were both rushed to a hospital , but only the governor survived .
President Kennedy died 30 minutes after his arrival in the hospital .
The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. was on April 4 , 1968 Martin Luther King Jr. was a Christian minister who led the Civil Rights movement in America .
Like Gandhi in India , King refused to use or support violence to achieve his goals .
Instead , he used civil disobedience such as demonstrations and marches .
On April 4 , 1968 , King was staying at the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis , Tennessee .
While standing on a balcony in the evening , James Earl Rey shot him with a rifle .
King went to a hospital but died less than an hour later .
King Hammurabi of Babylon introduced the world ’s first known legal code in 1754 BC .
This code is also known as the Code of Hammurabi .
Half of it deals with business law , while another third of the code is about family law .
The code is particularly known for its following the principle of ‘ eye for an eye ’ .
Gunpowder was first discovered in China during the 9th century AD .
And by accident at that .
Chinese alchemists were actually trying to discover the Elixir of Life .
It was going to make the Emperor immortal .
Instead , they discovered gunpowder .
Over the following centuries , gunpowder found a place in war .
These included bombs , fire arrows , and even a kind of gun .
Gunpowder spread beyond China through the Mongols , coming with them all the way to Europe .
Talk about something explosive from historical events facts .
Norse explorers reached America before Columbus did .
Christopher Columbus is usually credited for discovering America .
But in fact , Norse explorers from Scandinavia reached it as far back as the 9th century AD .
They even founded colonies of their own at Vinland , in what is now Canada .
These colonies were long abandoned by the time Columbus made his journey , though .
The Crusaders slaughtered helpless Muslims at the end of the First Crusade .
There ’s a shocking fact from historical events facts .
When people think of crusaders , they usually think of knights in shining armor who can do no wrong .
Those only exist in stories and fairy tales though .
When Pope Urban II proclaimed the First Crusade in 1095 , the crusaders had other motives .
They looked forward to the chance to carve out kingdoms of their own in the Middle East .
In 1099 , they captured Jerusalem and slaughtered their Muslim prisoners .
Afterward , they carved out kingdoms of their own , as they wanted at the beginning .
Something of a reality check from historical events facts .

Minamoto no Yoritomo became the first shogun in 1192 .
Shogun was a military and political position in medieval Japan .
They were military dictators , governing in the Emperor ’s name .

Ferdinand Magellan died in the Philippines on April 27 , 1521 .
Ferdinand Magellan left Spain on September 20 , 1519 , to find a western route to Asia .
He arrived in the Philippines on March 16 , 1521 .
He immediately began attempting to convert the natives to Christianity .
Though he met some success , the native ruler Lapulapu refused to convert .
Magellan tried to force the issue but was instead killed in the Battle of Mactan .
After his death , his crew continued their journey and returned to Spain on September 6 , 1522 .
They were the first to travel around the world , proving it round once and for all .
Though Magellan failed to survive the journey , he shared in the credit even after his death .
The English defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588 .
During the 16th century , Europe fought a series of wars over the issue of religion .
The Protestant Reformation had divided Europe between Catholic and Protestant countries .
In 1588 , Catholic Spain sent its armada to begin an invasion of Protestant England .
Instead , the English destroyed the armada in a great victory for the Protestant cause .
More important was how this victory marked the beginning of the end of the Spanish Empire .
Later on , Britain began to rise as the biggest empire on Earth .
Nicholas Copernicus published On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres in 1543 .
People once thought that the Sun , Moon , stars , and other planets orbited the Earth .
This went as far back as Greco - Roman times and received support from the church .
But in 1543 , Nicholas Copernicus used scientific evidence to show otherwise .
The Earth and other planets orbited the Sun .
This was a controversial position to make and earned Copernicus the church ’s anger .
In the end , though , Copernicus was right .
The Thirty Years War was the bloodiest in history until WWI .
The Thirty Years War took place between 1618 to 1648 .

In the end , it became a war over which nation would lead Europe .
France under Louis XIII , or the Holy Roman Empire under Ferdinand III .
It ended with the Peace of Westphalia , which saw the empire weakened and France dominant .
It also ended with 8 million deaths , of which only 200,000 were soldiers .

This defeat also marked the beginning of the slow decline of the Ottoman Empire .
Isaac Newton published the Principia Mathematica in 1687 .
Newton ’s Principia Mathematica contained his research and findings on motion and gravity .
They became the definitive texts on physics until the 20th century .

Mr DeLay appeared in a court in Austin , Texas for the first time since his indictment on conspiracy and money laundering charges .
But his formal charging - known as an arraignment in the US - was delayed pending a hearing on a request from his lawyer for a new judge to be appointed to the case .
During today 's brief hearing , the congressman 's lawyer Dick DeGuerin said Judge Bob Perkins had donated money to MoveOn.org , a ' liberal political campaign group ' , whose website had been selling T - shirts bearing an image of his client .
The judge said he had not seen or bought such a T - shirt and could not recall donating to the group since before the 2004 election , " when they were helping [ Democrat presidential candidate ] John Kerry " .
He said the best way to handle the request for a new judge would be to adjourn the proceedings .
It was not clear when a hearing would be held to settle Mr DeGuerin 's motion .
Mr DeLay , who was photographed and fingerprinted yesterday at the Harris County sheriff 's office and released on £ 5,600 bail , did not speak during today 's 10 minute hearing and was not called on to make a plea .
At a news conference outside the courthouse , Mr DeGuerin said : " All we want is a fair trial before a fair tribunal . "
But prosecutor Ronnie Earle , whom Mr DeLay has repeatedly denounced as a Democratic partisan , brushed aside the request for a new judge .
" What this means is if a judge had contributed to Crime Stoppers that judge could not hear a burglary case , " Mr Earle said .
" Carried to its extreme , that is what I think this motion means and I think that 's absurd .
We do n't live in a country where political party determines the measure of justice . "
Until the charges were announced , Mr DeLay was the Republican leader in the House of Representatives , the second most powerful position in the chamber .
A close George Bush ally , he was forced under the chamber 's rules to stepped aside from his role as majority leader to fight the allegations .
He is known for his conservative politics and fundraising and has been a central figure in securing the current Republican domination of Washington and its lobbying system .
Mr DeLay and two political associates are charged over an alleged scheme to launder £ 108,00 by funnelling corporate donations to Republican candidates for the Texas legislature .
State law prohibits the use of corporate donations to elect or defeat state candidates .
All three deny wrongdoing .
The charges arise from a campaign in which Republicans gained control of the legislature , then used their new majority to force through a redistricting plan that won the party additional seats in the House of Representatives .
The court proceeding comes at a time when Mr Bush 's popularity is at a low ebb and the Republicans beset by other ethical or criminal investigations , including stock sales by the party 's senate leader , Bill Frist , and a grand jury inquiry into whether top Bush administration aides leaked the name of a covert CIA officer .
Is that a condom in your pocket or do you want a fine ?
That is the question police in a Colombian town may soon be asking all males over the age of 14 as part of a scheme to cut the rate of HIV infections .
William Peña , a councillor in the town of Tuluá , has proposed that males be forced to carry condoms in the same way they have to carry national identity cards .
Anyone caught without a condom would have to pay a small fine or attend a three - hour Aids prevention class , according to Mr Peña .
" For the first three months of the statute the penalties for not carrying a condom would be merely educational , " he told El Tiempo newspaper .
" This is a country with a lot of sexual activity and Tuluá is no exception .
This measure would not oblige anyone to have sex , only to protect themselves . "
Tuluá , a town of 190,000 people , registered 14 deaths from sexually transmitted diseases last year .
A poll has indicated that males become sexually active at about the age of 15 .
Mr Peña says previous Aids prevention campaigns have been " misguided " .
" They say 'use a condom ' instead of ' carry a condom and then use it ' .
If you 're always carrying a condom it is much easier to use it , that 's why I made my proposal , " he said .
The proposal has caused a stir among church leaders in the deeply Catholic country .
Father Jesús Velásquez of the local church said he would not let the measure pass without a fight , comparing it to " selling guns in the streets .
What we need is education and respect for moral and Christian values . "
The deputy health minister , Eduardo Alvarado , also questioned the proposal and said condom use should not be obligatory .
" The best thing is to raise awareness and motivate people , " he said .
Mr Peña 's proposal will be voted on when the town council resumes sessions next month .

Brisbane , Australia -
At a breakfast seminar here June 6 on " Factors for IT Project Success and Failure , " Prof. June Verner of NICTA ( the National Information and Communication Technology institute of Australia ) provided a fascinating mix of surprises and predictables related to her subject topic .
The findings came from NICTA ’s study of 400 projects in the U.S. , Australia , and Chile , using questionnaires and interviews to discuss success and failure factors with practitioners .
What were the surprises ?
Most projects that had no schedule were successful
Requirements are needed for project success , but not necessarily early in the project
Projects often continue successfully for some time with unclear requirements
The choice of requirements methodology does not matter ; UML was " no help "
Using a development methodology was a success factor , especially when it was " appropriate to the application "
Very few projects use risk management , and those that do rarely manage those risks
Post mortem reviews are rarely held , and when they are it is almost always on successful projects
In the U.S. ( but not elsewhere ) , developers are involved in project estimation only when there are poor requirements ( Verner speculated that this is because the powers that be were looking for someone to blame ! )
And the predictables ?
Success comes from a culture that investigates and deals with problems
The vision for the project ( its business goals ) must be shared among all project personnel , especially the project manager
Project managers should be involved in the estimation activity
Project managers should be good at customer and developer communication ; they need not be good at the technology
There was some interesting data from the study , as well : 60 % of organizations have no process to measure benefits
86 % of projects had a business case , but 60 % ignored it
33 % of projects said they had no risks , but 62 % of those failed
49 % or organizations have had ( one or more ) project failures
In one - third of the projects , the project manager had no say in schedule / budget targets
75 % of projects were underestimated , none were overestimated
5 % of projects had no project manager ; 16 % changed project manager at least once ( and that was correlated with project failure )
Verner also asked developers what their criteria were for project success .
They said :
They had a sense they had delivered a quality product
They had a sense of achievement
They had enough independence to work creatively
The requirements were met and the system worked as intended ###

Think twice about glass entertainment centers
Monday , August 21 , 2006
I stumbled onto an article at the AVS forums about a couple and their glass entertainment center that exploded .
They had a plasma TV on it when it exploded but they got lucky and were able to make sure the plasma did n't crash to the floor .
Looking at the stand it seems like it needs more support in the middle , also tempered glass or safety glass is not supposed to explode and go everywhere .
Looks like there was a shortcut taken in the manufacturing of this .
A poster on the AVS forums mentioned what if there was a small child in front of the tv ?..
Yea no shit about that .
The company that made the entertainment center is not responding to any calls or e-mails so they are dodging responsibility for it .
Here are the companies to avoid :
Avdeco Inc ( maker of the entertainment stand )
The online dealer who sold it to them : Threshold Concepts
The case for impeaching President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney is far stronger than the case against President Bill Clinton or the impending case that drove President Nixon to resign .
With Republican control of Congress , especially of the House where impeachment must originate , it is hardly surprising that impeachment of the Republican Bush administration is a dead letter .
What is surprising is that conservatives with a long tradition of adulation for the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights have not been up in arms against the Bush regime ’s all - out assault on the foundation of America ’s political system .
Instead , the case for impeachment has come from the left wing .
This weakens the case , because it can be portrayed as a partisan political move instead of a last - ditch attempt to save the Constitution .
In Impeach the President : The Case Against Bush and Cheney , edited by Dennis Loo and Peter Phillips , left - wing professors , journalists , and activists present a 300 - page , 12 - count indictment .
It is for the most part a sound indictment .
A conservative American constitutionalist who loves his country can find little in the case for impeachment to take exception to .
Despite the strength of the case for impeachment , I do not think it will happen , because Bush has convinced Americans that his crimes against truth , the U.S. Constitution , and the Geneva Conventions are necessary measures in the “ war against terrorists . ”
As long as Americans understand 9/11 as an attack on America by “ Islamo - fascism , ” the executive branch will have wide latitude in usurping liberty .
Seymour Hersh in his book Chain of Command asks ,
“ How did eight or nine neoconservatives redirect the government and rearrange long - standing American priorities and policies with so much ease ?
How did they overcome the bureaucracy , intimidate the press , mislead the Congress , and dominate the military ?
Is our democracy that fragile ? ”
“ How indeed ? ” ask the editors of Impeach the President .
Their answer seems to be that the Democrats have been intimidated and “ truth and facts have been barricaded off from reaching most of the American people . ”
The editors have faith in the American people to do the right thing if only they can find out the truth .
It is refreshing to see that the Left , unlike the neoconservatives , believes in the American system .
However , as Claes Ryn indicates in his book America the Virtuous , it would appear that the American system has been eroded over the decades by the rise of the new Jacobin ideology known as neoconservatism .
In columns available on Antiwar.com on Oct. 12 , Leon Hadar and William S. Lind point out that the Democrats are as neoconized as the neoconized Republicans .
There is no difference .
At a recent conference hosted by the journal The National Interest , it was the Democrat Will Marshall , president and founder of the Progressive Policy Institute , who sounded like Richard Perle and William Kristol , not the Republican Stefan Halper , who served in the Reagan administration .
Halper presented a devastating critique of Bush ’s neocon foreign policy .
The problem is not that the Democrats are intimidated .
The problem is that the Democrats are part of the problem .
The editors of Impeach the President indirectly acknowledge this fact when they report that Congress “ looked the other way ” when Bush acknowledged that he lied to cover up his felony of illegally spying on U.S. citizens and declared the real criminal to be the NSA official who blew the whistle .
Democrats , no less than Republicans , have permitted the Bush regime to violate the separation of powers and the rule of law .
A branch of government that no longer defends its power is a branch of government that no longer believes in its power .
Just as the Reichstag faded away for Hitler , the U.S. Congress has faded away for the Bush administration .
Claes Ryn is correct when he says a change of mind has occurred .
The Constitution and the political system based on it are on the ropes because the players no longer believe in them .
They believe in executive power to act forcefully in behalf of “ American exceptionalism . ”
Civil libertarians rely on the judiciary to defend constitutional rights , but the Supreme Court has been compromised by Bush ’s appointments of Roberts and Alito , men who believe in “ energy in the executive . ”
Without support from Congress , the judiciary cannot protect civil liberty .
With the passage of the recent detainee and spy bills , Congress has allied itself with the Bush regime against civil liberty .
Beliefs are more important than institutions .
Michael Polanyi wrote that if people believed in the principles of Stalinism , democracy would uphold Stalinism .
If people believe in American hegemony , they will not complain when barriers to hegemonic actions are removed .
If people believe fighting terrorism is more important than civil liberty , they will lose civil liberty .
What America needs to refurbish is its beliefs .
Without renewing our beliefs , we cannot renew our civil liberties and hold government accountable .

Monday Musing : Cocktail Party Conversation Permit
It is a frequently observed phenomenon that the less educated and intelligent people are , the more they tend to have decisive and strong opinions on the most complex political , philosophical , economic , and other pressing issues .
You know the kind of person I am talking about , the one who is eager to quickly diagnose and solve a world problem or two with a single profound proclamation at every cocktail party .
Like the two urbane and seemingly well - educated and well - dressed slightly older gentlemen I once overheard at a dinner party in Karachi ( and there are plenty here in America , or anywhere for that matter ) saying with great conviction ( and with extremely thoughtful expressions on their faces , and in ponderous cadences , as if they were straining under the burden of a massive feat of cognitive strength and skill ) :
1st Guy : " Pakistan 's only problem has always been that our leaders lack sincerity . "
2nd Guy : " No , no , no .
Our only problem has always been that our leaders lack committment . "
The first guy then actually carefully considered this pearl of wisdom from political philosopher and all - round theorist # 2 and finally , having reevaluated his own sophisticated worldview in the light of this new gem , dumped it unceremoniously , humbly but gravely declaring defeat : " Yes ... I see ... you are right ... it is a matter of committment . "
In the throes of the cringing frustration one feels when faced with this sort of cretinism , I have sometimes felt that people should have to be licensed to spew profundities at cocktail parties , otherwise they should only be allowed to speak about either the weather or quantum theory .
And the license would be received after demonstrating the ability to think about really , really , simple problems by passing a test .
The idea , of course , being that if you can't think lucidly , logically , creatively and successfully about very simple problems where all the information required to solve them is present in their statement , and which have very clear and demonstrable solutions , what the &[ email protected ] # makes you think you should be engaging hard and incredibly complicated and intricate issues ?
Okay , okay , for the last nine days or so I was out of town and very busy and that is my excuse for not writing a substantive column today .
( Perhaps some of you noticed that I was n't posting all of last week ? )
Instead , now that I have given you some motivation to try and think about simple problems , I present a challenge to you : solve some logical and mathematical puzzles that my friend Alex Freuman sent me .
Alex teaches high school physics and math at La Guardia High School here in Manhattan .
( It was the model for the high school in the movie Fame . )
I had seen some of the puzzles before but not others , and it took me a while to solve some of those .
The first person to email me ( click " About Us " at the top left of this page for my email ) a full list of correct solutions , wins the privilege of writing one of our Monday columns for November 20th .
Okay , so it 's not a huge prize , but hey , if you 've got something to say , here 's your chance .
And , of course , you will have earned the cocktail party conversational permit as far as I am concerned .
Do n't look up the solutions , and please do n't post solutions in the comments .
Try to do all of them yourself .
Believe me , even if you have to think for some days about a problem before you get it , there is a huge satisfaction and mental reward in doing so yourself .
And you will feel more confident of yourself too .
I shall , of course , trust you not to cheat .
Here they are :
You are given two ropes and a lighter .
This is the only equipment you can use .
You are told that each of the two ropes has the following property : if you light one end of the rope , it will take exactly one hour to burn all the way to the other end .
But it does n't have to burn at a uniform rate .
In other words , half the rope may burn in the first five minutes , and then the other half would take 55 minutes .
The rate at which the two ropes burn is not necessarily the same , so the second rope will also take an hour to burn from one end to the other , but may do it at some varying rate , which is not necessarily the same as the one for the first rope .
Now you are asked to measure a period of 45 minutes .
How will you do it ?
You have 50 quarters on the table in front of you .
You are blindfolded and cannot discern whether a coin is heads up or tails up by feeling it .
You are told that x coins are heads up , where 0 < x < 50 .
You are asked to separate the coins into two piles in such a way that the number of heads up coins in both piles is the same at the end .
You may flip any coin over as many times as you like .
How will you do it ?
A farmer is returning from town with a dog , a chicken and some corn .
He arrives at a river that he must cross , but all that is available to him is a small raft large enough to hold him and one of his three possessions .
He may not leave the dog alone with the chicken , for the dog will eat it .
Furthermore , he may not leave the chicken alone with the corn , for the chicken will eat it .
How can he bring everything across the river safely ?
You have four chains .
Each chain has three links in it .
Although it is difficult to cut the links , you wish to make a loop with all 12 links .
What is the fewest number of cuts you must make to accomplish this task ?
Walking down the street one day , I met a woman strolling with her daughter .
“ What a lovely child , ” I remarked .
“ In fact , I have two children , ” she replied .
What is the probability that both of her children are girls ?
Be warned : this question is not as trivial as it may look .
Before you lie three closed boxes .
They are labeled “ Blue Jellybeans ” , “ Red Jellybeans ” and “ Blue & Red Jellybeans . ”
In fact , all the boxes are filled with jellybeans .
One with just blue , one with just red and one with both blue and red .
However , all the boxes are incorrectly labeled .
You may reach into one box and pull out only one jellybean .
Which box should you select from to correctly label the boxes ?
A glass of water with a single ice cube sits on a table .
When the ice has completely melted , will the level of the water have increased , decreased or remain unchanged ?
You are given eight coins and told that one of them is counterfeit .
The counterfeit one is slightly heavier than the other seven .
Otherwise , the coins look identical .
Using a simple balance scale , can you determine which coin is counterfeit using the scale only twice ?
There are two gallon containers .
One is filled with water and the other is filled with wine .
Three ounces of the wine are poured into the water container .
Then , three ounces from the water container are poured into the wine .
Now that each container has a gallon of liquid , which is greater : the amount of water in the wine container or the amount of wine in the water container ?
Late one evening , four hikers find themselves at a rope bridge spanning a wide river .
The bridge is not very secure and can hold only two people at a time .
Since it is quite dark , a flashlight is needed to cross the bridge and only one hiker had brought his .
One of the hikers can cross the bridge in one minute , another in two minutes , another in five minutes and the fourth in ten minutes .
When two people cross , they can only walk as fast as the slower of the two hikers .
How can they all cross the bridge in 17 minutes ?
No , they cannot throw the flashlight across the river .
Other than the North Pole , where on this planet is it possible to walk one mile due south , one mile due east and one mile due north and end up exactly where you began ?
I was visiting a friend one evening and remembered that he had three daughters .
I asked him how old they were .
“ The product of their ages is 72 , ” he answered .
Quizzically , I asked , “ Is there anything else you can tell me ? ” “ Yes , ” he replied , “ the sum of their ages is equal to the number of my house . ”
I stepped outside to see what the house number was .
Upon returning inside , I said to my host , “ I ’m sorry , but I still ca n’t figure out their ages . ”
He responded apologetically , ‘ I ’m sorry .
I forgot to mention that my oldest daughter likes strawberry shortcake . ”
With this information , I was able to determine all of their ages .
How old is each daughter ?
I assure you that there is enough information to solve the puzzle .
The surface of a distant planet is covered with water except for one small island on the planet ’s equator .
On this island is an airport with a fleet of identical planes .
One pilot has a mission to fly around the planet along its equator and return to the island .
The problem is that each plane only has enough fuel to fly a plane half way around the planet .
Fortunately , each plane can be refueled by any other plane midair .
Assuming that refuelings can happen instantaneously and all the planes fly at the same speed , what is the fewest number of planes needed for this mission ?
You find yourself in a room with three light switches .
In a room upstairs stands a single lamp with a single light bulb on a table .
One of the switches controls that lamp , whereas the other two switches do nothing at all .
It is your task to determine which of the three switches controls the light upstairs .
The catch : once you go upstairs to the room with the lamp , you may not return to the room with the switches .
There is no way to see if the lamp is lit without entering the room upstairs .
How do you do it ?
There are two gallon containers .
One is filled with water and the other is filled with wine .
Three ounces of the wine are poured into the water container .
Then , three ounces from the water container are poured into the wine .
Now that each container has a gallon of liquid , which is greater : the amount of water in the wine container or the amount of wine in the water container ?
In case no one gets all the answers right , the highest score wins .
In the case of a tie , whoever gets me the next correct answer first wins .
And keep in mind that by no means am I suggesting that everyone should get the solutions of all the problems .
Some of them are hard , and if you can't figure them out , do n't worry about it .
But keep trying !
Thanks for sending the problems , Alex , and sorry but you are disqualified .
Ready , set , go !
UPDATE : We have a winner !

Kategorija : Slovenija | Datum objave : Wednesday , 11 . 10 . 2006 | Avtor : Domen Savič
Ker se je v slovenskem spletnem političnem prostoru pred kratkim pojavila nova zveza spletnih dnevnikov , smo se pri E - demokracija.si odločili za komparativno analizo spletnih dnevnikov Liberalne demokracije Slovenija ter Slovenske nacionalne stranke .
Pozicija :
Spletni dnevniki LDS so pozicionirani na sredini spodaj , najdemo pa jih takoj .
Pisci so predstavljeni s fotografijami , ki pa so na žalost premajhne za vizualno prepoznavnost .
Spletni dnevniki slovenske nacionalne stranke so sicer vidni , vendar le , ko dejansko pridemo na spletno stran njihove mariborske “ podružnice ” .
Točka gre LDS , saj smo mnenja , da veliko več ljudi obiskuje domačo spletno stran SNS kot pa SNS Maribor .
Oblika :
SNS uporablja preverjen programski paket WordPress , LDS uporablja nam neznan ECP2 .
Oba dobro opravljata svoje delo , čeprav je preglednost in berljivost zapisov na spletnem mestu SNS boljša , črke so večje , prav tako pa ima SNS Maribor bolj pokategorizirane zapise , medtem ko LDS uporablja le variablo avtorja .
Poleg tega spletni dnevniki SNS Maribor podpirajo RSS tok podatkov , ki je zelo dobrodošla funkcija .
Omogoče je tudi lažje preklapljanje med avtorji , medtem ko moramo pri LDS ( pre) večkrat klikati .
Tako je oblikovno močnejši SNS .
Vsebina :
Medtem ko LDS objavlja povzetke člankov ter intevjujev in na drugi strani vsebine , pisane posebej za spletne dnevnike , se SNS zaenkrat zanaša na krajše uvode in povezave do dokumentov v formatu .doc in pdf .
WordPress omogoča objavljanje daljših kosov besedila , tako da je povezovanje nepotrebno ter zamudno , saj je potrebno datoteke najprej pretočiti na trdi disk in jih šele nato odpreti .
SNS svetujemo , naj izjave ter komentarje objavi neposredno na spletnem dnevniku .
Vsebinsko so močnejši LDS , vseeno pa bi od obeh pričakovali več .
Skupna ocena :
Zaenkrat vodi LDS , vendar pa ima SNS večji potencial .
Če bo le znala vpreči retoriko , ki jo s pridom uporablja tudi v državnem zboru , se ji za uspeh in odmevnost spletnega dnevnika ni potrebno bati .
Pohvalna je uporaba RSS toka podatkov , manjka pa vsebine , prisotno pa je tudi nepraktično povezovanje .doc in .pdf dokumentov .
Pri LDS je ravno obratno .
Vsebine je več , manjka pa RSS tok podatkov .
The Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman has ruled that the Apple iTunes service breaks the law , and has given the company two weeks to fix the problem .
In January , the Consumer Council asked the Ombudsman to look at iTunes because of concerns that it breaks consumer protection law .
Today 's decision backs that complaint .
According to the ruling , iTunes breaks section 9a of the Norwegian Marketing Control Act .
The regulator said it was not reasonable that the consumer must sign up to a contract regulated by English law , rather than Norwegian law .
It also said iTunes must accept responsibility for damage its software may do , and said it is unreasonable to alter terms and conditions after a song has been sold .
Consumer Council senior advisor Torgeir Waterhouse told the Reg : " The Consumer Council has asked Apple to respond as to whether iTunes should work on other platforms - they have until 21 June to respond .
After that the Ombudsman is likely to set another deadline and then start fining the company . "
Waterhouse said the Ombudsman is not a toothless watchdog - back in April it fined Ryanair € 62,500 for illegally charging refund fees .
The council is not only concerned by iTunes .
It says several other download services in Norway also break consumer protection law and it expects the Ombudsman to take similar action against them .
Apple has to respond by 21 June or face fines .

" I had no idea that this was even necessary until I found your site , then I realized that I had n't rewound any of them and I certainly do n't have the time to rewind them one by one !
Heck , I would n't even know how to do it ! " --
Actual email from Lou in Denver
" Love Your service !
When will I be getting my DVDs back ? " -- Lori in Colorado " I received the wrong DVD back .
Your customer service representative sounded drunk and swore at me . " -- George in Edmonton " Still have n't received my DVD 's back . " -- Lori in Colorado
" Love the service !
Does blue - ray take longer to rewind ? " --
Steve in Arkansas " Great service !
There 's nothing like getting good value , so I checked out your BlankSheetofpaper.com utility as well .
It 's fantastic !
Can you do the same thing with DVDs when I need a blank one ?
Thanks ! " -- Monroe in Kentucky
Most modern DVD players cut costs by not including a rewind button .
RewindDVDs fills the void by offering a free , mail in service to rewind any size DVD .
Why can't I rewind my own DVDs ?
Because most modern DVD players lack a rewind button .
Additionally , a modern DVD player simply does not have the technology to rewind DVDs as DVD tape is very tiny -- nearly invisible .
Our simple mail in service means that you no longer have to struggle with complicated software or use your finger .
How does it work ?
Simple !
Just mail your DVDs to : Mail in DVD Rewinding Service , Suite 141-200 , 6200 McKay Avenue , Burnaby , BC , V5H2P4 .
How long does it take to get my DVDs back after sending them in ?
Return times vary , of course , but we strive to return DVDs at a minimum of three to six months after the receipt of the item .
Our crack staff views each DVD , looking for defects such as nudity .
How much does it cost ?
You can be assured that RewindDVDs will always be free of charge .
Like this webpage , it makes money by intersplicing tiny ads into the movie before we return it .
You wo n't even notice them .
Why should I want my DVDs rewound ?
Rewound DVDs play 50 % faster than a regular DVD and smell like fresh lilacs .
You can watch a regular movie in just 45 minutes .
Do you take requests ?
Absolutely !
Here are the movies that I 'd like to see : " Westworld " , 1974 ; " Colossus , The Forbin Project " , 1970 ; " Death Race 2000 " , 1975 ; and " Last Holiday " 1950 .
Corporate Info : RewindDVDs is wholly owned by Mr. Benjamin Bradford , an expert in the IT field with over 20 years of experience .
Recently RewindDVDs welcomed its ten - thousandth visitor , and in a single day over 150 DVDs were forwarded to a poverty stricken village in the south of Africa .
Sadly , they do not own a DVD player and so use them as african neck rings .
If you have a technical question for Mr. Bradford , please forward all inquiries to bigdavediode at the email service gmail.com .
Debates in the aftermath of the Google Spreadsheet announcement have climbed the mountains and traversed the valleys of Google 's supposed master plan .
They 've covered the Google vs. Microsoft gorge , the trickling AdSense stream .
What they have n't discussed is the file format war , and I suspect that this is far more important than it may at first seem .
These days it 's not hard to pitch anything Google does as part of some brilliant strategy to dethrone Microsoft .
Despite the fact that the two company 's businesses touch at only a few points , the meme is that the two giants are fighting over the same pot of honey .
After snapping up Writely , a web - based word processor , Google 's eyes looked hungry for Microsoft 's Office cash cow .
The problem has been that , despite everyone 's assumption that the two are locked in battle , it 's not clear how a Google Office fits into Google 's business plans .
The question is made more complicated by the fact that there 's currently no shortage of Microsoft Office competitors out there , and some of them are even free .
There is no obvious link between Writely and Google Spreadsheet on the one hand , and Google 's search business on the other .
At least , it 's not anything the analysts are talking about .
Standing on the shoulders of open file formats
Even if Larry Page and Sergey Brin do n't have designs on toppling Microsoft Office , they do have a vested interest in toppling proprietary file formats ( well , save maybe Google 's own DRM ) .
After all , what makes Google 's Search possible ?
It 's the fact that the Internet is comprised almost entirely of " open " HTML documents .
The budding Google empire is built on top of an open file " format " with wide accessibility .
But there 's a huge disconnect between the Internet and the rest of the world .
While we marvel at the size of the web , we sometimes forgot about the mountains of word processor , spreadsheet , and database information housed " offline . "
And much of that is proprietary to some extent , stored in file formats that are not accessible or only semi-accessible to your average PC user with a web browser .
This is where the Open Document format ( ODF ) steps in .
As you may know , ODF is an open format for word processor , spreadsheet , database , and presentation files , based on XML .
Google 's Writely can import Microsoft Word 's DOC files , supports viewing and editing HTML documents , and ODF conversion is already supported as well .
Google Spreadsheet will support CSV and Excel 's file format , XLS , at launch .
ODF support is only a matter of time .
In my view , Writely and Google Spreadsheet are ultimately about promoting open file exchange and , eventually , the ODF file format .
Much in the same way that Adobe managed to make the PDF ubiquitous by meeting a need and giving away Acrobat Reader , Google can meet the need for casual office application users and can give it away for free .
With PDF , people were n't lying in the streets dying for it .
It met a need and quickly became the " lowest common denominator " for distributing documents with a modicum of complexity .
Adobe even made a few bucks selling PDF creation software ( at stiff prices ) .
ODF promises to do the same , but with far more flexibility , and without the expensive software on the creative side of the fence .
A month ago , ODF received approval from the ISO to become an international standard .
Some speculate that this has damped Microsoft 's chances for succeeding in its push to get approval for its own standard , OpenXML .
The thinking is that the ISO wo n't see the need for two different XML - based standards , so the race has already been won .
The prize is n't automatic ubiquity , however .
ODF still needs to be used , and this is where Google 's Office aspirations come into play .
Google Office is n't going to bury Microsoft Office .
Not even close .
Those who think it will carry the burden of proof .
OpenOffice and the like have already disproved the " if you build it , they will come " thesis .
They have n't come , if by " they " we mean a significant percentage of Microsoft Office 's user base .
This is n't to say that OpenOffice is bad , a failure , or anything else .
But it 's not taking the corporate world by storm , and it's not taking Joe Consumer 's desktop over , either .
If OpenOffice was meeting a strongly and widely perceived need , then it , much like Firefox , would be breaking download records and earning serious market share .
It 's not .
Google Office can make the ODF format more popular , however , because it wo n't require software downloads and installation , and let 's face it , it has that Google name attached to it , and will keep you on Google web properties .
this is why Google is n't backing OpenOffice .
Why bother when they can promote open exchange while at the same time drive people to their own web properties ?
It wo n't be hard for Dick or Jane to find Writely or Google Spreadsheet , and they 'll be able to read Microsoft 's formats , too , and wo n't need Internet Explorer to do it ( and they 'll be able to edit in addition to merely reading ) .
Better yet , they 'll be working in a data format that Google can plug into all of its various services without much worry .
It 's extensible , too .
An open standard for documents is everything Google wants .
If DOC and XLS currently rule the day , they may rue the day that modestly robust ODF editing tools for word processing and spreadsheets are only a " feeling lucky " click away .
And this is how ODF will become the default file format for Office 2010 or 2012 .
It 's not whether or not you 're using Word that matters to Google .
It will be whether or not you 're using ODF as a file format .
The first step in taking away dependence on an application ( or suite of applications ) is to take away the things that make it proprietary .
June 17 , 2005  --
We think of July and August as the peak of summer , but when it comes to sunburn , now is the peak .
Next Tuesday , June 21st , is the longest day of the year , when the sun is highest in the sky , so it 's now that the sun does the most damage .
Like most people , you probably think you know what to do about it .
You slather on the sunscreen when you 're out in the sun .
Our suntan lotions are good at screening out the sun 's UVB rays -- the ones that cause sunburn and skin cancers -- but most people do n't realize their sunscreens do n't offer much protection against UVA rays , the ones that put wrinkles in your skin .
" Ultraviolet A light ages your skin .
And the reason it does that , it 's a longer wavelength , so it can penetrate deeper into the skin , and instead of attacking the upper layers of the skin where skin cancer often forms , it attacks the layers that give your skin its tone , its elasticity , as we call it . …
You get the lines , the wrinkles , all the things associated from aging , " said Dr. Darrell Rigel , clinical professor of dermatology at New York University .
But there 's good news .
Lotions that contain the ingredients Oxybenzone , Titanium Dioxide or Parsol 1789 block out some UVA rays .
Doctors say a chemical called Mexoryl offers even better protection .
" It produces a product which gives us almost perfect protection against sunshine , " said Dr. Vincent DeLeo , chairman of dermatology at Columbia University .
People are happily protecting themselves with Mexoryl on the beaches of Rio de Janeiro , the streets of Paris , in Canada , Mexico and Australia .
Mexoryl " is the No. 1 individual ingredient in terms of protection from Ultraviolet A radiation , " Rigel said .
But even though dermatologists say Mexoryl is the best , you cannot legally buy it in the United States .
It 's illegal , because the Food and Drug Administration wo n't approve it .
They wo n't even say why .
The FDA is charged with making sure no drug is sold unless the government is convinced it 's safe and effective .
Dermatologists think it 's just stuck in the bureaucracy .
It routinely takes 12 to 15 years for a drug to get approval .
After an approved drug -- Vioxx , for example -- gets bad publicity as a health risk , the FDA gets particularly cautious .
But is there no common sense here ?
All drugs have risks as well as benefits .
Mexoryl has been in use in other countries for 13 years .
It 's passed many safety tests .
Why wo n't our FDA even talk about it ?
Although buying or selling sunscreens with Mexoryl is illegal in the United States , that does n't mean sunscreens with Mexoryl are n't bought and sold here .
We found it at some pharmacies .
It was expensive -- $ 30 to $ 50 .
" People really want this stuff .
People go to pharmacies and they keep it under the counter , like it's a secret ingredient , like prohibition or something and people will still buy it , " Rigel said .
I do n't fault the pharmacies , they 're serving their customers .
Everyone is always telling us , protect yourself from the sun , but then the government wo n't give us permission to have the best sunscreen ?
Give me a break .
I decided to see “ What The ( Bleep ) Do We Know ! ? ” ( sic ! ) .
I had avoided this film , as it looked like what Murray Gell - Mann calls quantum flapdoodle - distortions of quantum physics to support a mystical viewpoint .
But the “ what the bleep ” meme is growing , so I decided I should see it for myself .
Now I ’ve seen it I can confirm that it does distort quantum physics to support a mystical viewpoint .
But it is much more than that .
Much worse .
Hilariously so , in fact .
This post is rather long , but please read it to the end – there is a surprise there that will astonish you , I promise .
But I should start with the science .
Or , I should say :
The “ science ”
The premise of the film is that quantum mechanics proves a conscious observer is necessary to create reality .
The conclusion is we literally create reality with our thoughts .
Unfortunately the theory of quantum mechanics does not say this .
The film makers are confusing the theory of quantum mechanics with an interpretation of quantum mechanics .
This is an explanation to help understand what might be going on , but it is not part of the theory because it is not falsifiable : it can not be tested in such a way that , if it were false , it would fail the test ( without falsifying the whole of quantum mechanics , and therefore all the other interpretations too ) .
To falsify this interpretation you would have to see what would happen without a conscious observer monitoring the experiment .
But that ’s Catch - 22 : you need a conscious observer monitoring the experiment to see what happens .
You ca n’t look at the experiment without looking at it so no one can ever know if this interpretation is true .
Even if it were true , extrapolating to “ we literally create reality by out thoughts ” is applying reductionism to an absurd level .
Do n’t believe me ?
You do n’t have to because David Albert , the professor from the Columbia University physics department who was featured in the film , is quoted in Salon.com saying :
I was edited in such a way as to completely suppress my actual views about the matters the movie discusses .
I am , indeed , profoundly unsympathetic to attempts at linking quantum mechanics with consciousness .
Moreover , I explained all that , at great length , on camera , to the producers of the film ...
Had I known that I would have been so radically misrepresented in the movie , I would certainly not have agreed to be filmed .
( My bold . )
The ironic thing is that the film makers tell us quantum mechanics is oh - so - mysterious and ca n’t be explained - and then they explain it .
I am reminded of Richard Feynman ’s famous quote , " If you think you understand quantum mechanics , you do n't understand quantum mechanics " .
These film makers think they understand quantum mechanics .
They do n’t , but that does n’t stop them from making a film explaining it .
But it ’s just a consciousness - of - the - gaps explanation : we ca n’t explain it so it must be consciousness .
Any one of the many interpretations could be correct .
Or none of them might be correct , and the correct explanation is something not yet thought of .
Quantum mechanics is not telling us this is the way the universe necessarily is .
Baaaad examples
So they have the theory wrong , but they must have some good examples , right ?
Wrong .
They have three bad examples .
Appallingly bad , actually .
The first was the claim that when Columbus arrived in the West Indies , the natives were literally unable to see his ships .
Why ?
Because they had never seen ships before , so ships did not exist in their reality .
I had to rewind the film to make sure I had n’t missed the part where they said this was just a fable .
But they were stating it as fact .
This idea is just too dumb to be considered seriously .
Even if true , how could anyone verify it ?
I have searched the web for the source of this story to no avail , and conclude the film makers just made it up .
The second example was of the supposed “ Maharishi Effect . ”
John Hagelin of the Maharishi University , described how in 1993 , violent crime in Washington D.C. was reduced over a two month period , by 4000 people practicing transcendental meditation ( TM ) .
There were many problems with this experiment .
One was that the murder rate rose during the period in question .
Another was that Hagelin ’s report stated violent crime had been reduced by 18 % ( in the film he says 25 % ) , but reduced compared with what ?
How did he know what the crime rate would have been without the TM ?
It was discovered later that all the members of the “ independent scientific review board ” that scrutinized the project were followers of the Maharishi .
The study was pseudoscience : no double blinding , the reviewers were not independent , and the experiment has never been independently replicated .
Hagelin deservedly won an Ig Nobel Prize in 1994 for this outstanding piece of work .
The third example was the work of Masura Emoto , who tapes words to bottles of water .
The water is chilled and forms into crystals descriptive of the words used .
For example , if the word “ love ” is taped to a bottle , beautiful crystals form ; if the words “ you make me sick ” are used , ugly images appear .
What the film makers did n’t say is that Emoto knows the word used , and looks for a crystal that matches that word ( biased data selection ) .
To demonstrate a real effect , Emoto would need to be blind to the word used .
James Randi has said that if Emoto could perform this experiment double - blinded , it would qualify for the million dollar prize .
( He has never applied . )
Such a protocol would show there is no correlation between the words taped to a bottle and the crystals formed within .
These experiments have not been performed to a scientific protocol and have never been independently replicated .
Pert scam
The next segment was about neuro - peptides , how they are created in the brain , and regulate other cells in the body .
This was presented as another example of how the human brain ( consciousness ) , creates reality .
None of this would be new to anyone who has read Candace Pert ’s “ Molecules of Emotion ” .
Pert is a talented scientist who went woo woo many years ago for reasons I do n’t have time to go into here .
( Edited to add : see my May 2005 review of Molecules of Emotion . )
Suffice to say she has made many dubious claims , including this in the film :
Each cell has a consciousness , particularly if we define consciousness as the point of view of an observer .
I think what she saying is that when one cell interacts with another , it fulfills the role of the “ observer ” in quantum mechanics .
Well OK , but by that definition my toaster is conscious .
It ’s such a general definition of consciousness as to be meaningless : consciousness has to include some degree of self - awareness .
There is no evidence I ’ve heard of that individual cells are conscious .
This was followed by someone claiming he literally creates his day with his thoughts , plus some feel - good drivel about god and self that almost put me to sleep .
At the end , the main character in the film throws away her prescription meds because , since she creates her own reality , she does n’t need them .
( Do n’t try this at home . )
And that was it .
Channel No. 5
One thing that puzzled me was who were all the talking heads ?
I recognized a couple , but who was the bizarre guy who claimed he creates his day just by thinking about it , and who was the heavy - set blonde woman in the boxy red suit making the weird pronouncements in a funny accent ?
Normally in a documentary , the experts are introduced when they first appear .
But here they introduced them after the end of the film .
I was amused to see the guy who creates his own day , was a chiropractor .
But when I found out the identity of the blonde woman , my eyes nearly popped out .
I figured you would n’t believe me if I just told you , so I took a screenshot of it :
In case you ca n’t read the text , it says :
Ramtha Master Teacher – Ramtha School of Enlightenment Channeled by JZ Knight
They are stating as a fact , that one of the people you have been listening to for the previous 90 minutes , a main authority for the information being presented , is a 35,000 year old warrior spirit from Atlantis , being channeled by this Tacoma housewife turned cult leader .
The woman pictured is JZ Knight , but you are not listening to JZ Knight .
You are literally listening to Ramtha .
There were people who saw this film and did n’t say , “ That ’s just a woman putting on a funny accent ” .
Scary , huh ?
At this point the film lost any remaining pretence of being based on any kind of science or facts .
I did a little digging on Ramtha :
Ramtha is a 35,000 year - old spirit - warrior who appeared in J.Z. Knight ’s kitchen in Tacoma , Washington in 1977 .
Knight claims that she is Ramtha ’s channel .
She also owns the copyright to Ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks Hollywood ’s version of Elizabethan English in a guttural , husky voice .
She has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha at seminars ( $ 1,000 a crack ) and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment , and from the sales of tapes , books , and accessories ( Clark and Gallo 1993 ) .
She must have hypnotic powers .
Searching for self - fulfillment , otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold , muddy , doorless maze .
Upon further investigation I find the films ’ producers , writers , directors , and a number of the featured “ experts ” are members of the Ramtha School of Enlightenment .
The film is a propaganda piece for a cult .
What the ( Bleep ) Were They Thinking ?
I can answer that now .
They were thinking that if they made a film using the word “ quantum ” a lot , plus plenty of feel - good drivel they would ( a ) make a ton of money ( not that they are short of the stuff ) , and ( b ) gain more recruits to their loony - tunes cult .
This is probably one of the few things they got right .

Shawn Nelson StoryAt age 18 , Shawn Nelson was watching TV on the couch when he decided " a huge beanbag thing " might be more comfortable .
He bought 14 yards of vinyl , cut it into a baseball shape , and spent three weeks filling it with anything soft he could find .
The finished LoveSac was 7 feet wide , and everyone who saw it tried it out — and loved it .
When neighbors started placing orders , Nelson decided to start his company almost as a joke .
With free help from his friends , he made the LoveSacs in his parents ' basement and sold them at trade shows , events and even the drive - in .
Business was moderate at best , until he got a call on his cell phone that changed his life : a quarter - million - dollar order from Too Inc. , which was looking for a back - to - school offering for its Limited Too stores .
" I answered the phone and said , ' Twelve thousand LoveSacs ?
Sure , no problem .
That 's what we do ; we 're the best in the world at it , ' " remembers Nelson .
Undaunted , Nelson amassed $ 50,000 in credit card debt building a factory .
He worked 19 - hour days and slept at the factory .
" It nearly broke me emotionally , physically , mentally , " Nelson says .
" My hands were cracked and bleeding .
We finished the order [ for Too Inc. ] but ate up all our profits . "
Just when things seemed darkest , a deceptively simple idea presented itself :
Open a mall store .
Not just any store , but one designed from the beginning to look like an upscale chain — even before it was a chain .
It paid off : With some 55 stores , about half of them franchised , LoveSac is looking at sales topping $ 30 million this year .
"
We 're headed toward owning [ the market for ] oversized living , " says Nelson , who dispenses with all modesty where his business is concerned .
" We 're going to have a catalog that 'll be three inches thick , selling everything that 's over - the - top , bling - bling , LoveSac - get - out - of - our - freaking - way .
" No one fully expected LoveSac 's success — not even Nelson himself .
He says being committed to solving any problem is vital to his — and any entrepreneur 's — success .

Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during the holocaust Khaled Mahameed admits his museum , in Nazareth in northern Israel , is small .
But he believes it is unique .
According to Mr Mahameed , it is the first and only Arab run centre for promoting the study of the Holocaust .
The museum contains a collection of just 60 photographs depicting the genocide with Arabic captions explaining the scenes .
The pictures were purchased from Yad Vashem - the Israeli national Holocaust memorial .
Mr Mahameed firmly believes that it is only by understanding the truth about how the state of Israel was created that Arabs can fully understand Jews and ultimately resolve the conflict between them .
Ahmadinejad does n't know what he 's talking about - but I hope that people try to find out more about the Holocaust as a result of his words
Khaled Mahameed Many Arabs believe that Israel uses sympathy for Jewish suffering during the Holocaust to gain support from the West , Mr Mahameed says .
Arab leaders , he says , think that by giving credence to the Holocaust they are legitimising Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians .
" But when Palestinians learn about the Holocaust they will understand the Jewish people better and can begin to develop a shared history , " says Mr Mahameed enthusiastically .
Controversial
Since the museum opened in March 2005 , Mr Mahameed says , more than 2,000 people have visited .
The 43 - year - old Israeli Arab lawyer 's passion for his project is clear , he used $ 5,000 of his own money to set up the centre .
On Friday 27 January - UN Holocaust Remembrance Day - he spent hours handing out leaflets promoting the centre to Palestinians filing through Qalandiya checkpoint outside the West Bank town of Ramallah .
But Mr Mahameed 's desire to spread information about the Holocaust is also controversial amongst Palestinians and Israeli Arabs - even within his own family .
Many Palestinians feel that sympathising too much with Israelis could lead to justification for the occupation
Dr Sami Adwan , Bethlehem University .
No -one spoke to him at a recent wedding and his neighbours have cursed him in public , he says .
Visitors to the museum 's website have harangued him for speaking sympathetically about Jews and Israelis .
' Victim status '
Even though Palestinians are taught about the Holocaust in school , the continuing Israeli occupation means that many Palestinians find it difficult to sympathise with Jewish suffering , says Dr Sami Adwan , a professor of education at Bethlehem University .
Khaled Mahameed ( right ) promotes his message near Ramallah " Many Palestinians feel that sympathising too much with Israelis could lead to justification for the occupation . "
" And there is feeling that the Holocaust could undermine the Palestinians international status as victims - that the horror of the Holocaust is so big that it could overpower our own suffering . "
But there may also be hope that the relative lull in violence between Israel and Palestinian militants will allow greater understanding of each other 's histories .
Dr Haim Gertner , Director of Teacher Training at the International School of Holocaust Studies at Yad Vashem , says that whenever the political situation is calm Israeli Arabs show more interest in learning about the Holocaust .
" When there is less political tension , people are more open , " he says .
And despite the difficulties of spreading his message against a background of continuing conflict in the region Mr Mahameed believes he is making progress .
He hopes to make contact with Palestinian militants Hamas and Islamic Jihad to offer them information about the Holocaust .
He also has support for his project from many Israelis , including backing from Yad Vashem itself .
A conference organised by the centre in November attracted 30 people and Mr Mahameed believes that slowly - sometimes very slowly - he is changing minds .

Tomorrow 's Transportation : New Systems for the Urban Future
The following document is an excerpt from a 100 page report to the U.S. Congress that was submitted in 1968 by President Lyndon Johnson .
It was undertaken by the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( Robert Weaver ) at the request of Congress .
Its purpose was to explore areas of research and develop - ment that might ease the problems of Americans who live in and commute to work in cities .
Research and develop - ment projects that offer promising prospects for transporta- tion improvements in our cities are identified as is a longer term program of R&D activities , concentrated in areas of greatest promise and benefits .
The report contains four sections : Urbanization and Urban Transportation , The Federal Role and Responsibility , What Should Be Done and A Recommended Research and Development Program .
The excerpt below comes from the third section and bears the subtitle New Systems for the Future .
It is a copy of pages 58 - 77 from the report .
From a 2009 viewpoint , it is a remarkably prescient piece of work .
There are few ideas , issues and technologies that are current today that were not identified some 41 years ago .
A copy of the full report may be available in large university libraries , such as the U of California at Berkeley and Northwestern University .
RECOMMENDED FUTURE SYSTEMS
The following seven major types of new systems of all the many candidates investigated , were found to possess not only a high expectation of technical and economic feasibility but also to contribute significantly to the solution of major urban problems .
1 . DIAL - A - BUS ( DEMAND - ACTIVATED BUS SYSTEM
A major failing of public urban transportation today is its inability to provide adequate and attractive collection and distribution services in lower density areas of a metropolis .
In some parts of urban areas and in many small cities and towns , the travel demand is too small to support any transit service at all .
It is simply economically infeasible to route and schedule present transit vehicles efficiently when only a few people want to go to and from the same places during a short period of time .
Rail systems are too expensive and are technologically unsuited for low volumes of demand .
Ordinary buses cannot maintain sufficiently frequent service in outlying areas to attract any but those who have no alternative .
What is needed is a public transit system which can respond dynamically to the needs of these areas , that is , a system whose routes and schedules are both flexible and ubiquitous .
The Dial - a - Bus , which is a hybrid between an ordinary bus and a taxi , could be the basis for such flexibility .
It would pick up passengers at their doors or at a nearby bus stop shortly after they have telephoned for service .
The computer would know the location of its vehicles , how many passengers were on them , and where they were heading .
It would select the right vehicle and dispatch it to the caller according to some optimal routing program which had been devised for the system .
Thus , the system could readily link many origins to many destinations .
A Dial - a- Bus , with it 's position established by automatic vehicle monitoring , can be routed by computer and a communication link to collect passengers who have called for service .
The diffused pattern of trip origins and destinations which this system would serve is most dominant in low density suburbs .
But it also exists in a different form in the most thickly populated urban areas .
The cost of taxi rides can be driven down by sharing rides , and basically the Dial - a - Bus system is designed to accomplish this .
Data from the new systems study suggest that , depending on demand , door - to - door transit can serve its passengers almost as fast as a private taxi but at one - quarter to one - half the price , indeed , at only slightly more than the fare for a conventional bus .
With its operational flexibility , the Dial - a - Bus system could be programmed to give different levels of service for different fares .
At one extreme it might offer unscheduled single pas- senger door - to - door service , like a taxi , or multi- passenger serv- ice , like a jitney .
At the other extreme it might operate like a bus service , picking up passengers along specified routes which could include several home pick - ups .
The system might also be programmed to rendezvous with an express or line - haul carrier , and in serving as either a collector or distributor , provide the opportunity to improve the complete transportation service .
The major point is that the Dial - a - Bus might do what no other transit system now does : Handle door - to - door travel demand at the time of the demand .
This means that the system would attract more off - peak business than does conventional transit .
And if it does attract enough passengers , the off - peak revenue would help Dial - a - Bus avoid the same financial prob- lems of conventional transit , which is used heavily only 3 or 4 hours per day .
It could also help reduce dependence upon automobiles .
Technically , there is little question that the system will work .
Any number of existing vehicles can comfortably carry 12 to 24 passengers .
Some of the best are now offering service to airports .
Present computers , radio communications , and telephone links are fully adequate to the major needs of Dial - a - Bus .
Mathematical routing and the associated computer programming present no real obstacles .
What must be done is to put these isolated elements together into a unified system .
Dial - a- Bus service could be made somewhat more efficient if the buses were equipped with automatic monitors to report each vehicle 's location , to the dispatchers at frequent intervals .
Although these monitors do not now exist , there is no technological barrier to developing them , as discussed above under the automatic ve- hicle monitoring subsystem .
The cost for a given level of Dial - a - Bus service is a function of many variables .
These include the nature of the street system , the cruising speed of the vehicle , the distribution of demand , and the size of the area served .
Perhaps the most uncertain of these variables is demand density , the number of trips generated per square mile per hour .
Dial - a- Bus systems probably will be most efficient at demand densities of 100 trips per square mile per hour a level that is barely practicable for conventional bus service .
A limited demonstration of the Dial - a - Bus concept , using
existing equipment , could almost certainly be achieved within
3 years at a cost of less than $ 1 million .
A definitive full - scale
demonstration of Dial - a - Bus service , using vehicles and control
equipment specifically designed for this purpose to test the full
range of possible benefits , probably could be completed within
7 years at a cost of less than $ 20 million .

2. PERSONAL RAPID TRANSIT
The demand for transportation in areas of medium to low
population density is at the present time predominantly served
by private automobiles .
Public transit trunklines may traverse
these areas , but collector - distributor service is poor if it exists
at all .
More than half the automobile travel in large cities occurs
in such areas in trips longer than 2.5 miles .
Increasing travel
demands of this kind , unmet by public transportation services ,
tend to encourage multiple - automobile ownership and use ;
often these additional automobiles can be neither afforded nor
efficiently accommodated .
To provide accessibility and service to the profusion of origins
and destinations in these metropolitan areas , a system is needed
which can be designed to be more responsive to the requirements
varying population densities and land use patterns might generate .
One such concept is " personal rapid transit , " sometimes called
areawide individual transit or network transit .
It would consist of
small vehicles , each carrying about the same number of persons
as an automobile .
These vehicles would travel over an exclusive
right - of - way or guideway network , either over standard routes ,
or else automatically routed individually from origin to destination
at network stations .
Personal rapid transit would serve all but the lowest density
suburbs with a network like that shown below .
No part of
the urban area would be more than 2 miles from one of the
PRT routes .
Personal rapid transit would provide travelers the important
advantages of minimum waiting time at the origin station ,
and private , secure accommodations .
At the heart of the con -
cept is the premise that personal transit would serve a metro -
polis , except perhaps for its lowest density outskirts , with a
network or grid of lines , each perhaps a mile or two apart .
Empty passenger vehicles or " capsules " would be available
at each station on the network .
The riders would enter one ,
select and register their destination , and then be transported
there automatically , with no stopping .
The average speed would
be essentially equal to the vehicle speed .
The station spacing
on a guideway network for the system would have no influence
on speed of travel .
Passenger demand and station costs would
dictate proper station spacing .
Empty vehicles would be recirculated automatically to main -
tain an inventory at each station , and passengers could be
routed past stations without stopping until they reached their
destinations .
Ideally , such a system would give travelers the
same privacy as a private automobile , although during peak
periods in cities with particularly heavy corridor movements a
traveler might have to share a vehicle with two or three other
passengers .
Shown below is an illustration of an at grade PRT station
which has off - line platforms for picking up and discharging
passengers .
The guideway network covering the metropolitan area is
the essential ingredient of the personal rapid transit system .
Without a network of guideways the system could hardly avoid
conventional heavy dependence on work trips and a radial
orientation to existing central business districts .
Thus , it could
not provide adequate transportation alternatives in large met -
ropolitan areas with a wide dispersion of trip origins and
destinations .
No matter how sophisticated the technology ,
transit which operates without some sort of network service
pattern almost certainly will remain a marginal service in the
movement of urban populations .
Network systems of personal rapid transit would perform
economically with travel demand ranging from 1,000 to 10,000
persons an hour in a travel corridor the medium to lower
density conditions in which mass transit systems today usually
perform inadequately .
Yet these corridor travel demand levels
prevail in most metropolitan areas .
The network system , more -
over , could have average speeds of 50 to 70 miles an hour ,
a substantial improvement over average urban freeway speeds .
The roadbed or guideway for personal rapid transit might
consist of rails or surfaces for air bearings ; the vehicles could
use steel or rubber wheels or air pads .
Propulsion could be in
the vehicle or in the guideway itself .
Each guideway would
be about 5 feet wide and could be a single - lane over sub -
stantial portions of its length .
The narrower and lighter structures
should require less land .
They also could be more attractive
than many urban freeways .
All these options are open
to the design engineer ; no particular solution has yet been
shown to be outstanding .
An illustration of a depressed
route is shown below .
Other options include elevated ,
ground level and underground .
A personal rapid transit system having these performance
characteristics is an important element in a viable urban trans -
portation system for a number of reasons :
 An exclusive right - of - way is essential if public transportation
is to be automated and if it is to escape the congestion of general
street traffic .
Forced to compete with automobiles on crowded
streets , other forms of mass transportation are inherently at a
speed disadvantage .
 Automation can make transit service more competitive with
the automobile , since it is the only safe and efficient way to
operate a system using numerous small vehicles .
 Small , individualized vehicles avoid the chief delays of pres -
ent rapid transit : Stops at intermediate stations for other pass -
engers and waiting or dependence on a schedule at the origin
station .
 Additionally , use of small lightweight vehicles , with the quiet
suspension and propulsion mechanisms which can be developed ,
and the less massive elevated and station structures such systems
would permit , would minimize the impact of the system on the
environment .
The new systems study found over 20 existing proposals for
various kinds of personalized transit , most of them little ad -
vanced beyond the original concept .
The greatest amount of
development work is needed for automatic electronic controls .
Maintaining safe headways to permit stopping in case of an
emergency on the line ahead is a very substantial problem in a
system using small vehicles and yet still aiming at high traffic
volumes .
Such operation requires vehicles to be run far closer
together than they can now , but the problems involved in real -
izing this potential require further research .
A network of exclusive right - of - way transit on any such scale poses obvious problems other than technical ones .
Clearly a major investment would be required , though costs might be reduced by running the guideways on elevated structures using the medians or margins of existing rights - of - way .
Tunneled guideways and grade level or depressed guideways would be less expensive than conventional systems requirements because of the smaller vehicle size of personal rapid transit .
Personal rapid transit could probably operate at costs below 10 cents per mile if its capacity were 6,000 riders per hour and if the demand were sufficient to generate 15,000 riders per day , on the average , over each section of guideway .
In sum , the real issues concerning the feasibility of personal rapid transit systems , as for all new systems , are not merely technological ones , they include the questions of cost and safety as well .
These questions cannot be answered with absolute precision at this time , but indications are that personal rapid transit will be many times safer than the private automobile , and yet will cost no more than modern mass transit systems proposed in areas of low to medium volume travel demands .
As shown below , personal rapid transit stations in the suburbs could be reached by Dial - a - Bus and by private or public automobile service ( PAS ) .
A prototype of such a system could be developed , working perhaps from an existing system such as the Transit Express - way demonstrated in a Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) project in Pittsburgh .
Such a prototype system might minimize control difficulties , for instance , by requiring passengers to transfer a requirement that might not be too onerous in some metropolitan areas because networks requiring few transfers could be designed .
An illustration of an inner-city personal rapid stations is shown below .
The ultimate goal should be a system that does not require this kind of temporizing .
Yet control problems become even more complex in the areas of merging one vehicle stream into another and of routing numerous small vehicles automatically over a network of guideways , with provisions for switching off the line at stations , of maintaining adequate supplies of empty cars at stations , and of distributing vehicles so that congestion does not result on any line .
The new systems study found that these problems are surmountable , and that a prototype system could be developed , tested , and evaluated in less than 10 years at a cost of about $ 250 million .

3 . DUALMODE VEHICLE SYSTEMS
On the outer fringes of the personal rapid transit system just described , the network of lines in the lower density areas , to remain economical , would probably be too far apart for con- venient walking access , and unsuitable for short neighborhood or local trips .
The new systems study found the dualmode vehicle system to offer a possible solution to these problems .
In a dualmode system , the vehicle can convert easily from travel on a street to travel on an automated network .
It thus could serve as a logical extension or elaboration of personal rapid transit .
The dualmode vehicles could operate on the parts of the network of lines used by personal rapid transit .
Vehicles would drive from the streets onto the guideway at selected PRT stations .
Shown below is a small car entering the network through an inspection point , a destination encoder and an automated fare collector .
Dualmode personal vehicle systems would give the same service for persons who did not own or know how to drive an automobile as would the personal rapid transit system .
They would use public vehicles on the automatic guideways , and would walk or transfer to other systems for local trips .
How - ever , the guideways also would be accessible to privately owned or leased vehicles which could be routed on and off ramps con- necting with ordinary streets , and driven over the streets to the driver 's destination just as in the case of an automobile .
At the point of destination , the vehicles could be parked as they are today or , if they were leased for the trip , they could be turned in at local connection points for redistribution to other users .
This last method has the advantage of minimizing parking problems in congested areas .
A dualmode system presents more technical development problems than the personal transit system .
However , it should be possible to work on such problems simultaneously with the development of personal transit , and to so design personal transit systems for ultimate dual mode use .
The earliest developmental problems will be in the adaptation of propulsion , suspension , and guidance systems for use on both automatic guideways and regular streets .
None of them seems insurmountable in the light of present knowledge .
Propulsion on the guideway , as in the case of the personal transit system , would almost certainly be electric , probably using third rail power distribution in prototypes .
In the final develop - ment of the system , however , propulsion might be a version of the linear motor discussed previously .
Vehicles would thus need an electric motor ; off the guideway they would run on batteries or use a separate engine to generate power for the electric motor .
Since these are the directions in which propulsion technology for ordinary automobiles may evolve to achieve reductions in air pollution , the propulsion problems of a dual mode personal vehicle are likely to be solved well before its other problems .
The most difficult technical problems are those associated with the development of a control system .
Two different courses are possible .
One is to concentrate the burden of control in the automated guideway ( using equipment like linear synchronous motors and wayside computers ) ; the other is to concentrate it in the capsules .
The cost and complexity of the guideways would be reduced if the controls were in the capsule , but the controls could be damaged when the capsules were off the guideway and being driven by individuals , and there could be additional safety hazards .
The personal rapid transit system described earlier could operate at less than 10 cents per passenger mile with 15,000 passengers per day ; the dual mode system might cost as little as 7 to 8 cents per passenger mile , depending on whether the vehicles were privately or publicly owned .
If research and development of personal rapid transit and the dual mode system were undertaken in concert , the prin- cipal costs for guideways , controls , and propulsion systems could be shared .
The development , test , and evaluation of street vehicles which could also operate automatically on the guide - ways could add $ 150 million to the previous $ 250 million esti- mate .
While one first - generation form of the dual mode system could be demonstrated in less than 10 years at a cost of less than $ 35 million , the full - scale development , test , and evalua - tion of a compatible personal rapid transit and small dual mode vehicle system would be a more uncertain venture and could require a total of about 10 years and $ 400 million .

Population densities are relatively low , and trip distances are short over essentially radial routes between the urban core and outlying residential and industrial areas .
Pro- viding peak - hour home - to - work travel , including both that be - tween suburban homes and the rapidly expanding job oppor- tunities in the outlying industrial and commercial zones , poses major transit service problems .
Some form of public transit , improved over standard bus service , but with lower initial costs and greater flexibility than rapid rail transit , is desirable to meet the needs of the intermediate - size industrial city .
The automated dualmode bus would operate on the public streets as a conventional bus to pick up and discharge passen - gers .
On longer high speed runs it would operate as a fully automatic vehicle on a private right - of - way .
Thus , it offers the possibility for a system of public transit which combines the high speed capacity of a rail system operating on its private right - of - way with the flexibility and adaptability of a city bus .
This flexibility would make it possible for the transit system to serve areas where the cost of extensive fixed rights - of - way could not be justified , and to minimize the number of transfers which the passenger would have to make .
A dualmode bus , after completing an express run on the guideway , would enter the turnout and pick up a driver who would dis - engage the external power supply and continue the run to dis - charge customers or collect others for the next express trip .
An illustration of a typical interchange facility is shown below .
In the automatic mode , the vehicle would be powered elec- trically from an external source .
While in the manual or street mode , propulsion might be initially from a turbo- electric power plant .
Eventually , an all - electric propulsion system could achieve minimum levels of noise and air pollution .
Because of the relatively long headways between vehicles the controls for intervehicle spacing , speed , switching , and stops are not as complex as those required by the personal rapid transit or small dual mode vehicle systems .
Nevertheless , the controls will constitute a major portion of the research and development effort leading to a demonstration of the automated dualmode bus system .
Significant efforts will also be required for the design and development of the guideway propulsion system and mainline stops for passenger entry and exit while the vehicles are operated automatically .
The redistribution and effective use of vehicles and drivers during off - peak and manual operating periods will require careful analysis .
Consideration has been given to the possible use of some of these vehicles as a Dial - a - Bus during off - peak hours .
The automated dual mode bus could be developed and its feasibility demonstrated very likely within 5 years at a possible cost of less than $ 15 million .

5 . PALLET OR FERRY SYSTEMS
The most rapid population and employment growth in Ameri - can cities today is in the suburban areas .
As a result , the percentage of trips having an origin or destination in a con- centrated central city area is shrinking , and the number of trips between low density residential areas and decentralized indus- trial and commercial areas is growing .
To accommodate this growth pattern and to provide other options of urban development , modes of transportation which span entire metropolitan areas with circumferential , as well as radial links , are essential .
A corollary to the dual mode personal vehicle systems which would provide this type of service would use pallets to carry ( or ferry ) automobiles , minibuses or freight automatically on high - speed guideways .
A rail - based pallet or ferry system could make good use of abandoned or seldom used rail line in the city .
An illustration of such a concept is shown below , Pallets have several advantages .
For one , the individual would not have to buy or lease special vehicles .
For another , a single freeway or rail line could be converted to pallet opera- tion ; automobiles in the area could use the pallet for high - speed line - haul , thus preserving the quality of automobile comfort without the disadvantages of driving in traffic .
In the rail system , the traveler 's private automobile , with the driver and any passengers remaining inside , would be loaded on a pallet and transported at high speed .
The automobile would not need special equipment and the pallet vehicle would not need to be much more than a platform or flatcar able to carry about 10 to 12 vehicles .
The concept is not limited to rail systems , but could be adapted for guideways with electrically propelled carriers .
The system would provide high - flow capacities per lane , as well as automatic operations over long route segments .
Load - ing and unloading might be automated , although the operations would have to be restricted to terminals with transfer equipment .
A major disadvantage of the pallet concept is that it would serve only vehicles of conventional size .
( It could , of course , be restricted to special small vehicles , but only by losing a prin- cipal advantage of general availability . )
Thus , the pallet sys- tems would not , in the long run , have much effect on congestion in downtown areas unless it were coupled with extensive con- struction of peripheral parking facilities or automated garages .
While only a limited comparison of a pallet and dual mode system was made , the new system study concluded that each had certain advantages in particular applications .
A Federal program of research should examine both on the basis that a rail pallet system could initiate dual mode operation when a substantial portion of metropolitan guideways were converted .
The feasibility of one form of rail pallet system could be demon- strated within 5 years at a cost of less than $ 25 million .

6 . FAST INTRAURBAN TRANSIT LINKS
The diversification of travel in and around major metropolitan areas requires fast intraurban transit links to move relatively high volumes of passengers between central cities and suburban growth centers .
Increasingly , they will be needed for line - haul travel not oriented entirely to central cities : Cross traffic among new towns , between satellite centers and international or regional airports , and as feeder - distributor systems serving the major high - speed ground lines along major regional corridors .
New systems of fast line - haul links will be essential in the development of new or renewed satellite communities .
Indeed , they may be the only means to provide the focal points for future metropolitan development patterns alternative to continued regional sprawl .
The new systems study investigated all the conceivably feasible new types of fast intraurban transit links .
At their best , they can be quieter , smaller , and less demanding in guideway requirements than current high speed intercity systems .
Moreover , they can take less land , and can minimize adverse impact on areas adjacent to rights - of - way .
For long - term development , speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour are difficult to attain economically with steel wheel suspension on steel rails because , for acceptable levels of vibration , tracks must be precisely level and an exact alignment .
Further , vehicle stability requires weight , which is expensive to move .
Support , suspension and guidance for several types of fast intraurban systems may evolve from the air - cushion principle .
Fast intraurban transit links can provide rapid access throughout a metropolitan area between a number of distant locations , as illustrated below .
If future intraurban link systems are to succeed where commuter lines have failed , they must be automatically controlled , with vehicles capable of operating either independently or coupled into trains .
Automated systems of single - car trains would not require a large labor force to operate them , and could be easily adjusted to fluctuations in demand .
Linear motors for propulsion , air - cushion support and suspension for the higher speed ranges , and automatic vehicle monitoring , ticketing , and ridership counting equipment , would all contribute to safe , reliable , flexible service .
A fast intraurban transit station in a satellite city might look like the following illustration .
Guideway dimensions , turning radii , and support structure requirements for intraurban systems are such that fast transit links could be installed in the medians or along the edges of existing freeways .
Rail rights - of - way could also be converted in many instances .
One version of an intermediate speed intraurban link would carry 80 seated passengers per car , for a system capacity of 16,000 passengers per hour .
Another could carry 20 passengers per vehicle and would be able to move 6,000 passengers per hour in conditions approaching the convenience , comfort , and privacy of the automobile .
Higher and lower capacities could be attained through changes in train lengths and headways .
A main central city terminal for a fast intraurban transit link might look like the following illustration .
Both versions of intermediate - speed systems require extensive technological development and economic analysis .
The development , test , and evaluation of the 20 - passenger - per-car fast intraurban transit link system probably could be accomplished in less than 10 years at a cost of less than $ 50 million .
The new systems study also considered other imaginative concepts for point - to - point travel systems , such as the gravity - vacuum tube design , many monorail system designs , and also various kinds of short - haul aircraft , both fixed - wing ( vertical or short takeoff and landing ) and rotary - wing ( helicopter ) types .
Each of these types of systems , in their present and pro- jected states of development , has some major problems , how - ever , compared to other systems examined .
Until these prob- lems are resolved , such systems appear to offer few salient advantages and would have relatively limited application for travel within urban areas .

7 . SYSTEMS FOR MAJOR ACTIVITY CENTERS
Multitudes of people assemble each day in the major activity centers of a city ; large airports , shopping centers , industrial parks , and universities , for example .
Central business districts are , of course , major activity centers .
Provision must be made for an adequate circulation system to better accommodate the movement of people and goods within these centers .
Cur - rently , much of the travel in these areas is by pedestrians on sidewalks .
In a few cities , trains provide service in subways or on elevated railways .
In most areas , this circulation is now provided by autos , taxis , streetcars , buses , and jitneys operating on city streets , frequently under highly congested conditions .
Pedestrian movement in central cities can be aided by moving belts ( as shown on the right and left ) or by a network of cab transit ( shown as crossing the throughfare ) below .
The new systems study has identified several circulation sys- tems which offer the potential for moving large numbers of people over short trips in a relatively small area and are capable of doing so safely , comfortably , economically , and with a mini- mum of waiting .
Because modal separation is imperative under the congested conditions of travel in activity centers , such sys- tems must operate on some kind of exclusive guideway .
Follow - ing is a discussion of the principal types of systems : Moving Belts : Horizontal conveyor belts have been in use for a long time .
They have many advantages low cost , no wait - ing , no operators .
A major disadvantage is their slow speed .
The very old , the very young and the handicapped cannot get safely on and off sidewalks which are moving faster than about 120 feet per minute ( 1.76 m.p.h. ) .
In order to permit safe loading and unloading , constant - speed belts must move at such slow speeds that they can be easily out - distanced by the average pedestrian .
Previous prototype systems approached this problem by having people board faster belts from adjacent slow ones .
Continuous parallel track layouts , however , are ex- tremely expensive , cumbersome to accommodate , and involve significant safety hazards .
There are several other ways to approach the problem of ac- celerating belt speed from 1.5 to 15 miles per hour that the new systems study found worthy of further development and ex- perimentation .
These include belts whose length or width can be varied during operation .
Two ways of using variable length or " stretching ) ' '' to produce variable speeds are to use a series of rigid plates which would overlap at slow speeds , or a " win- dow shade " device that could produce varying speeds .
This second type would be divided into sections attached at either end to a series of carts or boxes that would move along at varying speeds .
The spacing between the carts or boxes would be controlled mechanically ; if they were a foot apart at a board - ing speed of 1.5 miles an hour , they would have to move 10 feet apart at 15 miles per hour .
As they moved apart the belt material would unwind from the " window shade " reel in the carts and the passengers on the belts would be smoothly accelerated .
Capsule Transit :
The complexity of moving belt designs sug- gests that a type of small vehicle system may be more feasible for major activity center use in the long run , if sufficiently high carrying capacities can be achieved .
A large number of con- cepts have been proposed and several are actually being mar- keted or are in use .
Some use small cars propelled by moving belts and are accelerated and decelerated by variable speed rollers .
Others substitute variable - pitch screws for the rollers or cables for the belts .
All of these proposals have technical problems of one kind or another , such as the inability to pro- vide for an emergency like the failure of one car without shutting down the entire system .
The new systems study rec- ommends that investigations of them be included in a Federal research and development program .
Network Cab Transit :
While traditional transit forms are applicable to downtown circulation , on - street forms suffer and contribute to congestion , while new subway systems are both very expensive and highly disruptive during installation .
To meet these difficulties , the study considered narrow light - weight , low - noise systems , which can be suspended above city streets or sidewalks with a minimum of intrusion .
Two systems were proposed which consist of small auto- matically controlled capsules .
The capsules carry one or two persons ( with room for parcels ) and run at about 15 m.p.h. on tracks high enough above the street level to keep from inter- fering with existing traffic .
To use the system a person enters a capsule at one of the many sidings and pushes a start button .
The capsule is automatically accelerated and merged into the mainline traffic .
Deceleration to a stop is done automatically when the capsule is turned into a siding .
Capsules travel along the main lines only a few feet apart ; allow capacities of about 8,000 vehicles per hour .
For the speeds and loads involved neither propulsion nor suspension is a critical issue ; direct - current electric motors driving steel or pneumatic wheels will probably suffice .
Many aspects of the new network cab system are similar to personal rapid transit .
Principal differences are in the speeds , size of vehicles or cabs , and in spacing of the network grids .
The network cab system is intended to cover a much smaller area than personal rapid transit .
This similarity affords the opportunity for closely integrated development efforts which tie a circulation system for major activity centers together with fringe area transportation systems like personal rapid transit .
The most complicated part of these systems is the merging and spacing control .
In the simplest type of system , operation would be in a single loop and the merging would occur only when cars left stations .
Each vehicle being merged would pro- ceed only if a slot were available ; slots would not be deliberately created upstream of a merge point .
Spacing would be uncon- trolled except for the minimum amount necessary for emergency stops .
Speed control would not be precise , but would be limited to the nominal system speed .
More sophisticated versions are possible , verging on the personal rapid transit system described previously .
If developed concurrently , the feasibility of one example of these types of systems could be demonstrated during a 5 - year period at a cost of about $ 6 million per system for a total pro- gram estimate of $ 18 million .
In order to fully develop , test , and evaluate a series of desirable systems which could be certified safe for public demonstration , a program extending over 10 years is estimated to cost approximately $ 118 million .

Correction Appended
AUSTIN , Tex. —
Unable to afford health insurance , Dee Dee Dodd had for years been mixing occasional doctor visits with clumsy efforts to self - manage her insulin - dependent diabetes , getting sicker all the while .
In one 18 - month period , Ms. Dodd , 38 , was rushed almost monthly to the emergency room , spent weeks in the intensive care unit and accumulated more than $ 191,000 in unpaid bills .
That is when nurses at the Seton Family of Hospitals tagged her as a “ frequent flier , ” a repeat visitor whose ailments — and expenses — might be curbed with more regular care .
The hospital began offering her free primary care through its charity program .
With the number of uninsured people in the United States reaching a record 46.6 million last year , up by 7 million from 2000 , Seton is one of a small number of hospital systems around the country to have done the math and acted on it .
Officials decided that for many patients with chronic diseases , it would be cheaper to provide free preventive care than to absorb the high cost of repeated emergencies .
There is one way , over the long haul , to guarantee the appointment of judges that are sensitive to issues of social justice , and that is to win the right to appoint them by recapturing the presidency and the Senate .
And I do n't believe we get there by vilifying good allies , with a lifetime record of battling for progressive causes , over one vote or position .
I am convinced that , our mutual frustrations and strongly - held beliefs notwithstanding , the strategy driving much of Democratic advocacy , and the tone of much of our rhetoric , is an impediment to creating a workable progressive majority in this country .
According to the storyline that drives many advocacy groups and Democratic activists - a storyline often reflected in comments on this blog - we are up against a sharply partisan , radically conservative , take - no - prisoners Republican party .
They have beaten us twice by energizing their base with red meat rhetoric and single - minded devotion and discipline to their agenda .
In order to beat them , it is necessary for Democrats to get some backbone , give as good as they get , brook no compromise , drive out Democrats who are interested in " appeasing " the right wing , and enforce a more clearly progressive agenda .
The country , finally knowing what we stand for and seeing a sharp contrast , will rally to our side and thereby usher in a new progressive era .
I think this perspective misreads the American people .
From traveling throughout Illinois and more recently around the country , I can tell you that Americans are suspicious of labels and suspicious of jargon .
They do n't think George Bush is mean - spirited or prejudiced , but have become aware that his administration is irresponsible and often incompetent .
They do n't think that corporations are inherently evil ( a lot of them work in corporations ) , but they recognize that big business , unchecked , can fix the game to the detriment of working people and small entrepreneurs .
They do n't think America is an imperialist brute , but are angry that the case to invade Iraq was exaggerated , are worried that we have unnecessarily alienated existing and potential allies around the world , and are ashamed by events like those at Abu Ghraib which violate our ideals as a country .
It 's this non-ideological lens through which much of the country viewed Judge Roberts ' confirmation hearings .
A majority of folks , including a number of Democrats and Independents , do n't think that John Roberts is an ideologue bent on overturning every vestige of civil rights and civil liberties protections in our possession .
Instead , they have good reason to believe he is a conservative judge who is ( like it or not ) within the mainstream of American jurisprudence , a judge appointed by a conservative president who could have done much worse ( and probably , I fear , may do worse with the next nominee ) .
While they hope Roberts does n't swing the court too sharply to the right , a majority of Americans think that the President should probably get the benefit of the doubt on a clearly qualified nominee .
A plausible argument can be made that too much is at stake here and now , in terms of privacy issues , civil rights , and civil liberties , to give John Roberts the benefit of the doubt .
That certainly was the operating assumption of the advocacy groups involved in the nomination battle .
I shared enough of these concerns that I voted against Roberts on the floor this morning .
But short of mounting an all - out filibuster -- a quixotic fight I would not have supported ; a fight I believe Democrats would have lost both in the Senate and in the court of public opinion ; a fight that would have been difficult for Democratic senators defending seats in states like North Dakota and Nebraska that are essential for Democrats to hold if we hope to recapture the majority ; and a fight that would have effectively signaled an unwillingness on the part of Democrats to confirm any Bush nominee , an unwillingness which I believe would have set a dangerous precedent for future administrations -- blocking Roberts was not a realistic option .
In such circumstances , attacks on Pat Leahy , Russ Feingold and the other Democrats who , after careful consideration , voted for Roberts make no sense .
Russ Feingold , the only Democrat to vote not only against war in Iraq but also against the Patriot Act , does n't become complicit in the erosion of civil liberties simply because he chooses to abide by a deeply held and legitimate view that a President , having won a popular election , is entitled to some benefit of the doubt when it comes to judicial appointments .
Like it or not , that view has pretty strong support in the Constitution 's design .
The same principle holds with respect to issues other than judicial nominations .
My colleague from Illinois , Dick Durbin , spoke out forcefully - and voted against - the Iraqi invasion .
He is n't somehow transformed into a " war supporter " - as I 've heard some anti-war activists suggest - just because he has n't called for an immediate withdrawal of American troops .
He may be simply trying to figure out , as I am , how to ensure that U.S. troop withdrawals occur in such a way that we avoid all - out Iraqi civil war , chaos in the Middle East , and much more costly and deadly interventions down the road .
A pro-choice Democrat does n't become anti-choice because he or she is n't absolutely convinced that a twelve - year - old girl should be able to get an operation without a parent being notified .
A pro-civil rights Democrat does n't become complicit in an anti-civil rights agenda because he or she questions the efficacy of certain affirmative action programs .
And a pro-union Democrat does n't become anti-union if he or she makes a determination that on balance , CAFTA will help American workers more than it will harm them .
Or to make the point differently :
How can we ask Republican senators to resist pressure from their right wing and vote against flawed appointees like John Bolton , if we engage in similar rhetoric against Democrats who dissent from our own party line ?
How can we expect Republican moderates who are concerned about the nation 's fiscal meltdown to ignore Grover Norquist 's threats if we make similar threats to those who buck our party orthodoxy ?
I am not drawing a facile equivalence here between progressive advocacy groups and right - wing advocacy groups .
The consequences of their ideas are vastly different .
Fighting on behalf of the poor and the vulnerable is not the same as fighting for homophobia and Halliburton .
But to the degree that we brook no dissent within the Democratic Party , and demand fealty to the one , " true " progressive vision for the country , we risk the very thoughtfulness and openness to new ideas that are required to move this country forward .
When we lash out at those who share our fundamental values because they have not met the criteria of every single item on our progressive " checklist , " then we are essentially preventing them from thinking in new ways about problems .
We are tying them up in a straightjacket and forcing them into a conversation only with the converted .
Beyond that , by applying such tests , we are hamstringing our ability to build a majority .
We wo n't be able to transform the country with such a polarized electorate .
Because the truth of the matter is this :
Most of the issues this country faces are hard .
They require tough choices , and they require sacrifice .
The Bush Administration and the Republican Congress may have made the problems worse , but they wo n't go away after President Bush is gone .
Unless we are open to new ideas , and not just new packaging , we wo n't change enough hearts and minds to initiate a serious energy or fiscal policy that calls for serious sacrifice .
We wo n't have the popular support to craft a foreign policy that meets the challenges of globalization or terrorism while avoiding isolationism and protecting civil liberties .
We certainly wo n't have a mandate to overhaul a health care policy that overcomes all the entrenched interests that are the legacy of a jerry - rigged health care system .
And we wo n't have the broad political support , or the effective strategies , required to lift large numbers of our fellow citizens out of numbing poverty .
The bottom line is that our job is harder than the conservatives ' job .
After all , it 's easy to articulate a belligerent foreign policy based solely on unilateral military action , a policy that sounds tough and acts dumb ; it 's harder to craft a foreign policy that 's tough and smart .
It 's easy to dismantle government safety nets ; it 's harder to transform those safety nets so that they work for people and can be paid for .
It 's easy to embrace a theological absolutism ; it 's harder to find the right balance between the legitimate role of faith in our lives and the demands of our civic religion .
But that 's our job .
And I firmly believe that whenever we exaggerate or demonize , or oversimplify or overstate our case , we lose .
Whenever we dumb down the political debate , we lose .
A polarized electorate that is turned off of politics , and easily dismisses both parties because of the nasty , dishonest tone of the debate , works perfectly well for those who seek to chip away at the very idea of government because , in the end , a cynical electorate is a selfish electorate .
Let me be clear : I am not arguing that the Democrats should trim their sails and be more " centrist . "
In fact , I think the whole " centrist " versus " liberal " labels that continue to characterize the debate within the Democratic Party misses the mark .
Too often , the " centrist " label seems to mean compromise for compromise sake , whereas on issues like health care , energy , education and tackling poverty , I do n't think Democrats have been bold enough .
But I do think that being bold involves more than just putting more money into existing programs and will instead require us to admit that some existing programs and policies do n't work very well .
And further , it will require us to innovate and experiment with whatever ideas hold promise ( including market - or faith - based ideas that originate from Republicans ) .
Our goal should be to stick to our guns on those core values that make this country great , show a spirit of flexibility and sustained attention that can achieve those goals , and try to create the sort of serious , adult , consensus around our problems that can admit Democrats , Republicans and Independents of good will .
This is more than just a matter of " framing , " although clarity of language , thought , and heart are required .
It 's a matter of actually having faith in the American people 's ability to hear a real and authentic debate about the issues that matter .
Finally , I am not arguing that we " unilaterally disarm " in the face of Republican attacks , or bite our tongue when this Administration screws up .
Whenever they are wrong , inept , or dishonest , we should say so clearly and repeatedly ; and whenever they gear up their attack machine , we should respond quickly and forcefully .
I am suggesting that the tone we take matters , and that truth , as best we know it , be the hallmark of our response .
My dear friend Paul Simon used to consistently win the votes of much more conservative voters in Southern Illinois because he had mastered the art of " disagreeing without being disagreeable , " and they trusted him to tell the truth .
Similarly , one of Paul Wellstone 's greatest strengths was his ability to deliver a scathing rebuke of the Republicans without ever losing his sense of humor and affability .
In fact , I would argue that the most powerful voices of change in the country , from Lincoln to King , have been those who can speak with the utmost conviction about the great issues of the day without ever belittling those who opposed them , and without denying the limits of their own perspectives .
In that spirit , let me end by saying I do n't pretend to have all the answers to the challenges we face , and I look forward to periodic conversations with all of you in the months and years to come .
I trust that you will continue to let me and other Democrats know when you believe we are screwing up .
And I , in turn , will always try and show you the respect and candor one owes his friends and allies .

While the United States has been fighting its war on terror , a new political idea has begun to punch through with such weight that alarm bells have begun ringing loudly in Washington .
Under the slogan of " peaceful rising " , China is selling itself to the developing world as an alternative model for ending poverty .
China : an alternative model for ending poverty ?
His aim is to negotiate the precise line which China must not cross in creating its new strategic alliance with Latin America , which has seen billions of dollars of Chinese money earmarked for infrastructure , transport , energy and defence projects there .
" We want to make sure we do n't get our wires crossed , " said one official arranging the talks .
The spectre of an encroaching China is made worse by a string of elections which has produced populist and US - sceptic , left - wing leaders .
During the Cold War they would probably never have survived in office .
The latest may be retired army commander Ollanta Humala , who is leading the opinion polls in the Peruvian presidential election due on 9 April .
" We 're concerned about the leftist countries that are dealing with China , " says Congressman Dan Burton , the Republican chairman of the sub-committee on the Western Hemisphere .
" It 's extremely important that we do n't let a potential enemy of the US become a dominant force in this part of the world . "
' Alliance of giants '
While China pleads innocence , more and more voices in Washington are chastising President George W Bush for failing to act as decisively against China .
Every thing I do is with China now

" The status quo cannot be accepted and tolerated by this country any more than the Soviet Union 's practices were tolerated by Ronald Reagan . "
In Brazil itself , the view is very different .
It is about two developing countries , the giants of their regions , forming a natural alliance .
" It 's wonderful .
It 's amazing , " says Alexandre Solis , an aircraft engineer who spent more than two years in the Chinese city of Harbin , setting up a joint venture for the ultra hi-tech Brazilian Embraer commuter jet company .
" They wanted all the information we could give them because they are determined to be best in the world . "
' Nowhere else '
The flurry of China - Brazil business began less than two years ago after an exchange of visits between Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Chinese President Hu Jintao .
[ China ] has achieved the greatest victory in the history of human rights ...
It has removed 400 m Chinese people from poverty

In Sao Paulo , Chinese language classes are packed .
Not only are students taught how to speak Mandarin , but they are also guided in cultural habits such as attending banquets and singing Chinese folk songs .
" Everything I do is with China now , " says one student Priscila Marques , who runs a freight forwarding company .
" It 's Brazil - China ; nowhere else . "
The nub of Mr Shannon 's Beijing visit , however , is to determine how much can be put down to simply business and how much China plans to export its own political system and power .
" The Chinese government has achieved the greatest victory in the history of human rights , " says Charles Tang , who heads the Brazil - China Chamber of Commerce and who has been behind many of the joint - venture initiatives .
" It has removed 400 million Chinese people from poverty and enabled them to live with dignity and take part in economic life .
That is the true measure of human rights .
" Brazil should analyse why China grows so much and Brazil so little . "
Monroe doctrine
Washington 's political protectionism of Latin America dates as far back as 1823 when President James Monroe decreed that no foreign power would have more influence there than the US itself .
Assistant Secretary of State Tom Shannon is off to Beijing
This time , as China gathers confidence , ideological debate will be over which political system - Western democracy or Chinese authoritarianism - delivers more people from poverty , and whether freedom should be measured in terms of wealth or elections .
In Beijing and Washington it might be viewed as a contest of ideas , but on the ground in Latin America it could turn into something darkly familiar .
" We should always look at Latin America in relation to the Monroe Doctrine , " says Congressman Burton .
" There already are [ Chinese ] military exchanges and hardware being sold - or given to Latin American countries .
You can rest assured the US is going to do everything it can to make sure this hemisphere is safe . "
Humphrey Hawksley 's report from Brazil is part of Newsnight 's Inside Latin America season , and can be seen on Tuesday at 2230 on BBC Two .
Memory expert in CIA leak case forgot that she met prosecutor before RAW STORY
Published : Friday October 27 , 2006 Print This Email
This A memory expert testifying on behalf of a former aide to Vice President Cheney who is accused of lying to prosecutors in the CIA leak case forgot that she had met the special prosecutor before and was reduced to " stuttering " and " backpedaling " on the stand , according to the Washington Post .
Elizabeth F. Loftus , a professor of criminology and psychology at the University of California at Irvine , was trying to bolster I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby 's defense , but Patrick J. Fitzgerald " sliced " her up .
" Citing several of her publications , footnotes and the work of her peers , Fitzgerald got Loftus to acknowledge that the methodology she had used at times in her long academic career was not that scientific , that her conclusions about memory were conflicting , and that she had exaggerated a figure and a statement from her survey of D.C. jurors that favored the defense , " Carol D. Leonnig writes .
The Post reports that " Loftus was completely caught off guard by Fitzgerald , creating some very awkward silences in the courtroom . "
" One of those moments came when Loftus insisted that she had never met Fitzgerald , " the article continues .
" He then reminded her that he had cross - examined her before , when she was an expert defense witness and he was a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney 's office in New York . "
Excerpts from Post article : # Her defense - paid visit to the federal court was crucial because Libby is relying on the " memory defense " against Fitzgerald 's charges that he obstructed justice and lied to investigators about his role in the leaking of a CIA operative 's identity to the media .
Libby 's attorneys argue that he did not lie -- that he was just really busy with national security matters and forgot some of his conversations .
When Fitzgerald found a line in one of her books that raised doubts about research she had cited on the stand as proof that Libby needs an expert to educate jurors , Loftus said , " I do n't know how I let that line slip by . "
" I 'd need to see that again , " Loftus said when Fitzgerald cited a line in her book that overstated her research by saying that " most jurors " consider memory to be equivalent to playing a videotape .
Her research , however , found that to be true for traumatic events , and even then , only 46 percent of potential jurors thought memory could be similar to a videotape .

Every morning , before I go running , I check the local news for a few minutes .
It ’s more of a sanity check than anything else , just to make sure I ’m not going out into nuclear fallout or a gang riot or something like that .
This morning , our local CBS affiliate led their entire day ’s news with one of those “ BREAKING NEWS ” graphics and stinger music .
Uh - oh , I thought .
What ’s happened now ?
Massive violence in Iraq ?
A terrible fire in local mountains ?
A police standoff ?
A major death ?
The discovery of torture prisons alternative interrogation technique centers on U.S. soil ?
Nope .
The BREAKING NEWS was this : Paris Hilton had been arrested for a DUI .
What .
The .
Frack !!!
How in god ’s green earth is that BREAKING NEWS ?
I mean , forget why I should give a rat ’s ass , because I will posit that her arrest is entertainment news , perhaps even real news , since she is a person of some notoriety .
But BREAKING NEWS ?
How does this demand my immediate attention in any way , shape , or form ?
It does n’t .
You know it , I know it , and the producers at KCBS 2 most certainly know it .
They just do n’t care , or have surrounded the part that cares with layers and layers of cynicism and money .
Look , living in Los Angeles means that you have to live with celebrity gossip , car chases and recaps of popular reality shows masquarading as news on the morning TV shows .
I ’ve made my peace with this , especially since I can get hard news on the Net 24 - 7 , and I understand how ratings pressure ( and the Net ) have accelerated the race to the bottom .
A race , BTW , that meant that not only was the Paris arrest BREAKING NEWS , they sent a reporter out to do a stand - up from the spot where she ’d been arrested !!
And what the hell , I ’m certainly not so high and mighty that I did n’t experience a little schadenfreude over the whole Mel Gibson and Paris Hilton incidents ( and noticed that they called her “ Socialite Paris Hilton , ” not “ Actress Paris Hilton ” or “ Singer Paris Hilton , ” HA ! ) , or do n’t enjoy entertainment news .
As you may have noticed , this is n’t a website about politics ; we are n’t exactly saving lives here .
But we do n’t bill ourselves that way either .
It ’s just that this extremely rough summer — with wars in Iraq and Lebanon , skyrocketing gas prices , chaos in our airports , etc. — has been chock full of this crap , with these cosmically minor things taking up huge chunks of mindshare .
The capper , of course , was the unforgiveable two weeks of total news hysteria over that creepy guy who lied about killing that little girl a decade ago .
And sigh , I know that the ratings went up , so people were interested , which makes it news , right ?
So what is to be done ?
Hell , I do n’t know .
But maybe , just maybe , reserve the BREAKING NEWS wolf - cry for actual news ?
Would that be so difficult ?
It would ?
Oh , never mind .
No one can live a positive life without failing .
However , many people experience a fear of failure , despite its inevitability in life .
Failure , as you will see from these 30 success and failure quotes , is the key ingredient for the recipe of success !
Today ’s society is obsessed with success and achievement , and failure is definitely NOT part of the equation .
Failure and making mistakes is hidden away or seen as a human weakness .
However , if you avoid making mistakes in life , struggle to do everything right , and are obsessed with perfection and order , then living and experiencing a successful and happy life is going to be impossible .
Embrace your failure , whether it is one failure or many failures , because with the right attitude and a willingness to learn from your mistakes , you are guaranteed a lifetime of success .
Here are some uplifting quotes about failure and success to help you get started .
1 . “ Never let success get to your head ; never let failure get to your heart . ”
- Anonymous
This quote is important for those of us who feel downtrodden after every failure , heartbroken , if you will .
If you let failure get you down for more than a couple of days , you ’re wasting away your chance to bounce back from it .
On the other hand , if you allow yourself to build an inflated ego after every success , future failures may be even harder to cope with .
Maintain a sense of humility and gratitude for each success and failure you find .
2 . “ Just because you fail once , does n’t mean you ’re gonna fail at everything .
Keep trying , hold on , and always , always , always believe in yourself , because if you do n’t , then who will , sweetie ? ” - Marilyn Monroe
Marilyn Monroe is spot on with this one .
The first person who should be there to catch you when you fall is you .
You have to be your own best advocate , the person to build you up when it feels like everything is going wrong .
The others in your support system are just icing on the cake .
3 . “ You always pass failure on your way to success . ” - Mickey Rooney
In today ’s competitive world , it ’s hard to understand that almost no one experiences failure before they experience genuine , lasting success .
Failure is what forces you to learn in order to achieve that goal you ’ve been working up to .
Advertising
4 . “ Failure is not falling down but refusing to get up . ” - Chinese proverb
Everyone falls .
Those who refuse to pick themselves back up , no matter if it ’s after two days or two years , are the true failures .
5 . “ Successful people do n’t fear failure but understand that it ’s necessary to learn and grow from . ”
- Robert Kiyosaki
There are many success and failure quotes on this idea , and that ’s because it ’s so very important .
Learning does n’t happen when things are easy .
It happens when things get tough and you have to find a way through challenges .
6 . “ The real test is not whether you avoid this failure , because you wo n’t .
It ’s whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction , or whether you learn from it ; whether you choose to persevere . ”
- Barack Obama
No one can escape failure .
If you let it keep you down and shying away from achieving your goals , you ’ve failed again .
If you learn from it and continue on your path toward greatness , it was n’t a true failure but a lesson .
7 . “ Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough . ” - Og Mandion
Determination is one of the best antidotes to failure .
Even if you take two steps forward and one step back , you ’re still moving forward with grit and determination .
Keep going !
8 . “ Fear regret more than failure . ” - Taryn Rose
At the end of your life , what do you think you ’ll feel worst about , failing or never trying ?
9 . “ Do not judge me by my successes , judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again . ” - Nelson Mandela
If anyone has enough insight to offer us success and failure quotes , it ’s Nelson Mandela .
He learned that that path to success ( and freedom ) is full of setbacks .
His determination , however , led him to make amazing changes in the world around him .
Now that ’s success .
10 .
“ The secret of life is to fall seven times and to get up eight times . ” - Paulo Coelho
Each time you get back up , it will get easier and easier , and you ’ll realize each time that those failures are the greatest lessons life will ever give you .
11 . “ Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure . ” - Napoleon Hill
Unfortunately , many people stop trying after a large failure comes their way .
They lose their confidence , determination , and will .
However , success usually follows quickly behind these huge failures because you ’ve inevitably learned what not to do .
Advertising
Do n’t stop with the huge failure .
Take a few more steps and see if it gets you where you wanted to go .
12 . I have not failed , I ’ve just found 10,000 ways that wo n’t work . ”
- Thomas Alva Edison
Through his success and failure quotes , Thomas Edison shows us that failures are only truly failures if you do n’t learn the lesson they offer .
13 . “ It ’s fine to celebrate success , but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure . ” - Bill Gates
Celebrating success feels good , but learning the lessons of failure is where growth occurs , which can lead you to even greater successes .
14 . “ The only thing that separates success from failure is one last attempt .
Try one more time and you will get lucky . ”
- Apoorve Dubey
Every success comes from an attempt .
If you do n’t try one more time , you ’ll never know if it could ’ve been your big chance at big success .
15 . “ Failure is a detour ; not a dead - end street . ” - Zig Ziglar
Many people get impatient with failure .
They feel that it ’s a stopping point , or a road that ’s too long to walk .
However , the patience to take that new road is exactly what ’s necessary to find success .
If success is easy to find , it likely wo n’t last very long .
16 . “ In the real world , very smart people fail , and mediocre people rise .
Part of what makes people fail or succeed are skills that have nothing to do with IQ .
Also , the idea that intelligence can be gauged by an IQ test is erroneous . ”
- Camille Paglia
Failure is not a sign of a lack of intelligence , as Paglia suggests .
Failure is a sign of great intelligence and great courage .
She also points out the important point that intelligence takes many forms , and it ’s often the grit and maturity to accept failure for the temporary setback that it is .
17 . “ Think like a queen .
A queen is not afraid to fail .
Failure is another stepping stone to greatness . ”
- Oprah Winfrey
Queens will always be queens , no matter if they experience success or failure .
And you will always be you , so use that to your advantage , and take the risk of failure in order to reach success .
18 . “ It is impossible to live without failing at something , unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case , you fail by default . ” - J.K. Rowling
Living a life free of failure generally means you have lived a boring , uneventful life .
Is it really worth it ?
Advertising
19 .
“ You do n’t learn to walk by following rules .
You learn by doing , and by falling over . ” - Richard Branson
If you ’ve ever watched a child learn to walk , you know that Branson ’s success and failure quotes are true .
Children are determined .
They fall , and they get back up .
And then they learn , and soon they ’re running .
20 .
“ Success or failure is caused more by mental attitude than by mental capacity . ” - Walter Scott
Scott knows that intelligence is less of a determining factor in success than determination or ruthless optimism .
Set yourself up for success by cultivating both .
21 . “ I ’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career .
I ’ve lost almost 300 games .
26 times , I ’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed .
I ’ve failed over and over and over again .
That is why I succeed . ” - Michael Jordan
Michael Jordan knows failure , and yet we know him as an incredibly successful person .
Why ?
Because he never let the failures stop him from moving on .
22 . “ There comes a time in your life , when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it .
You surround yourself with people who make you laugh .
Forget the bad , and focus on the good .
Love the people who treat you right , pray for the ones who do n’t .
Life is too short to be anything but happy .
Falling down is a part of life , getting back up is living . ” - José N. Harris
The secrets to success are pretty simple , and living a full life is only possible once you learn that getting up after a failure will bring a great sense of satisfaction and joy .
23 . “ All people fail at certain instances in their lives , the only thing that makes them different is how they manage to stand up or how they choose to fail again . ”
- Unknown
If you fail , you ’re like the vast majority of the world .
What makes you different is how you choose to respond .
24 . “ Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly . ” - Robert Kennedy
If you aim high , even if you fall short you ’ll still likely be ahead of the majority of people .
Take the time in life to fail greatly because that ’s where you ’ll find your true self .
25 . “ Failure is good as long as it does n’t become a habit . ” - Michael Eisner
If you continue to make the same mistakes , you ’re not learning from your failures .
This is when it becomes a destructive habit instead of a moment to propel you toward success .
26 . “ If you are afraid of failure , you do n’t deserve to be successful . ” - Charles Barkley
Only those who are willing to accept the hard emotions that come along with failure will be those who will enjoy the good feelings of genuine success .
Advertising
27 . “ Failure should be our teacher , not our undertaker .
It is delay , not defeat .
It is a temporary detour , not a dead - end street . ” - William A. Ward
In his success and failure quotes , Ward points out something important .
Failure is often seen as a death stroke , something that stops our success .
If we shift our perspective and look upon failure as a teacher instead , we will likely feel very differently about those moments in our life and see that failure is delay , not death .
28 . “ Courage allows the successful woman to fail and learn powerful lessons from the failure .
So that in the end , she did n’t fail at all . ” - Maya Angelou
We ’ve been here before .
Failure is only failure if you do n’t learn from it .
Let yourself get a bad grade on the test ; you ’ll study differently next time .
Let yourself fail at a relationship ; you know how to build a healthier relationship next time .
Every failure brings a lesson .
Learn it and move on .
29 .
“ Good people are good because they ’ve come to wisdom through failure .
We get very little wisdom from success , you know . ” - William Saroyan
If you think of the moments you learned and grew the most , were they easy times or hard times ?
Challenges make us better , smarter people .
You do n’t get wise through an easy life .
30 . “ Do n’t fear failure — not failure , but low aim , is the crime .
In great attempts it is glorious even to fail . ” - Bruce Lee
If you try to achieve something great , even a failure feels like a success .
At least you had the courage to try .
That ’s more than most can say .

Lawyers say Babar Ahmad , in green , risks the death penalty in the US
Mr Ahmad , 31 , a computer expert from Tooting , south London , is accused of running websites supporting terror and of urging Muslims to fight a holy war .
His wife Maryam said her husband would be appealing in the High Court .
Charles Clarke ordered his extradition after giving " full consideration " to representations made on behalf of UK - born Mr Ahmad , the Home Office said .
But Mrs Ahmad said he would be appealing both against the home secretary 's decision and the original decision in favour of extradition made by a District Court judge in May .
She told BBC News 24 her husband should be tried in Britain , if at all .
If our government has any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Babar Ahmad then he should be charged in this country and put on trial here
Inayat Bunglawala
Muslim Council of Britain
Profile : Babar Ahmad
" If the Americans were to provide the evidence and if he was to have a trial in this country it would be very easy for us to mount a defence in support of Babar to show that he is n't the individual they are pointing him out to be , " she said .
" We 've seen where the Americans have put forward allegations against an individual and eventually when it 's come to court the case has been thrown out . "
Mr Ahmad is being held in Woodhill Prison , Milton Keynes .
On a posting on his website he said : " This decision should only come as a surprise to those who thought that there was still justice for Muslims in Britain .
" I entrust my affairs to Allah and His Words from the Quran . "
' Further alienation '
The Muslim Council of Britain said it was " very disappointed " in the extradition ruling and feared it could contribute to " further alienation " among Muslim youths .
It questioned the fairness of the Extradition Treaty 2003 under which the US government does not have to prove to the UK that there is a prima facie case to answer .
" If our government has any evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Babar Ahmad then he should be charged in this country and put on trial here , " spokesman Inayat Bunglawala said .
In effect , this sends a message to British Muslims that there is no legal and democratic means to air your concerns
Ahmad family spokesman
But the Home Office said : " The government is fully committed to completing extradition cases relating to terrorist offences as quickly as possible . "
A spokesperson said the " positive effects of strict time limits " under the act had already been seen .
" Furthermore , we have begun a consultation on how it may be possible to expedite future extradition cases involving terrorism . "
Meanwhile , a spokesman for Mr Ahmad 's family said : " In effect , this sends a message to British Muslims that there is no legal and democratic means to air your concerns . "
" We held protests , wrote letters , lobbied MPs and compiled petitions of over 15,000 signatures ...
" If the floodgates for extradition are allowed to be opened , it will be British Muslims that will be targeted - the very people the British government was hoping to win support from in the fight against terrorism . "
' Full consideration '
In May , District Judge Timothy Workman , sitting at Bow Street magistrates ' court , ruled Mr Ahmad could be extradited , and the case was sent to the home secretary for final approval .
A Home Office spokesman said : " The home secretary has given full consideration to complex representations that have been made on Mr Ahmad 's behalf , but is satisfied that the conditions for his extradition have been met . "
In claims dating back to 1997 , the US government has accused Mr Ahmad of " conspiring to support terrorism " , saying he " sought , invited and solicited contributions " via websites and e-mails .
The US Department of State has claimed that websites run by Mr Ahmad urged Muslims to use " every means at their disposal " to train for jihad , or holy war .
The websites are said to call for support for terrorist causes in Afghanistan and Chechnya , as well as encouraging the transfer of money and useful equipment via the sites .
It is also alleged Mr Ahmad tried to set up a terrorist training camp in Arizona .
His lawyers have said Mr Ahmad would be at risk of the death penalty if he was sent to the US and transferred to military jurisdiction .

Schwartzian Transform でランダムシャッフル
確かにlibcのrand ( ) は、0からRAND_MAX(たいていMAX_INT = 0x7fffffff)までの整数を返しますが、JavaScriptのMath.random( ) も含め、たいていのLL言語ではrand() やrandom()
に相当する組み込み関数は0から1までの浮動小数点の値を返すようになっています。
/* generates a random number on [ 0,1 ) with 53 - bit resolution */ static double genrand_real ( void ) { unsigned long a=genrand_int32 ( ) >> 5 , b=genrand_int32 ( ) >> 6 ; return ( a*67108864.0+b ) *( 1.0/9007199254740992.0 ) ; }
Schwartzian Transform を使って配列をシャッフルする話 をみて、なるほどな～と思いつつも、よくよく考えてみるとこれは2つの意味で駄目です。1. 計算量が O(n * log(n ) ) であるこ と 。2 . ランダムにシャッフルできない。1. は説明するまでもないので、2の理由を考えてみます。まず、rand( ) が 0..k - 1 までの k種類の整数から 1 つ数値を返すものとします。配列のサイズが n の場合、 weight の並びの場合の数は k^n 通り存在します。ところが、配列の順列の場合の数は n!
です。 ここで何か矛盾点があるように思えてきます。実際に k = 2 , n = 2 の場合を考えて見ましょう。この場合、サイズ2の配列をシャッフルするんですから、
要素を入れ替える場合と入れ替えない場合が
1/2 の確率で出現するのが正しいシャッフルです。k = 2 の場合、各配列のweightは[0 0 ] [ 0 1 ] [ 1 0 ] [ 1 1 ] の 4 通 りあります。 これらをソートして降順に並べるわけですから、ソートが安定だと仮定すれば、入れ替わるのは [ 1 0 ] の時のみになってしまいます。つまり、確率
1/4 で要素が入れ替わって 3/4 で入れ替わらない ということになります。クイックソートのように不安定の場合でも、[0 0 ] [ 1 1 ] の動作は確定的なので、結局 偏ってしまいます。k をいくら大きくしても問題は解決されません。 うまくいくのであれば、最低 ( k^n ) は n!
で割り切れなければなりません。なぜならば、n!
の場合の数を、k^n に均等に分配してあげる必要があるからです。割り切れないと、いずれかの配列の並び方を重複して数えてしまいます。これはランダムではありません。一般に ( k^n ) % n! != 0 ですから、ランダムなシャッフルは実現できません。浮動小数点だったら問題ないという指摘がありましたが，それは誤認です．たいていの乱数生成器(線形合同法やMT19937)は整数値を返すようになっています．浮動小数点を返すものは整数から適当に [ 0 - 1 ]
にノーマライズしているだけです．つまり，たとえ浮動小数点であろうと，整数値と全射の関係にあります．Ruby の rand は，MT19937 を2回つかって整数値から浮動小数点に変換しています．かりに浮動小数点を返す乱数生成器があったとしても，浮動小数点の精度は有限なので，整数値に完全にマッピングできます．ソートベースの方法が完全性を持つには，浮動小数点の乱数で，その精度が無限にある状況のみです．もっとも，RAND_MAX は十分大きいので，実用上はほとんど問題にならないと思います．大規模なシミュレーションをしても誤差は出ないと思います．

ransacking
投稿者 celebrex : 2006 年12月03 日 11:46
Webmasters have been seething at Google since it introduced its ' Big Daddy ' update in January , the biggest revision to the way its search engine operates for years .
Alarm usually accompanies changes to Google 's algorithms , as the new rankings can cause websites to be demoted , or disappear entirely .
But four months on from the introduction of " Big Daddy , " it 's clear that the problem is more serious than any previous revision - and it 's getting worse .
Webmasters now report sites not being crawled for weeks , with Google SERPS ( search engine results pages ) returning old pages , and failing to return results for phrases that used to bear fruitful results .
" Some sites have lost 99 per cent of their indexed pages , " reports one member of the Webmaster World forum .
" Many cache dates go back to 2004 January . "
Others report long - extinct pages showing up as " Supplemental Results . "
This thread is typical of the problems .
With creating junk web pages is so cheap and easy to do , Google is engaged in an arms race with search engine optimizers .
Each innovation designed to bring clarity to the web , such as tagging , is rapidly exploited by spammers or site owners wishing to harvest some classified advertising revenue .
Recently , we featured a software tool that can create 100 Blogger weblogs in 24 minutes , called Blog Mass Installer .
A subterranean industry of sites providing " private label articles , " or PLAs exists to flesh out " content " for these freshly minted sites .
And as a result , legitimate sites are often caught in the cross fire .
But the new algorithms may not be solely to blame .
Google 's chief executive Eric Schmidt has hinted at another reason for the recent chaos .
In Google 's earnings conference call last month , Schmidt was frank about the extent of the problem .
" Those machines are full , " he said .
" We have a huge machine crisis . "
And there 's at least some anecdotal evidence to support the theory that hardware limitations are to blame .
" The issue I have now is Googlebot is SLAMMING my sites since last week , but none of it makes it into the index .
If it 's old pages being re-indexed or new pages for the first page , they do n't show up , " writes one webmaster .
The confusion has several consequences which we 've rarely seen discussed outside web circles .
Giving
Google the benefit of the doubt , and assuming the changes are intentional , one webmaster writes : " In which case Google 's index , and hence effectively ' the Web as most people know it ' is set to become a whole lot smaller in the coming weeks . "
It 's barely more than a year since Yahoo ! and Google were engaged in a willy - waving exercise to claim who had the largest index .
( See My spam - filled search index is bigger than yours ! )
Now size , it seems , does n't matter .
There 's also the intriguing question raised by search engines that are unable to distinguished between nefarious sites and legitimate SEO ( search engine optimization ) techniques ?
The search engines can't , we now know , blacklist a range of well - establish techniques without causing chaos .
In future , will the search engines need to code for backward bug compatibility ?
And lingering in the background is the question of whether the explosion of junk content - estimates put robot - generated spam consists of anywhere between one - fifth and one - third of the Google index - can be tamed ?
" At this rate , " writes one poster on the Google Sitemaps Usenet group , in a year the SERPS will be nothing but Amazon affiliates , Ebay auctions , and Wiki clones .
Those sites do n't seem to be affected one bit by supplemental hell , 301s , and now deindexing . "
With $ 8 billion in the bank , Google is better resourced and more focussed than anyone - but it 's still struggling .
Financial analysts noted that its R&D expenditure now matches that of a wireline telco .
Only a cynic would suggest that poor SERPs drive desperate businesses to the search engines own classified ad departments - so if you want to play , you have to pay .
Banish that unworthy thought at once .
( Thanks to Isham Research 's Phil Payne for the tip ) . ®
Bootnote : Something called OneWebDay - we 're not kidding - is encouraging you to celebrate the web with a " special hand signal - you extend your middle three fingers and have your thumb and little finger touch in a circle .
Not the gesture many webmasters are making this week .
Website development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the World Wide Web or a private network .
This can include web design , web content development , client liaison , client - side / server - side scripting , web server and network security configuration , and e-commerce development .
However , among web professionals , “ website development ” usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites : writing markup and coding .
Website development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web - based internet applications , electronic businesses , or social network services .
People who develop websites are called web developers .
For larger organizations and businesses , web development teams can consist of hundreds of people .
Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department .
Business online presence with Website , App , or social media is a valuable base or asset for its success .
Complete control on the content with engaging look - and - feel serves as the crucial resources for customers .
Do every business has a website !
No .
The number of companies who do n't have a website or any other online presence is impressive .
It makes the web hosting and website development business look more lucrative .
WordPress , PHP Scripts , drag and drop web builder , E - commerce tools , intelligent editors , content management systems ( CMS ) and many platforms like WordPress , Joomla , and Drupal have made the daunting task of responsive website development more comfortable .
The un-experienced non-technical practitioners are also able to create a fully functional and professional - looking website .
At a time , when designers and developers were not targeting the small businesses , now the small businesses are not looking towards them for their website development .
An experienced business owner knows everything about its business , the type of customers , markets , products , promotional strategies which works , marketing , and branding .
Entrepreneurs consider every minute details which impact their business , whether online or offline .
The business card , social media presence , blog , news published in magazines or reputed newspapers complement or help to create their brand identity .
So many things or details are crucial , hence a lot of brainstorming sessions required for business websites to decide the color , menus , call - to - action - buttons , locations of various content and images .
Web Development can be split into many areas and a typical and basic web development hierarchy might consist of :
Client Side Coding
Flash Adobe Flash Player is a ubiquitous browser plug - in ready for RIAs .
Flex 2 is also deployed to the Flash Player .
JavaScript is a ubiquitous client side platform for creating and delivering rich Web applications that can also run across a wide variety of devices .
JQuery Cross - browser JavaScript library designed to simplify and speed up the client - side scripting of HTML .
Microsoft Silverlight Microsoft 's browser plug - in that enables animation , vector graphics and high - definition video playback , programmed using XAML and .NET programming languages .
HTML5 and CSS3 Latest HTML proposed standard combined with the latest proposed standard for CSS natively supports much of the client - side functionality provided by other frameworks such as Flash .
Server Side Coding
ASP ( Microsoft proprietary )
CSP , Server - Side ANSI C
ColdFusion
CGI
Groovy ( programming language ) Grails ( framework )
Java , e.g. Java EE or WebObjects
Lotus Domino
Perl , e.g. Catalyst , Dancer ( all open sources )
PHP ( open source )
Python , e.g. Django ( web framework ) ( open source )
Real Studio Web Edition
Ruby , e.g. Ruby on Rails ( open source )
Smalltalk e.g. Seaside , AIDA / Web
SSJS Server - Side JavaScript , e.g. Aptana Jaxer , Mozilla Rhino
WebDNA ( WSC proprietary )
Websphere ( IBM proprietary )
. NET and .NET MVC Frameworks ( Microsoft proprietary )
Web engineering is multidisciplinary and encompasses contributions from diverse areas : systems analysis and design , software engineering , hypermedia / hypertext engineering , requirements engineering , human - computer interaction , user interface , information engineering , etc .
Web engineering is neither a clone , nor a subset of software engineering , although both involve programming and software development .
While web engineering uses software engineering principles , web development encompasses new approaches , methodologies , tools , techniques , and guidelines to meet the unique requirements for web - based applications .
Client Side + Server Side
Google Web Toolkit provides tools to create and maintain complex JavaScript front - end applications in Java .
Opa is a high - level language in which both the client and the server parts are implemented .
The compiler then decides which parts run on the client and which parts run on the server .
The developer can tune those decisions with simple directives .
Tersus is a platform for the development of rich web applications by visually defining user interface , client side behavior and server side processing .
However languages like Ruby and Python are often paired with database servers other than MySQL .
For instance some developers prefer a LAPR ( Linux / Apache / PostgreSQL / Ruby on Rails ) setup for development .
Website development takes into account many security considerations , such as data entry error checking through forms , filtering output , and encryption .
Malicious practices such as SQL injection can be executed by users with ill intent yet with only primitive knowledge of web development as a whole .
Scripts can be exploited to grant unauthorized access to malicious users trying to collect information such as email addresses , passwords and protected content like credit card numbers .

A Turing machine is the simplest form of a computer .
The concept was invented by Alan Turing in 1936 .
This was the first computer invented ( on paper only ) .
I- Principles of a Turing machine .
In its simplest form , a Turing machine is composed of a " tape " , a ribbon of paper of indefinite length .
There is a " head " that can read the symbol , chose to write a new symbol in place , and then move left or right .
The Turing machine is said to be in a certain " state " .
Finally , the program is a list of " transitions " , that is a list that says , given a current state and a symbol currently under the head , what should be written on the tape , what state the machine should go , and whether the head should move left or right .
The tape is used to store data .
In addition , it can also store a series of transitions ( a small programs ) and thus , the head can run " sub- programs " .
We then say a Turing machine is emulating another one ( the one on the tape ) .
By analogy with modern computers , the tape is the memory and the head is the microprocessor .
Although it is composed of pretty simple capabilities , Turing argued that this simple machine could performed any computation , that is , could realize anything that results from operations .
In 1950 , he discussed that the mind is itself the results of operations ( at the neural level ) and thus is the creator of the artificial intelligence studies .
For examples , see : Turing machine simulator Virtual Turing machine
One way to know that a simple mechanism has the same computational capabilities than a Turing machine is to see if it can emulate a Turing machine .
Only these mechanisms are powerful enough .
Indirectly , it shows that humans are also Turing machines since we can emulate them .
II - The Automaton with Append .
I chose to implement in Lego a slightly different version of the original Turing machine .
Instead of having a bi directional tape , it uses a stack .
When the symbol beneath the stack is read ( and removed ) , the machine changes " states " and can add zero , one or two symbols on top of the stack .
This variation is maybe very different yet it is possible to show that this simple machine has the same capabilities than a Turing machine .
Among other things , it can emulate a Turing machine placed on the stack .
I programmed a small interface ( through an Access database so Microsoft Access must be installed on your computer ) to enter an test simple Automaton With Append ( AWA or AAA in French ) .
Follow this link to download the demo : AAA.zip .
One reason to build the automaton with append instead of the original Turing machine was that I avoided building a bi directional ( near ) infinite tape .
III - Building the automaton with LEGO
It turned out to be a very difficult project since , among other things , the construction needs to be " binary " , that is , to be able to deliver one and only one symbol on the top of the stack , to pull one and only one symbol from beneath the stack , and that , for an indefinite period of time .
In itself , adding a symbol is not that complicated , but doing this with " binary " precision is another matter entirely .
a ) the symbols
The symbols themselves are made of cylinders .
Using plates , I can code in binary so that the cylinder below is ( 1,0,1 ) or the number 5 .
This kind of bar code is easy to read using the light detector .
b) the memory
The stack is a small hollow tower in which the symbols can fall horizontally .
It is therefore a " compact " memory , containing near 10 bytes per 6 inches !
Another difficulty is to make sure the symbols will always remain horizontal , which implies equal friction everywhere .
Below is shown one section but many can be connected together .
I used two sections ( since I pretty much ran out of beams at that point ) .
c ) the reader
The reader is at the bottom of the memory .
It is a mechanism meant to expulse one symbol at a time .
The expulsed symbol pass in front of the light detector ( not shown ) so that the bar code can be read .
It is composed of the lower part of the memory stack and of a lever ( shown on the side ) that pushes the symbol out , activated in and out by the red axle .
d ) the stacker
The stacker is at the top .
Its purpose is to place new symbols on the stack .
It is maybe the most difficult part of the automaton .
Only one bank is shown in the picture , but 5 were actually implemented ( see pictures below ) .
It works using the two blue blades .
Every time the blades turn 90 degrees , one symbol falls down the memory onto the stack .
In order to turn exactly 90 degrees , I used the rotation sensor described in the section " Rotation sensor " , connected onto the red axle for each bank .
Since in the full implementation , there are 5 banks , the correct bank cannot be controlled directly from the RCX which has only three outputs .
Therefore , a selector is required that can select , using one motors , which of ( up to 5 ) output must be activated .
I used the third design from the page on my 2 - to - 7 multiplexors .
e- putting it all together
All the designs shown above are available in LDRAW files :
a- the symbol : symbol.dat
b- the memory : memory .
dat
c- the reader : reader_b.dat , reader_a.dat
d- the stacker : provider.dat and the rotation sensor : rotation3.dat
e - the selecter : multi_v3.dat
IV - Programming Well , this Turing machine is not entirely mechanical ...
I used the RCX to store the transition table .
Since the symbols are bar codes read with a light detector , it would have been very difficult to continue with a physical mechanism .
Three subroutines are required , one to select which symbol to provide on top of the memory , one to turn the provider one quarter of a turn , and one to pull out one symbol from the bottom of the memory ( reading it on the way ) .
These routines were programmed using PRO - BOT .
The subroutine Stacker turns the provider one quarter of a turn .
It uses a sensor that turns off then on : Declare Stacker CONSTANT 2
Declare stack MOTOR 1
Declare stacking SENSOR 0
Declare stacker_duration CONSTANT
10
SetSensorType(stacking , SWITCH_TYPE )
BeginOfSub( Stacker )
On( stack )
While ( stacking = Open )
EndWhile ( )
Wait ( stacker_duration )
While ( stacking = Close )
EndWhile ( )
Wait ( stacker_duration )
Off ( stack )
EndOfSub ( )
The second subroutine select which symbol to provide .
It uses two global variables , one which indicates the current location and another one which indicate which is the desired symbol .
It compares the actual position with the desired position and move the motor Selecter accordingly : BeginOfSub( Selecter )
{ if there is a move to do}
If ( objective <> actual_pos )
{decide which way , backward or forward}
If ( objective < actual_pos )
SetRwd( select )
Else
SetFwd( select )
EndIF ( )
{perform the moves for the right duration}
While ( actual_pos <> objective )
SetVar( select_duration , next_step )
{ if this is the last or first symbol}
If ( actual_pos = nrnotch )
SetVar( select_duration , first_step )
EndIF ( )
If ( actual_pos = CONSTANT,1 )
SetVar( select_duration , first_step )
EndIF ( )
{move one notch}
On(select )
Wait ( select_duration )
Off ( select )
{update actual position }
If ( objective < actual_pos )
SubVar( actual_pos , CONSTANT,1 )
Else
SumVar( actual_pos , CONSTANT,1 )
EndIF ( )
EndWhile ( )
EndIF ( )
PlayTone ( 400,20 )
EndOfSub ( )
The last subroutine Reader removes one symbol from the bottom of the memory stack , reading it along the way , returning in the variable Symbol the number of black bars on it : Declare Reader CONSTANT 4
Declare read MOTOR 2
Declare reading SENSOR 2
Declare reader_duration CONSTANT 19
Declare gray_luminance CONSTANT 700
Declare couleur VARIABLE 30
Declare Symbol VARIABLE 29
Declare read_timer TIMER 0
BeginOfSub( Reader )
{ 0 - initialise}
SetVar( Symbol , constant , 1 )
SetVar( couleur , black )
{ a- pull out}
ClearTimer ( read_timer )
On( read )
While ( read_timer < reader_duration )
EndWhile ( )
AlterDir( read )
{b- push in , reading the symbol}
ClearTimer ( read_timer )
While ( read_timer < reader_duration )
If ( couleur = white )
If ( reading > gray_luminance )
SetVar( couleur , black )
SumVar( Symbol , constant , 1 )
EndIF ( )
EndIF ( )
If ( couleur = black )
If ( reading < gray_luminance )
SetVar( couleur , white )
EndIF ( )
EndIF ( )
EndWhile ( )
AlterDir( read )
Off ( read )
{ c- remove two for the black of the reader}
SubVar ( Symbol , constant ,
2 )
EndOfSub ()
A complete listing of the source code is provided in this text file : AAA.rcp .
These three routines are the building blocks used in a main program that run the automaton .
The main program can be generated automatically by the demo program indicated earlier , AAA.mdb .
V- A full example : the AxnBxn problem .
Suppose a very simple problem that we want to be solved by an automaton .
We want a system that can decide whether the number of A's placed at the beginning of the input ( on the memory stack ) is the same as the number of B's following the A's .
The symbol # indicates the end of the input .
A simple way to program the automaton is to ( i ) read the first A , ( ii ) all the A's that follow are place back on the top of the stack , ( iii ) to read the first B , ( iv ) all the remaining B's are placed back on the top of the stack , and ( v ) once the end - of - input is reach , put it back on top of the stack , and start the program again on the resulting input .
Basically , it creates a new input that has one A and one B less than the original input .
A simple way to represent an automaton is with the following diagram :
Where the > sign next to q 0 indicates the starting state , and the double line around q exit indicates the accepting state , that is , the input was adequate .
The branches depend on the symbol found on the memory ( at the bottom of the stack ) .
On occasion , there is an indication " stack an A " which means that the automaton is adding a symbol on top of the memory .
Although this visual diagram is convenient to visualize the operations of the AxnBxn automaton , they are generally represented using the transition table , as follow : ( q0 , # ) -> ( nothing ) , ( nothing ) , qExit
( q0 , a ) -> ( nothing ) , ( nothing ) , q1
( q1 , a ) -> a , ( nothing ) , q1
( q1 , b ) -> ( nothing ) , ( nothing ) , q2
( q2 , # ) -> # , ( nothing ) , q0
( q2 , b ) -> b , ( nothing ) , q2 where ( nothing ) means that nothing is added to the stack .
You can check that both representation have the same meaning .
The RCX program that will run this automaton is generated by the AAA.mdb demo program , and the result is : { Mapping of the internal states to a numeric value : }
Declare q0 CONSTANT 0
Declare q1 CONSTANT 1
Declare q2 CONSTANT 2
Declare qEx CONSTANT 3
{ Mapping of the internal symbols to a number of bars ( and the banks ) : }
Declare # CONSTANT 0
Declare a CONSTANT 1
Declare b CONSTANT 2
SetVar( State = q0 ) {starting state}
While ( State <> qEx ) {finishing state}
GoSub( Reader ) { reads one symbol , unstacking it on the way}
If ( State = q0 )
If ( Symbol = #)
SetVar( State , qEx ) {new state}
EndIf ( )
EndIf ( )
If ( State = q0 )
If ( Symbol = a )
SetVar( State , q1 ) {new state}
EndIf ( )
EndIf ( )
If ( State = q1 )
If ( Symbol = a )
SetVar( Objective = a ) { stacks one symbol}
GoSub ( Selecter )
GoSub ( Stacker )
SetVar( State , q1 ) {new state}
EndIf ( )
EndIf ( )
If ( State = q1 )
If ( Symbol = b )
SetVar( State , q2 ) {new state}
EndIf ( )
EndIf ( )
If ( State = q2 )
If ( Symbol = #)
SetVar ( Objective = # ) { stacks one symbol}
GoSub ( Selecter )
GoSub ( Stacker )
SetVar( State , q0 ) {new state}
EndIf ( )
EndIf ( )
If ( State = q2 )
If ( Symbol = b )
SetVar( Objective = b ) { stacks one symbol}
GoSub ( Selecter )
GoSub ( Stacker )
SetVar( State , q2 ) {new state}
EndIf ( )
EndIf ( )
EndWhile ( ) { end of the main loop}
This program is saved by AAA.mdb under the name of AAA_2.rcp , which is automatically inserted in the global program AAA.rcp .
IV - My implementation
Here is the final result :
Not exactly small , and the colors do n't really match ( I barely have enough LEGO to make it all ;-) ) .
Below are more details , break down in three pictures .
Click to enlarge .
A view on the stacker with its 5 banks .
In front of the banks are the rotation sensors .
A view on the selecter , a 2 - to - 7 multiplexor which can select one of the 5 bank .
Underneath are the two motors that controls it .
A back - side view of the reader with the RCX on the side .
We can see through the beams of the memory a few symbols stacked , ready to be read .
IIV : What can we learn from Turing machines ?
The main question is related to artificial intelligence .
The Turing machine can perform any computation .
Well , does the brain performs computations ?
If so , it is possible to imagine one day a computer that will have the same cognitive capabilities than a human .
We could converse with it , it could discover new insight about physics , about the human nature ...
For more , check the Loebner Prize .
It takes something as big as Hurricane Katrina and the misery we saw among the poor black people of New Orleans to get America to focus on race and poverty .
It happens about once every 30 or 40 years .
What we saw unfold in the days after the hurricane was the most naked manifestation of conservative social policy towards the poor , where the message for decades has been : ' You are on your own ' .
Well , they really were on their own for five days in that Superdome , and it was Darwinism in action - the survival of the fittest .
People said : ' It looks like something out of the Third World . '
Well , New Orleans was Third World long before the hurricane .
It 's not just Katrina , it 's povertina .
People were quick to call them refugees because they looked as if they were from another country .
They are .
Exiles in America .
Their humanity had been rendered invisible so they were never given high priority when the well - to - do got out and the helicopters came for the few .
Almost everyone stuck on rooftops , in the shelters , and dying by the side of the road was poor black .
In the end George Bush has to take responsibility .
When [ the rapper ]
Kanye
West said the President does not care about black people , he was right , although the effects of his policies are different from what goes on in his soul .
You have to distinguish between a racist intent and the racist consequences of his policies .
Bush is still a ' frat boy ' , making jokes and trying to please everyone while the Neanderthals behind him push him more to the right .
Poverty has increased for the last four or five years .
A million more Americans became poor last year , even as the super - wealthy became much richer .
So where is the trickle - down , the equality of opportunity ?
Healthcare and education and the social safety net being ripped away - and that flawed structure was nowhere more evident than in a place such as New Orleans , 68 per cent black .
The average adult income in some parishes of the city is under $ 8,000 ( £ 4,350 ) a year .
The average national income is $ 33,000 , though for African - Americans it is about $ 24,000 .
It has one of the highest city murder rates in the US .
From slave ships to the Superdome was not that big a journey .
New Orleans has always been a city that lived on the edge .
The white blues man himself , Tennessee Williams , had it down in A Streetcar Named Desire - with Elysian Fields and cemeteries and the quest for paradise .
When you live so close to death , behind the levees , you live more intensely , sexually , gastronomically , psychologically .
Louis Armstrong came out of that unbelievable cultural breakthrough unprecedented in the history of American civilisation .
The rural blues , the urban jazz .
It is the tragi -comic lyricism that gives you the courage to get through the darkest storm .
Charlie Parker would have killed somebody if he had not blown his horn .
The history of black people in America is one of unbelievable resilience in the face of crushing white supremacist powers .
This kind of dignity in your struggle cuts both ways , though , because it does not mobilise a collective uprising against the elites .
That was the Black Panther movement .
You probably need both .
There would have been no Panthers without jazz .
If I had been of Martin Luther King 's generation I would never have gone to Harvard or Princeton .
They shot brother Martin dead like a dog in 1968 when the mobilisation of the black poor was just getting started .
At least one of his surviving legacies was the quadrupling in the size of the black middle class .
But Oprah [ Winfrey ] the billionaire and the black judges and chief executives and movie stars do not mean equality , or even equality of opportunity yet .
Black faces in high places does not mean racism is over .
Condoleezza Rice has sold her soul .
Now the black bourgeoisie have an even heavier obligation to fight for the 33 per cent of black children living in poverty - and to alleviate the spiritual crisis of hopelessness among young black men .
Bush talks about God , but he has forgotten the point of prophetic Christianity is compassion and justice for those who have least .
Hip - hop has the anger that comes out of post - industrial , free - market America , but it lacks the progressiveness that produces organisations that will threaten the status quo .
There has not been a giant since King , someone prepared to die and create an insurgency where many are prepared to die to upset the corporate elite .
The Democrats are spineless .
There is the danger of nihilism and in the Superdome around the fourth day , there it was - husbands held at gunpoint while their wives were raped , someone stomped to death , people throwing themselves off the mezzanine floor , dozens of bodies .
It was a war of all against all - ' you 're on your own ' - in the centre of the American empire .
But now that the aid is pouring in , vital as it is , do not confuse charity with justice .
I 'm not asking for a revolution , I am asking for reform .
A Marshall Plan for the South could be the first step .

I have been using Vista Beta 2 for a while now and there is one thing that continues to frustrate me .
Microsoft has designed the User Account Control ( UAC ) to work so perfectly that it will be difficult for the average person to switch the default browser .
After installing Vista you can open up the Control Panel and the first thing that I do is switch to the classic view .
Opening up the Default Programs module and looking at the setting for Internet Explorer reveals that it is set to the default browser :
Not surprising , right ?
Like Microsoft would ship Vista with Firefox or Opera…even though it would be funny if someone slipped it in before it was sent to RTM :) .
That ’s besides the point because I just want to download Firefox , install it , and set it to be my default browser so that I do n’t have to worry about IE opening up my links .
That ’s what I did and once I ran Firefox for the first time it asked if I wanted to set it to be the default browser …of course I do !
I continued on with my browsing and when I get done I closed Firefox .
Later on I returned to my computer , ran Firefox , and I was presented with the same window asking if I would like to set Firefox as the default browser .
At this point I was thoroughly confused and I returned to the Default Programs in the Control Panel only to see that IE is still my default browser !
Then it clicks !
I have to run Firefox as an administrator so that I am authorizing Vista to change my personal setting .
I right - clicked on my Firefox icon and selected “ Run As Administrator ” :
Then I confirm that I authorized this action :
Finally I agree to set Firefox as my default browser , again !
This time it works and if I take a look at the Default Programs in the Control Panel I can see the change I just made :
Is this really a great security feature or just a headache ?
At first I thought it was a security feature but then I decided to do a little experiment .
I opened IE and when I was prompted to switch my default browser back to Internet Explorer I chose the “ yes ” option .
Guess what , it did switch my browser back to Internet Explorer without ever having to run it as an administrator .
I am still quite perplexed at this and I am hoping that the issue is on Mozilla ’s end for not making the program get the proper permission to change the setting .
I really hope this is n’t Redmond ’s way of mocking Mozilla ’s “ Take Back The Web ” slogan by replacing it with their own “ Take Back The Market Share ” .
MSNBC confirms : Outed CIA agent was working on Iran RAW STORY
Published : Monday May 1 , 2006 Print This | Email This On Chris Matthews ' Hardball Monday evening , just moments ago , MSNBC correspondent David Shuster confirmed what RAW STORY first reported in February : that outed CIA officer Valerie Plame Wilson was working on Iran at the time she was outed ( Watch the video of Shuster 's report here ) .
RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna broke the story earlier this year , which went unnoticed by the mainstream media ( Read our full story ) .
According to current and former intelligence officials , Plame Wilson , who worked on the clandestine side of the CIA in the Directorate of Operations as a non-official cover ( NOC ) officer , was part of an operation tracking distribution and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction technology to and from Iran .
Reports Shuster in this rush transcript : " INTELLIGENCE SOURCES SAY VALERIE WILSON WAS PART OF AN OPERATION THREE YEARS AGO TRACKING THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS MATERIAL INTO IRAN .
AND THE SOURCES ALLEGE THAT WHEN MRS .
WILSON'S COVER WAS BLOWN , THE ADMINISTRATION'S ABILITY TO TRACK IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS WAS DAMAGED AS WELL . "
MSNBC transcript follows ( we apologize for the caps ; they were in the original ) .
# Matthews : Ever since the White House / CIA leak scandal erupted , the nation has seen photographs here and there of Valerie Wilson , the CIA operative whose identity was blown .
Now , thanks to a black tie event Saturday night , we have some video .
Hardball correspondent David Shuster brings it to us and has the latest on the CIA leak case .
( David Shuster ) FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE BUSH ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS REVEALED HER UNDERCOVER IDENTITY AND RUINED HER CAREER --- FORMER CIA OPERATIVE VALERIE WILSON ... ACCOMPANIED BY HER HUSBAND JOE WILSON , STEPPED IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION CAMERAS .
AND THEIR RED CARPET APPEARANCE SATURDAY NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT'S DINNER COULD NOT HAVE COME AT A MORE DRAMATIC MOMENT IN THE CIA LEAK INVESTIGATION ITSELF .
PROSECUTOR PATRICK FITZGERALD IS WEIGHING WHETHER TO INDICT TOP PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR KARL ROVE , OTHERWISE KNOWN AS BUSH'S BRAIN .
AND , WHITE HOUSE SUPPORTERS ARE STEPPING UP THEIR ARGUMENT THAT UNVEILING WILSON'S IDENITY WAS NOT A CRIME .
JOE WILSON'S RESPONSE ?
Wilson : " Well the CIA I think has responded first by asking the Justice Department to open an investigation and my judgment the leak of national security information is a betrayal a minimum of one 's security clearance and certainly of the public trust and I for one can't understand how Mr. Rove remains on the payroll of the US Government . "
EARLY IN THE CASE , ROVE ADMITTED TO INVESTIGATORS THAT HE OUTED VALERIE WILSON'S IDENTITY TO COLUMNIST ROBERT NOVAK -- NOVAK WAS THE FIRST JOURNALIST TO PUBLISH WILSON'S IDENTITY AND THE FIRST TO TALK ABOUT IT TO INVESTIGATORS .
AND LAST WEEK , KARL ROVE TESTIFIED AGAIN HE MAY HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE WILSON'S WITH TIME MAGAZINE'S MATT COOPER .
ROVE SAID HE DENIED THAT UNDER OATH FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF THE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE OF MEMORY PROBLEMS .
A CASE OF BAD MEMORY IS SCOOTER LIBBY'S DEFENSE .
BUT IN REGARDS TO KARL ROVE , LAWYERS IN THE CASE SAY PROSECUTOR FITZGERALD IS STILL TROUBLED BY THE TIMING OF ROVE'S ROLLING DISCLOSURES : IT SEEMS THAT ROVE'S MEMORY PERKS UP WITH EVERY NEW INDICATION SOMEONE ELSE WILL EXPOSE HIM .
WHEN ROVE FINALLY BEGAN TO UPDATE HIS TESTIMONY IN OCTOBER 2004 ...
IT WAS JUST DAYS AFTER COOPER WAS FIRST HELD IN CONTEMPT FOR REFUSING TO DISCLOSE CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES .
AND ROVE DID NOT GIVE COOPER A CLEAR WAIVER TO TESTIFY UNTIL AFTER COOPER'S APPEALS HAD BEEN EXHAUSTED 9 MONTHS LATER .
IN ANY CASE , AS PROSECUTOR PATRICK FITZGERALD CONSIDERS WHETHER TO CHARGE KARL ROVE WITH PERJURY , OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE , OR WORSE ...
MSNBC HAS LEARNED NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE WHITE HOUSE LEAKS .
INTELLIGENCE SOURCES SAY VALERIE WILSON WAS PART OF AN OPERATION THREE YEARS AGO TRACKING THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS MATERIAL INTO IRAN .
AND THE SOURCES ALLEGE THAT WHEN MRS .
WILSON'S COVER WAS BLOWN , THE ADMINISTRATION'S ABILITY TO TRACK IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS WAS DAMAGED AS WELL .
THE WHITE HOUSE CONSIDERS IRAN TO BE ONE OF AMERICA'S BIGGEST THREATS .
President George W. Bush : " the Iranians should not have a nuclear weapon , the capacity to make a nuclear weapon , or the knowledge as to how to make a nuclear weapon .
And now that we 've got the goal in mind , we 're working on the tactics . "
BUT THE TACTICS ARE NOT AS CLEAR IN THE MIDST OF RECORD LOW APPROVAL RATINGS AND A DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY PLAYING FIELD LIMITED BY THE U-S WAR IN IRAQ .
Madeleine Albright : " The world is in total turmoil right now .
Worst I 've ever seen it .
( reporter )
How do we get out of it ?
Whats the number one issue as far as whats related to that turmoil ?
( Albright ) Iraq . ( reporter )
What do we do about it ?
( Albright walks away ) THE IRAQ WAR IS THE BACKDROP FOR THE CIA LEAK CASE .
JOE WILSON HAD CRITICIZED THE ADMINISTRATION'S CASE FOR THE IRAQ WAR ...
AND THE WHITE HOUSE TRIED TO UNDERCUT HIM BY LEAKING , AMONG OTHER THINGS , INFORMATION ABOUT HIS CIA WIFE .
Shuster : THE WILSONS SAY THEY'VE SPOKEN TO PROSECUTOR PATRICK FITZGERALD TWICE SINCE THE CASE BEGAN ...
AND THE LAST TIME WAS SEVERAL MONTHS AGO .
SO , THEY ARE WAITING , LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE , FOR SOME SORT OF ANNOUNCEMENT FROM FITZGERALD'S OFFICE ABOUT ROVE .
KARL ROVE'S ATTORNEYS SAY THEY'VE BEEN TOLD BY FITZGERALD THAT NO DECISION WILL BE MADE FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER WEEK .

In an effort to replace my home backup server with Amazon 's S3 , I 've been collecting a list of Amazon S3 compatible backup tools to look at .
Here 's what I 've discovered , followed by my requirements .
The List
I 've evaluated exactly zero of these so far .
That 's next .
s3sync.rb is written in Ruby as a sort of rsync clone to replace the perl script s3sync which is now abandonware .
Given that I already use rsync for much of my backup system , this is highly appealing .
Backup Manager appears to now have S3 support as of version 0.7.3 .
It 's a command - line tool for Linux ( and likely other Unix - like systems ) .
s3DAV is n't exactly a backup tool .
It 's provides a WebDAV front - end ( or " virtual filesystem " ) to S3 storage , so you could use many other backup tools with S3 .
Recent versions of Windows and Mac OS have WebDAV support built - in .
Java is required for s3DAV .
S3 Backup is an Open Source tool for backing up to S3 .
It 's currently available only for Windows .
Mac and Linux versions appear to be planned .
The UI is built on wxWidgets .
duplicity is a free Unix tool that uses S3 and the librsync library .
It is written in Python but not considered suitable for backing up important data quite yet .
S3 Solutions is a list of other S3 related tools on the Amazon Developer Connection .
Brackup is a backup tool written by Brad Fitzpatrick ( of LiveJournal , SixApart , memcached , perlbal , etc ... ) .
It 's written in Perl , fairly new , and does n't have a lot in the way of documentation yet .
Jungle Disk provides clients for Mac , Windows , and Linux .
It also offers a local WebDAV server .
DragonDisk has Linux and Windows clients .
For those keeping track , non-S3 options suggested in the comment on my previous post are Carbonite , rsync.net , and a DreamHost account .
Are there other S3 tools that I 'm missing ?
Also , I 've found that Amazon 's S3 forum is quite helpful .
The discussion there is generally of good quality and the software does the job nicely .
Perhaps we should do something similar for YDN instead of using Yahoo !
Groups ?
My Requirements
Most of what I need to backup lives on Linux servers in a few collocation facilities around the country ( Bowling Green , Ohio ; San Jose , California ; San Francisco , CA ) .
My laptop and desktop windows boxes have USB backup and get automatically synced to a Unix box on a regular basis already using the excellent SyncBack SE , so I do n't need to re-solve that problem .
I do n't really need a fancy GUI .
I 'm really looking for a stand alone tool that 's designed to work with S3 and keep bandwidth usage to a minimum .
Alternatively , something that works at a lower level ( such as a filesystem driver ) to provide a " virtual drive " type of interface might work as well .

At Totonno ’s in Coney Island , pizza has been made the same way since 1924 .
Along with its Brooklyn pizza brethren Di Fara ’s , Grimaldi ’s and Franny ’s , Totonno ’s is considered among the best in the country by people who have dedicated their lives to the subject .
We purchased our Domino ’s pie just a few blocks away from Totonno ’s on Neptune Avenue .
That it was handed to us over bulletproof glass turned out to be the most authentically Brooklyn part about it .
Domino ’s , which began selling Brooklyn Style pies at its 5,100 United States stores last week , designed the pizza to mimic what most New Yorkers get when they go for a slice .
The crust is stretched thinner than that of a standard Domino ’s pizza , and the cornmeal cooked into the crust gives it certain crispness .
The pieces of pepperoni and wads of sausage the company suggests as toppings are freakishly large .
The slices are so big you can fold them , which , it seems , is the Brooklyn -y part .
Tony Muia , who runs A Slice of Brooklyn Pizza Tour , said the first problem with the Domino ’s pie is that it ’s cut into six slices instead of eight .
And he does n’t like the cornmeal .
“ O.K. , so you put cornmeal on the bottom of your pizza .
So what ? ” he said .
“ You go back to Naples , there ’s flour on the board . ”

The software is based on pattern recognition
But IBM researchers are betting that tracing letters on a touch screen will become the way to write on a handheld device like a PDA or mobile phone .
They have developed software that works by recognising the patterns of words .
" In the long run this will be one of the major interaction methods for mobile devices , " said IBM researcher Shumin Zhai .
Dubbed Shark ( Shorthand - Aided Rapid Keyboarding ) , the team say the software is ready to go into commercial development and could be bundled with PDAs in the coming months .
Palm power
Handheld computing devices like PDAs and Tablet PCs are getting increasingly powerful .
But without a keyboard , taking advantage of the potential of these gadgets can be a struggle .
Anyone who has used a handheld device will be familiar with the problem .
We realised that people remember patterns and not letters .
There is some higher level learning that is encoded in human memory
Dr Shumin Zhai , IBM
These methods can be cumbersome and slow , as well as being prone to errors , leading Dr Zhai at IBM 's Almaden Research Center in California to wonder if there was a better way .
" The new problem is when computing takes place outside of the desktop format , " he told the BBC News website .
" You wanted something that offers both high speed and high accuracy .
But on the other hand people do n't want to spend a lot of time to learn . "
Even speech recognition software has its problems .
While recording a memo works well , speech is less suited for longer , complete sentences .
" The major issue with speech is that speech is a very different process to writing , " said Dr Zhai .
" Most people cannot speak an essay , an article .
The way you speak and you write is very different . "
Pattern recognition
Dr Zhai and his PhD student , Per - Ola Kristensson , took a sideways look at the problem and came up with some surprising results .
" We realised that people remember patterns and not letters , " explained Dr Zhai .
" There is some higher level learning that is encoded in human memory . "
The Atomik keyboard is designed for letter associations
Instead of tapping out letters or writing a word on screen , you trace each letter in a single , fluid stroke .
The keyboard on screen shows the shape of the word .
The software works with a standard Qwerty keyboard , as well as IBM 's experimental Atomik keyboard .
The keys in the Atomik keyboard are arranged to maximise letter associations .
Dr Zhai reckons that 100 patterns cover about 40 % of the words most people write .
The software lends a hand by making allowances for mistakes .
It uses algorithms to recognise that some letter combinations are more likely to form words than others .
In tests , people have reached speeds of around 60 to 70 words per minute .
While this is slower than touch - typing , it is much faster than tapping out words with a stylus .
" Eventually you reach a high performance level as each time you trace a word , the pattern will start to be remembered , " said Dr Zhai .
" It will become a recall - based skill . "
An experimental version of the software has been available as a free download from IBM's Alphaworks site for a year .
The team say they are now ready to develop a commercial version that could make it way onto handheld devices in the near future .
It 's described as the T - rex of the deep , a creature with huge razor - sharp teeth it used to " chomp " through its prey off Australia 's southern coastline about 25 million years ago .
But what has excited Australian paleontologists and prompted a re-drawing of the world 's evolutionary charts is the fact this ancient predator was a baleen whale - the species which today catches tiny shrimps and krill using only a sieve of coarse hair .
Monash University PhD student Erich Fitzgerald , 25 , has spent the past three years removing the creature 's skull from the rock boulder in which it was found in the late 1990s .
High Yewdale Farm is being divided among local farmers
For forty years farmer Johnny Birkett has tended his 400 - strong flock of sheep at High Yewdale Farm in Cumbria .
But this week he had tears in his eyes as he prepared to auction them off .
The 71 - year - old is retiring and he has lost his campaign , backed by Prince Charles , to save the farm that was once owned by author Beatrix Potter .
The flock he brought down from the fells above Lake Coniston are direct descendants of those bred by the Peter Rabbit creator before she bequeathed the farm to the National Trust in 1943 .
Farmer devastated
At the time , the 450 - acre estate was hailed as a shining example of a British farm and was visited by the Queen .
But after more than 60 years , the National Trust says facts must be faced because Common Agricultural Policy ( CAP ) reforms mean the farm is not making a good living .
It is a good farm and it is a disgrace that it is being split up
Johnny Birkett , farmer
But the move to break up the estate has sparked outrage locally and nationally among those who claim the farm is one of the most viable in the area and splitting it could destroy a unique part of Britain 's farming heritage .
Mr Birkett has tended the land day and night for 40 years with his wife Ruth and retires on Wednesday .
He is devastated that he will be unable to pass on his experience to a new tenant .
He said : " I have worked all my life on the land and it has given me such pleasure .
" You work day and night and have to have a good wife to support you , which I have .
' Lost ' tradition
" It is a good farm and it is a disgrace that it is being split up .
Anyone could work this farm and make a living .
as I have proved .
" The National Trust made its mind up from the start and has been making one excuse after another .
" Farmers in this area just do n't agree with the decision - a part of the farming tradition in the Lake District is being lost forever . "
Beatrix Potter left the farm to the National Trust in 1943
A spokesman for the National Trust said he understood the concerns , but there was no other choice than to split up the land .
John Darlington , National Trust area manager for the Lake District , said : " This is a very sad day and we wish to acknowledge Mr Birkett 's hard work over the years .
" He has worked the land and done a wonderful job preserving the landscape of the Lake District .
" But unfortunately the Common Agricultural Policy reforms mean that the financial payments to support hill farming are changing with the result that the viability of a farm such as High Yewdale is greatly reduced .
The trust will ensure the character of the farm and its beautiful landscapes are protected for the future
John Darlington , National Trust
" We do appreciate the concerns people have about changes , but in fact Beatrix Potter , as a land manager and farmer , made changes during her lifetime in response to the agricultural pressures of her day .
" Very importantly , the trust will ensure the character of the farm and its beautiful landscapes are protected for the future . "
Potter , who was born in London in 1866 , moved to Cumbria after getting married , where she created her famous characters .
She died on 22 December 1943 and left 14 farms and 4,000 acres of land to the National Trust , together with her flocks of Herdwick sheep .
Last month Prince Charles personally intervened and contacted the National Trust in an attempt to save the hilltop farm .
His questions prompted the trust to carry out a report about the future of upland hill farming in Britain , but did not persuade it to reverse the decision .
Mr Birkett added : " We shall not return to High Yewdale .
It will not be a farm any longer , if it had been we would have come back to help out the new tenants .
This is a sad day for my wife and I . "
Earth Science Missions Anomaly Report : GOES / POES Program / POES Project : 6 Sep 2003
Status Report From : Goddard Space Flight Center
Posted : Tuesday , September 9 , 2003
EARTH SCIENCE MISSIONS ANOMALY REPORT
TO : GSFC : 100/ A. Diaz , 100 / W. Townsend , 100 / 400 / D Perkins , NASA HQ : Y/G. Asrar , Y / M. Luther , Q / B O'Connor
FROM : GSFC / POES Project /480 / K. Halterman
DATE : September 6 , 2003
PROGRAM / PROJECT : GOES / POES Program / POES Project
DATE OF ANOMALY : September 6 , 2003
LOCATION OF ANOMALY : Lockheed Martin , Sunnyvale CA
DESCRIPTION OF EVENT :
As the NOAA - N Prime spacecraft was being repositioned from vertical to horizontal on the " turn over cart " at approximately 7:15 PDT today , it slipped off the fixture , causing severe damage .
( See attached photo ) .
The 18 ' long spacecraft was about 3 ' off the ground when it fell .
The mishap was caused because 24 bolts were missing from a fixture in the " turn over cart " .
Two errors occurred .
First , technicians from another satellite program that uses the same type of " turn over cart " removed the 24 bolts from the NOAA cart on September 4 without proper documentation .
Second , the NOAA team working today failed to follow the procedure to verify the configuration of the NOAA " turn over cart " since they had used it a few days earlier .
IMPACT ON PROGRAM / PROJECT AND SCHEDULE :
The shock and vibration of the fall undoubtedly caused tremendous damage .
Significant rework and retest will be required .
NOAA -N Prime is planned for launch in 2008 .
CORRECTIVE ACTION :
Lockheed Martin formed an Accident Review Team in which GSFC is participating .
The immediate actions concern safety ( preventing the spacecraft from rolling , discharging the batteries , and depressurizing the propulsion system ) .
NOAA -N Prime is under guard , all records have been impounded , and the personnel interviewed .
After the safety issues are addressed , attention will focus on assessing the damage to NOAA - N Prime .

Please folks , do n't forget to go rate this story of Dave 's at reddit and digg .
This is one of his best , and he put a lot of effort into it .
He deserves as many eyeballs as he can get !
Recession fears are being reported as affecting the oil markets .
Oil prices tumble over fears of US recession is typical .
Before recently , all the fears were geopolitical in nature .
Easing of those concerns for no good reason at all has been replaced by the specter of an American recession .
Let 's examine that possibility .
As it turns out , the view here is that a recession perhaps a severe one may be more likely than not .
" Worries about US growth are an important factor , " said HSBC economist John Butler .
" We are concerned about the possibility of recession in the US . "
Hedge funds and oil traders are selling their crude holdings because of fears that the US economy could slump next year , dragged down by the stalling housing market .
Figures released yesterday showed US house prices falling last month for the first time in over a decade , while the inventory of unsold houses was at its highest level for 13 years .
Traders are concerned that an American slowdown would drag many other major oil importers down , causing worldwide energy demand to plunge .
The Negative Yield Curve
The Housing Bubble
The Oil Price Shocks Model
Paying Attention to What 's Important
I shall argue from three separate lines of evidence indicating the possibility of a recession .
Any one of them , by itself , might not be considered by some as sufficient reason for alarm .
However , all three factors are strong signals and , taken together , paint a worrisome picture .
Here they are .
Each is discussed in order below .
In the final section , I shall indicate why those of us concerned about Peak Oil should care .
Please read the conclusions .
But first , here 's a short note .
The work of Dr. James Hamilton figures prominently in this story .
Stepping back a bit from the immediate subject will there be a recession soon ?
it is altogether clear that Hamilton 's work takes the role of oil in fueling economic growth seriously , whereas other , more shortsighted analysts often try to explain it away on superficial grounds , e.g. the percentage of family gasoline expenditures in the total household budget and the like .
These kinds of arguments miss the point by a wide margin .
Every aspect of modern civilization owes its existence to someusually large extent on oil , its use as the primary feedstock for liquid transportation fuels or its many other uses for creating everyday products we take for granted various plastics , for example , including parts of the computer on which I am typing out this story .
It is inconceivable to me that any serious historical analysis of the Industrial Age since 1870 and the economic growth that has attended it would not emphasize the availability of abundant , cheap oil regardless of past oil shocks , worries about scarcity and price volatility .
Dr. Hamilton seems to appreciate this , while others do not .
Hence , he writes frequently about oil and that work includes his highly recommended How to talk to an economist about peak oil .
The Negative Yield Curve
The current negative ( or , ) yield curve is shown inand its significance is explained below the figure by Arturo Estrella of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
The curve is inverted because of the negative
spread between the short - term rates ( the 3 month )
and the long - term rates ( the 10 year )
Figure 1 -- Click to enlarge .
The difference between long - term and short - term interest rates ( " the slope of the yield curve " or " the term spread " ) has borne a consistent negative relationship with subsequent real economic activity in the United States , with a lead time of about four to six quarters .
The measures of the yield curve most frequently employed are based on differences between interest rates on Treasury securities of contrasting maturities , for instance , ten years minus three months .
The measures of real activity for which predictive power has been found include GNP and GDP growth , growth in consumption , investment and industrial production , and economic recessions as dated by the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) .
The specific accuracy of these predictions depends on the particular measures employed , as well as on the estimation and prediction periods .
However , the results are generally statistically significant and compare favorably with other variables employed as leading indicators .
For instance , models that predict real GDP growth or recessions tend to explain 30 percent or more of the variation in the measure of real activity .
See Estrella and Hardouvelis ( 1991 ) .
The yield curve has predicted essentially every U.S. recession since 1950 with only one " false " signal , which preceded the credit crunch and slowdown in production in 1967 .
People talk about interest rates going up and going down as if all rates moved together .
The truth is , the rates on bonds of different maturities behave quite independently of each other with short - term rates and long - term rates often moving in opposite directions simultaneously .
What 's important is the overall pattern of interest - rate movement -- and what it says about the future of the economy and Wall Street .
Rates are like tea leaves , only much more reliable if you know how to read them .
Inverted Curve
At first glance an inverted yield curve seems like a paradox .
Why would long - term investors settle for lower yields while short - term investors take so much less risk ?
The answer is that long - term investors will settle for lower yields now if they think rates -- and the economy -- are going even lower in the future .
They 're betting that this is their last chance to lock in rates before the bottom falls out .
So , a negative yield curve appears to be a robust indicator of recession .
The reason for this is discussed in Historical Yield Curve from Fidelity .
My recommendation is that you read James Hamilton 's Econbrowser posts on this subject in order to more fully understand the negative yield curve signal .
Jonathan Wright , a brilliant research economist at the Federal Reserve Board , recently completed a very interesting paper titled The Yield Curve and Predicting Recessions .
Wright 's research seems to have been influential in Fed Chair Ben Bernanke 's recent assessment that the current very flat yield curve does not signify a coming significant economic slowdown .
The Housing Bubble
There are two important things to bear in mind at the present time .
First , the last link # 4 notes that the yield curve became inverted in the 4th quarter of 2005 .
As Arturo Estrella notes above , " [ the curve ] has borne a consistent negative relationship with subsequent real economic activity in the United States , with a lead time of about four to six quarters . "
We are now in the 4th quarter of 2006 .
Secondly , in link # 3 above , Hamilton notesIndeed , you can run Wright 's model at Reckoning the Odds of Recession .
A model run for today , October 2nd based on a 10 year rate of 4.61 % , a 3 month rate of 4.77 % and a Federal Funds Rate ( September 29th ) of 5.34 % indicates a 42.9 % chance of a recession in the next 4 quarters .
These are the same numbers the Fed is seeing .
Here 's what The Economist had to say about the housing bubble in June of 2005 with one of their accompanying graphs , labeledhere .
Figure 2
The worldwide rise in house prices is the biggest bubble in history .
Prepare for the economic pain when it pops Japan provides a nasty warning of what can happen when boom turns to bust .
Japanese property prices have dropped for 14 years in a row , by 40 % from their peak in 1991 .
Yet the rise in prices in Japan during the decade before 1991 was less than the increase over the past ten years in most of the countries that have experienced housing booms ( see Figure 2 ) .
And it is surely no coincidence that Japan and Germany , the two countries where house prices have fallen for most of the past decade , have had the weakest growth in consumer spending of all developed economies over that period .
Americans who believe that house prices can only go up and pose no risk to their economy would be well advised to look overseas .
For the first time in 11 years , monthly figures showed the median price of a previously owned home falling as inventories of unsold homes rose to levels not seen in more than a decade .
The National Association of Realtors said that the median price in August fell to $ 225,000 , down 1.7 percent from August 2005 .
That was the first time since April 1995 that the national median price was lower than the month a year before .
Volume fell as well as prices .
The number of existing homes sold , which make up about 85 percent of all home sales , declined 0.5 percent in August from July .
They had slumped in that month by 4.1 percent from June .
At the same time , the Commerce Department said that sales of new homes rose 4.1 percent in August from July .
But economists warned against reading too much into those figures because the government adjusted the July figure downward before making the comparison .
Meanwhile , the housing market has been leveling off .
The Commerce Department 's report Monday said spending on private home construction dropped 1.5 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted rate of $ 617 billion .
The August decline followed an even bigger 2.1 percent July decrease and marked the fifth straight home building has fallen .
The generalized bubble in housing prices is comparable to the bubble in stock prices in the late 1990s .
The eventual collapse of the housing bubble will have an even larger impact than the collapse of the stock bubble , since housing wealth is far more evenly distributed than stock wealth .
Housing construction is equal to approximately 5 percent of GDP .
Construction of new homes has been going on at a near - record pace over the last few years , in response to the run-up in housing prices .
Home construction could easily fall back 40 percent ( this was the drop off in the 1981 - 82 recession ) , which would imply a direct loss in demand equal to 2 percentage points of GDP .
The large wealth effect associated with the housing bubble , which has spurred a consumption boom in the last few years , will go into reverse as housing prices plummet .
Research from the Federal Reserve Board shows that a dollar in additional housing wealth leads to 4 to 6 cents of annual consumption .
This implies that a loss of $ 5 trillion in housing wealth would lead to a decline in annual consumption of between $ 200 billion and $ 300 billion .
This loss in consumption is equivalent to 1.6 to 2.5 percentage points of GDP .
Combining the 2 percentage point drop in demand due to a falloff in housing construction with the 1.6 to 2.5 percentage point drop in demand due to the reversal of the housing bubble 's wealth effect leads to a falloff in demand of between 3.6 and 4.5 percentage points of GDP .
If employment fell in the same proportion , this would imply the loss of between 5.0 million and 6.3 million jobs .
Since the federal government is already running a large deficit , and the country is running a very large trade deficit , the government 's ability to use fiscal and monetary policy to boost the economy out of the recession will be severely restricted .
Despite a small bit of good news reported by Hamilton , the data trend is not looking good lately .
Here 's some text and data from Watching Prices Swing in Health , Housing and Stocks ( New York Times , September 30th ) .
Aside from prices , the Commerce Department reported that new construction is falling from the Houston Chronicle As with the Law of Gravity , what goes up in a speculative price bubble must come down , being divorced from the fundamentals .
Aside from the symptoms of a deflating balloon , which are growing more robust , what would the consequences be ?
Let 's turn to The Housing Bubble Fact Sheet , a July , 2005 analysis from the Centre for Economic Policy Research ( CEPR ) .
Section 5 of the report states that " the collapse of the housing bubble will throw the economy into a recession , and quite likely a severe recession . "
Their verbatim analysisit seemed pointless to try to condense it goes like this :
If you believe that the housing market is starting to collapse , and given that The Economist labeled it the " biggest bubble in history " , then the pessimistic analysis of the CEPR does not seem so extreme .
If the bubble iscollapsing now , then this would indicate to me that we are witnessing some volatility that presages the " real " collapse which will occur later remember , it 's like Gravity .
Also remember the experience of Japan as shown in .
Once the bubble bursts , it 's all downhill from there .
Since we are trying to gauge the likelihood of a recession , the situation does not look good in either case .
The housing market is very shaky .
Oh , by the way , did I forget to mention worth reading from Resource Investor how the dollar has been faring ?
Uhmmm ...
That does n't look good -- Figure 3
But there is no space in this story to talk about the longer - term decline of the dollar or the large U.S. Current Accounts and Trade deficits .
Or even the rising mortgage defaults in California ( August , 2006 ) .
Lenders sent 20,752 default notices to homeowners across the Golden State , up 10.5 % from 18,778 the previous quarter and up 67.2 % from 12,408 in the second quarter of 2005 ....
" This is an important trend to watch but does n't strike us as ominous , " said Marshall Prentice , DataQuick 's president .
" We would have to see defaults roughly double from today 's level before they would begin to impact home values much . "
That 's right , Marshall , nothing ominous about a year - on - year 67 % rise in default notices in the world 's 5th largest economy , though doubling of defaults does n't take long at that rate , does it ?
Nothing ominous , Marshall , unless you are the one doing the defaulting because your kid got sick and you have no health insurance , you work at Wal - Mart , you made the mistake of using credit cards for stuff you thought you needed and now you use them for food & gas , you have a recent interest - only mortgage , your house is worth less than it was last year and you are no longer able to declare bankruptcy since the Republicans changed the law but that would n't be you ,
[ editor 's note , by Dave Cohen ] I am so sorry !
I just lost my grip there .
OK , I wo n't read or agree with Kurt Vonnegut anymore .
Mea Culpa .
Old Socialists do n't die , they
just fade away  for Yankee
Let 's , ahhh , resume the analysis .
Here 's our third factor .
Oil Price Shocks
High oil prices have preceded or coincided with nine of the 10 U.S. recessions since World War II -- a history lesson that has policy makers , executives and economists scouring for evidence that it could happen again .
Indeed , Figure 1 [ see Figure 4 below ] , which plots the real , inflation - adjusted price of imported petroleum , shows that high oil prices have frequently coincided with recessions .
In a series of papers , Hamilton ( 1983 , 1996 , 2003 ) has argued forcefully that the oil shocks were responsible for these recessions .
However , he argues that not all changes in the price of oil have the same effect on the economy .
For instance , a fall in oil prices is unlikely to boost the economy in the same way that an increase can drag it down .
In addition , he argues that oil price increases that simply reverse previous price decreases are unlikely to have a significant effect .
One approach he recommends to isolate the kinds of price changes that can affect the economy is to record an oil shock only if the prevailing price of oil is higher than it has been over the past three years .
In June of 2004 , the Wall Street Journal published Oil Prices Start to Pinch , Stirring Concern Over Economic Impact ( subscription required ) .
This fear is based on Hamilton 's theory of oil price shocks you can read the original paper but this is only for the very brave .
The view is described by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ( FRBSF ) in Why Has n't the Jump in Oil Prices Led to a Recession ?
( November , 2005 ) .
Figure 4
Performing Hamilton 's transformation , the FRBSF comes up with Figure 5 .
Figure 5
The authors critique Hamilton 's model as shown in Figure 5 , suggesting that the role of oil price shocks in previous [ the 70's ] recessions was exaggerated .
They note that the magnitude of the oil price shock effect is much larger than direct income loss .
See their paper for the details .
Plainly , the run up in oil prices since 2002 has not resulted in a recession .
The Fed authors seek to explain this .
The fundamental premise is that oil prices affect the economy because the price of imported oil is a " tax " on U.S. domestic users .
" For each $ 10 / barrel increase in oil prices , the United States pays an effective " tax " of about $ 50 billion ( 5 billion barrels times $ 10 ) , or 0.4 % of GDP . "
The authors argue that the current episode ( since 2002 ) is different , in part , because " the run-up in oil prices in the past few years seems to reflect the endogenous response of prices to the strength of global demand [ mostly from China ] . "
Therefore :
Previous recessions involved exogenous ( geopolitcal ) shocks to supply .
Demand increases originating in China coupled with inelastic global supply produces an increase in the oil price for the U.S. similar to a decrease in supply .
However , a demand - driven price shock will not have the same effects on the U.S. economy as a decrease in supply would .
A related argument can be found in Barreling Down the Road to Recession ? from the Federal Reserve Board of St. Louis ( September , 2006 ) .
Finally , can we expect a recession to occur as a result of current oil prices ?
James Hamilton believes that oil shocks affect economic growth only when , as a result of the higher prices , consumers ' spending behavior changes .
As the accompanying chart [ Figure 6 below ] shows , PCE [ personal consumption expenditures ] growth has remained positive since the real price of oil began to rise .
The negative PCE growth that accompanied the previous oil shocks has not yet occurred during the current run-up in oil prices .
Thus , as of now , economic growth appears to be more resilient to the negative effects of rising oil prices than in the 1970s and early 1980s .
Figure 6
As you can see , the PCE index has remained positive despite the increasing oil prices since 2002 .
So , why include the oil price shock effect in this story if it has not , in fact , resulted in a recession over the last 4 years ?
The two - part answer is this :
Despite the recent steep drop in oil prices , it is likely this is due to a number of temporary factors that have been extensively discussed at The Oil Drum .
The most likely scenario is that the price will begin rising again , starting with the end - of - year seasonal adjustment .
The fact that $ 60 / barrel remains the real floor price persuades me even more of the correctness of this assumption .
See Khebab's How Periodic Are the Oil Price Fluctuations ?
The fundamentals have not changed and OPEC can still create downward pressure on supply if prices fall further .
Even if rising oil prices have not caused a recession , it is still the case that for each $ 10 / barrel increase in oil prices , the United States pays an effective " tax " of about $ 50 billion , or 0.4 % of GDP .
Prices had quadrupled since the start of 2002 until very recently .
As I said , I believe they will rise to high levels next year .
Therefore , rising oil prices will continue to have their detrimental effects on personal expenditures and also add to inflationary pressures .
Peak Oil , Recession and Oil Prices
Most analysts anticipate a slowdown in 2007 .
Taken together , the three factors discussed here do not point to a healthy economic outlook .
Indeed , if all three effects are piled up one on top of the other , it is possible that there will be a severe recession next year .
This may lead to the dreadedscenario for oil prices .
For those concerned about peak oil , low prices resulting from decreased demand in a recession has two detrimental effects .
Development of new oil & natural gas projects that now depend on high prices is curtailed .
Development of substitutes for oil & natural gas is curtailed .
Lower maybelower demand over a significant period of time ( a few years ) masks the global production peak but does not help solve it .
When the global economy does finally emerge from a recession , the same old problems will still be with us but mitigation efforts will have been crippled .
Furthermore , most people will be persuaded that the peak was a fiction due to the low prices they have just seen during the recession .
In the meantime , however , the world will still have been consuming oillarge amounts of it thus draining existing production butas the low prices put many projects on hold .
This is the worst case I can think of .
I do not know that there will be a severe recession but it is a matter of degree .
Even a large slowdown or mild recession putting downward pressure on price will have detrimental effects .
In the best of all possible worlds , we would see a steady price rise over time reflecting the peaking of world oil production .
Hamilton ( in How to talk to an economist about peak oil ) has argued in a friendly , contrarian kind of way that if the peaking of global oil production is coming in n-years , then
what economists would therefore expect to see under the n-year scenario would be for the oil price to rise steadily over all these n years , gradually producing greater and greater incentives for the needed conservation and the needed development of alternatives between now and year n .
Denial about the peak oil phenomenon itself this usually amounts to setting n as a large number measured in decades Lack of precision in predicting the peak for small values of n measured in years but less than a decade this invalidates any n-year scenario because we can not predict n Deflationary scenarios that lower prices over short periods of time a few years in the case of a recession or even shorter periods of time reflecting volatility a few weeks or months
Why do n't we see that ?
Well , actually , weseeing that since 2002 , despite great price volatility .
However , there are other problems :
Oil itself is not yet scarce but its price should always reflect the real geological , technological & economic constraints on supply .
See Nate 's Natural Gas - A Tale of Two Markets for similar reasoning applying to natural gas prices .
Unfortunately , the workings of the near - term market ( # 3 above ) combined with the other factors ( # 1 and # 2 ) will not solve an inevitable problem which is , ultimately , a tragedy of the commons .
But that will be another post .
Sincerely ,
Dave Cohen

This is one of his best , and he put a lot of effort into it .
He deserves as many eyeballs as he can get !
by Lazarus B. Danzig
“ In my role as a puppetmaster , lounging in this blasé bureaucratic atmosphere virtually devoid of repercussions , any lack of diligence on my part shall only encourage if not excite my own profound negligence of everything . ”
“ Lazarus B. Danzig ” is a manager in an unnamed department at McMurdo Station , where he has spent numerous summers and a few winters .
Burdened as the middle manager is with a pedigree of doubt , and trapped in a cubicled prison cell , suffering endlessly in like company , it behooves us to understand that these errant figures , tormented by perceptions of privation and suffering the frozen associations of life in Antarctica , should finally be granted their righteous due .
The vile rancor one naturally feels towards the mental dictums of middle management might be somewhat mitigated by a rational inquest into the work ethos of White Collar management as opposed to Blue Collar laborers .
The separation of work ethics and values between the two camps is as great a gulf as between a Priest and an Atheist .
I believe we must take a look at the mechanisms of mind , body and spirit exhibited by these two groups , their respective philosophies on the nature of accountability and achievement , as well as their fundamental differences in response to the physical environment they co-inhabit .
A pithy example of how managers inure themselves to creature comfort is their abject refusal to deal with the environment in which they live .
The average manager in Antarctica insists on indoor temperatures that would call for air conditioning were they summering at home .
And , while the outside temperatures might for months remain well below zero , they will wear clothing suitable to Sub Saharan Africa or perhaps Polynesia .
Their flesh recoils from the refreshing bite of sub - zero air as would a vampire ’s when exposed to sunlight .
Fearing any hint of exposure , they bundle themselves in the heaviest of parkas and dash from one indoor oasis of heat to the next .
Their working experience of Antarctica might just as well occur in a windowless office at some home - and - garden depot in wintertime Peoria .
The indoor nature of the manager ’s work precludes any of the healthful benefits found in manual labor , especially those labors performed in outdoor Antarctica , with its fresh , crisp , and cleanest of all airs .
Here an easy Blue Collar day outdoors provides more exercise than a month of inane managerial exertions .
This lack of physical endeavors makes for a steady and inexorable decline in the health and fitness of our ignoble hero .
The inevitable result is a sickly , enfeebled and impuissant specimen of humanity that glowers in envy at the jocular fitness of even a slothful Blue Collar worker .
The physical prowess of the outdoor laborer radiates health and vitality , and these qualities attract the attention of both sexes , occasionally dictating a laborer ’s summons to the office .
This attraction only serves to illuminate by contrast the paunchy flaccidity of the managerial ranks , both to their own eyes and to those of the opposite sex .
These feelings of inadequacy brew over the years in a seething cauldron of lustful animosity .
While the image of an indoor working manager slipping into obese decrepitude hardly engenders feelings of empathy , a manager really needs little if any physical strength .
Rather , he flexes mental muscle and exercises discriminating faculties to do a proper job .
A thick skin and a strong back hardly make for a nimble mind — a bounty far more difficult to display than a bulging bicep .
The manager grasps this straw of truth tightly , just as he desperately grasps at the enduring image of the Blue Collar worker as a muscle - bound cretin .
Unfortunately , as civilization has progressed , the luxury of public education has worked its magic so that , contrary to popular myth , the Blue Collar worker of the postmodern age is often an educated free - thinker , especially so in Antarctica .
Many have thrown off the yoke of button - down collars while still in college , having realized that the health and monetary benefits of Blue Collar employment far exceed the perceived drudgery and lower social standing .
And here our ambitious middle manager is chagrined to discover that the skills of the lowly laborers often command premiums that exceed his own expectations .
This , along with the realization that years in the same trade dramatically increase the value of the skilled laborer , is like a hot needle in the eye .
The life expectancy of a stagnated middle manager is measured in dog-years , and failure to advance steadily through the ranks leads to a life - sentence of cubical obscurity and impotent mechanizations .
This disparity is the bitterest of pills to swallow , and further alienates the middle - manager from the happy - go - lucky plebeians under him , who frolic in childlike freedom from responsibility and organizational woes , prospering all the while .
While these physical roles are easily established , the principle disparity between the two groups is a divergence far more endemic than even physical attributes .
The average Blue Collar worker is loath to boast a daily record of work performed , for fellow employees will deride him if such an account is offered .
Merely noticing , let alone boasting , that one has sweat blood in the course of a workday is cause for a lambasting .
Indeed , the more difficult the deed flaunted , the more derision one can expect to receive from one ’s fellows .
This derision rises on an order of magnitude if these same deeds are mentioned to the accursed manager .
To offer one ’s manager an unsolicited account of the workday so negates all that was done as to be almost worse than having shirked those duties completely .
To boast of one ’s accomplishments is looked upon by the rabble as a mark of betrayal and a sure sign of managerial leanings , and thus a secret yearning for a life of scheming manipulations and physical ease .
The results of the worker ’s day speak silent volumes to all who labored beside the productive fellow , and a more mute testimony need never be offered .
The honor of knowing one ’s mettle is the reward , and the endearment and respect of one ’s co-workers is like an invisible badge of rank , one which can only be displayed in a swagger of towering self - respect .
This muscle - sore swagger of barrel - chested pride will necessarily never be experienced by those who populate the cubicles of officialdom .
These creatures must by necessity take credit for the accomplishments of the Blue Collar worker , cloaking themselves in distant deeds and reaping illegitimate kudos .
The more verbose the accountability , the greater the acclaim ; and acclaim is the ultimate goal of one who accomplishes nothing tangible .
The beleaguered middle manager must accumulate accolades in order to showcase his command of the departmental muscle , thereby gaining in prestige over the other puppetmasters .
These poor wretches are never secure in their posts , and must either rise , or perish in lateral obscurity .
Many affect an air of intellectual condescension to mask the reality of their position , and this is especially so in cases where the manager has no practical knowledge of the work being performed under him .
The overlord is secretly at the mercy of the foreman and , knowing so , the inept manager husbands this resource like a miser ’s treasure .
On the other hand , should the inept manager inadvertently install a conniving foreman , he risks becoming the manipulated mouthpiece of his own lackey , an unwary monkey dancing for a scheming organ grinder .
In this worst of all scenarios , a symbiotic relationship develops between manager and foreman in which little gets done but much is taken credit for .
When at some eventuality the reality of the situation is presented , the display of indignation ( whether genuinely felt , or feigned ) is a self - righteous farce worthy of operatic grandeur .
Our beleaguered middle manager lurks about under constant delusions of Blue Collar ineptitude and laziness .
These traditional views upholding Blue Collar lassitude are not completely without merit .
While most Blue Collar workers slave in spite of themselves , a growing minority of suburban milksops are infesting the ranks of laborers here in Antarctica .
To them a work ethic is a weakness to be scoffed at , and by shirking responsibilities they believe they are pulling one over on “ The Man ” .
Many of these miscreants are neo-hippies who romanticize the past and view themselves through a distorted lens of self - indulgent platitudes .
They have perverse notions of what it means to be living the good life , free from the constraints of servitude , but ensconced in luxury and material excess .
These children of the sun are damning genetic examples of the 60′s era “ Free Love ” and that dubious generation ’s legacy of duty .
While such louts are rare in number , the deviant Blue Collar worker is a constant source of aggravation to all who suffer the presence of this individual .
This one malignant strain personifies many of the preconceived notions management holds in regards to Blue Collar workers as a whole , and this blight maligns all who strive to do a job for its own sake .
The all seeing eye of upper management is always by chance glancing about when this buffoon makes an appearance , and the observation becomes a reflection on the group as a whole .
This reflection of the group is a concentrated reflection on the abilities of the manager who , under this magnified spotlight of misconception , is burned alive for failing to motivate or rein in unproductive workers .
Such Blue Collar mites of humanity recoil under any direction and are engaged in constant petty rebellions against all of the smaller forms of authority .
When approached by management of rank these lackeys either run and hide or transform into sulking lickspittles willing to make any concession , and praise any decision however harebrained , in an effort to distract the detractor ’s attention away from themselves .
The inept and vainglorious supervisor often mistakes these obsequious sycophants as creatures of talent and , against all rationality , promotes them into the lower rungs of middle management .
In this sense , a constant battle between genuine talent and politically - savvy ineptitude is being waged .
The managerial aspirant , although aware that some degree of real merit is demanded by his position , nonetheless holds political agility and endearment as attributes of greater value than competence and insightful knowledge .
The manager of talent scoffs at such connections and shoulders on , despite the sometimes temporary aggrandizement his nemesis might seem to enjoy .
Thus , the ranks of management are as split amongst themselves as are the ranks of their laboring minions ; the bad apples of the office sector , just as in the work yard , spoil the image of the lot .
Who wields the power to promote mediocre imbeciles to positions of authority ?
It is the upper middle manager , often an aged curmudgeon who after years of clerical exile in the middle ranks has managed to clamber a rung or two higher .
Securely perched , these marooned scavengers glare about with a profane sense of self - satisfaction .
All the while clinging to precarious notions of grandeur , they are actually ebbing in prowess and desperately harbor stillborn dreams of advancement .
These pitiful curs people the crevices of Antarctic operations at Denver headquarters , and have for many years .
These ranks of management are festooned with backbiting , inept bunglers , as immune to competency and sound reason as they are to original thought .
Many of these self - inflated mountebanks are just now fading into well - earned obscurity , after half a lifetime of penury accomplishment and self - serving mechanizations .
Their penchant for half - witted manipulation and self - aggrandizing schemes chased many a genuine talent from the Antarctic program , and populated it with the lowest cost ( and cast ) of laboring humanity , and in the end have cost the Antarctic program many millions of dollars .
A variation on our theme is the newly graduated professional manager .
Often , if not principally , the directly hired graduate possesses an attitude of aloof antagonism towards the Blue Collar wretches under his or her control .
This form of nobility often represents a second or third generation of White Collar manipulators , and has been spoon - fed from birth in the superiority of his person .
Having been schooled in the “ art ” of management , and with little , if any , hands - on experience with tasks physical or practical , these masters of chicanery are the vampires of their kind .
Ambitious to a fault , each position attained is a stepping - stone to greater pastures , thus importance far beyond relevance is placed on every action that may effect a bystander ’s perception of the manager ’s performance .
In the end , however , the ranks of middle management are an anathema for any truly ambitious manager , and usually only the younger recent graduates are ever to be suffered as a boss .
The very notion of rubbing shoulders with an “ untouchable ” is an abhorrence to these BS , MBA imposters , although a young , hot , hardbody laborer is still worth a poke .
Let us now observe the metamorphosis of a Blue Collar employee to a White Collar puppetmaster .
To step away from one ’s toiling fellows and enter the world of managerial largess , the ties of camaraderie are twisted and strained in ways that inexorably sever them .
Despite enthusiastic pledges of fidelity , a polar shift has taken place , and the open doors of warm reception with past fellows are slowly shut .
The forcing of opinions in matters of procedure breeds resentment among old friends .
Former fellows foster feelings of diminished status .
Inadequate servility towards the newly promoted forces an eventual reproach , a laying down of authority .
Once this breech has been crossed , all but the rarest of workplace friendships will fall by the wayside .
When former fellows gather , barbed jokes about you are bandied about .
Grab-ass horseplay and former tolerances of your proclivities are eroded until what was once endearing is now offensive , if not repugnant .
In the blink of an eye , what was once jolly good humor has become taboo .
There is no going back .
To abandon the course undertaken and attempt to undo the transformation as a middle - manager would only disenfranchise one as a failure in the eyes of both groups .
There is no cure other than competency during this chrysalis period of one ’s transformation from grub to moth .
Former Blue Collar workers hold the touchstone of one ’s managerial mettle to a much harder surface than any other breed of manager , and rightly so .
To know what is involved in any undertaking , and having tasted the bitter draught of nonsensical taskings , the nouveau taskmaster has no excuse to shield himself from the harsh criticisms of former mates .
In some cases , one is expected to maintain some semblance of fellowship by lending a hand in the drudgeries one has just proscribed .
The separation here is acutely felt , as your fellows know that when you are not beside them , you are lounging inside while they toil in unabashed cold .
But by keeping abreast of upcoming changes and problematic situations from a centrally - located desk , the insightful manager is able to affect a solution before problems arise , thus saving the cursing fellows a great deal of effort outdoors .
This notion is lost in their wrathful jealousy .
A pro-active stance from management is an attribute lost on the suffering laborer .
Reactive management is far more endemic to the various Antarctic departments , and is thus more familiar to the near - sighted ethos of the laboring peons .
But a manager who constantly acts as one of the minions interferes with the group dynamics ( as nobody likes to work with the boss ) and acts to usurp the foreman of the crew , effectively creating a now superfluous team leader , who naturally resents the diminished authority .
Such continual hands - on participation from a manager is an affront to God ’s order and it blurs the lines of nature .
It is like having sex with animals or making deserts out of vegetables ( i.e. : Zucchini Bread : what kind of an abomination is this ?
A sacrilege conjured up by one of these gender - blurring Neo-Hippies that infest the kitchens of the Antarctic stations . )
The new manager ’s hammer - forged inclination for action and physical activity is an initial hurdle on the path to officialdom that only time will overcome .
The desk - bound comfort of the new position is an insidious treat , since in one ’s former incarnation respites from manual labor were stolen moments of ease , and just as sweet as a pilfered cookie in one ’s youth .
Now the cookie jar of surfeit ease is under your command and while initially this feels like wealth , the constant diet of languid exertions diminishes the flavor , but increases the appetite for comfortable vacillation , and the inexorable decline begins .
Therein lies the conundrum of my own experience as a manager .
Only through manual labor have I been able to give any semblance of strength and steel to the indolence and languor that is my true nature .
In my role as a puppetmaster , lounging in this blasé bureaucratic atmosphere virtually devoid of repercussions , any lack of diligence on my part shall only encourage if not excite my own profound negligence of everything .
The middle manager is as old as Man , and the species as it exists in Antarctica has evolved outside the constraints of accountability and exists in a state of eroding isolation .
The brain - fevered ideology of the remote outpost manager as a beacon of enlightened civilization died in the Congo a hundred years ago .
The larger legacy of middle management lies in its dictums on the nature of bureaucratic responsibility .
This school places every impetus on abject security and recoils from the risks involved in direct decision - making or in the sponsoring of insightful changes .
Longevity is its mantra , first and last and always .
These bureaucratic toadies are in fact the very axis of our civilization .
Without them we are condemned as a species to disintegration and unsustainable drive .
Managerial mediocrity is the very mortar of our civilization , and no institution in Heaven or on Earth would fail to crumble in the absence of its mollifying umbrage .
Do you want to look 15 pounds thinner ?
Do you want to walk more fluidly and eliminate lower back pain ?
Do you want to improve speed ?
Then you need to do some wall work .
Coach Martin Rudow showed walkers at the Annual NW Regional Racewalk Retreat how developing the right posture can work wonders for walkers of any speed .
Sitting at computers , watching TV , or standing in line can all contribute to bad slouching habits , which in turn can lead to or worsen low back pain , shoulder pain , and neck pain .
Posture work on a wall can help to alleviate these problems
6 Common Walking Posture Problems
Lordosis : Back curved excessively in an S shape - rear sticking out , shoulders too far back , head and stomach thrust forward .
For women , wearing high heels contributes to this posture .
Some S shape is needed , but too much strains the lower back .

Hip - sitting : Walking with your weight carried too far back , strutting with your torso leaning back and overstriding in front .
When walking you look like the " Keep on Truckin ' " guy .

Forward lean :
In the past , walking coaches advised a slight forward lean when walking .
This was meant to cure the hip - sitting posture .
But this often resulted in people leaning too much forward .

Hunching your shoulders :
When sitting and working at a desk or computer , most people tend to draw their shoulders forward , so that their chest muscles do n't get expanded .
Over time this becomes a habit you have to consciously overcome when walking .

Neck tightening : Many people carry stress by tightening their neck and upper shoulders , leading to knots and pain .
There are cures for these , and a wall near you can help !
Wall Exercise to Look 15 Pounds Thinner
The good news is that walkers can eliminate bad posture with a simple exercise and with attention to what good walking posture feels like .
Perform this three times a day , it can be done anywhere there is a wall .
Stand next to a wall with your heels touching the wall and knees straight .
Make buttocks touch the wall .
Make shoulders touch the wall —
Do not flatten them fully against the wall , but square them and have them touch the wall at one level .
Make the back of your head , with chin level , touch the wall .
Hold this posture for a minute .
Raise your hand and tuck it between the wall and the small of your back .
If there is lots of space it shows that you have lordosis ( too much S - curve ) .
You want to work on reducing that by flexing you lower abdominal muscles to draw the small of your back closer to the wall .
Now step away from the wall and try to maintain this posture while walking around .
Repeat this three times a day .
This is the posture you should try to develop for walking .
To work on reducing the space at the small of the back , get a foam ball , such as a Nerf ball , and place it there to squeeze back against .
Look Like a Winner
The long , upright body this exercise gives you will make you look pounds thinner , more confident , and develop the right body mechanics for relieving lower back pain and walking easier .
It may not lead to promotions , compliments on your appearance , and walking medals , but it is worth a try to look and feel great .
Composers often speak of fitting chords and melodies together , as though sounds were physical objects with geometric shape -- and now a Princeton University musician has shown that advanced geometry actually does offer a tool for understanding musical structure .
In an attempt to answer age - old questions about how basic musical elements work together , Dmitri Tymoczko has journeyed far into the land of topology and non-Euclidean geometry , and has returned with a new -- and comparatively simple -- way of understanding how music is constructed .
His findings have resulted in the first paper on music theory that the journal Science has printed in its 127 - year history , and may provide an additional theoretical tool for composers searching for that elusive next chord .
" I 'm not trying to tell people what style of music sounds good , or which composers to prefer , " said Tymoczko ( pronounced tim - OSS - ko ) , a composer and music theorist who is an assistant professor of music at Princeton .
" What I hope to do is provide a new way to represent the space of musical possibilities .
If you like a particular chord , or group of notes , then I can show you how to find other , similar chords and link them together to form attractive melodies .
These two principles -- using attractive chords , and connecting their notes to form melodies -- have been central to Western musical thought for almost a thousand years . "
Tymoczko 's findings appear as a report in Science 's July 7 issue .
Making graphical representations of musical ideas is not itself a new idea .
Even most nonmusicians are familiar with the five - line musical staff , on which the notes that appear physically higher represent sounds that have higher pitch .
Other common representations include the circle of fifths , which illustrates the relationships between the 12 notes in the chromatic scale as though they were the 12 hours on a clock 's face .
" Tools like these have helped people understand music with both their ears and their eyes for generations , " Tymoczko said .
" But music has expanded a great deal in the past hundred years .
We are interested in a much broader range of harmonies and melodies than previous composers were .
With all these new musical developments , I thought it would be useful to search for a framework that could help us understand music regardless of style . "
Traditional music theory required that harmonically acceptable chords be constructed from notes separated by a couple of scale steps -- such as the major chord , whose three notes comprise the first , third and fifth elements in the major scale , forming a familiar harmony that most audiences find easy to enjoy .
Many 20th - century composers abandoned this requirement , however .
Modern chords are often constructed of notes that sit right next to one another on the keyboard , forming " clusters " -- dissonant by traditional standards -- that to this day often challenge listeners ' ears .

" Western music theory has developed impressive tools for thinking about traditional harmonies , but it does n’t have the same sophisticated tools for thinking about these newer chords , " Tymoczko said .
" This led me to want to develop a general geometrical model in which every conceivable chord is represented by a point in space .
That way , if you hear any sequence of chords , no matter how unfamiliar , you can still represent it as a series of points in the space .
To understand the melodic relationship between these chords , you connect the points with lines that represent how you have to change their notes to get from one chord to the next . "
One of Tymoczko 's musical spaces resembles a triangular prism , in which points representing traditionally familiar harmonies such as major chords gather near the center of the triangle , forming neat geometric shapes with other common chords that relate to them closely .
Dissonant , cluster - type harmonies can be found out near the edges , close to their own harmonic kin .
Tymoczko said that composers have traditionally valued a kind of harmonic consistency that does not require that the listener jump far from one region of the space to another too quickly .
“ This idea that you should stay in one part of space , ” he said , “ is an important ingredient of our notion of musical coherence . ”
To bring these ideas to life , Tymoczko has created a short movie that illustrates the chord movement in a piece of music by 19th - century composer Frederick Chopin .
His E minor piano prelude ( Opus 28 , No. 4 ) has charmed listeners since the 1830s , but its harmonies have not been well explained .
" This prelude is mysterious , " Tymoczko said .
" While it uses traditional harmonies , they are connected with nonstandard chord progressions that people have had trouble describing .
However , when you plot the chord movement in geometric space , you can see Chopin is moving along very short lines , staying primarily within one region . "
Tymoczko said that the geometric approach could assist with our still - murky understanding of music ranging from the mid-1800s through the contemporary period , including the cluster - based compositions of Georgi Ligeti , whose work formed a dramatic part of the soundtrack to the film " 2001 : A Space Odyssey . "

" What all this implies is that you can begin with any sort of harmony your ear enjoys , whether it's a familiar chord from a 300 - year - old hymn or the most avant - garde cluster you can imagine , " he said .
" But once you have decided where to start from and what region of space your harmony inhabits , very general principles of musical coherence suggest that you stay close to that region of space . "
Tymoczko , whose compositional influences include classical music , rock and jazz , said he does not expect people will start writing music by " connecting the dots " as a result of his research .
But he hopes it will at least provide a new tool for understanding the relationships behind music .
" Put simply , I 'm a composer and I like to write and play music that sounds good , " he said .
" But what does it mean to ' sound good ' ?
That 's a question that the musical community has grappled with for centuries .
Our understanding of the Chopin piece , for example , had previously been very local -- as if we were walking in a heavy fog and could only see a few steps in front of our feet at any one time .
We now have a map of the whole terrain on which we can walk , and can replace our earlier , local perspective with a much more general one . "
Commenting on the significance of the work , Yale 's Richard Cohn said that Tymoczko has made a useful contribution to a fundamental problem in music theory .
" Dmitri 's solution is exhaustive , original , and expressed clearly enough to be meaningful even to those musicians and scholars who do not have Dmitri 's mathematical abilities , " said Cohn , who is the Batell Professor of the Theory of Music at Yale .
" His work leads to a deeper understanding of why composers in the European tradition favor certain types of scales and chords , and it suggests that melody and harmony are more fundamentally intertwined than has been previously thought .
His achievement will become central to future work in the modelling of musical systems . "

Discovery launches amid clouds of exhaust emissions
Observing the planet from her vantage - point in space , Discovery Commander Eileen Collins spoke last Thursday of the environmental destruction visible on Earth , likening the atmosphere to " an eggshell on an egg , it 's so very thin " .
She added : " We know that we do n't have much air - we need to protect what we have . "
But is Nasa itself really observing this need for the protection of Earth as it sends shuttles into orbit ?
The image of a shuttle at lift - off , enveloped in clouds of exhaust , is now iconic .
As crowds gather to witness the dramatic displays as shuttles are made airborne though , many may wonder whether all those exhaust fumes are damaging our environment .
' Eco-friendly ' main engines
According to Nasa , the Space Shuttle Main Engine design , three of which powered Discovery , is " the most advanced liquid - fuelled rocket engine ever built " .
The International Space Station , and Earth , as seen from Discovery
Inside the engines , this hydrogen fuel is combusted with liquid oxygen in a reaction that reaches temperatures of up to 3136C , " hotter than the boiling point of iron " .
This creates a high - speed stream of gas which ultimately generates the thrust necessary for launching the shuttle .
Professor George Fraser , director of Leicester University 's Space Research Centre says this exhaust gas , made from the combination of hydrogen and oxygen , consists of water vapour and as such does not harm the atmosphere , making the use of Nasa 's main shuttle engines fairly environmentally safe .
Fuel cell technology is often thought of as being an answer to the world 's energy problems .
Carbon dioxide can , however , be a by - product from the production of hydrogen , depending how it is made .
Discovery was also made more environmentally friendly by the use of a certain type of insulating foam on its surface .
NASA SHUTTLE FOAM 1997 : US Environmental Protection Agency ordered many industries to phase out use of Freon 2001 : despite an exemption from CFC ban , Nasa continued to use ' green ' non-freon - based foam 2003 : seven astronauts died when Columbia disintegrated upon re-entry - an investigation reported thermal protection system damage was initiated by sheared off foam striking the wing 2005 : non-freon - based foam fell from the Discovery shuttle shortly after launch , and repairs were needed in space
Shuttle return held for 24 hours
Before 1997 , Nasa preferred to use freon - based foam on the shuttles , but as a chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) , freon is now linked to ozone depletion and so has been phased out .
Opting to follow Environmental Protection Agency guidelines , Nasa switched to an environmentally friendly version of the foam .
Despite these factors , however , all shuttle launches can nonetheless have damaging impacts on the local environment .
Hydrochloric acid
Professor Fraser said : " The classic example of environmental impact is in Kazakhstan at the Baikonur launch site , where there are reports of quite serious environmental damage . "
For most shuttles , the damage comes from the solid rocket boosters , or SRBs , require at shuttle launch to provide 71.4 % of the thrust at lift - off and elevate the shuttle to an altitude of 45 km ( 28 miles ) .
As a shuttle launches , a " cloud " becomes visible which contains SRB exhaust products , either dissolved or as particles in the water vapour released by the main engines .
Hydrochloric acid formed in this launch cloud leads to acidic deposits in the surrounding area , a phenomenon which may also be observed some distance away if exhausts are carried on prevailing winds .
The scenes of dead fish in Spain could be repeated next to launch sites
A 1993 Nasa technical manual considered environmental effects of space shuttle launches at Kennedy Space Centre , and stated that some cumulative effects of launches in the nearby area are " reduction in the number of plant species present and reduction in total cover " .
The manual also pointed out that acid deposits from the launch cloud can also impact nearby water lagoons and their wildlife .
If hydrochloric acid is deposited , the pH value near the surface of the water may drop and prove too acidic for fish , although these impacts on wildlife do " appear minimal and manageable " .
Professor Fraser points out also that while shuttles may cause a small amount of damage to the ozone layer this will be " far less marked than that from the large number of high altitude aircraft in the World all the time " .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
Compared to the vast benefits of the space program to conservation here on Earth , I feel that it can be safely suggested that the damage to the environment from these launches is relatively negligible .
Although some damage to the local ecosystem can be expected it is almost certainly very limited and has been taken into account for the Space Program .
Peter Humphreys , Cobham , Surrey
Nice to know the Shuttle exhaust is n't damaging the enviroment .
I am wondering what damage is done to the Global enviroment by producing all this hydrogen though ?
There must be a fair amount of enegry used to chill and pressurise the tanks ?
Ian Bonham , Gibraltar
But how is the liquid hydrogen manufactured and then maintained at such a low temperature ?
Because of inevitable inefficiencies in the manufacturing and storage processes , this is bound to use more energy from fossil fuel than the total energy that the rockets use to lift the Shuttle into orbit .
Damage to the atmosphere from the release of carbon is thus greater than if the Shuttle burnt fossil fuel direct .
While the radiative forcing element of burning fossil fuel at altitude will be missing , the release of vapour at altitude also contributes to the formation of clouds , which also raises the temperature of the atmosphere .
Peter Thomas , London
We are in danger of getting onto the environmental and PR bandwagons here .
Compared to the destruction on the rainforests , the close to home environmental degradation through all sorts of human activity and waste , any damage that may be caused by the launch of a few shuttles every few months will pale into insignificance .
The benefits that come out of this programme far outweigh any environmental impact .
Lets keep things in perspective .
William , Patagonia , Argentina
Since there are only two shuttles left , their environmental impact is minimal .
To put things in perspective , there are underground fires around the world that are even more polluting .
If we could find a way to put them out , we 'd do a lot more for the environment .
John Airey , Peterborough , UK
Although the shuttle take - off without doubt requires a remarkable amount of energy , I 'm sure compared to global usage it is a small number .
Understanding of the climate system and its response to human burning of fossil fuels ( particularly the associated increases in CO2 ) is getting better all the time , but there still remain some open scientific questions .
Observation of Earth from space will help refine the debate about how our climate system operates and changes , and aid policymakers in decisions as to what constitutes " safe " levels of emissions .
If shuttle missions are used to place Earth observing Satillites in orbit to provide this data , the little extra energy used achieving this will be worthwhile .
Chris Huntingford , Wallingford
Describing the main engines as " eco-friendly " is misleading .
It 's true that they only release water vapour as exhaust , but producing such vast quantities of super - cooled liquids consumes extremely large amounts of energy .
We must consider the quantity of fossil fuels being burned in power stations to provide this energy - surely it is many times more than if the shuttle were to burn fossil fuels itself !
Alex , Cheshire , UK
The real enviromental effect is the energy consumed in the construction of the shuttle and its components .
Not only is the production of the materials that go in to making the shuttle hugely energy intensive but the man hours also take a huge toll on the resources of the planet .
Each worker drives to work , uses diposible tools and materials and due to the constant quest for safety the number of rejected components must be phenominal .
What is the true cost of a shuttle mission ?
James , Vancouver , Canada
ALL human activities effect the environment and shuttle launches are no different .
One needs to consider the costs vs the benefits .
Launch costs are quantifiable .
However , benefits may not be realized for years .
Look back on the first lunar landings .
How could the benefits of micro-electronics , medical technologies , material sciences , computers , and many other spin - offs be quantified ?
What could be the benefits of our current program ?
Clean compact power sources , improved waste recycling , new materials , new manufacturing , and improved medical procedures , to name a few , could be used on Earth .

I could see the greenie 's point of view if it was plutonium powered , but it 's not .
Yes , there is undoubtably some damage , but it could be far more harmful .

Many of the astronauts have logged thousands of hours in aircraft ( s ) during training sessions .
I am sure none of them were powered by hydrogen .

I think we are forgetting the main picture here .
Hypothetically NASA launches one rocket per year , that wo n't even compare to the pollution of 1 highway truck running continuously for one year .
i wo n't take it as a danger to the environment as long as we have the millions and millions of trucks and cars that pollute our environment everyday .
Jayachandran Kamaraj , Dunlap US
True , that the benefits of the shuttle far outweigh the manageable environmental impact that it may have .
But is there any harm in evaluating the alernatives and trying to constantly improve ?
For e.g. is the method of sending men and material to the space station using the soviet capsule method less resource intensive and simpler ?
If yes , then may be there should be a rethink .

I wonder how many ' environmentally concerned ' folks are reading this on a computer screen in a fabricated workstation , whilst sitting on a plastic chair , having arrived with aid of a car , after dousing themselves in no less than 10 litres of warm water and scoured themselves with all manner of chemical compunds ... of course being largely european , we will forgive them the use of the chemical compounds in their toilette .

Quite a few people were interested in my recent harvest of Luffa shower sponges .
I thought I ’d explain a bit more about the plant and the process of growing it .
Luffa aegyptiaca Mill .
or as it is commonly called , the Loofah , is a vegetable native to South America .
It can be eaten when it is smaller .
I have stir fried them but only up to a size of about 4 inches .
After that they become tough like an over ripe squash .
Left to fully mature each fruit produces an excellent sponge .
Seeds for this plant are readily available through vegetable catalogs and you ’ll only have to buy seeds your first year - one mature Luffa sponge will produce at least 30 seeds .
Some will produce many more .
Frost kills the plant and it needs 4 to 5 months of growth to produce sponges .
Here in North Carolina
I can plant seeds directly in the ground near the date of the last frost and then harvest a modest number of sponges later in autumn .
If I wanted a better yield or if I lived further north I would start them indoors several weeks , maybe even a month before the date of the last frost and transplant them outdoors after frost danger has passed .
Planting them on the sunny , southern side of your property will help .
They are natural climbers and are happiest running up the sides of a trellis or even the outer walls of your home .
I sprinkle a few seeds near , but not in front of , one of my south facing gutter downspouts .
When the plant sprouts it climbs up the downspout and along my gutters .
It does n’t impede the flow of water and in the fall when the plant dies I easily pull it off of my home .
The large Luffa leaves help to shade the hottest side of my house in the summer .
I am certain they could be grown just as well on a large trellis .
They can get quite long .
I ’ve grown vines that exceeded 15 feet in length .
Sometimes Luffas left to fully mature and turn brown or Luffas that ripen lying on the ground will have brown splotches of color throughout the sponge .
For some people this is n’t a problem .
Others however do not like bathing with something that is several different shades of rust .
After I remove the outer skin and squeeze out the pulp and seeds from inside the Luffa , I often soak them in a weak solution of bleach and warm water for about 5 minutes .
This is especially true of the Luffa sponges I give as gifts .
The process usually lightens the color and gets rid of dark brown spots .
After doing so I let them dry thoroughly by hanging them up or placing them on a drying rack .
It is also possible to dye the Luffas if you think you ’d like bathing with a pink sponge .
I highly suggest you try growing Luffa sponges ; even those of you in Northern climates with shorter growing seasons .
Each morning as I start my day , I am reminded of my commitment to becoming more self - sufficient when I shower using a sponge I grew myself .
Derren Brown on The Heist
Under the guise of a motivational seminar and a follow - up documentary , can Derren Brown persuade any of his group of responsible , middle - management businessmen and women to steal £ 100,000 in an armed robbery ?
Such is the premise for the most ambitious and challenging of Derren ’s specials to date .
It ’s a look at what little it takes to cross into deviant behaviour and a masterclass in persuasion .
Derren , how did you come up with the idea for this show ?
“ As ever , these things come about by thinking what I 'd personally like to see on TV .
I 'm finally having my TV removed and replaced by a tropical fish tank , which I hope will provide more interesting viewing .
I 've also always had a vague distaste for the cult of selfishness apotheosised through self - help seminars , which form the starting point for the show . ”
How would you describe what it ’s about ?
“ For me this is about the fine line that we tread between normal and deviant behaviour ; the nature and process of persuasion ; what little it takes to push us into behaviour that is designated anti-social ; and to quote Banksy - the fact that more crimes are committed in the name of obedience than disobedience .
And generally far worse crimes . ”
Is it possible to get someone to obey ANY order ?
Are they hypnotised ?
“ You have to realise that hypnosis does n't exist : it just works on people 's natural suggestibility , their expectations and capacity to unconsciously role play .
You can't make someone do anything they do n't want to do .
Clearly if a hypnotist could make someone to steal £ 100 k just by telling them to , the world would be a different place , and I suspect that hypnotists would n't bother doing shows in pubs or dodgy Spanish holiday resorts .
So the challenge of the show is to insiduously massage these people to the point that they will make the decision themselves to hold up an armoured security van and point a gun at the guard , but without ever telling them to do so .
Were I to ever suggest the idea , they 'd obviously refuse .
It has to come from inside them at the right moment .
The viewer will follow every aspect of the persuasion process that takes place over 2 weeks : nothing is added or taken away . ”
Were they aware they would be breaking the law ?
“ Absolutely .
When the moment arrives , they will have no idea that they 're being filmed , or that we 're using a stunt actor as a security guard . ”
Did they think the gun was real ?
“ No , they know it 's a toy gun , but they know it 's realistic enough to fool a guard with . ”
Will they remember what they did ?
“ Of course .
For that reason , the psychological handling of the participants was of paramount importance .
Aside from the police we had sealing off and monitoring the area , we also used two independent clinical psychologists in the show to check on their suitability beforehand , and welfare after . ”

Lobbyist admits to kickbacks , fraud Abramoff agrees to cooperate in Washington corruption probe RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Lobbying Government Crime , Law and Justice or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former high - powered lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy , fraud and tax evasion charges , agreeing to cooperate in a federal corruption probe in Washington .
Abramoff , 46 , faces up to 11 years in federal prison and must pay $ 26.7 million in restitution , said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher .
She said Abramoff admitted to corrupting government officials and defrauding his own clients out of $ 25 million .
Abramoff admitted that he did not disclose receiving kickbacks on payments from Native American tribes to a partner 's public relations firm .
Abramoff and his politically connected partner , public relations expert Michael Scanlon , jokingly referred to their scheme as the " Gimme Five Program , " Fisher said .
( Watch the rise and fall of Abramoff - 1:50 ) Abramoff also acknowledged that some of his money did not go to charities , as he had reported , but paid for a golf trip to Scotland .
Abramoff 's plea agreement spares him the possibility of a maximum 30 - year sentence if he provides useful assistance in the corruption probe .
Prosecutors also might seek a further sentence reduction at the end of the investigation , Fisher said .
( Read the plea agreement -- PDF )
A courtroom apology " Words can never express my sorrow and profound regret , " Abramoff told U.S. District Court Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle .
" Nor can they express my sadness and regret for my conduct , " he added . " I ask for forgiveness and redemption from ( the ) Almighty . "
As part of the deal , Abramoff agreed to cooperate with the IRS on his tax evasion charge and pay the agency $ 1.72 million .
He also agreed not to dispose of assets and to repay the $ 25 million , according to the plea agreement .
Washington lawyer Abbe Lowell said in a statement that Abramoff will cooperate with prosecutors , repay " anyone he has harmed , " and " seek absolution from all . "
Court documents filed Tuesday describe how Abramoff and Scanlon cheated clients of Abramoff 's lobbying firm by urging them to use Scanlon 's PR firm -- which in turn paid Abramoff millions of dollars in kickbacks .
( Read a summary of the charges -- PDF ) Abramoff is a longtime associate of several top GOP leaders , including former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay , Americans for Tax Reform director Grover Norquist , and former Christian Coalition chief Ralph Reed .
Washington on edge Scanlon , a 35 - year - old former aide to DeLay , also is cooperating .
His and Abramoff 's cooperation deals could have a wide - reaching effect in Washington .
( View a report on what Abramoff said and its potential impact -- 2:37 )
A source close to the inquiry said investigators are looking at about half a dozen members of Congress .
Another source , a senior government official , told CNN the probe involves about two dozen lawmakers and staffers .
Fisher vowed the investigators , including agents from the FBI and IRS , will go wherever the evidence leads .
" Government officials and government actions are not for sale , " she vowed .
Such corruption , she added , has " a devastating impact on the public 's trust in government . "
Sources told CNN's Ed Henry that Abramoff may have thousands of e-mails in which he describes influence - peddling and explains what lawmakers were doing in exchange for the money he was putting into their campaign coffers .
Sources said Abramoff has been cooperating with the Justice Department for months without any kind of plea deal .
He will not be sentenced until his cooperation is complete , the source added .
Kickback scheme detailed
The court documents allege Abramoff deprived his clients of his honest services by overcharging them to fund the alleged kickback scheme with Scanlon .
Listed in the court documents are four Native American tribes that contracted Abramoff 's services .
The documents said the tribes gave millions of dollars to Scanlon 's firm , which then paid Abramoff 50 percent of the profits it made .
According to the documents : Starting in 2001 , Abramoff persuaded a Louisiana tribe to pay nearly $ 30.5 million for " grassroots work " to a Scanlon company , which , in turn , kicked back nearly $ 11.4 million to Abramoff .
In 2001 Abramoff also persuaded a Mississippi tribe to give nearly $ 14.8 million to Scanlon , who funneled nearly $ 6.3 to Abramoff .
A Michigan tribe gave $ 3.5 million to Scanlon 's firm in 2002 ; $ 540,000 ended up in Abramoff 's pocket .
Also in 2002 , a Texas tribe gave $ 4.2 million to Scanlon , and nearly $ 1.9 million found its way to Abramoff According to e-mail obtained by a Senate committee , Abramoff made a fortune from the tribes while privately mocking tribal leaders as " monkeys " and " morons . "
In one instance , Fisher told reporters , Abramoff took fees from one client , then worked for another client with competing interests .
She did not identify the clients .
Influence peddling alleged Scanlon pleaded guilty in November to a single conspiracy count as part of a deal with the Justice Department .
He agreed to pay about $ 19.7 million in restitution for kickbacks he admitted receiving , and promised to testify against Abramoff .
Prosecutors also detailed a " stream of things of value " given to an unnamed congressman , identified in the court documents as Representative No. 1 , and to members of his staff .
The items listed include a " lavish " golf trip to Scotland , tickets to sporting events and other entertainment , meals at Abramoff 's " upscale " Washington restaurant , and campaign contributions to the representative and his political action committee in exchange for a series of actions by that representative .
The Justice Department would not identify the congressman .
But government sources have said he is Rep. Bob Ney , a veteran Republican from Ohio who heads the House Administration Committee .
In the court documents , prosecutors alleged Abramoff , Scanlon and others got the lawmaker " to perform a series of official acts . "
According to the documents , the acts included supporting bills , placing statements in the Congressional Record , meeting with the lobbyist 's clients and supporting a client of Abramoff in a bid to win a contract for wireless telephone service for the House of Representatives .
Ney is known to have entered comments in the Congressional Record against a man standing in the way of an Abramoff project -- a 2000 casino fleet purchase -- and he took a 2002 golf trip to Scotland that Abramoff sponsored .
Ney denies wrongdoing " At the time I dealt with Jack Abramoff , I obviously did not know , and had no way of knowing , the self - serving and fraudulent nature of Abramoff 's activities , " Ney said Tuesday in a statement .
Ney 's office said he has " never done anything illegal or improper and the allegations in this plea agreement do not change this fact . "
The statement continued , " Whenever Congressman Ney took official action , he did so because of his understanding of the merits and facts of the situation and not because of any improper influence from Jack Abramoff or anybody else . "
Ney continues to cooperate with the investigation " to separate truth from fiction , " his office said .
Ney is the only member of Congress to disclose that he has been subpoenaed -- a step required under House rules -- as part of the investigation .
However , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D - California , said in a statement that Abramoff 's plea agreement was a sign of Republicans ' " culture of corruption . "
" Today , Jack Abramoff admitted to conspiring to bribe members of Congress -- a despicable action that strikes at the heart of our democracy .
Sadly , it is not a surprise because this Republican Congress is the most corrupt in history and the American people are paying the price , " Pelosi said .
Florida plea expected Abramoff 's name also surfaced earlier this year amid ethics questions about DeLay , a longtime friend .
The Washington Post has reported DeLay , a Texas Republican , took two expensive overseas trips that Abramoff and other lobbyists bankrolled -- a violation of House rules , if true .
DeLay has denied wrongdoing , calling the report " just another seedy attempt by the liberal media to embarrass me . "
DeLay , who is facing unrelated money laundering charges , was forced by party rules to step down from his leadership position in September after he was indicted in Texas .
Abramoff will also plead guilty Wednesday to charges in Florida , said Neal Sonnett , his Miami attorney .
Those charges stem from Abramoff 's role in the 2000 purchase of SunCruz Casinos , a fleet of offshore gambling boats .
In the Florida case , Abramoff and a partner , Adam Kidan , are accused of falsifying a $ 23 million wire transfer to obtain $ 60 million in financing .
Kidan pleaded guilty last month .

A word to the reader :
The following paper is so shocking that , after preparing the initial draft , I did n't want to believe it myself , and resolved to disprove it with more research .
However , I only succeeded in turning up more evidence in support of my thesis .
And I repeated this cycle of discovery and denial several more times before finally deciding to go with the article .
I believe that a serious writer must follow the trail of evidence , no matter where it leads , and report back .
So here is my story .
Do n't be surprised if it causes you to squirm .
Its purpose is not to make predictions history makes fools of those who claim to know the future but simply to describe the peril that awaits us in the Persian Gulf .
By awakening to the extent of that danger , perhaps we can still find a way to save our nation and the world from disaster .
If we are very lucky , we might even create an alternative future that holds some promise of resolving the monumental conflicts of our time .
-- MG Last July , they dubbed it operation Summer Pulse : a simultaneous mustering of US Naval forces , world wide , that was unprecedented .
According to the Navy , it was the first exercise of its new Fleet Response Plan ( FRP ) , the purpose of which was to enable the Navy to respond quickly to an international crisis .
The Navy wanted to show its increased force readiness , that is , its capacity to rapidly move combat power to any global hot spot .
Never in the history of the US Navy had so many carrier battle groups been involved in a single operation .
Even the US fleet massed in the Gulf and eastern Mediterranean during operation Desert Storm in 1991 , and in the recent invasion of Iraq , never exceeded six battle groups .
But last July and August there were seven of them on the move , each battle group consisting of a Nimitz - class aircraft carrier with its full complement of 7 - 8 supporting ships , and 70 or more assorted aircraft .
Most of the activity , according to various reports , was in the Pacific , where the fleet participated in joint exercises with the Taiwanese navy .
But why so much naval power underway at the same time ?
What potential world crisis could possibly require more battle groups than were deployed during the recent invasion of Iraq ?
In past years , when the US has seen fit to " show the flag " or flex its naval muscle , one or two carrier groups have sufficed .
Why this global show of power ?
The news headlines about the joint - maneuvers in the South China Sea read : " Saber Rattling Unnerves China " , and : " Huge Show of Force Worries Chinese . "
But the reality was quite different , and , as we shall see , has grave ramifications for the continuing US military presence in the Persian Gulf ; because operation Summer Pulse reflected a high - level Pentagon decision that an unprecedented show of strength was needed to counter what is viewed as a growing threat in the particular case of China , because of Peking 's newest Sovremenny - class destroyers recently acquired from Russia .
" Nonsense ! " you are probably thinking .
That 's impossible .
How could a few picayune destroyers threaten the US Pacific fleet ? "
Here is where the story thickens : Summer Pulse amounted to a tacit acknowledgement , obvious to anyone paying attention , that the United States has been eclipsed in an important area of military technology , and that this qualitative edge is now being wielded by others , including the Chinese ; because those otherwise very ordinary destroyers were , in fact , launching platforms for Russian - made 3M - 82 Moskit anti-ship cruise missiles ( NATO designation : SS - N - 22 Sunburn ) , a weapon for which the US Navy currently has no defense .
Here I am not suggesting that the US status of lone world Superpower has been surpassed .
I am simply saying that a new global balance of power is emerging , in which other individual states may , on occasion , achieve " an asymmetric advantage " over the US .
And this , in my view , explains the immense scale of Summer Pulse .
The US show last summer of overwhelming strength was calculated to send a message .
The Sunburn Missile I was shocked when I learned the facts about these Russian - made cruise missiles .
The problem is that so many of us suffer from two common misperceptions .
The first follows from our assumption that Russia is militarily weak , as a result of the breakup of the old Soviet system .
Actually , this is accurate , but it does not reflect the complexities .
Although the Russian navy continues to rust in port , and the Russian army is in disarray , in certain key areas Russian technology is actually superior to our own .
And nowhere is this truer than in the vital area of anti-ship cruise missile technology , where the Russians hold at least a ten - year lead over the US .
The second misperception has to do with our complacency in general about missiles - as - weapons probably attributable to the pathetic performance of Saddam Hussein 's Scuds during the first Gulf war : a dangerous illusion that I will now attempt to rectify .
Many years ago , Soviet planners gave up trying to match the US Navy ship for ship , gun for gun , and dollar for dollar .
The Soviets simply could not compete with the high levels of US spending required to build up and maintain a huge naval armada .
They shrewdly adopted an alternative approach based on strategic defense .
They searched for weaknesses , and sought relatively inexpensive ways to exploit those weaknesses .
The Soviets succeeded : by developing several supersonic anti-ship missiles , one of which , the SS - N - 22 Sunburn , has been called " the most lethal missile in the world today . "
After the collapse of the Soviet Union the old military establishment fell upon hard times .
But in the late1990s Moscow awakened to the under - utilized potential of its missile technology to generate desperately needed foreign exchange .
A decision was made to resuscitate selected programs , and , very soon , Russian missile technology became a hot export commodity .
Today , Russian missiles are a growth industry generating much - needed cash for Russia , with many billions in combined sales to India , China , Viet Nam , Cuba , and also Iran .
In the near future this dissemination of advanced technology is likely to present serious challenges to the US .
Some have even warned that the US Navy 's largest ships , the massive carriers , have now become floating death traps , and should for this reason be mothballed .
The Sunburn missile has never seen use in combat , to my knowledge , which probably explains why its fearsome capabilities are not more widely recognized .
Other cruise missiles have been used , of course , on several occasions , and with devastating results .
During the Falklands War , French - made Exocet missiles , fired from Argentine fighters , sunk the HMS Sheffield and another ship .
And , in 1987 , during the Iran - Iraq war , the USS Stark was nearly cut in half by a pair of Exocets while on patrol in the Persian Gulf .
On that occasion US Aegis radar picked up the incoming Iraqi fighter ( a French - made Mirage ) , and tracked its approach to within 50 miles .
The radar also " saw " the Iraqi plane turn about and return to its base .
But radar never detected the pilot launch his weapons .
The sea-skimming Exocets came smoking in under radar and were only sighted by human eyes moments before they ripped into the Stark , crippling the ship and killing 37 US sailors .
The 1987 surprise attack on the Stark exemplifies the dangers posed by anti-ship cruise missiles .
And the dangers are much more serious in the case of the Sunburn , whose specs leave the sub-sonic Exocet in the dust .
Not only is the Sunburn much larger and faster , it has far greater range and a superior guidance system .
Those who have witnessed its performance trials invariably come away stunned .
According to one report , when the Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani visited Moscow in October 2001 he requested a test firing of the Sunburn , which the Russians were only too happy to arrange .
So impressed was Ali Shamkhani that he placed an order for an undisclosed number of the missiles .
The Sunburn can deliver a 200 - kiloton nuclear payload , or : a 750 - pound conventional warhead , within a range of 100 miles , more than twice the range of the Exocet .
The Sunburn combines a Mach 2.1 speed ( two times the speed of sound ) with a flight pattern that hugs the deck and includes " violent end maneuvers " to elude enemy defenses .
The missile was specifically designed to defeat the US Aegis radar defense system .
Should a US Navy Phalanx point defense somehow manage to detect an incoming Sunburn missile , the system has only seconds to calculate a fire solution not enough time to take out the intruding missile .
The US Phalanx defense employs a six - barreled gun that fires 3,000 depleted - uranium rounds a minute , but the gun must have precise coordinates to destroy an intruder " just in time . "
The Sunburn 's combined supersonic speed and payload size produce tremendous kinetic energy on impact , with devastating consequences for ship and crew .
A single one of these missiles can sink a large warship , yet costs considerably less than a fighter jet .
Although the Navy has been phasing out the older Phalanx defense system , its replacement , known as the Rolling Action Missile ( RAM ) has never been tested against the weapon it seems destined to one day face in combat .
Implications For US
Forces in the Gulf The US Navy 's only plausible defense against a robust weapon like the Sunburn missile is to detect the enemy 's approach well ahead of time , whether destroyers , subs , or fighter - bombers , and defeat them before they can get in range and launch their deadly cargo .
For this purpose US AWACs radar planes assigned to each naval battle group are kept aloft on a rotating schedule .
The planes " see " everything within two hundred miles of the fleet , and are complemented with intelligence from orbiting satellites .
But US naval commanders operating in the Persian Gulf face serious challenges that are unique to the littoral , i.e. , coastal , environment .
A glance at a map shows why :
The Gulf is nothing but a large lake , with one narrow outlet , and most of its northern shore , i.e. , Iran , consists of mountainous terrain that affords a commanding tactical advantage over ships operating in Gulf waters .
The rugged northern shore makes for easy concealment of coastal defenses , such as mobile missile launchers , and also makes their detection problematic .
Although it was not widely reported , the US actually lost the battle of the Scuds in the first Gulf War termed " the great Scud hunt " and for similar reasons .
Saddam Hussein 's mobile Scud launchers proved so difficult to detect and destroy over and over again the Iraqis fooled allied reconnaissance with decoys that during the course of Desert Storm the US was unable to confirm even a single kill .
This proved such an embarrassment to the Pentagon , afterwards , that the unpleasant stats were buried in official reports .
But the blunt fact is that the US failed to stop the Scud attacks .
The launches continued until the last few days of the conflict .
Luckily , the Scud 's inaccuracy made it an almost useless weapon .
At one point General Norman Schwarzkopf quipped dismissively to the press that his soldiers had a greater chance of being struck by lightning in Georgia than by a Scud in Kuwait .
But that was then , and it would be a grave error to allow the Scud 's ineffectiveness to blur the facts concerning this other missile .
The Sunburn 's amazing accuracy was demonstrated not long ago in a live test staged at sea by the Chinese and observed by US spy planes .
Not only did the Sunburn missile destroy the dummy target ship , it scored a perfect bull 's eye , hitting the crosshairs of a large " X " mounted on the ship 's bridge .
The only word that does it justice , awesome , has become a cliché , hackneyed from hyperbolic excess .
The US Navy has never faced anything in combat as formidable as the Sunburn missile .
But this will surely change if the US and Israel decide to wage a so - called preventive war against Iran to destroy its nuclear infrastructure .
Storm clouds have been darkening over the Gulf for many months .
In recent years Israel upgraded its air force with a new fleet of long - range F - 15 fighter - bombers , and even more recently took delivery of 5,000 bunker - buster bombs from the US weapons that many observers think are intended for use against Iran .
The arming for war has been matched by threats .
Israeli officials have declared repeatedly that they will not allow the Mullahs to develop nuclear power , not even reactors to generate electricity for peaceful use .
Their threats are particularly worrisome , because Israel has a long history of pre-emptive war .
( See my 1989 book Dimona : the Third Temple ? and also my 2003 article Will Iran Be Next ?
posted at http://www.InformationClearingHouse.info/article3288.htm
)
Never mind that such a determination is not Israel 's to make , and belongs instead to the international community , as codified in the Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
With regard to Iran , the International Atomic Energy Agency's ( IAEA 's ) recent report ( September 2004 ) is well worth a look , as it repudiates facile claims by the US and Israel that Iran is building bombs .
While the report is highly critical of Tehran for its ambiguities and its grudging release of documents , it affirms that IAEA inspectors have been admitted to every nuclear site in the country to which they have sought access , without exception .
Last year Iran signed the strengthened IAEA inspection protocol , which until then had been voluntary .
And the IAEA has found no hard evidence , to date , either that bombs exist or that Iran has made a decision to build them .
( The latest IAEA report can be downloaded at : http://www.GlobalSecurity.org)
In a talk on October 3 , 2004 , IAEA Director General Mohamed El Baradei made the clearest statement yet : " Iran has no nuclear weapons program " , he said , and then repeated himself for emphasis : " Iran has no nuclear weapons program , but I personally do n't rush to conclusions before all the realities are clarified .
So far I see nothing that could be called an imminent danger .
I have seen no nuclear weapons program in Iran .
What I have seen is that Iran is trying to gain access to nuclear enrichment technology , and so far there is no danger from Iran .
Therefore , we should make use of political and diplomatic means before thinking of resorting to other alternatives . "
No one disputes that Tehran is pursuing a dangerous path , but with 200 or more Israeli nukes targeted upon them the Iranians ' insistence on keeping their options open is understandable .
Clearly , the nuclear nonproliferation regime today hangs by the slenderest of threads .
The world has arrived at a fateful crossroads .
A Fearful Symmetry ?
If a showdown over Iran develops in the coming months , the man who could hold the outcome in his hands will be thrust upon the world stage .
That man , like him or hate him , is Russian President Vladimir Putin .
He has been castigated severely in recent months for gathering too much political power to himself .
But according to former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev , who was interviewed on US television recently by David Brokaw , Putin has not imposed a tyranny upon Russia yet .
Gorbachev thinks the jury is still out on Putin .
Perhaps , with this in mind , we should be asking whether Vladimir Putin is a serious student of history .
If he is , then he surely recognizes that the deepening crisis in the Persian Gulf presents not only manifold dangers , but also opportunities .
Be assured that the Russian leader has not forgotten the humiliating defeat Ronald Reagan inflicted upon the old Soviet state .
( Have we Americans forgotten ? )
By the mid-1980s the Soviets were in Kabul , and had all but defeated the Mujahedeen .
The Soviet Union appeared secure in its military occupation of Afghanistan .
But then , in 1986 , the first US Stinger missiles reached the hands of the Afghani resistance ; and , quite suddenly , Soviet helicopter gunships and MiGs began dropping out of the skies like flaming stones .
The tide swiftly turned , and by 1989 it was all over but the hand wringing and gnashing of teeth in the Kremlin .
Defeated , the Soviets slunk back across the frontier .
The whole world cheered the American Stingers , which had carried the day .
This very night , as he sips his cognac , what is Vladimir Putin thinking ?
Is he perhaps thinking about the perverse symmetries of history ?
If so , he may also be wondering ( and discussing with his closest aides ) how a truly great nation like the United States could be so blind and so stupid as to allow another state , i.e. , Israel , to control its foreign policy , especially in a region as vital ( and volatile ) as the Mid-East .
One can almost hear the Russians ' animated conversation : " The Americans !
What is the matter with them ? "
" They simply cannot help themselves . "
" What idiots ! " " A nation as foolish as this deserves to be taught a lesson " " Yes !
For their own good . "
" It must be a painful lesson , one they will never forget .
" Are we agreed , then , comrades ? "
" Let us teach our American friends a lesson about the limits of military power ... "
Does anyone really believe that Vladimir Putin will hesitate to seize a most rare opportunity to change the course of history and , in the bargain , take his sweet revenge ?
Surely Putin understands the terrible dimensions of the trap into which the US has blundered , thanks to the Israelis and their neo-con supporters in Washington who lobbied so vociferously for the 2003 invasion of Iraq , against all friendly and expert advice , and who even now beat the drums of war against Iran .
Would Putin be wrong to conclude that the US will never leave the region unless it is first defeated militarily ?
Should we blame him for deciding that Iran is " one bridge too far " ?
If the US and Israel overreach , and the Iranians close the net with Russian anti-ship missiles , it will be a fearful symmetry , indeed .
Springing the Trap
At the battle of Cannae in 216 BC , the great Carthaginian general , Hannibal , tempted a much larger Roman army into a fateful advance , and then enveloped and annihilated it with a smaller force .
Out of a Roman army of 70,000 men , no more than a few thousand escaped .
It was said that after many hours of dispatching the Romans , Hannibal 's soldiers grew so tired that the fight went out of them .
In their weariness they granted the last broken and bedraggled Romans their lives .
Let us pray that the US sailors who are unlucky enough to be on duty in the Persian Gulf when the shooting starts can escape the fate of the Roman army at Cannae .
The odds will be heavily against them , however , because they will face the same type of danger , tantamount to envelopment .
The US ships in the Gulf will already have come within range of the Sunburn missiles and the even more - advanced SS - NX - 26 Yakhonts missiles , also Russian - made ( speed : Mach 2.9 ; range : 180 miles ) deployed by the Iranians along the Gulf 's northern shore .
Every US ship will be exposed and vulnerable .
When the Iranians spring the trap , the entire lake will become a killing field .
Anti-ship cruise missiles are not new , as I 've mentioned .
Nor have they yet determined the outcome in a conflict .
But this is probably only because these horrible weapons have never been deployed in sufficient numbers .
At the time of the Falklands war the Argentine air force possessed only five Exocets , yet managed to sink two ships .
With enough of them , the Argentineans might have sunk the entire British fleet , and won the war .
Although we 've never seen a massed attack of cruise missiles , this is exactly what the US Navy could face in the next war in the Gulf .
Try and imagine it if you can : barrage after barrage of Exocet - class missiles , which the Iranians are known to possess in the hundreds , as well as the unstoppable Sunburn and Yakhonts missiles .
The questions that our purblind government leaders should be asking themselves , today , if they value what historians will one day write about them , are two : how many of the Russian anti-ship missiles has Putin already supplied to Iran ?
And :
How many more are currently in the pipeline ?
In 2001 , Jane 's Defense Weekly reported that Iran was attempting to acquire anti-ship missiles from Russia .
Ominously , the same report also mentioned that the more advanced Yakhonts missile was " optimized for attacks against carrier task forces . "
Apparently its guidance system is " able to distinguish an aircraft carrier from its escorts . "
The numbers were not disclosed .
The US Navy will come under fire even if the US does not participate in the first so - called surgical raids on Iran 's nuclear sites , that is , even if Israel goes it alone .
Israel 's brand - new fleet of 25 F - 15s ( paid for by American taxpayers ) has sufficient range to target Iran , but the Israelis cannot mount an attack without crossing US - occupied Iraqi air space .
It will hardly matter if Washington gives the green light , or is dragged into the conflict by a recalcitrant Israel .
Either way , the result will be the same .
The Iranians will interpret US acquiescence as complicity , and , in any event , they will understand that the real fight is with the Americans .
The Iranians will be entirely within their rights to counter - attack in self - defense .
Most of the world will see it this way , and will support them , not America .
The US and Israel will be viewed as the aggressors , even as the unfortunate US sailors in harm 's way become cannon fodder .
In the Gulf 's shallow and confined waters evasive maneuvers will be difficult , at best , and escape impossible .
Even if US planes control of the skies over the battlefield , the sailors caught in the net below will be hard - pressed to survive .
The Gulf will run red with American blood .
From here , it only gets worse .
Armed with their Russian - supplied cruise missiles , the Iranians will close the lake 's only outlet , the strategic Strait of Hormuz , cutting off the trapped and dying Americans from help and rescue .
The US fleet massing in the Indian Ocean will stand by helplessly , unable to enter the Gulf to assist the survivors or bring logistical support to the other US forces on duty in Iraq .
Couple this with a major new ground offensive by the Iraqi insurgents , and , quite suddenly , the tables could turn against the Americans in Baghdad .
As supplies and ammunition begin to run out , the status of US forces in the region will become precarious .
The occupiers will become the besieged .
With enough anti-ship missiles , the Iranians can halt tanker traffic through Hormuz for weeks , even months .
With the flow of oil from the Gulf curtailed , the price of a barrel of crude will skyrocket on the world market .
Within days the global economy will begin to grind to a halt .
Tempers at an emergency round - the - clock session of the UN Security Council will flare and likely explode into shouting and recriminations as French , German , Chinese and even British ambassadors angrily accuse the US of allowing Israel to threaten world order .
But , as always , because of the US veto the world body will be powerless to act ...
America will stand alone , completely isolated .
Yet , despite the increasingly hostile international mood , elements of the US media will spin the crisis very differently here at home , in a way that is sympathetic to Israel .
Members of Congress will rise to speak in the House and Senate , and rally to Israel 's defense , while blaming the victim of the attack , Iran .
Fundamentalist Christian talk show hosts will proclaim the historic fulfillment of biblical prophecy in our time , and will call upon the Jews of Israel to accept Jesus into their hearts ; meanwhile , urging the president to nuke the evil empire of Islam .
From across America will be heard histrionic cries for fresh reinforcements , even a military draft .
Patriots will demand victory at any cost .
Pundits will scream for an escalation of the conflict .
A war that ostensibly began as an attempt to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons will teeter on the brink of their use .
Conclusion Friends , we must work together to prevent such a catastrophe .
We must stop the next Middle East war before it starts .
The US government must turn over to the United Nations the primary responsibility for resolving the deepening crisis in Iraq , and , immediately thereafter , withdraw US forces from the country .
We must also prevail upon the Israelis to sign the Nonproliferation Treaty ( NPT ) and open all of their nuclear sites to IAEA inspectors .
Only then can serious talks begin with Iran and other states to establish a nuclear weapon free zone ( NWFZ ) in the Mid East so essential to the region 's long - term peace and security .
10/26/04 " ICH " * Mark Gaffney 's first book , Dimona the Third Temple ? ( 1989 ) , was a pioneering study of Israel 's nuclear weapons program .
He has since published numerous important articles about the Mid-East with emphasis on nuclear proliferation issues .
Getting started with SSH
The following sections hope to provide enough information to setup a user new to ssh with the appropriate files necessary for accessing remote hosts in a secure manner .
Improvements to and comments about this document are welcome .
Updated :
The examples now show ssh version 2 commands , using OpenSSH .
There are several security vulnerabilities in protocol version 1 .
Everyone should have already migrated to version 2 by now , so it was about time for me to also reflect best practises in this document .
I also updated the link section at the end of the document to better reflect today ’s software selection .
Public key cryptography uses a public key to encrypt data and a private key to decrypt it .
The name public key comes from the fact that you can make the encryption key public without compromising the secrecy of the data or the decryption key .
What this means is that it is safe to send your public key ( i.e. the contents of the ~ /.ssh /id_rsa.pub file ) in electronic mail or by other means e.g. to have a system administrator of a remote site install that key into your ~/.ssh / authorized_keys file .
For anyone to actually gain access they need the corresponding private key ( i.e. the decrypted contents of ~ /.ssh / id_rsa ) to identify themselves .
To further protect your private key you should enter a passphrase to encrypt the key when it is stored in the filesystem .
This will prevent people from using it even if they gain access to your files .
The very first step is to use ssh - keygen to create an authentication key for yourself .
In most cases the defaults for this command are what you want .
Always , always , type in a good pass - phrase when prompted for one .
It can be multiple words ( i.e. spaces are just fine within the phrase ) , so you could choose a sentence that you can remember .
Changing some of the words by misspelling them or by changing some of the letters into digits is highly recommended to increase the strength of your pass phrase .
Here is a sample session , your input is in bold .
Note that the pass - phrase is not echoed back as you type it .
beowulf % ssh - keygen -t rsa Generating public / private rsa key pair .
Enter file in which to save the key ( /u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa ) : [ RETURN ]
Enter passphrase ( empty for no passphrase ) : 1 amp jumb3d Enter same passphrase again : 1 amp jumb3d
Your identification has been saved in /u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa .
Your public key has been saved in /u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa.pub .
The key fingerprint is : b7:18 :ad:3b:0b:50:5c:e1:da:2d:6f:5b:65:82:94:c5 kim@beowulf.gw.com
If you have multiple accounts you might want to create a separate key on each of them .
I have separate keys for
my office environment
my private systems
my Internet service provider ( ISP ) systems
my university account
This allows me to limit access between these organizations , e.g. not allowing the university account to access my ISP account or the machines in the office .
This enhances the overall security in case any of the authentication keys are compromised for some reason .
You can change the pass - phrase at any time by using the -p option of ssh - keygen .
beowulf % ssh - keygen -p
Enter file in which the key is ( /u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa ) : [ RETURN ]
Enter old passphrase : 1amp jumb3d Key has comment
'/u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa'
Enter new passphrase ( empty for no passphrase ) : cow 3ats grass
Enter same passphrase again : cow 3ats grass
Your identification has been saved with the new passphrase .
The pass - phrases are not echoed as you type them .
To allow access to a system for a given identity place the public key in your ~/.ssh / authorized_keys file on that system .
All keys listed in that file are allowed access .
Usually you will want to authorize access to the local system using the local key ( especially in an environment where multiple systems share the same home directory e.g. using NFS ) .
Thus a good start is to copy the public key for your default identity into the ~/.ssh / authorized_keys file .
beowulf % cd ~/.ssh beowulf % cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
You could now copy the ~/.ssh / authorized_keys file to other systems to allow access from the local system .
One way to copy the file is to use the scp command , like this :
beowulf % scp -p ~/.ssh/authorized_keys hrothgar:.ssh / kim@hrothgar 's password : YourPasswordHere authorized_keys 100 % 1839 1.2MB/s 00:00
As no identities have been authorized yet on the remote system , you will be asked for your regular login password as seen above .
It will not be echoed as you type it .
The Copying files between systems section has more information about scp .
Use a text editor to add more keys to the file .
If you use cut and paste to copy the key make sure each key entry is a single line in the file .
The keys to add are always the public keys ( from files with the .pub extension ) .
NOTE : To gain access to restricted systems you might need to send your public key in electronic mail to the administrator of the system .
Just include the contents of the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file in the message .
If access to the remote system is still denied you should check the permissions of the following files on it :
the home directory itself
the ~/.ssh directory
directory the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file
The permissions should allow writing only by you ( the owner ) .
This example shows the most relaxed permissions you could use .
hrothgar % cd hrothgar % ls - ld .
.ssh .ssh/authorized_keys drwxr-xr-x 36 kim kim 4096 Jul 25 02:24 .
drwxr-xr-x 2 kim kim 512 Apr 10 02:30 .ssh -rw-r--r-- 1 kim kim 1674 Apr 10 02:29 .ssh/authorized_keys
To make the remote system allow access you must change the permissions to disallow writing by others than the owner .
hrothgar % cd hrothgar % chmod go-w .
.ssh .ssh/authorized_keys
Remember to do this on all the systems you want to have access to .
To establish an interactive connection to a remote system you would use either the slogin or the ssh command .
The only parameter is the name of the remote system .
The pass - phrase is not echoed back to you when you type it .
beowulf % slogin hrothgar Enter passphrase for key '/u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa ' : 1 amp jumb3d Last login : Wed Jul 21 00:00:49 2004 from beowulf.gw.com [ more output from the remote machine ] hrothgar %
You can avoid the pass - phrase prompts by keeping the authentication keys in memory .
You only need to type the pass - phrase when you add a key into memory .
If your account name on the remote system differs from the one on the local system ( the system you are connecting from ) you can use the -l switch to specify the remote account name .
beowulf % slogin -l suominen panix.com Last login : Sun Jun 13 14:55:17 2004 from beowulf.gw.com [ more output from the remote machine ] panix %
You can change the default remote account name by creating a configuration file entry for the host .
If you frequently open connections to remote systems you can run your session under the ssh - agent .
The agent will provide decrypted authentication keys to all the commands when new connections are created .
When you start ssh - agent you need to provide it a command to spawn .
This is usually either your shell or a command to start a windowing environment .
When you exit the command all keys will be removed from memory .
beowulf % ssh - agent $ SHELL beowulf %
You will now need to add keys into memory to have them available for other commands .
If you have workstation where you start the X window system after logging in you can have the whole windowing environment benefit from the keys in memory .
The X window system is normally started with startx and the initial clients are in your ~/.xinitrc file .
beowulf % ssh - agent startx &
If your workstation has virtual consoles it is good to put the X window system in the background so the current virtual console can still be used for more commands if necessary .
It wo n’t hurt to background the command even without virtual consoles .
NOTE : Your system might have a non-standard way of starting the X window system .
Replace startx with the appropriate command if necessary .
Please ask your system administrator for the exact command to use .
If you use an X - terminal or your workstation is running xdm you need to arrange for the clients to run under ssh- agent .
The easiest way ( which is conveniently compatible with the method used without xdm ) is to put all initial clients into the ~/.xinitrc file which in turn is called from the ~/.xsession file .
An example ~/.xsession file is below .
It runs ssh - agent only if you have a ~/.ssh directory .
#!/bin/sh if [ -d $ HOME /.ssh ] then EXEC= " exec ssh- agent " else EXEC = " exec " fi if [ -x $ HOME /.xinitrc ] then $ EXEC $ HOME / .xinitrc else $ EXEC xterm - geometry 80x24+0-60 - ls fi
Make sure the files are executable .
The following command will change the permissions suitably .
beowulf % chmod a+x ~/.xinitrc ~/.xsession
NOTE : If you are using an X - terminal keep in mind that your session is most likely not secure .
Usually anything you type can be captured on the local area network you are connected to .
Before your connections can be authenticated without prompts for a pass - phrase you have to use ssh- add to add the necessary keys to memory .
To add the default key on the current system to memory no options are needed .
The pass - phrase is prompted for to decrypt the key .
It is not echoed back as you type it .
beowulf % ssh- add Enter passphrase for /u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa : 1amp jumb3d Identity added : /u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa
(/u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa)
You can specify the file that contains the key if you have other identities than the default .
You must use the private key file ( the one that does not have the .pub extension ) .
The -d option will have the key deleted from memory .
There is no ssh - delete command .
beowulf % ssh- add -d ~/.ssh/isp
To list all keys currently in memory use the -l option .
beowulf % ssh - add -l 1024 [ hex numbers ]
/u/kim/.ssh/id_rsa ( RSA ) 1024 [ hex numbers ]
/u/kim/.ssh/isp ( RSA )
You can delete all keys from memory at once with the - D option .
beowulf % ssh- add -D
This is useful if you have added keys into memory on remote systems and do n’t want to reconnect just to delete the keys .
The ssh command can also be used to run commands on remote systems without logging in .
The output of the command is displayed and control returns to the local system .
Here is an example which will display all the users logged in on the remote system .
beowulf % ssh hrothgar who christos ttyp8 Oct 17 20:42 ( milou ) beowulf %
If you are using the X Window System you can use this capability to start a terminal window to start an interactive session on the remote system .
beowulf % ssh -n hrothgar xterm & [ 1 ] 15866 beowulf %
Use the -n to prevent the remote system from trying to read from the terminal starting the xterm and put the process in the background .
A new window from the remote system should appear shortly on your display .
You can copy files from the local system to a remote system or vice versa , or even between two remote systems using the scp command .
To specify a file on a remote system simply prefix it with the name of the remote host followed by a colon .
If you leave off the filename of the copy or specify a directory only the name of the source file will be used .
An easy way of retrieving a copy of a remote file into the current directory while keeping the name of the source file is to use a single dot as the destination .
beowulf % scp -p hrothgar : aliases .
beowulf %
The -p option is not required .
It indicates that the modification and access times as well as modes of the source file should be preserved on the copy .
This is usually desirable .
You can copy several files in a single command if the destination is a directory .
beowulf % scp - p hrothgar:.login hrothgar:.logout panix.com :. beowulf %
Relative filenames resolve differently on the local system than on the remote system .
On the local system the current directory is assumed ( as usual with all commands ) .
On the remote system the command runs in the home directory !
Thus relative filenames will be relative to the home directory of the remote account .
NOTE : When you specify remote machines in both the source and the destination the connection to copy the files is made directly between those hosts .
The files are not copied through the local system .
Sometimes this makes a difference in a firewalled or otherwise restricted environment .
The defaults for the ssh - related commands can be altered for each account in a configuration file ~/.ssh / config ( there is also a system - wide file , usually / etc/ ssh / ssh_config ) .
Each entry starts with a Host keyword .
You can use wildcards to match all the appropriate systems :
? matches any single character
matches any single character * matches any sequence of zero or more characters
Usual keywords include ( defaults in parenthesis ) :
Compression yes / no ( no ) Controls whether compression is used on the connection .
CompressionLevel 1 - 9 ( 6 ) Level of compression : 1 is fastest , 9 is slowest ( achieves best compression ) .
Compression is good for slow links ( saves bandwidth ) and fast machines .
FallBackToRsh yes / no ( yes )
If a secure connection to the remote system cannot be established the commands can try unsecure connections ( a warning will be displayed if this happens ) .
On highly secure systems this could be disabled in the system - wide configuration .
KeepAlive yes / no ( yes ) Controls whether TCP keepalive messages are used .
When enabled it is possible to detect network outages and automatically close your connections ( which is good ) .
However , if you are connected over a dialup link that automatically dials when there is traffic , you will want to turn this off to avoid unnecessarily bringing up the line .
User account ( local account ) Specify the remote account name .
Add this to avoid having to use the -l option when issuing commands .
Here is an example ~/.ssh / config file .
Host * panix.com
User suominen Compression no Host * gw.com FallBackToRsh no Host * Compression yes CompressionLevel 9 FallBackToRsh yes KeepAlive no
Options are accumulated over entries , but a more specific entry will override a less specific one .
E.g. in the above compression will not be used for hosts that match * panix.com but will be used for hosts that match * gw.com ( and all other hosts since the * entry matches all hosts ) .
For a complete list of options please refer to the manual pages of both ssh and sshd .
« Boo Hoo | WILLisms.com | Ballot Boxes And Bullets » Taxes
In 1969 .
It 's already nearing the end of January once again , which , of course , means that tax day is just around the corner .
Income taxes and property taxes are bad enough as it is , but in recent weeks I have been paying closer attention to the little , constant taxes found in just about any sort of monthly bill .
Cable television , for example .
The taxes on my bundled cable , internet , and digital phone total thirty - seven dollars and ninety - seven cents .
$ 37.97 .
For the various local , state , and federal ( mostly federal ) taxes on that stuff .
Every single month .
PLUS another $ 1.19 for a " Municipal Telecommunications Surcharge . "
On the digital phone .
That 's the one that goes through the internet .
These are the sorts of fees that have been around forever , but too many people have begun to mentally incorporate them into some sort of monolithic cost concept of the good or service .
We should be mad , each and every time we see " oh , and by the way , we need 37 dollars and 97 cents extra in taxes , thanks a bunch " on a cable bill .
That should n't be normal .
Regardless of what Americans tell pollsters their most significant / pressing issue is ( sometimes it is terrorism , or Iraq , or health care , or whatever else is dominating the headlines that week ) , taxes will always be there .
People feel , intuitively , that they are overtaxed , no matter the tax bracket .
This is why it always baffles and delights me when liberals try to force the issue on taxes .
It 's sort of like that hilariously ill - advised Reggie Bush lateral / fumble in the 2006 Rose Bowl .
It just makes you scratch your head and go , " what on earth could that guy be thinking ? "
But press the issue they do .
Often .
Unlike Reggie Bush , however , Democrats are not very good at winning elections .
There 's a reason for that .
No matter how socially liberal some guy may be , no matter how outraged he is by all the trumped - up non-scandals in Washington , DC , how could anyone bring himself to vote for a candidate demanding substantially higher taxes ?
That 's the one campaign promise a politician will keep 100 % of the time .
But Democrats do just that -- call for higher taxes -- nearly every single election .
Some cloak it in the language of rolling back " irresponsible " tax cuts , as if there is some Constitutionally - mandated tax level from the days or yore , higher than where we are now .
Liberals today genuinely act as if we 're woefully undertaxed today .
The sales pitch for higher taxes also usually involves something about " tax cuts for the rich . "
Americans almost unanimously believe they are middle class ( a perception that is n't really all that off ) , so the occasional voter might fall for that lefty class warfare garbage .
But most of us have the basic cognitive capacity to reason thusly : A : I am not rich .
B : I got a tax cut .
C : So , that means either , I really am rich ( I 'm not ) , I did n't really get a tax cut ( I did ) , or that rich Democrat ( Kennedy , etc. ) does n't know what he is talking about .
Or worse , he is lying to me .
What a joke of a political party .
Most Americans are more than capable of connecting the dots .
Credibility is heck to earn and a breeze to burn .
The real question is : how much more credibility do these guys have left to burn ?
That 's a rhetorical question , but one answer is that they will have as much credibility as the left - dominated media grant them .
We must demolish the left - wing media establishment .
We must dismantle the Democrat - run death grip on information .
We must expose the socialist tendencies of America 's journalists .
That 's why we blog .
On taxes , for example .
One unfortunate side effect of America 's prevailing pecuniary practice of paycheck withholding is that many of us receive a check or direct deposit FROM the IRS for hundreds or thousands of dollars about this time of year .
When receiving gobs of money , it is easy to forget that they took way too much from us in the first place .
Today , we have Tax Freedom Day to remind us of just how much we have to work to pay off our taxes each year .
Last year it was April 17 .
Federal taxes alone took 70 days to pay off last year : Everybody is n't working for the weekend .
We 're working for Uncle Sam .
And Uncle Connecticut .
And Uncle New York .
And Uncle New Jersey .
And Uncle Massachusetts .
And all the other Uncles we did n't even know we had until we got rich enough to receive one of Bush 's tax cuts .
Once upon a time , there was no Tax Freedom Day , but there was this nifty bit of nostalgia ( .pdf ) : Some things never change .
As long as taxes are an issue in an election , tax - slashing Republicans will benefit over tax - loving Democrats .
From here to 2069 , and beyond .
Here 's a wake - up call :
The 2006 elections will be here in a flash .
Let 's quit the dilly - dallying .
Let 's quite worrying over this or that or the other .
In committee , let 's quit pretending Democrats have anything worthwhile ( or even remotely truthful ) to say on taxes .
[ I am appealing to you , Congressional Republicans . ]
In the public square , however , use their narrowly - crafted , base - rallying comments and votes against them .
Hoist them by their own collective petard , not just on their national security weakness , not just on their seething hypocrisy on the " corruption " issue , but on their tax - loving socialism , as well .
The truth is a powerful force .
Let 's use it .

Well done , i love how you write .
you should compile all your articles and make a book .
seriously , why not , i mean if tookie can get published ?!
Good work ,
Christian wells Posted by : christian at January 26 , 2006 09:21 PM
Wait a minute .
The Democrats say over and over again that Bush 's tax cuts were for the rich .
I got a tax cut .
By golly , I 'm rich !!!!
Woo hoo !!!

Bah !
You 've let me down , Will !
I usually LOVE your graphics for their ability to easily compare / contrast ideas in succinct ways ...
Maybe it 's just the way my brain works ( or does n't ) but comparing a Pie Chart whose numbers are in base 365 with a bar graph in base 8 , I lose the comparisons ...
Again , it may well be the way my brain works , because right now it 's saying " Mmmmmmmm ... Pie .... "
Now , which one of my freezers did I put my Ice Cream ...
Mr. Michael Posted by : Mr. Michael at January 27 , 2006 01:29 AM
I am beginning to figure this blog out .
Ken is the rational one and Will is the one completely out of touch with reality .
Let me put it to you this way friend .
I as an individual make say $ 70,000 a year .
But my expenses consistantly total $ 85,000 a year .
After 10 years my debt is $ 150,000 , ( not including interest ) .
As my total debt increases a larger and larger percentage of my expenditures ( I am already over spending mind you ) goes to pay the interest on my debt , so of the $ 85,000 I spend per year less and less annually goes to my expenses and more goes to servicing the debt , in effect making me poorer .
Now if you were my buddy and I shared this information with you what would your advice be ?
I would guess it would be to cut my expenses and to pay off the debt , maybe get a second job to make more money .
That would be the responsible thing to do .
What the GOP used to stand for was fiscal responsibility .
This is why I considered my self a moderate at one point .
I supported the GOP regarding fiscal responsibility and supported the democrats liberal social agenda .
This is no longer the case .
Now read carefully , this is the clincher .
I honestly believe that the current Grover Norquist engineered policy is to cause the government to completely fall flat on its face .
To make the situation so dire that the entire infrastructure of this country collapses .
There will be no way for the government to function so all social services collapse so the only role of government is protecting wealth and fighting wars .
A true Bush conservative would be familiar with the writings of Grover Norquist and essentially agree with this statement .
This is the goal .
Your average Joe who allows the GOP to create a social agenda rallying cry is completely ignorant to this .
How do you think the Gay marriage ban referenda ended up on so mayny ballots in swing states ?
Coincidence ?
Do you think they were placed there by Democrats ?
Also , to you recall how many terror alerts were issued in the months of October and November leading up to the election ?
Have n't had too many lately have we ?
Posted by : thomas at January 27 , 2006 08:00 AM
And if you have n't noticed , there are small but growing movements by congressional Reps right now trying to get back to fiscal responsibility .
Have you also noticed that since the tax cuts enacted by Bush , gov't tax receipts have acually gone up ?
Thomas , as a regular reader now of Willisms , you must be aware that one of the biggest financial issues of the next 25 years is Social Security .
What is your opinion on solutions for that ?
Posted by : Hoodlumman at January 27 , 2006 08:21 AM
Tax revenue increased substaintally in 2005 ..
This is true .
But this was was mostly related to an increase in tax receipts from the corporate sector of the tax base , not from the individual .
Take a look at this for a more detailed discription .
http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/TaxFacts/TFDB/TFTemplate.cfm?Docid=203
Tax revenue is going to increase as the economy grows .
To say this is due to tax cuts only is irresponsible .
We have not had negative economic growth in this country in decades .
However , I do not argue that the tax cuts and massive spending have helped the economy .
Any time the government goes into debt to put money into the economy or the pockets of political contributors , it is going to have an effect .
Look at what WWII or the TVA did for the economy .

Not to dodge the question of Social Security .
i think there are only two options really since private accounts would do nothing to address the pending crisis .
1 . Increase the SS taxes on current workers and reduce the benefits to all future retirees .
2 . Reduce the number of future retirees , by converting them to Soylent Green .

Wow , Thomas .
You should start reading some Willisms archives .
Maybe start here .
Your option for SS salvation is 100 % unacceptable .
And what might cause a large increase in corporate tax receipts ?
Your tax cut spin rings hollow here .
Had the tax cuts not been implemented , the economy might have been more sluggish and slow to recover and then all we'd here is how " worthless " the overall economy is these days .

That link does n't show many anything i do n't freely admit .
There is going to be a problem .
I also admit that tax cuts spur the economy .
So we seem to be in agreement on most issues .
However , big problem is that regardless of the increasing tax revenues , we also have this issue of increasing national debt and budget deficit .
Unless you , like Cheney , think that deficits do n't matter we still have a problem here .

I was n't pointed to that article specifically .
But at the bottom of each Reform Thursday , Will links all previous topics .
Those archives have tons of data , ideas , solutions and insights on the current problem .
Deficits are a problem .
And they key , from my position is slapping the Republican party back in line .
Given the Dems lack of seriousness regarding national security and terrorism , they are not a viable option .
And financially , they 'll spend the same , if not more than the Republicans , but will go ahead and pump up taxes as much as they can get away with .
They 're the party that even calls decreases in the percentage increase of spending " cut backs . "
That is deceptive and , quite frankly , a joke .

" Given the Dems lack of seriousness regarding national security and terrorism " I see the GOP 's propaganda machine has you hooked and reeled in .
Do you think Tom Delay 's critism of Clinton when he was trying to take out Bin Laden was based on true National Security concerns or was he simply taking any opportunity he could find to try to discredit Clinton instead of concentrating on defending our national security ?
Posted by : thomas at January 27 , 2006 11:05 AM
So it 's Delay 's fault that Clinton did n't nab Bin Laden ??
" WILL YOU GUYS EVER STOP TALKING ABOUT CLINTON !?!? "

It is a sad truth that the CinC bears a lonely burden in the foreign policy arena and often is subject to unfair grandstanding by political enemies .
It is a fact that clinton had several opportunities to take out bin laden and either passed on them or blew them .
It is a fact that clinton as CinC was privy to a huge amount of information about the murderous intent and capabilities of our radical islamist enemies that most of us never will know .
It also is factual that the level of vitriol heaped upon the current administration for its real war on terror was not matched by the same level of vitriol for the former president for his inadequate response .

As long as it is " unconscionable " for the government to reduce the overall aid rendered for failure of individual responsibility , taxes will always be " too low " .
It pains me to say this but I believe that Republicans are just as guilty of catering to the politically needy .
They can't bring themselves to say " NO " .
Besides , the tax burden has been ( largely ) passed squarely to small businesses .
Individuals do n't recognize the tax burden because they never see the money anyway .
It 's like the frog in the cool pan of water .
The heat is being increased but individuals wo n't recognize that they 're boiling until it is too late .

Ms. Gabor ,
Please be specific in stating which facts I am arguing with my MSM biased opinion .
Is stating the tax cuts are not being off set with spending cuts inaccurate ?

Conrad Parker Boids
I have been interested in the field known as Artificial Life for a number of years .
One of the most beautiful findings of this field is a very simple algorithm known as boids , which models flocking behaviour in nature .
This algorithm was invented by computer animator Craig Reynolds .
In 1996 I wrote an example of this algorithm as a Java applet , which continues to be quite popular .
The algorithm models the behaviour of flocking animals ( eg. birds ) by simple rules which describe only the behaviour of individuals .
For a full explanation and an informative history of this algorithm see Craig Reynolds ' boids page .
Briefly , the rules are :
Boids try to fly towards the centre of mass of neighbouring boids .
Boids try to keep a small distance away from other objects ( including other boids ) .
Boids try to match velocity with near boids .
If you would like to learn more about how these rules are implemented , I have written a programming explanation with accompanying pseudocode .
Here is my Java based example of the model :
A nicely laid out version of this is here , and for your viewing pleasure , a larger version is also available .
Oh , and now one set at Coogee Beach .
xboids
Download the Java classes
You can also download the Java classes and a sample html file : Boids.tar.gz or Boids.zip
Other implementations
Todd Warner has made an implementation in Python based on the above pseudocode .
It is available ( under the GNU GPL ) at http://www.dma.org/~tw/pyboids/.
Jonathon Crane has written a javascript / DHTML version of this , and I 've adapted it here with flocking yellow triangles .
Jonathon 's code implements ants crawling around ; you can see and play with at : http://feastofbeats.co.uk/boids/index.html
Jeff Foster implement this flocking behaviour in Clojure .
Yay functional programming !
An interesting parallel to this theory is that proposed by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene .
His theory , which he describes in the context of accounting for the evolution of pack behaviour , is as follows :
A simple strategy for a predator animal is to chase the closest prey animal in its vicinity .
This is reasonable because it expends the least amount of effort for the predator .
Then a strategy for a prey individual is to try to keep as far away from predators as possible : if predators only attack the closest prey individuals , then all the others should be safe .
You can consider each prey individual as having a " domain of danger " surrounding it .
This is the area around it comprising the points around it to which it is the closest prey .
For example , a lone individual would have a " domain of danger " which is a large circle around it , whereas each individual in a pack would have a small " domain of danger " around it .
Then the strategy is to reduce the " domain of danger " as much as possible .
This is achieved in the pack formation , where all the prey individuals try to stay together , each one of them selfishly trying to reduce its own " domain of danger " .
However , the individuals on the edges of the pack have a much greater " domain of danger " than those in the interior .
Thus , the individuals on the edge of the pack try to move towards the interior of the pack , which moves other individuals to the edges .
This strategy correlates well with the boids rules .
Each individual boid tries to move towards the centre of mass of the pack , which very simply implements the reduction of the " domain of danger " .
Of course , they cannot all move to the very centre : there is a limit to the closeness of individuals , such that they all have enough room to move .
This is also implemented as a rule for Boids .

[ This article is excerpted from chapter 7 of How Capitalism Saved America . ]
Free - market capitalism is a network of free and voluntary exchanges in which producers work , produce , and exchange their products for the products of others through prices voluntarily arrived at .
State capitalism consists of one or more groups making use of the coercive apparatus of the government … for themselves by expropriating the production of others by force and violence .
— Murray N. Rothbard , The Logic of Action ( 1997 )
The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are often referred to as the time of the " robber barons . "
It is a staple of history books to attach this derogatory phrase to such figures as John D. Rockefeller , Cornelius Vanderbilt , and the great nineteenth - century railroad operators — Grenville Dodge , Leland Stanford , Henry Villard , James J. Hill , and others .
To most historians writing on this period , these entrepreneurs committed thinly veiled acts of larceny to enrich themselves at the expense of their customers .
Once again we see the image of the greedy , exploitative capitalist , but in many cases this is a distortion of the truth .
As common as it is to speak of " robber barons , " most who use that term are confused about the role of capitalism in the American economy and fail to make an important distinction — the distinction between what might be called a market entrepreneur and a political entrepreneur .
A pure market entrepreneur , or capitalist , succeeds financially by selling a newer , better , or less expensive product on the free market without any government subsidies , direct or indirect .
The key to his success as a capitalist is his ability to please the consumer , for in a capitalist society the consumer ultimately calls the economic shots .
By contrast , a political entrepreneur succeeds primarily by influencing government to subsidize his business or industry , or to enact legislation or regulation that harms his competitors .
In the mousetrap industry , for instance , you can be a market entrepreneur by making better mousetraps and thereby convincing consumers to buy more of your mousetraps and less of your competitors ' , or you can lobby Congress to prohibit the importation of all foreign - made mousetraps .
In the former situation the consumer voluntarily hands over his money for the superior mousetrap ; in the latter case the consumer , not given anything ( better ) in return , pays more for existing mousetraps just because the import quota has reduced supply and therefore driven up prices .
The American economy has always included a mix of market and political entrepreneurs — self - made men and women as well as political connivers and manipulators .
And sometimes , people who have achieved success as market entrepreneurs in one period of their lives later become political entrepreneurs .
But the distinction between the two is critical to make , for market entrepreneurship is a hallmark of genuine capitalism , whereas political entrepreneurship is not — it is neomercantilism .
In some cases , of course , the entrepreneurs commonly labeled " robber barons " did indeed profit by exploiting American customers , but these were not market entrepreneurs .
For example , Leland Stanford , a former governor and US senator from California , used his political connections to have the state pass laws prohibiting competition for his Central Pacific railroad , and he and his business partners profited from this monopoly scheme .
Unfortunately , the resentment that this naturally generated among the public was unfairly directed at other entrepreneurs who succeeded in the railroad industry without political interference that tilted the playing field in their direction .
Thanks to historians who fail to ( or refuse to ) make this crucial distinction , many Americans have an inaccurate view of American capitalism .
How to Build a Railroad
Most business historians have assumed that the transcontinental railroads would never have been built without government subsidies .
The free market would have failed to provide the adequate capital , or so the theory asserts .
The evidence for this theory is that the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads , which were completed in the years after the War Between the States , received per-mile subsidies from the federal government in the form of low - interest loans as well as massive land grants .
But there need not be cause and effect here : the subsidies were not needed to cause the transcontinental railroads to be built .
We know this because , just as many roads and canals were privately financed in the early nineteenth century , a market entrepreneur built his own transcontinental railroad .
James J. Hill built the Great Northern Railroad " without any government aid , even the right of way , through hundreds of miles of public lands , being paid for in cash , " as Hill himself stated .
Quite naturally , Hill strongly opposed government favors to his competitors : " The government should not furnish capital to these companies , in addition to their enormous land subsidies , to enable them to conduct their business in competition with enterprises that have received no aid from the public treasury , " he wrote .
This may sound quaint by today 's standards , but it was still a hotly debated issue in the late nineteenth century .
James J. Hill was hardly a " baron " or aristocrat .
His father died when he was fourteen , so he dropped out of school to work in a grocery store for four dollars a month to help support his widowed mother .
As a young adult he worked in the farming , shipping , steamship , fur - trading , and railroad industries .
He learned the ways of business in these settings , saved his money , and eventually became an investor and manager of his own enterprises .
( It was much easier to accomplish such things in the days before income taxation . )
Hill got his start in the railroad business when he and several partners purchased a bankrupted Minnesota railroad that had been run into the ground by the government - subsidized Northern Pacific ( NP ) .
The NP had been a patronage " reward " to financier Jay Cooke , who in the War Between the States had been one of the Union 's leading financiers .
But Cooke and his NP associates built recklessly ; the government 's subsidies and land grants were issued on a per - mile - of - track basis , so Cooke and his cohorts had strong incentives to build as quickly as possible , which only encouraged shoddy work .
Consequently , by 1873 the NP developers had fallen into bankruptcy .
The people of Minnesota and the Dakotas , where the railroad was being built , considered Cooke and his business associates to be " derelicts at best and thieves at worst , " writes Hill biographer Michael P. Malone .
It took Hill and his business partners five years to complete the purchase of the railroad ( the St. Paul , Minneapolis , and Manitoba ) , which would form the nucleus of a road that he would eventually build all the way to the Pacific ( the Great Northern ) .
He had nothing but contempt for Cooke and the NP for their shady practices and corruption , and he quickly demonstrated a genius for railroad construction .
Under his direction , the workers began laying rails twice as quickly as the NP crews had , and even at that speed he built what everyone at the time considered to be the highest - quality line .
Hill micromanaged every aspect of the work , even going so far as to spell workers so they could take much - needed coffee breaks .
His efficiency extended into meticulous cost cutting .
He passed his cost reductions on to his customers in the form of lower rates because he knew that the farmers , miners , timber interests , and others who used his rail services would succeed or fail along with him .
His motto was : " We have got to prosper with you or we have got to be poor with you . "
In keeping with his philosophy of encouraging the prosperity of the people residing in the vicinity of his railroad , Hill publicized his views on the importance of crop diversification to the farmers of the region .
He did n't want them to become dependent on a single crop and therefore subject to the uncertainties of price fluctuation , as the southern cotton farmers were .
Hill also provided free seed grain — and even cattle — to farmers who had suffered from drought and depression ; stockpiled wood and other fuel near his train depots so farmers could stock up when returning from a delivery to his trains ; and donated land to towns for parks , schools , and churches .
He transported immigrants to the Great Plains for a mere ten dollars if they promised to farm near his railroad , and he sponsored contests for the beefiest livestock or the most abundant wheat .
His " model farms " educated farmers on the latest developments in agricultural science .
All of this generated goodwill with the local communities and was also good for business .
Hill 's rates fell steadily , and when farmers began complaining about the lack of grain storage space , he instructed his company managers to build larger storage facilities near his rail depots .
He refused to join in attempts at cartel price fixing and in fact " gloried in the role of rate - slasher and disrupter of [ price - fixing ] pooling agreements , " writes historian Burton Folsom .
After all , he knew that monopolistic pricing would have been an act of killing the goose that lays the golden egg .
In building his transcontinental railroad , from 1886 to 1893 , Hill applied the same strategy that he had in building the St. Paul , Minneapolis , and Manitoba : careful building of the road combined with the economic cultivation of the nearby communities .
He always built for durability and efficiency , not scenery , as was sometimes the case with the government - subsidized railroads .
He did not skimp on building materials , having witnessed what harsh Midwest winters could do to his facilities and how foolish it was for the NP to have ignored this lesson .
( The solid granite arch bridge that Hill built across the Mississippi River was a Minneapolis landmark for many years . )
Burton Folsom describes
Hill 's compulsion for excellence :
Hill 's quest for short routes , low grades , and few curvatures was an obsession .
In 1889 , Hill conquered the Rocky Mountains by finding the legendary Marias Pass .
Lewis and Clark had described a low pass through the Rockies back in 1805 ; but later no one seemed to know whether it really existed or , if it did , where it was .
Hill wanted the best gradient so much that he hired a man to spend months searching western Montana for this legendary pass .
He did in fact find it , and the ecstatic Hill shortened his route by almost one hundred miles .
Hill 's Great Northern was , consequently , the " best constructed and most profitable of all the world 's major railroads , " as Michael P. Malone points out .
The Great Northern 's efficiency and profitability were legendary , whereas the government - subsidized railroads , managed by a group of political entrepreneurs who focused more on acquiring subsidies than on building sound railroads , were inefficiently built and operated .
Jay Cooke was not the only one whose government - subsidized railroad ended up in bankruptcy .
In fact , Hill 's Great Northern was the only transcontinental railroad that never went bankrupt .
James J. Hill versus the Real Robber Barons
By the summer of 1861 , after the Battle of First Manassas , it was apparent to all that the War Between the States was going to be a long drawn - out campaign .
Nevertheless , in 1862 Congress , with the southern Democrats gone , diverted millions of dollars from the war effort to begin building a subsidized railroad .
The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 created the Union Pacific ( UP ) and the Central Pacific ( CP ) railroads , the latter to commence building in Sacramento , California , and the former in Omaha , Nebraska .
For each mile of track built Congress gave these companies a section of land — most of which would be sold — as well as a sizable loan : $ 16,000 per mile for track built on flat prairie land ; $ 32,000 for hilly terrain ; and $ 48,000 in the mountains .
As was the case with Jay Cooke 's Northern Pacific , these railroads tried to build as quickly and as cheaply as possible in order to take advantage of the governmental largesse .
Where James J. Hill would be obsessed with finding the shortest route for his railroad , these government - subsidized companies , knowing they were paid by the mile , " sometimes built winding , circuitous roads to collect for more mileage , " as Burton Folsom recounts .
Union Pacific vice president and general manager Thomas Durant " stressed speed , not workmanship , " writes Folsom , which meant that he and his chief engineer , former Union Army genera1 Grenville Dodge , often used whatever kind of wood was available for railroad ties , including fragile cottonwood .
This , of course , is in stark contrast to James J. Hill 's insistence on using only the best - quality materials , even if they were more expensive .
Durant paid so many lumberjacks to cut trees for rails that farmers were forced to use rifles to defend their land from the subsidized railroad builders ; not for him was the Hill motto , " We have got to prosper with you or we have got to be poor with you . "
Folsom continues :
Since Dodge was in a hurry , he laid track on the ice and snow … .
Naturally , the line had to be rebuilt in the spring .
What was worse , unanticipated spring flooding along the lower fork of the Platte River washed out rails , bridges , and telephone poles , doing at least $ 50,000 damage the first year .
No wonder some observers estimated the actual building cost at almost three times what it should have been .
In 1869 , after seven years of construction , the two subsidized railroads managed to meet up at Promontory Point , Utah , amidst much hoopla and celebration .
What is not often mentioned , however , is that after the big celebration both of the lines had to be rebuilt and even relocated in places , a task that took five more years ( into 1874 ) .
The wasteful costs of construction were astonishing .
The subsidized railroads routinely used more gunpowder blasting their way through mountains and forests on a single day than was used during the entire Battle of Gettysburg .
With so much tax money floating around , the executives of the CP and UP stole funds from their own companies in order to profit personally , something that would have been irrational for James J. Hill or any other private , market entrepreneur to do .
For example , the UP managers created their own coal company , mining coal for two dollars per ton and selling it to themselves for six dollars per ton , pocketing the profits .
This crooked scam was repeated in dozens of instances and would be exposed as the Crédit Mobilier scandal .
( Crédit Mobilier was the name of one of the companies run by UP executives . )
With virtually everything riding on political connections , as opposed to creating the best - quality railroad for consumers , the UP and CP executives naturally spent an inordinate amount of time on politics as opposed to business management .
While James J. Hill detested politicians and politics and paid little attention to them , things were very different with the UP .
Folsom explains :
In 1866 Thomas Durant wined and dined " prominent citizens " ( including senators , an ambassador , and government bureaucrats ) along a completed section of the railroad .
He hired an orchestra , a caterer , six cooks , a magician ( to pull subsidies out of a hat ? ) , and a photographer .
For those with ecumenical palates , he served Chinese duck and Roman goose ; the more adventurous were offered roast ox and antelope .
All could have expensive wine and , for dessert , strawberries , peaches , and cherries .
After dinner some of the men hunted buffalo from their coaches .
Durant hoped that all would go back to Washington inclined to repay the UP for its hospitality .
In addition , free railroad passes and Crédit Mobilier stock were routinely handed out to members of Congress and state legislators , and General William Tecumseh Sherman was sold land near Omaha , Nebraska , for $ 2.50 an acre when the going rate was $ 8.00 .
Congress responded to the 1874 Crédit Mobilier scandal by enacting a blizzard of regulations on the UP and CP that would in the future make it impossible for them to operate with any semblance of efficiency .
Because of the regulations , managers could not make quick decisions regarding leasing , borrowing money , building extensions of the rail lines , or any other day - to - day business decision .
Each such decision literally required an act of Congress .
Political interference also meant that separate rail lines were required to be built to serve communities represented by influential members of Congress even if those lines were uneconomical .
No business could possibly survive and earn a profit under such a scenario .
The UP went bankrupt in 1893 ; the Great Northern , on the other hand , was still going strong .
Not having accepted any government subsidies , James J. Hill was free to build and operate his railroad in a way that he deemed was most efficient and most profitable .
He prospered while most of his subsidized competitors went bankrupt at one point or another .
Hill continued to show how effective market entrepreneurs could be .
Having completed the Great Northern , he then got into the steamship business in order to facilitate American exports to the Orient .
As usual , he succeeded , increasing American exports to Japan sevenfold from 1896 to 1905 .
He continued to reduce his rail rates in order to make American exports profitable .
Being an ardent free trader , Hill was a Democrat for most of his life , because the Republican Party since the time of Lincoln had been the main political force behind high protectionist tariffs .
( He switched parties late in life when the Democratic Party abandoned its laissez - faire roots and became interventionist , but he considered the Republican Party to be merely the lesser of two evils . )
Recognizing a market in the American Midwest for timber from the Northwest , Hill convinced his next - door neighbor , Frederick Weyerhauser , to get into the timber business with him .
He cut his freight charges from ninety to forty cents per hundred pounds , and he and Weyerhauser prospered by selling Northwest timber to other parts of the country .
Despite the quality services and reduced costs that Hill brought to Americans , he would be unfairly lumped in with the political entrepreneurs who were fleecing the taxpayers and consumers .
The public eventually began complaining of the monopoly pricing and corruption that were inherent features of the government - created and - subsidized railroads .
The federal government responded to the complaints with the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 , which was supposed to ban rail rate discrimination , and later with the Hepburn Act of 1906 which made it illegal to charge different rates to different customers .
What these two federal laws did was to outlaw Hill 's price cutting by forcing railroads to charge everyone the same high rates .
This was all done in the name of consumer protection , giving it an Orwellian aura .
This new round of government regulation benefited the government - subsidized railroads at Hill 's expense , for he was the most vigorous price cutter .
His trade to the Orient was severely damaged since he could no longer legally offer discounts on exports in order to induce American exporters to join with him in entering as foreign markets .
He eventually got out of the steamship business altogether , and as a result untold opportunities to export American products abroad were lost forever .
The Interstate Commerce Commission soon created a bureaucratic monstrosity that attempted to micromanage all aspects of the railroad business , hampering its efficiency even further .
This was a classic example of economist Ludwig von Mises 's theory of government interventionism : one intervention ( such as subsidies for railroads ) leads to market distortions which create problems for which the public " demands " solutions .
Government responds with even more interventions , usually in the form of more regulation of business activities , which cause even more problems , which lead to more intervention , and on and on .
The end result is that free - market capitalism is more and more heavily stifled by regulation .
And on top of that , usually the free market , not government intervention , gets the blame .
Thus , all of the railroad men of the late nineteenth century have gone down in history as " robber barons " although this designation definitely does not apply to James J. Hill .
It does apply to his subsidized competitors , who deserve all the condemnation that history has provided them .
( Also deserving of condemnation are the politicians who subsidized them , enabling their monopoly and corruption . )
Oily Characters ?
Another prime example of a market entrepreneur whom generations of writers and historians have inaccurately portrayed — indeed , demonized — is John D. Rockefeller .
Like James J. Hill , Rockefeller came from very modest beginnings ; his father was a peddler who barely made ends meet .
Born in 1839 , he was one of six children , and his first job on graduating from high school at age sixteen was as an assistant bookkeeper for fifteen cents a day ( under ten dollars a day today , even accounting for nearly 150 years of inflation ) .
Rockefeller was religious about working and saving his money .
After working several sales jobs by age twenty - three he had saved up enough to invest four thousand dollars in an oil refinery in Cleveland , Ohio , with a business partner and fellow church member , Samuel Andrews .
Like James J. Hill , Rockefeller paid meticulous attention to every detail of his business , constantly striving to cut his costs , improve his product , and expand his line of products .
He also sometimes joined in with the manual laborers as a means of developing an even more thorough understanding of his business .
His business partners and managers emulated him , which drove the company to great success .
As economist Dominick Armentano writes , the firm of Rockefeller , Andrews , and Flagler , which would become Standard Oil ,
prospered quickly in the intensely competitive industry due to the economic excellence of its entire operations .
Instead of buying oil from jobbers , they made the jobbers ' profit by sending their own purchasing men into the oil region .
They also made their own sulfuric acid , barrels , lumber , wagons , and glue .
They kept minute and accurate records of every item from rivets to barrel bungs .
They built elaborate storage facilities near their refineries .
Rockefeller bargained as shrewdly for crude as anyone has before or since ; and Sam Andrews coaxed more kerosene from a barrel of crude than the competition could .
In addition , the Rockefeller firm put out the cleanest burning kerosene and managed to profitably dispose of most of the residues , in the form of lubricating oil , paraffin wax , and Vaseline .
Rockefeller pioneered the practice known as " vertical integration , " or in - house provision of various inputs into the production process ; that is , he made his own barrels , wagons , and so on .
This is not always advantageous — sometimes it pays to purchase certain items from specialists who can produce those items at very low cost .
But vertical integration has the advantage of allowing one to monitor the quality of one 's own inputs .
It has the further advantage of avoiding what modern economists call the " hold - up problem . "
If , say , an electric power plant contracted with a nearby coal mine for coal to fuel its generating plant , the coal mine might effectively break its contract at one point by demanding more money for its coal .
In such instances the power plant has the choice of paying up , engaging in costly litigation , or going without the coal and closing down .
None of these options is attractive .
But if the power plant simply buys the coal mine , all of these problems disappear .
That is what Rockefeller , the compulsive micromanager , did with many aspects of the oil - refining business .
He reduced his costs and avoided hold - up problems through vertical integration .
Rockefeller also devised means of eliminating much of the incredible waste that had plagued the oil industry .
His chemists figured out how to produce such oil byproducts as lubricating oil , gasoline , paraffin wax , Vaseline , paint , varnish , and about three hundred other substances .
In each instance he profited by eliminating waste .
Just as James J. Hill spent the extra money to build the highest quality railroad lines possible , Rockefeller did not skimp in building his refineries .
So confident was he of the safety of his operations that he did not even purchase insurance .
Rockefeller also made the oil - refining industry much more efficient .
There had been vast overinvestment in the oil industry in its first decades , as everyone had wanted to get rich quick in the business .
Northwestern Pennsylvania , where the first oil well had been drilled , was littered with oil derricks and refineries of all sizes , many of which were operated by men who really should have been in another line of work .
Rockefeller purchased many of these poorly managed operations and put their assets to far better use .
There was never any threat that these " horizontal mergers " — the combination of two firms that are in the same business — would create a monopoly , for Standard Oil had literally hundreds of competitors , including such oil giants as Sun Oil , not to mention its many large competitors in international markets .
One of Rockefeller 's harshest critics was journalist Ida Tarbell , whose brother was the treasurer of the Pure Oil Company , which could not compete with Standard Oil 's low prices .
She published a series of hypercritical articles in McClure 's magazine in 1902 and 1903 , which were turned into a book entitled The History of the Standard Oil Company , a classic of antibusiness propaganda .
Tarbell 's writings are emotional , often illogical , and lacking in any serious attempt at economic analysis .
But even she was compelled to praise what she called the " marvelous " economy of the entire Standard Oil operation .
In a passage describing one aspect of Standard Oil 's vertical integration she wrote :
Not far away from the canning works , on Newtown Creek , is an oil refinery .
This oil runs to the canning works , and , as the newmade cans come down by a chute from the works above , where they have just been finished , they are filled , twelve at a time , with the oil made a few miles away .
The filling apparatus is admirable
As the newmade cans come down the chute they are distributed , twelve in a row , along one side of a turn - table .
The turn - table is revolved , and the cans come directly under twelve measures , each holding five gallons of oil — a turn of a valve , and the cans are full .
The table is turned a quarter , and while twelve more cans are filled and twelve fresh ones are distributed , four men with soldering cappers put the caps on the first set … .
The cans are placed at once in wooden boxes standing ready , and , after a twenty - four - hour wait for discovering leaks are nailed up and carted to a nearby door .
This door opens on the river , and there at anchor by the side of the factory is a vessel chartered for South America or China … waiting to receive the cans … .
It is a marvelous example of economy , not only in materials , but in time and footsteps [ emphasis added ] .
Because of Standard Oil 's superior efficiency ( and lower prices ) , the company 's share of the refined petroleum market rose from 4 percent in 1870 to 25 percent in 1874 and to about 85 percent in 1880 .
As Standard Oil garnered more and more business , it became even more efficient through " economies of scale " — the tendency of per-unit costs to decline as the volume of output increases .
This is typical of industries in which there is a large initial " fixed cost " — such as the expense involved in building an oil refinery .
Once the refinery is built , the costs of maintaining the refinery are more or less fixed , so as more and more customers are added , the cost per customer declines .
As a result , the company cut its cost of refining a gallon of oil from 3 cents in 1869 to less than half a cent by 1885 .
Significantly , Rockefeller passed these savings along to the consumer , as the price of refined oil plummeted from more than 30 cents per gallon in 1869 to 10 cents in 1874 and 8 cents in 1885 .
Because he could refine kerosene far more cheaply than anyone else could , which was reflected in his low prices , the railroads offered Rockefeller special low prices , or volume discounts .
This is a common , ordinary business practice — offering volume discounts to one 's largest customers in order to keep them — but Rockefeller 's less efficient competitors complained bitterly .
Nothing was stopping them from cutting their costs and prices and winning similar railroad rebates other than their own inabilities or laziness , but they apparently decided that it was easier to complain about Rockefeller 's " unfair advantage " instead .
Cornelius Vanderbilt publicly offered railroad rebates to any oil refiner who could give him the same volume of business that Rockefeller did , but since no one was as efficient as Rockefeller , no one could take him up on his offer .
All of Rockefeller 's savings benefited the consumer , as his low prices made kerosene readily available to Americans .
Indeed , in the 1870s kerosene replaced whale oil as the primary source of fuel for light in America .
It might seem trivial today , but this revolutionized the American way of life ; as Burton Folsom writes , " Working and reading became after - dark activities new to most Americans in the 1870s . "
In addition , by stimulating the demand for kerosene and other products , Rockefeller also created thousands upon thousands of new jobs in the oil and related industries .
Rockefeller was extremely generous with his employees , usually paying them significantly more than the competition did .
Consequently , he was rarely slowed down by strikes or labor disputes .
He also believed in rewarding his most innovative managers with bonuses and paid time off if they came up with good ideas for productivity improvements , a simple lesson that many modern corporations seem never to have learned .
Of course , in every industry the less efficient competitors can be expected to snipe at their superior rivals , and in many instances sniping turns into an organized political crusade to get the government to enact laws or regulations that harm the superior competitor .
Economists call this process " rent seeking " ; in the language of economics , " rent " means a financial return on an investment or activity in excess of what the activity would normally bring in a competitive market .
This sort of political crusade by less successful rivals is precisely what crippled the great Rockefeller organization .
The governmental vehicle that was chosen to cripple Standard Oil was antitrust regulation .
Standard Oil 's competitors succeeded in getting the federal government to bring an antitrust or antimonopoly suit against the company in 1906 , after they had persuaded a number of states to file similar suits in the previous two or three years .
The ostensible purpose of antitrust regulation is to protect consumers , so on the face of it the government 's case against Standard Oil seems ludicrous .
Because of Standard Oil 's tremendous efficiencies , the price of refined petroleum had been plummeting for several decades , generating great benefits for consumers and forcing all other competitors to find ways to cut their costs and prices in order to survive .
Product quality had improved , innovation was encouraged by the fierce competition , production had expanded dramatically , and there were hundreds of competitors .
None of these facts constitutes in any way a sign of monopoly .
As happens in so many federal antitrust lawsuits , a number of novel theories were invented to rationalize the lawsuit .
One of them was so - called predatory pricing .
According to this theory , a " predatory firm " that possesses a " war chest " of profits will cut its prices so low as to drive all competitors from the market .
Then , when it faces no competition , it will charge monopolistic prices .
It is assumed that at that point no other competition will emerge , despite the large profits being made in the industry .
Journalist Ida Tarbell did as much as anyone to popularize this theory in her book on Standard Oil , in a chapter entitled " Cutting to Kill . "
To economists , however , predatory pricing is theoretical nonsense and has no empirical validity , either .
It has never been demonstrated that a monopoly has ever been created in this way .
Certainly predatory pricing was not a tactic used by Standard Oil , which was never a monopoly anyway .
In a now - classic article on the topic in the prestigious Journal of Law and Economics , John S. McGee studied the Standard Oil antitrust case and concluded not only that the company did not practice predatory pricing but also that it would have been irrational and foolish to have attempted such a scheme .
And whatever else may be said about John D. Rockefeller , he was no one 's fool .
McGee was quite right about the irrationality of predatory pricing .
As an investment strategy , predatory pricing is all cost and risk and no potential reward .
The would - be " predator " stands to lose the most from pricing below its average cost , since , presumably , it already does the most business .
If the company is the market leader with the highest sales and is losing money on each sale , then that company will be the biggest loser in the industry .
There is also great uncertainty about how long such a tactic could take : ten years ?
twenty years ?
No business would intentionally lose money on every sale for years on end with the pie - in - the - sky hope of someday becoming a monopoly .
Besides , even if that were to occur , nothing would stop new competitors from all over the world from entering the industry and driving the price back down , thereby eliminating any benefits of the predatory pricing strategy .
Finally , there is a logical contradiction in the theory .
The theory assumes a " war chest " of profits that is used to subsidize the money - losing strategy of predatory pricing .
But where did this war chest come from ?
The theory posits that predatory pricing is what creates a war chest of " monopoly profits , " but at the same time it simply assumes that these profits already exist !
After examining some eleven thousand pages of the Standard Oil case 's trial record , McGee concluded that there was no evidence at all presented at trial that Standard Oil had even attempted to practice predatory pricing .
What it did practice was good old competitive price cutting , driven by its quest for efficiency and customer service .
The antitrust case against Standard Oil also seems absurd because its share of the petroleum products market had actually dropped significantly over the years .
From a high of 88 percent in 1890 , Standard Oil 's market share had fallen to 64 percent by 1911 , the year in which the US Supreme Court reaffirmed the lower court finding that Standard Oil was guilty of monopolizing the petroleum products industry .
The court argued , in essence , that Standard Oil was a " large " company with many divisions , and if those divisions were in reality separate companies , there would be more competition .
The court made no mention at all of the industry 's economic performance ; of supposed predatory pricing ; of whether industry output had been restrained , as monopoly theory holds ; or of any other economic factors relevant to determining harm to consumers .
The mere fact that Standard Oil had organized some thirty separate divisions under one consolidated management structure ( a trust ) was sufficient reason to label it a monopoly and force the company to break up into a number of smaller units .
In other words , the organizational structure that was responsible for the company 's great efficiencies and decades - long price cutting and product improving was seriously damaged .
Standard
Oil became much less efficient as a result , to the benefit of its less efficient rivals and to the detriment of consumers .
Standard Oil 's competitors , who with their behind - the - scenes lobbying were the main instigators of the federal prosecution , are ( along with " muckraking " journalists like Ida Tarbell ) the real villains in this story .
They succeeded in using political entrepreneurship to hamstring a superior market entrepreneur , which in the end rendered the American petroleum industry less competitive .
The prosecution of Standard Oil was a watershed event for the American petroleum industry .
It emboldened many in the industry to pay less and less attention to market entrepreneurship ( capitalism ) and more to political entrepreneurship ( mercantilism ) to profit .
During World War
I the oil industry became " partners " with the federal government ostensibly to assure the flow of oil for the war effort .
( Of course , in such arrangements the government is always the " senior partner . " )
As Dominick Armentano writes :
The Oil Division of the U.S. Fuel Administration in cooperation with the War Services Committee , was responsible for determining oil production and for allocating crude supplies among various refiners .
In short , these governmental organizations , with the coordinating services of leading business interests , had the legal power to operate the oil industry as a cartel , eliminating what was described as " unnecessary waste " ( competition ) , and making centralized pricing and allocative decisions for the industry [ i.e. , price fixing ] as a whole .
Thus , the wartime experiment in " planning " ( i.e. , planning by political agents to satisfy political interests rather than by consumers , investors , and entrepreneurs to meet consumer demand ) created what had previously been unobtainable : a government sanctioned cartel in oil .
After the war , oil industry executives favored extending this government - sanctioned and - supervised cartel .
President Calvin Coolidge created a Federal Oil Conservation Board that enforced the " compulsory withholding of oil resources and state prorationing of oil , " a convoluted way of saying " monopoly . "
The newly formed American Petroleum Institute , an industry trade association , lobbied for various regulatory schemes to restrict competition and prop up prices ; it did not even pretend to be in favor of capitalism or free enterprise .
The institute even endorsed the use of National Guard troops to enforce state government production quotas in Texas and Oklahoma in the early l930s .
During the 1930s even more teeth were put into government oil industry cartel schemes .
The National Recovery
Act empowered the federal government to support state oil production quotas to assure output reductions and higher prices .
Interstate and foreign shipments of oil were strictly regulated so as to create regional monopolies , and import duties on foreign oil were raised to protect the higher - priced American oil from foreign competition .
In 1935 Congress passed the Connally Hot Oil Act , which made it illegal to transport oil across state lines " in violation of state proration requirements . "
In the l950s the government placed import quotas on oil , creating an even greater monopoly power .
All of this , you will recall , came on the heels of the government 's antitrust crusade against the Standard Oil " monopoly . "
Clearly , the purpose of the political persecution of Standard Oil had been to begin stamping out competition in the oil industry .
That process was continued with a vengeance with forty years of squalid political entrepreneurship .
By the middle of the twentieth century , real capitalism had all but disappeared from the oil industry .
Vanderbilt Takes on the Monopolists
The battle between market and political entrepreneurs was not confined to the railroad and oil industries .
Indeed , from the mid-nineteenth century onward , this sort of battle marked the development of much of American industry — the steamship industry , the steel industry , and the auto industry , to name just a few .
For example , the great steamship entrepreneur Cornelius Vanderbilt competed with government - subsidized political entrepreneurs for much of his career .
In fact , he got his start in business by competing — illegally — against a state - sanctioned steamship monopoly operated by Robert Fulton .
In 1807 , the New York state legislature had granted Fulton a legal , thirty - year monopoly on steamboat traffic in New York — a classic example of mercantilism .
In 1817 , however , a young Cornelius Vanderbilt was hired by New Jersey businessman Thomas Gibbons to defy the monopoly and run steamboats in New York .
Vanderbilt worked in direct competition with Fulton , charging lower rates as his boats raced from Elizabeth , New Jersey , to New York City ; to underscore the challenge to Fulton 's monopoly , Vanderbilt flew a flag on his boats that read NEW JERSEY MUST BE FREE .
Slowly he was breaking down the Fulton monopoly , which the US Supreme Court finally ended in 1824 , ruling in Gibbons v. Ogden that only the federal government , not the states , could regulate interstate trade under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution .
As the cost of steamboat traffic plummeted because of deregulation , the volume of traffic increased significantly and the industry took off .
Vanderbilt became the leading market entrepreneur in the industry , but he would continue to face government - subsidized competitors .
For example , steamship operator Edward K. Collins convinced Congress that it needed to subsidize the transatlantic steamship business to compete with the Europeans and to create a military fleet in case of war .
In 1847 Congress awarded Collins $ 3 million , plus $ 385,000 per year .
Sitting on these fat subsidies , Collins had little incentive to build his ships efficiently or to watch his costs once they were built .
Instead of focusing on making his business more efficient , Collins spent lavishly on lobbying , including wining and dining President Millard Fillmore , his entire cabinet , and many congressmen .
Like James J. Hill in the railroad industry , Vanderbilt did not shy away from competing against his heavily subsidized rivals .
Not surprisingly , these government - supported rivals ultimately could not keep up with Vanderbilt , in large part because the stifling regulations that were inevitably attached to the government subsidies made these steamship lines remarkably inefficient .
By 1858 , Collins 's line had become so inefficient that Congress ended his subsidy , and he promptly went bankrupt .
He could not compete with Vanderbilt on an equal basis .
The Real History
The lesson here is that most historians are hopelessly confused about the rise of capitalism in America .
They usually fail to adequately appreciate the entrepreneurial genius of men like James J. Hill , John D. Rockefeller , and Cornelius Vanderbilt , and more often than not they lump these men ( and other market entrepreneurs ) in with genuine " robber barons " or political entrepreneurs .
Most historians also uncritically repeat the claim that government subsidies were necessary to building America 's transcontinental railroad industry , steamship industry , steel industry , and other industries .
But while clinging to this " market failure " argument , they ignore ( or at least are unaware of ) the fact that market entrepreneurs performed quite well without government subsidies .
They also ignore the fact that the subsidies themselves were a great source of inefficiency and business failure , even though they enriched the direct recipients of the subsidies and advanced the political careers of those who dished them out .
Political entrepreneurs and their governmental patrons are the real villains of American business history and should be portrayed as such .
They are the real robber barons .
At the same time , the market entrepreneurs who practiced genuine capitalism , whose genius and energy fueled extraordinary economic achievement and also brought tremendous benefits to Americans , should be recognized for their achievements rather than demonized , as they so often are .
Men like James J. Hill , John D. Rockefeller , and Cornelius Vanderbilt were heroes who improved the lives of millions of consumers ; employed thousands and enabled them to support their families and educate their children ; created entire cities because of the success of their enterprises ( for example , Scranton , Pennsylvania ) ; pioneered efficient management techniques that are still employed today ; and donated hundreds of millions of dollars to charities and nonprofit organizations of all kinds , from libraries to hospitals to symphonies , public parks , and zoos .
It is absolutely perverse that historians usually look at these men as crooks or cheaters while praising and advocating " business / government partnerships , " which can only lead to corruption and economic decline .

I 'm thinking of getting back into web design .
It 's been a few years , and the kids probably know a few more tricks than I do , but I have one thing they do n't : I could not possibly care less about web design .
That 's right .
You want your logo to spin in a circle and twist itself inside - out for twenty seconds before people can get to your splash page ?
How about this instead : bgcolor= #CCCCCC .
That is " portable across platforms . "
You think it would be great to have a Flash movie play in the center of your splash page , and " maybe have a guy do kind of a ' Matrix ' - thing ? "
This is the sound of me stapling a picture of Keanu Reeves to my invoice .
I made you a table where border=5 .
Actually , I copied the code from somebody else .
You want the navigation buttons to change color when the mouse rolls over them ?
And maybe make a little " plink " sound ?
That 's called Javascript .
I have no idea how it works .
I made your buttons out of blue underlined text .
The " Contact " one is actually a " mailto " command .
On the house , compadre .
Look , I did n't go to college for this .
You could n't , when I was in college .
We would spend hours , hunched over our NeXT boxes , trying to figure out why BRs would behave as Ps in certain TDs .
We learned nothing and were paid nothing .
Excite was still called Architext .
I know this because I used to get stoned with one of the founders .
I said hi to him at the mall last week and he looked at me like I was crazy .
Hm , a " chat room . "
Yes , I think that everybody who comes to your model railroad website will want to sit around alone in your chat room .
One thing I could also do , though , is design a link to " Yahoo Chat : Small Trains . "
For the link , I can create little right - arrows using two " greater - than " signs .
Or maybe I will use the guillemot right ASCII character .
That 's a premium character , and rather volatile cross-platform , but breathtaking when executed correctly .
What ?
You want your website to automatically play a 2 kb MIDI of " Oh My Darling Clementine " when it loads , and for the background to be a tiled animated GIF of an American flag ?
And for the header to be H1 size ?
Okay , I think I have that template .
I may have to " back it up " off of an old hard drive .
I charge $ 150 / hr , and I do n't have a phone number .

The rules technically allow executions at Guantanamo Bay
The new rules spell out the procedures for carrying out death sentences imposed at courts martial .
There are six men on death row , all held at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas .
Anti-death penalty campaigners fear the new move may pave the way for the execution of Pte Dwight Loving , who was convicted of killing two taxi drivers .
The drivers were killed while Loving was stationed at Fort Hood , Texas , in 1988 .
The court of appeals for the armed forces rejected his latest appeal last month .
He now has few legal resources left at his disposal .
The execution would have to be approved by President George W Bush to go ahead .
Procedures
Two other servicemen were sentenced to death last year .
Sgt Hassan Akbar was convicted of killing two officers in Kuwait in 2003 .
A jury also sentenced Senior Airman Andrew Witt for stabbing to death another airman and his wife .
The new rules are acknowledged by senior ranks as a major revision of the existing situation .
The revision also makes it possible for executions to take place at any military prison , not just Fort Leavenworth .
This , according to anti-death penalty protesters , means it would be technically legal for executions to take place at Guantanamo Bay .
Currently 10 detainees there have been charged with various offences , but none of them are capital cases .
They already use basic tools , have rudimentary language and star in TV commercials , but now scientists have proof that chimpanzees are more closely related to humans than other great apes .
Genetic tests comparing DNA from humans , chimps , gorillas and orang - utans reveal striking similarities in the way chimps and humans evolve that set them apart from the others .
The finding adds weight to a controversial proposal to scrap the long - used chimp genus " Pan " and reclassify the animals as members of the human family .
The move would give chimps a new place in creation 's pecking order alongside humans , the only survivor of the genus Homo .
The biologist Soojin Yi's team at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta compared 63 m base pairs of DNA from different species , where each base is a letter in the animal 's genetic code .
They then analysed the DNA to look at what evolutionary biologists call the molecular clock , the rate at which an animal 's genetic code evolves .
The speed of the clock shows how the span of a generation has changed over the millennia .
The tests showed that even though humans and chimps split from a common ancestor between 5 m and 7 m years ago , the rate at which their genetic codes were evolving was extremely similar , differing by only 3 % , and much slower than gorillas and orang - utans .
A slow molecular clock suggests that the time between generations is long , something that has historically set humans apart from the great apes .
Team member Navin Elango said : " We found that the chimpanzee 's generation time is a lot closer to that of humans than it is to other apes . "
According to the scientists , whose study appears today in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the finding suggests some human traits only emerged 1 m years ago , a fleeting moment on evolutionary scales .
" This study provides further support for the hypothesis that humans and chimpanzees should be in one genus , rather than in two different genera , because we not only share extremely similar genomes , we share similar generation time , " said Dr Yi .
Doubts over the chimp 's position in the evolutionary tree have been around from the start .
In 1775 , when scientists first got around to naming the chimpanzee , they noted the similarity with people and placed them next to humans under the genus Homo .
But by 1816 chimps had been pushed out into their own genus , Pan , which has survived to this day .
In 1991 , the Pulitzer prize - winning ecologist Jared Diamond called humans " the third chimpanzee " , setting us alongside the common chimp ( Pan troglodytes ) and its less aggressive but astoundingly promiscuous cousin , the bonobo ( Pan paniscus ) .
By 1999 confusion over the biological status of chimpanzees prompted scientists in New Zealand to join forces with lawyers to petition the country 's government to pass a bill conferring " rights " on chimpanzees and other primates .
The move drew derision .
Roger Scruton , the moral philosopher , asked : " Do we really think that the jails of New Zealand should henceforth be filled with malicious chimpanzees ?
If not , by what right are they to be exempted from punishment ? "
New Zealand granted great apes legal protection from animal experimentation .
British Home Office guidelines also forbid experiments on chimps , gorillas and orang - utans .
In 2003 , researchers at Wayne State University in Detroit again ignited the debate when they found that 99.4 % of the most critical DNA sites are identical in human and chimp genes , prompting the lead researcher , Morris Goodman , to declare that chimps and humans should be brought together under the same umbrella genus , Homo .
" There have been discussions about whether chimpanzees should be afforded more protection and this might make things a bit clearer in peoples ' minds about whether they should have rights of some kind .
In terms of life on Earth , chimps and humans are really not that different to each other , " said Andrew Rambaut , an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University .
Practically , he adds , reclassification could raise the chimp 's profile and potentially improve their conservation .
" It seems a bit human - centric to want to put chimps into the ' Homo ' genus and not reclassify humans as ' Pan ' .
But these things are arbitrary , once you 've divided it into species .
It would become a more political decision than anything else , " he said .

The Bosnia - Atlantis Connection April 27 , 2006 by Mark Rose
Frenzied reporting of supposed pyramids in the Balkans ignores the truth and embraces the fantastic .
The world 's oldest and largest pyramid found in Bosnia ?
It sounds incredible .
The story has swept the media , from the Associated Press and the BBC , from papers and websites in the U.S. to those in India and Australia .
Too bad that it is not a credible story at all .
In fact , it is impossible .
Who is the " archaeologist " who has taken the media for a ride ?
Why did the media not check the story more carefully ?
ARCHAEOLOGY will address these questions in depth in our next issue , July / August , but for now let 's at least put the lie to the claims emanating from Visoko , the town 20 miles northwest of Sarajevo where the " Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun " is located .
Semir ( Sam ) Osmanagic , a Houston - based Bosnian - American contractor first saw the hills he believes to be pyramids last spring .
He is now digging the largest of them and plans to continue the work through November , promoting it as the largest archaeological project underway in Europe .
( His call for volunteers even slipped into the Archaeological Institute of America 's online listing of excavation opportunities briefly before being yanked . )
He claims it is one of five pyramids in the area ( along with what he calls the pyramids of the Moon , Earth , and Dragon , plus another that has n't been named in any account I 've seen ) .
These , he says , resemble the 1,800 - year - old pyramids at Teotihuacan , just north of Mexico City .
Osmanagic maintains that the largest is bigger than the pyramid of Khufu at Giza , and that the Bosnian pyramids date to 12,000 B.C .
Construction of massive pyramids in Bosnia at that period is not believable .
Curtis Runnels , a specialist in the prehistory of Greece and the Balkans at Boston University , notes that " Between 27,000 and 12,000 years ago , the Balkans were locked in the last Glacial maximum , a period of very cold and dry climate with glaciers in some of the mountain ranges .
The only occupants were Upper Paleolithic hunters and gatherers who left behind open - air camp sites and traces of occupation in caves .
These remains consist of simple stone tools , hearths , and remains of animals and plants that were consumed for food .
These people did not have the tools or skills to engage in the construction of monumental architecture . "
But time and again the media reports say that Osmanagic has spent 15 years studying the pyramids of Latin America .
What is not included in the reports is how Osmanagic interprets those structures and the cultures that built them .
Had anyone bothered to investigate , they would have found rather bizarre notions in Osmanagic 's book The World of the Maya ( Gorgias Press , Euphrates imprint , 2005 ; $ 29.95 ) .
I had a look at the online edition of it ( accessible on Osmanagic 's " Alternative History " website at www.alternativnahistorija.com).
A couple of brief passages will convey the gist of Osmanagic 's beliefs :
Ordinary watchmakers repair our watches and put them into accordance with Earthly time .
It is my theory that the Maya should be considered watchmakers of the cosmos whose mission it is to adjust the Earthly frequency and bring it into accordance with the vibrations of our Sun .
Once the Earth begins to vibrate in harmony with the Sun , information will be able to travel in both directions without limitation .
And then we will be able to understand why all ancient peoples worshipped the Sun and dedicated their rituals to this .
The Sun is the source of all life on this planet and the source of all information and knowledge .
... And with a frequency in harmony , the Earth will , via the Sun , be connected with the center of our Galaxy .
These facts become exceptionally important when we realize that we are rapidly approaching December 2012 , a date which the Maya have marked as the time of arrival of the Galactic Energy Cluster which will enlighten us .
The descendants of the Maya , the Lacandon Indians in Chiapas were discovered in the mid-twentieth century .
This isolated community showed a surprising similarity to the Basque and Berber peoples ( most probable descendants of the natives of Atlantis ) ....
In the sacred Mayan book , the Popul Vuh , there are descriptions of cosmic travelers , the use of the compass , the fact that the Earth is round , and knowledge of the secrets of the universe ....
The Mayan hieroglyphics tell us that their ancestors came from the Pleiades ... first arriving at Atlantis where they created an advanced civilization .
Many cultures around the world , from India , Sumeria , Egypt , Peru , the Indians of North and Central America , the Inca and the Maya , call themselves the " Children of the Sun " or the " children of light . "
Their ancestors , the civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria , erected the first temples on energy potent point of the Planet .
Their most important function was to serve as a gateway to other worlds and dimensions .
And there it is .
A self - described archaeologist , who believes the Maya and others are descended from Atlanteans who came from the Pleiades , has been accepted as a legitimate researcher by many news outlets .
His ideas of early pyramids in Bosnia , which is simply not possible , has been accepted as a major discovery .
How could this happen ?
If you want to categorize this farce , it seems a standard - issue " amateur / maverick confounds establishment with great discovery " story , which no doubt makes it appealing to uncritical reporters looking for a big story .
This kind of tale is a staple of the pseudoarchaeology or fantastic archaeology genre .
And the term " pyramidiot " has been applied to those obsessed with pyramids and who offer strange interpretations of them on websites and in books and televsion programs .
( See " Seductions of Pseudoarchaeology : Far Out Television " ) .
Such stories infuriate serious scholars like Runnels .
" These reports are irresponsible on the part of journalists , " he says .
" These claims are completely unsupported with any kind of factual evidence , such as artifacts or photographs of the alleged architectures .
They have not been confirmed by archaeologists who have the training and competence to evaluate them .
The person making the claims appears to have no training in archaeology and has not presented his finds in a way that would allow them to be scrutinized by trained experts .
This is simply sensationalism and grandstanding and the journalists who have reported on these claims , without first fact - checking the stories with professional archaeologists , should be ashamed of themselves .
People who believe these stories , especially when they are presented without evidence , are fools . "
Some in the academic establishment have spoken out .
They maintain that the kind of project Osmanagic is running is far worse than just misleading the gullible public .
Following a report about Osmanagic in the London Times , Anthony Harding , president European Association of Archaeologists , wrote the editors , " The situation of professional heritage management in Bosnia - Herzegovina is , since the Bosnian war , in a poor state , with a tiny number of people trying to do what they can to protect their rich heritage from looting and unmonitored or unauthorised development .
It adds insult to injury when rich outsiders can come in and spend large sums pursuing their absurd theories ( the construction of a colossal pyramid so large that it dwarfs even those of Egypt or Mesoamerica ?
12,000 years ago ? ) , in ways that most other countries would never countenance , instead of devoting their cash to the preservation of the endangered genuine sites and monuments in which Bosnia - Herzegovina abounds . "
Others fear that Osmanagic 's excavations will damage real sites ( the hill he calls the " Pyramid of the Sun " is said to have medieval , Roman , and Illyrian remains on it ) .
In one of the few critical accounts of the Bosnian pyramid story , which appeared in the Art Newspaper , the University of Sarejevo 's Enver Imamovic , a former director of the National Museum in Sarjevo , is quoted as saying , " This is the equivalent of letting me , an archaeologist , perform surgery in hospitals . "
There is public outcry within Bosnia , and an online petition that seeks to shut down Osmanagic 's project .
But he apparently has backers within the federal government and the Sarejevo city government .
Whether he is allowed to continue or not is unresolved for now , and his website makes no mention of any controversy .
And even when the mainstream media catch up and realize that the " Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun " is no such thing , it will have entered the annals of fantastic archaeology and will have a multitude of believers and defenders .

A tiger moth caterpillar feeding on a ragwort plant , which contains toxins that are especially tasty to parasitized caterpillars .
Photo : Michael Singer / NATURESome parasites trigger their own destruction by altering their hosts ' behavior , researchers at The University of Arizona and Wesleyan University report in Nature .
Many parasites have developed mechanisms that suppress their hosts ' ability to fight them off or even change their behavior in favor of the parasite .
" We found the opposite is true with tiger moth caterpillars and their parasites , " said UA Regents ' Professor Emerita Elizabeth Bernays .
Bernays discovered the previously unknown phenomenon when she studied tiger moth caterpillars infected with parasitic fly larvae .
The presence of the parasites alters their hosts ' taste organs .
As a result , the caterpillars prefer to consume plants containing chemicals toxic to the parasites .
Bernays , who is in the department of entomology at UA 's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and in the Division of Neurobiology at UA 's Arizona Research Laboratories , did the research with Michael Singer , a former doctoral student of hers who is now an assistant professor in the department of biology at Wesleyan University in Middletown , Conn .
" It is a new and surprising kind of interaction between organisms , " said Bernays .
" When parasites change the behavior of their hosts , it 's usually to their advantage . "
The chemical war starts when parasitic flies of the tachinid family seek out their victims , the caterpillars of two species of tiger moth , Grammia geneura and Estigmene acrea .
The flies lay their eggs on the outer surface ( cuticle ) of the caterpillar .
As soon as the larvae hatch they bore through the cuticle and squeeze inside the caterpillar 's body .
Inside they feast on the caterpillar 's tissue , using it as an ever - fresh live supply of food .
When the fly larvae have eventually consumed and killed their host , they pupate and develop into adult flies .
But in the case of the tiger moth , co-evolution between parasite and host has resulted in an arms race involving chemical weapons .
Some plants that the caterpillars feed on produce chemicals that are toxic to the parasites and kill them .
The chemicals , known as pyrrolizidine alkaloids and iridoid glycosides , are secondary compounds made by plants such as ragwort and plantain .
When the caterpillars consume those plants , the substances become distributed throughout the caterpillar 's body .
The caterpillars store especially high amounts in their skin and blood to deter various natural enemies .
" Normally the caterpillars wander around and eat lots of different plants , " explained Bernays .
But caterpillars with parasites in their bodies behave differently , the team found .
" They are likely to stay longer on those plants that contain the protective chemicals , thus eating more of the plants that are good for them , " said Bernays .
Using neurophysiological methods , Bernays and Singer figured out why parasitized caterpillars switch to a more healthful eating behavior .
When parasites are present in a caterpillar , its taste cells react differently to chemicals in the food .
The cells become more responsive to the protective chemicals and less sensitive to other chemicals , which are present in the same plants but are distasteful to the caterpillar and normally cause it to crawl off and look for tastier plants elsewhere .
As a result , the change in behavior elicited by the parasites makes parasitized caterpillars consume more of the beneficial plants .
In many cases , the altered behavior helps the caterpillar to escape its impending doom because the plant chemicals kill off its parasites .
Bernays and her co-worker have not yet figured out by what mechanism the parasite elicits the change of behavior on a physiological level .
" It 's still a mystery how they do it , " Bernays said .
" But the result for the caterpillars is the same :
They can survive because they find the protective plants more tasty . "

Through further processing , primarily in the gonads and adrenal glands , cholesterol is converted into sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone .
Kenneth Lee Jones , the former chief of pediatrics at the University of California , San Diego , noted pediatric cases similar to those described by Dr. Dedekian in a 2004 report in the journal Pediatrics .
At that time , unregulated “ prohormones ” like Andro , famously used by Mark McGwire , the former St. Louis Cardinals power hitter , and banned by federal law in 2005 , were available as topical sprays used to enhance libido .
Dr. Jones said the sprays used by adults in some households permeated the children ’s bedsheets , and the early puberty stopped only when the adults stopped using the sprays and also discarded old sheets .
Testosterone - containing products are not the only trigger of disordered puberty in children .
In a 1998 paper in the journal Clinical Pediatrics , Dr. Chandra Tiwary , the former chief of pediatric endocrinology at Brook Army Medical Center in Texas , reported an outbreak of early breast development in four young African - American girls who used shampoos that contained estrogen and placental extract .
The early puberty reversed once the shampoo was stopped .
In the tradition of previous physicians who deliberately exposed themselves to possible pathogens , Dr. Tiwary tried the shampoos on himself .
He carefully measured his own levels of various male and female sex hormones to establish his baseline , used the shampoos for a few days , then repeated the tests .
While Dr. Tiwary is quick to admit that his unpublished findings must be interpreted with great caution , some of his sex hormone levels changed by almost 40 percent after he used the shampoos .
In some cases , substances other than sex steroids may also disrupt normal sexual development .
In Boston at the annual Endocrine Society meeting in June , Clifford Bloch of the University of Colorado School of Medicine presented several cases of young men who had developed marked breast enlargement from using shampoos containing lavender and tea tree oils , which are widely used essential oil additives that present no problem for adults .
( Unlike Dr. Dedekian ’s cases , these cases were not a result of passive transfer from parents .
The boys themselves used the shampoos . )
Dr. Bloch collaborated with scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina to test the oils on human breast cells grown in test tubes .
Lavender and tea tree oil had the same effect on the cells as estrogen .
Dr. Bloch speculates that the findings , which he is submitting for publication in a peer - reviewed journal , may explain the boys ’ breast growth .
He noted , however , that cells in a test tube are a far cry from humans , so the relationship of the essential oil to breast growth remains hypothetical .

“ I will make sure you will never be able to place an order on the internet again . ”
“ I ’m an attorney , I will sue you . ”
“ I will call the CEO of your company and play him the tape of this phone call . ”
“ I ’m going to call your local police and have two officers come over and arrest you . ”
“ You ’d better get this through your thick skull . ”
“ You have no idea who you are dealing with . ”
These are all direct threats that I received today from an individual who identified himself as Steve Phillips , the manager of PriceRitePhoto in Brooklyn , New York when I called to inquire about my order with them .
My crime ?
Telling him that I planned to write an article about my unfortunate experience with his company regarding the camera order I had placed with him yesterday .
How are these people able to stay in business ?
I suppose I should have been duly warned based on PC World ’s Camera Confidential expose written a few years back about unscrupulous camera operators operating out of New York , but I have never been so utterly offended by a retailer in my life .
I guess in some ways this is my own fault , or as Steve Phillips reminded me , you ’re a “ professional photographer you should know better than to buy things on the internet this way . ”
I have been keeping track of The new Canon EOS 5D for a while .
As those of you who visit this site regularly know , photography is a passionate hobby of mine .
I ’ve told myself that I ’d pick up a 5D as soon as the price dropped below $ 3,000 .
I ’ve been regularly checking both Yahoo !
Shopping and PriceGrabber for a while waiting for one to drop .
Well yesterday for the first time I saw that the 5D was for sale for $ 2,899 at PriceRitePhoto .
I placed an order online and this is where my trouble began .
The order went through and was confirmed and is shown below .
The first thing that happened was I received a call from an individual who identified himself as Joseph telling me that there was a “ problem ” with my order .
He said he needed to “ verify ” the security code on my American Express .
Although I had given that security code in the order I gave him this code again .
He then tried to explain to me that I was going to need some accessories with this camera .
For starters I was going to need a new memory card .
When I told him that I already had a memory card he became somewhat insistent that mine was not good enough .
After I would n’t buy his memory card he said I ’d need new batteries for the camera .
Again I told him that I already had two batteries at home and would not be needing to purchase these from him .
And of course he then tried to sell me the ever famous “ extended warranty ” that I politely declined .
He then thanked me for my time , confirmed my order verbally , said that it would be shipping out in the next few days and hung up .
So today I checked on my order online again and saw that it had not been routed to shipping and called the company back again .
Four times I was put on hold for a substantial amount of time and had to hang up and call the company again .
Finally I was able to connect with an individual who said his name was Steve Phillips .
Steve Phillips abruptly told me that the camera was out of stock .
When I protested and told him that it was confirmed online yesterday and verbally by his sales rep he refused to budge .
When I told him that even right now as we speak the camera was still showing online at that price on his website , ( see below with today ’s date ) he still insisted that he did not have the camera .
At this point I thanked him and informed him that I would be writing an article about my experience with his company .
It was at this point that he went ballistic .
He first told me that if I did this that he would not cancel my order but just never fill it .
If I cancelled it he said he ’d charge me a 15 % restocking fee .
When I told him that that would be unethical he went nuts .
He accused me of trying to “ extort ” him and said that he was going to have two local police officers come over and arrest me .
He then went on to say that as a “ professional photographer ” I should have known better than to try and buy a camera this way and that he was an attorney and would sue me if I wrote an article about my experience .
He told me that I had no idea who I was dealing with and that as he had my work contact info that he was going to call both my immediate supervisor and the CEO of my company and tell them that I was trying to extort him .
“ I will take this very personally , ” he said .
He claimed to have recorded our phone call and said that he would make sure that I would “ never be able to order anything on the internet again . ”
Of course these threats only served to agitate me more .
After about 20 minutes of this abuse I told him that I had to go and he refused to get off the line .
He said that if I hung up that he would just charge me for the whole camera and never ship it .
I hung up and he called me back .
I left for my meeting and he called back asking to speak with my boss .
This is by far the most abusive situation I have ever encountered with any retailer on the internet .
One of the things that troubles me the most about this situation is that I found this retailer through Yahoo !
shopping and they were perceived to have positive feedback .
Is the feedback mechanism for Yahoo !
Shopping broken ?
How could this horrible retailer have a four star rating with 858 ratings ?
I ’m convinced that there is a possibility that many of the “ reviews ” for this company could be fake .
I should though have sorted through the reviews to the worst to see that many others had fallen prey to similar fraud by this company .
How is this company still allowed to offer their products through Yahoo !
Shopping ?
PriceRitePhoto may also be doing business as C&A ; Marketing and TheCameraMall.com
Below are some examples from other users :
“ very bad place for shoppping .
Ordered a TV a week ago .
when checking out , the shipping price was higher than displayed by Yahoo .
That is ok .
Called customer service 2 days later to make sure the order was ok .
The guy from customer service tried to sell other things to me , and promised the item will come in 2 days .
After 3 days , called again , I was told they over sold the item , and my order was cancelled .
what a joke !
Do n’t buy thing from this merchant !!! ”
“ In all the years I ’ve done business with online stores ( and I ’ve done plenty ) , this is by far the ABSOLUTE WORST company I ’ve conducted business with yet .
They ’re customer service is almost completely inaccessible despite their 24/7 365 claim , they do n’t deliver on anything they say they will , they ’re rude and pushy , and any information that IS sent back is usually filled with vague half - answers that do nothing to solve any problems .
This is just an awful business experience .
Case in point :
They claim to be open on Sundays over the phone from 10 AM to 4 PM EDT .
Well , what they really mean is that the sales department is open , but customer service ( who will place you on hold forever during the week ) is closed , as is billing .
STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY .
And warn your friends . … ”
“ I gave this store an overall rating of 1 .
That is because Yahoo does not allow me to rate it any lowe
r. I cannot stress enough how poor the customer service from the wretched excuse of a store .
First off , they stress ‘ we ship in less than 24 hours ’ .
That is a blatant lie .
An hour after placing the order , I received a call to confirm that I had indeed purchased a camera , and that the delivery address was correct .
So far , so good .
I returned the call , and informed them that yes I had indeed purchased a camera , and yes , the information was correct .
The next day , I received another phone call to confirm the shipping address , and did I also want to purchase an extended warranty ?
Yes , the address is correct , and no , I do n’t want your warranty .
They assured me my camera would be shipped that day .
Three days later , I again received a phone call to confirm the shipping address , which had now been done 3 times , and did I want to purchase the extended warranty ?
Yes , the information is correct , no I do n’t want your stupid warranty , I was assured the camera would be shipped that day .
It is , in my opinion unconscionable to delay shipping an order for over a week , just so a company can try a high pressure sales job , on a warranty a customer has already told them , repeatedly , that they do n’t want .
It has now been ten days since the date of purchase , and still no camera .
My experience with this store is one I will never repeat , nor would I wish it upon my worst enemy ! ! ”
and yet another review I found on the company :
“ I placed an order with TheCameraMall.com ( aka PriceRite Photo aka C&A ;
Marketing ) on June 9 , 2005 for a Sony DSR - PD170 camcorder .
At the time
the price advertised on - line was very low , which should have raised a
warning flag , but a call to the company confirmed the item was in stock
ready to be shipped , that it was a US model , the user ’s manual was in
English , and the salesman ( Joseph ) seemed helpful .
There was some
pressure to add unwanted items like a tripod , extra battery , etc , but they
were declined .
An offer to add insurance was offered , and initially I
declined but then agreed after being told that otherwise if the product
arrived and was non-functional I would be taking full risk .
Before the
product could be shipped I was asked to sign and fax a form , appended
below , that indicated that if I wrote any negative feedback I would agree
to have my credit card charged $ 100 , and that I also agreed to waive my
right to chargeback to the credit card company , and that product could not
be returned for any reason .
I signed and returned this form with the
understanding that the company would send the item I ordered .
However
after a week there was no indication of a product even having been
shipped , and the customer service contact indicated that only the
salesperson could give me order status , so after several tried I reached
Joseph again , and now he indicated that he could n’t ship the product
unless I faxed him a copy of my credit - card !!!
This I refused to do , and
have never , ever had to do for a transaction .
I sent email to the company
requesting cancelation of the order , and received yet another email asked
me to sign and fax back a form indicating that I would not post negative
feedback and if I did I was authorizing my credit card to be charged
$ 100 .
I refused to sign this .
I did post feedback to
the feedback links provided by the customer describing the details of the
transaction , including the forms I had been sent .
The day after posting the feedback describing my attempt to buy the video
camera from PriceRitePhoto / CameraMall , I received a call from a “ John
Hancock ” , claiming to be the owner of the camera companies , and demanding
that I remove the feedback I posted .
He said that he would charge my
credit card for the amount of the camera and and additional $ 250 for each
posting .
He also said that he was shipping a Malaysian version of the
camera , without a lens , to me , and that he would make money on the deal ,
and I could n’t stop the shipment , or dispute the charge .
My credit card
company confirmed that a pending charge had been placed by PriceRite , but
the charge was not yet posted , and once it was posted , I could dispute .
The next day , July 6 , I received several calls from “ John Hancock ” ,
demanding again that I remove the feedback I had posted , and when I agreed
that I would remove anything that he felt was not accurate , but if he
could not indicate any inaccuracy , then the feedback would remain .
He
screamed and swore at me over the phone , and said that he would post my
credit card number on the internet if I did n’t comply .
On July 8 a charge was posted to my credit card for $ 2139.99 and a second
charge was posted for $ 100.00 .
I called my credit card company and
initiated the dispute process .
The security department of BankOne Credit
strongly suggested that I cancel my credit card , and complete an internet
fraud report .
Description of how you were defrauded :
My credit card has been charged $ 2238.99 for an cancelled order .
I ’ve been threatened with additional multiple charges against my
credit card unless I change feedback posted to the Internet , and I’ve
been threatened with having my credit card number posted to the
Internet .
I ’ve had to cancel my credit card on the advice of my
credit card provider . ”
Update # 1 : Found this text on their eBay store ad : “ We guarantee our customers to have the best quality products and the best customer service !
Our customers love us for our friendly attitude , buy with confidence ! ”
This just makes me sick .
If you want to Digg this story you can here .
Update # 2 : Well I just received a call back from Steve Phillips at PriceRitePhoto .
He said that I should be expecting a call from the “ FBI ” shortly and that “ my tactics ” of flooding his store ’s phone lines was “ illegal . ”
When I asked him to hold on as I wanted to turn on my recorder to record our conversation he hung up on me .
Of course I have not called his store at all but I ’d imagine that the attention that his abuse has received from Digg and other places on the internet may have something to do with that .
My boss did have a conversation with me about the fact that this guy called him yesterday and was very understanding about the situation .
Update # 3 : Also since calling my boss , Steve Phillips has called my boss ’ assistant several times this morning as well .
Contrary to Steve Phillips claims , I still have had no police officers show up at my office to “ arrest me . ”
Nor have I been contacted by the “ FBI . ”
Last night when I called AMEX it appeared that PriceRitePhoto had not charged my card yet .
My guess is that when I refused to buy their high priced accessories that they never had any intention of sending me the camera at their advertised price .
I blocked the card with AMEX and will be getting a new number to prevent them from further abusing my credit card .
I have also filed a complaint with the New York Attorney General ’s office regarding their behavior and have left negative reviews on my experience with their company on most of the shopping comparison services that they are included in .
Hopefully from the attention that this story has received they will reflect on the appropriateness of their sales tactics going forward .
If anyone has a contact at Yahoo !
Shopping it would be nice to learn from them that they were being delisted or at least investigated over this .
Interestingly enough , it was just two weeks back that Yahoo !
made
an announcement about an overhaul to their shopping service .
It would seem that they plan to include more social networking type reviews on products and vendors in the future .
Hopefully whatever new system they put in place will help weed out the bad apples like PriceRitePhoto .
Of course even as late as today , they still have the camera that they told me as out of stock on their internet site for sale for $ 2,899 .
Update # 4 : Received this email back from the New York State Attorney General ’s Office today : “ Dear Consumer :
Thank you for your submission to the New York State Attorney General ’s Internet Bureau .
On behalf of Attorney General Eliot Spitzer , I want to thank you for taking the time to alert us to this matter .
Your assistance is vital to our efforts to serve the people of the State of New York .
We have added your submission to our files .
It is through complaints such as yours that we learn of patterns of fraud and illegality .
If you have any questions about this matter , please call us at ( 212 ) 416-8433 .
For other consumer - related matters , please call our consumer hotline at ( 800 ) 771-7755 .
Thank you for contacting us . ”
Update # 5 : Thanks to a complaint by Digg User loker269 , PriceGrabber has now delisted PriceRitePhoto .
Nice to see PriceGrabber do the responsible thing here .
Update # 6 : This story has risen to the number one dugg story on Digg this year with 5439 diggs so far today .
Thanks diggers !
I also received this email today from Joe Lazarus , Director of Marketing for Yahoo !
Inc. : “ Tom , I wanted to follow up on a comment I added to your post on PriceRitePhoto .
I work at Yahoo !
Shopping .
I passed your issue along to our Customer Care team who will investigate and take the appropriate action per our merchant Guidelines and Terms of Service .
I covered some more details in my comment .
Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions .
~ Joe ”
Update # 7 : This story just made the front page of Slashdot .
It was also on Boing Boing and Metafilter today along with many , many other blogs .
I truly hope that this attention shines a light on the abusive bait and switch tactics that so many of you have also unfortunately experienced and shared in your comments .
The support is overwhelming and very much appreciated .
And , yes , yes , yes , I do know that I was stupid and should have known better and done my homework before buying from these guys — but that does n’t negate the fact that their sales tactics are wrong and deserve to be stopped .
Update # 8 : Although I have not heard directly back from Yahoo ! or their Marketing Director Joe Lazarus .
It would appear at least that for the time being , today , PriceRite Photo is not operating on Yahoo !
Shopping .
They are still listed as a merchant there and there is a link to their store but when you do a search by their store for products for sale through Yahoo !
you get the following message : “ We did n’t find any product results for mid:1016578 . ”
I ’m not sure if Yahoo !
pulled their listings or if PriceRitePhoto did or if that is just part of what happens when Yahoo !
investigates a company .
I hope that if after investigating Yahoo !
concludes that this company is acting unethically that they will in fact delist them altogether .
I will update as I hear more on this .
Also , fortunately , my server has held up remarkably well with all of the traffic being sent to this story from the above sources .
I recently had to move from a shared server to a dedicated server with lots of excess capacity because I ’ve had many highly ranked Google Images that had been eating through my bandwidth in the past .
Also it helps keep my bandwidth usage down as the photos that are included as part of this story are actually hosted by Flickr , my favorite site on the internet and as I oft like to repeat , “ almost certainly the best online photo management and sharing application in the world . ”
Ironically , of course in all of this , Flickr is owned by Yahoo !
Below is an image of the company ’s website this morning .
As you can see , the camera that was supposedly “ out of stock ” when I refused to purchase their high priced accessories is still being shown for sale at the $ 2,899 price even still today .
I suspect that they do actually have the camera in stock but that they only sell it to those who load up on expensive accessories and warranty plans from them .
Update # 9 : One of the best stories I have read in conjunction with this article was a letter that Slashdot user DrWho42 ( 558107 ) wrote to PriceGrabber regarding his own personal experience with PriceRite Photo about a year ago .
It is a well articulated letter and pretty much describes PriceRite Photo perfectly .
Apparently because of this well written letter PriceGrabber , according to the user , took PriceRite Photo off of their site a year ago .
He wonders how they could have gotten back on PriceGrabber .
I would be interested if someone at PriceGrabber could comment on this report and tell us why after this merchant was removed from their site a year ago and a known bait and switch merchant who used extortion to try and influence feedback , that they would be allowed back on .
I see that they are pulled off PriceGrabber now , but if it is true that they were banned a year ago and still made it back on then I ’d say PriceGrabber ’s system is pretty much broken .
It ’s a long read but very worthwhile .
Update # 10 : Although the priceritephoto.com site is still up , I received an email today from a reader who complained to their hosting provider Webair.com .
I ’m not sure exactly the ramifications of the email from Webair .
It was sent from abuse@webair.com and was forwarded to me as follows :
“ This client has been sent a TOS violation for illegal activity .
Thank you ,
—
Webair Abuse Team ”
Update # 11 : I received a call this morning from Ed Lopez , the owner of PriceRitePhoto .
We spoke at length and he told me that the activity that has resulted from my post on my experience with his business has most certainly impacted his business .
Mr. Lopez told me that he was calling to apologize and that Mr. Philips was going to be terminated at a company board meeting later on this morning .
He confirmed to me that they do have the camera in question in stock and although I am not interested in purchasing it from them at this point indicated that he would sell it for me at the advertised price .
Subsequently
Ed sent me the following email :
“ On behalf of Priceritephoto I would like
to sincerely apologize for the negative experience that you have experienced with our company .
As a company this is not representative of the way we treat our customers .
If there is anything that we can do at this point to rectify the situation , please let me know .
We have tens of thousands of happy customers who have purchased form us in the past and it is our commitment to give our customers the best value when dealing with us .
We are doing a comprehensive review of our company ’s procedures to ensure that something like this never occurs .
We have also terminated Mr. Philips from his position with our company . ”
Although I do not believe my “ Steve Philips experience ” was an isolated case by this merchant ( and certainly the other testimonials suggest that this is in fact more of a common practice by them ) , my own personal view is that any retaliation towards this vendor should be channeled through legitimate and legal channels .
Although some of the crank phone calls are actually pretty funny I think that it is better to take the high road in this case and to use legitimate resources where they exist , whether reporting them to the comparison pricing services or contacting the Attorney General ( as I have done ) or reporting them to people like the Better Business Bureau .
I think that the popularity of this story comes in large part because the message resonates so strongly with all of us .
Although in a sense it is the classic tale of David and Goliath retold , it is much more than this .
We all have at one point or another in our lives been bullied and most of us have been defrauded or ripped off .
The fact that so many times in the past there was nothing we could do about it makes us feel all that much better about the fact that in today ’s internet and blogosphere we actually CAN do something about it .
It is tremendously empowering for all of us to be able to turn the powerlessness that we felt in the past into justice in todays ’ blogosphere through the help of things like Digg and Slashdot and Boing Boing .
And although every rip off does not receive this level of attention , I believe this story in a greater sense is representative of perhaps thousands of rip off experiences that we have all suffered in the past and been able to do nothing about – some directly with this vendor , some directly with New York based camera vendors like this one , and some with just fraudulent internet businesses wherever they happen to be located .
Because we in the past have had to live with the bitterness of our own personal frauds , our feelings towards the popularity of this story is that much stronger – as is our desire to retaliate .
This being said , I again would encourage everyone to take the high road with respect to this vendor .
I believe that the power of this story and the ultimate outcome , whatever that may be , will carry much more weight if as a public we handle things responsibly and do not resort to illegal tactics or harassment .
Although there is a sense that we all must feel that these folks have gotten what they deserved , I think it would be a far greater legacy for this story to have if change takes place in legal and legitimate channels .
I cannot speak to the sincerity of Ed Lopez .
He has sent me an apology letter and I feel it appropriate to print it .
His motivation very well may be legitimate — or it could also be the only possible avenue Mr. Lopez has left to try to salvage his business at this point .
Out of all of this , hopefully more than anything , this story will serve as a reminder to shady businesses everywhere that in the end fraud and abusive behavior towards customers does not pay .
Perhaps
I ’m being overly idealistic here and perhaps this incident is the smallest possible blip in the greater world of internet fraud — but one thing I do know is that the power of the consumer is growing .
And in a new world today with tools like blogs and Slashdot and Digg the consumer is empowered in great ways that they never have been in the past .
Update # 12 : This story is now on the first page search results for the term PriceRitePhoto for both Google and Yahoo !
It is the number one returned search result , even ahead of their store , on MSN Search .
Their site has been down now since yesterday afternoon —
I ’m not sure if this is the result of hacker activity or a reaction from their hosting company for bandwidth useage or TOS violations .
The story was also picked up by Digital Life TV .
You can view the episode here .
Update # 13 : PriceRitePhoto has been delisted from both Yahoo !
Shopping and PriceGrabber .
They still do appear however to have a profile listing giving them four stars at CNET .
I could not find any products for sale from them on CNET but they still are up as a four star internet retailer .
Their internet site is still down as of this morning and the story has moved up to the number 4th search result for the term priceritephoto on Google .
A wikipedia entry was started for priceritephoto but it appears to have been edited out of wikipedia .
Update # 14 : I ’ve written a follow - up post asking if PriceRitePhoto and TheCameraMall are the same company .
Update # 15 : I just received an email from David Bricker , the Director of Partner Services at CNET Networks .
According to David : “ We have pulled PriceRitePhoto.com from our site(s ) and their affiliated companies .
The “ profile ” page , while still live , is impossible to navigate to .
That said , we ’ll be pulling that page down from our web servers shortly . ”
I have sent a follow up email to David asking if he can provide me the names of their “ affiliated companies . ”
Update # 16 : I just received an email back from CNET ’s David Bricker who pointed me to a Better Business Bureau report identifying additional companies that are affiliated with PriceRitePhoto .
Although TheCameraMall is not listed on a Better Business Bureau report as one of PriceRitePhoto ’s affiliates , according to the Better Business Bureau of New York , PriceRite Photo is in fact affiliated with many other names and ultimately would seem to fall under a parent company going by the name of Let ’s Go Digital that is owned by Jack Heffner .
You can see the report yourself here which includes their contact and other information .
According to the BBB they additional are using the following business names : A. Heffco Technologies , Inc. , C&A ; Marketing , Dealz Net , Hype Audio , Ideal Audio / Video , Ideal Photo and Video , Let ’s Go Digital , LGD Superstore , Price Rite Photo , Prices Rite Photo .
Yesterday when I was on the phone with Ed Lopez he denied that Jack Heffner was affiliated with PriceRitePhoto although he did acknowledge knowing Jack Heffner and identified him as the owner of LGD Superstore ( another alleged affiliate according to the BBB )
Update # 17 : Although PriceRitePhoto ’s website is still offline and they appear to have been dropped from all of the major shopping comparison sites , they are still operating on eBay .
They are listed there as a “ power seller . ”
Update # 18 : After being down for much of the later half of last week , PriceRite Photo appears to be back up again this morning .
They have a note on their website : “ For those of you who tried to contact us in the past few days , we would like to apologize for any inconvenience that you may have incurred .
Our website was down for maintenance and we are back up and fully operational .
If you have placed an order with us please be assured that it will be shipped in a timely manner .
Happy Holidays . ”
This article is now the number two search result behind their store for anyone searching PriceRitePhoto on Google .
This article is the number two story behind their store for anyone searching PriceRitePhoto on Yahoo !
And it is still the number one search result for the term PriceRitePhoto at MSN Search .
Kevin and Alex also chat about the story on the latest Diggnation podcast recorded in Tokyo .
Update # 19 : The New York Post covered the story .
Update # 20 : Well in addition to the PriceRitePhoto story being picked up by the New York Post today , I received a bit more information in one of my comments .
Since the beginning of my problems with PriceRitePhoto I ’ve suspected that PriceRitePhoto ’s purported owner “ Ed Lopez ” was a fictional name .
It seemed to me unusual that PriceRitePhoto had an individual by the name of Eduardo Lopez register their domain name while another camera store linked to them TheCameraMall had an Eduardo Sanchez register their domain name .
According the the New York Post : “ a call to PriceRite Photo produced no Ed Lopez , and further calls and an e-mail went unanswered . ”
Today I received the following comment on my blog : “ By the way , the owner ’s name is not Ed Lopez .
His name is Chaim Pikarski .
I know it because I worked for him in the past .
His tactics do not surprise me , and all he is trying to do is hide his true identity through the alias of Ed Lopez .
Actually , I would be very surprised if you ever spoke to the owner .
It was most likely just an employee that provided you a fictitious name and is probably just a manager . ”
Turns out upon doing a Google search for “ Chaim Pikarski ” one of the results back is a directory for the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corp .
They have Chaim Pikarski listed at the following address : 140 58th St. , Unit 4E , BX 37 in Brooklyn and a phone number of ( 718 ) 491-4300 .
Interestingly enough , one of the addresses that comes up under Don Wiss ’ excellent series of Brooklyn Camera Store Storefronts for CP Industries , dba TheCameraMall is the same address in Brooklyn , 140 58th St. Also , if you do a Google search for the phone number 718-491-4300 you can find an old cached page listing that phone number as a number for The Camera Zone , another company which has been identified by Wiss as being under the same management as TheCameraMall .
This site , Digital Paradise ( The Digital Paradise is an automated electronic marketplace designed to streamline the purchasing and selling processes of games & electronics for the gaming community ) also lists the exact same phone number and address for The Camera Zone as is listed for Pikarski in the Googled Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corp .
Now this is in no way conclusive evidence that Chaim Pikarski is the true individual behind TheCameraMall and PriceRitePhoto , but I would be interested if anyone else had any information on Chaim Pikarski and / or information regarding his involvement in these businesses .
Also to note , and I ’m not sure why , the Better Business Bureau of New York has pulled down some of the information regarding PriceRite Photo from their website .
The report where PriceRitePhoto was previously named by them is “ being updated , ” and the following message is on the site : “ The Bureau ’s report on this business is currently being updated , and no report is available at this time .
Please check this site in approximately four to six weeks . ”
Update # 21 : Update # 21 :
One of the things that these shady camera dealers seem to have a reputation for is carrying multiple different company identities and then changing names when things go wrong with an existing identitiy .
So go figure that PriceRitePhoto has just changed their identity on on eBay on Monday of this week from PriceRitePhoto to “ Barclay ’s Photo . ”
Now barclaysphoto can welcome in a whole new round of suckers .
Barclay ’s , like the bank , now that sounds catchy .
Of course Barclay ’s ( formerly known as PriceRitePhoto ) seems to have a bit better feedback on eBay than they ’ve had on the other shopping comparison sites ( where they ’ve been bounced ) .
My guess is that this is because it is harder to bait and switch on eBay .
You ca n’t make up fake feedback there like you can at Yahoo !
Shopping and PriceGrabber because each feedback must be tied to a specific transaction .
Perhaps their behavior and treatment of eBay customers is better than the other comparison shopping sites .
It is interesting though that almost everything that they ’ve sold on eBay seems to be packaged with accesories .
This might make it easier for them to be nice when they are making money on a transaction and not advertising rock bottom prices to then bait and switch .
They still do have some negative feedback on eBay of course with things like : “ great product and great deal , but shipping took forever and alot of telemarketing , ” and “ Terrible co. to deal with .
Misrepresentation .
Bait & Switch on their web site . ”
So welcome to the new world of online shopping Barclay ’s Photo .
Hopefully you do better than your evil twin ( er , exact same company ) PriceRitePhoto .
And thanks eBay for having such a nifty feature as allowing online shopping companies the ability to change names and identity .
We would n’t want any eBay online stores being weighed down with a bad name for bad behavior now would we ?
And here ’s another interesting point , before being called PriceRitePhoto , it seems Barclay ’s / PriceRitePhoto was once called Film4Less — they ’ve also gone by edigix as well .
Update # 22 : Comparison Shopping on Sale – Forbes.com : From Forbes : “ While the vast majority of user reviews and merchant ratings provide a useful service , online shoppers can still get caught by disreputable merchants .
One blogger , Thomas Hawk of San Francisco , recently attempted to purchase a Canon EOS 5D camera that he saw listed for $ 2,899 at PriceRite Photo — the lowest price online at the time .
Hawk checked and found positive store reviews , but after placing the order , Hawk claims he was c
ontacted by a PriceRitePhoto , employee who tried to sell Hawk expensive accessories to go with the camera .
When Hawk declined , the employee said the camera was no longer available and threatened to charge Hawk ’s credit card and never send the camera .
( PriceRite Photo did not return phone calls requesting a comment . )
Yahoo Shopping ’s vice president , Rob Solomon , said that PriceRitePhoto had rigged Yahoo ’s feedback system to garner positive reviews .
Hawk was lucky because he was able to cancel his credit card before any money was charged .
However , things could have been worse .
Yahoo
Shopping offers a money - back guarantee to its buyers , but that guarantee is capped at $ 1,000 .
Sites like Become.com and NexTag offer no such guarantees . ”
Update # 23 : In a Flash , Camera Dealers Feel the Web ’s Wrath – New York Times : The New York Times today published a good expose on the recent PriceRitePhoto issue .
It would appear that they are pretty much out of business at this point with mail stacking up at the door of their address which the owner wo n’t pick up according to a handyman at the building because he owes money .
“ On Nov. 29 , Mr. Hawk posted a 2,333 - word complaint about Price Rite Photo on his Web site , describing hard sales tactics and threats .
By 2 a.m. the next day , this dispute over a $ 3,000 camera was an enormously popular topic of discussion online , casting Mr. Hawk in the timeless role of the outraged underdog .
Internet gunslingers tend to shoot first and ask lots of questions while shooting , so the attacks on Price Rite came quickly and with much discussion .
Some bragged of tying up the company ’s phone lines , others of flooding its Web site with excess traffic .
It is unclear whether that tactic worked .
“ The world of blogs is such an echo chamber that , a few places pick it up , you literally are generating tons of traffic , ” said Lee Holmes , 28 , who posted similar complaints on his own site from his home near Seattle .
There were conscientious objectors , too .
One discussion participant anonymously wrote , “ This is vigilante justice ; there are proper channels to deal with this . ”
After reading Mr. Hawk ’s complaints , Yahoo !
Shopping blocked Price Rite from its service , according to Sabrina Crider , a spokeswoman for the company .
Mr. Hawk quickly declared victory , and online discussion forums with names like Digg filed the story under headlines like “ Digg Users Take Revenge at Bad Online Store . ”
But the episode was not complete for Mr. Wiss , whose photographs of Brooklyn buildings had been mentioned in Mr. Hawk ’s rant under the headline “ Update # 20 . ”
On Dec. 14 , Mr. Wiss said , he received several calls accusing him of putting stores out of business and threatening him with death .
He said the threats were all bluster , but he reported the calls to the police and adamantly refused to allow photographs of his face for this article .
He said he hopes to trace the calls if they continue .
At the warehouse in Sunset Park , Mr. Colon , the handyman , had his own ideas about the whereabouts of Price Rite and its proprietor .
“ He owes me money , ” Mr. Colon said , explaining that he was never paid for moving an air - conditioner .
“ That ’s why he does n’t come here to pick up the mail . ” ”
Update # 24 : Yesterday I received an email from an individual identifying himself as Gabe Heffez from A. Heffco Technologies .
Mr. Heffez seemed somewhat distraught over the fact that in my reporting on PriceRitePhoto that his company and companies had been erroneously identified as being associated with PriceRitePhoto .
In my reporting on my experience with PriceRitePhoto I had identified A. Heffco Technologies as possibly being associated with PriceRitePhoto based on a report that linked the two from the Better Business Bureau of New York .
I was first made aware of this report and connection from CNET ’s David Bricker when he pointed me to the BBB report when I first began reporting on PriceRitePhoto and included my first mention of A. Heffco Technologies based on this report .
Contrary to this report from the BBB Mr. Heffez wrote me yesterday saying , “ our company is in no way related to PriceRitePhoto , ” he added , “ we do n’t know who C&A ; Marketing is or who Ideal Photo Video is .
We have sent dozens of faxes and made numerous phone calls to the BBB to correct the issue so far to no avail . ”
Mr. Heffez further went on in a subsequent email to say , “ This ( action ) caused us to reap the wrath of the public and our own advertisers .
In early - mid December , our host , Yahoo !
also terminated our stores and three of our personal ID ’s without explanation .
A seven year relationship was ended in the blink of an eye . ”
Mr. Heffez also said that CNET dropped them as well and added , “ your David vs. Goliath blog unfortunately turned into our instant termination .
We all have families to feed and this past Christmas our job was that much harder . ”
In response to Mr. Heffez ’s claims of not being associated with PriceRitePhoto I have been in contact with Tony Barbera , Manager of Information and Investigations with the BBB serving Metropolitan NY expressing my concerns over having possibly hurt an innocent company based on a potential wrongful association on the part of the BBB .
Mr. Barbera , who was aware of the coverage that this story received yesterday by the New York Times told me that the company ’s report has been suspended pending further results of an investigation .
“ I was contaced by Mr. Heffez yesterday , and we will be working with the companies in order to establish correct and complete records for each entity if it is determined they are separate , ” wrote Mr. Barbera .
Millions of people each day turn to the Better Business Burea and rely on the accuracy of the information that they provide for making informed decisions regarding their purchases and which merchants they will do business with .
The integrity of their information regarding merchants is super important .
If in fact the BBB has erroneously linked PriceRitePhoto and Mr. Heffez ’s company then I would be very personally disappointed to have hurt an innocent unrelated company .
Mr. Heffez has informed me that over the past few weeks his phone lines have been ringing off the hook with nothing on the other end but hang ups or music and has told me that he is pretty sure that his sites have been bombarded with worthless traffic in an attempt to crash them .
I suspect that this story will be developing and hope to have more conclusive findings one way or the other shortly — but in the event that the information linking his company and their affiliates to PriceRitePhoto was incorrectly reported by the BBB , I apologize and am truly sorry for any role that I and my blogging may have had in hurting his business .
PriceRitePhoto Update # 25 : Last week I reported on a company Heffco possibly being erroneously connected with my reporting on PriceRitePhoto based on a report by the New York BBB .
I have received the following email back from Tony Barbera , Manager of the Information and Investigations Divsion of the BBB New York :
“ Just letting you know our reports on PriceRitePhoto and PricesRite have been re-released and are listed as separate entities .
Take a look , and let me know if you have any questions . ”
PricesRite is still associated with Let ’s Go Digital and ultimately also A. Heffco Technologies with a fairly negative BBB rating , but it is no longer associated per the BBB New York with PriceRitePhoto , the o
utfit that I had my run in with .
It sounds like while distancing the companies , the BBB still is not willing to change the overall rating of Let ’s Go Digital and that the unrelated complaints against them are still standing .
PriceRitePhoto is now listed as an affilate of C&A ; Marketing , with a “ Howard Baker ” as it ’s president .
Interesting and suprisingly to me they only have three complaints filed with the BBB against them .
I received the following email from Gabe Heffez of Heffco , on the matter at hand : “ Thank you for your help with the BBB .
Although they still do n’t have our information 100 % correct , they have removed associations with priceritephoto and company .
We will continue to write them and fax them the correct information so they can get it completely right .
Thank you for the quick response and corrections on your side . ”
and then a second email :
“ Funny , I just checked again and it looks like we inherited all of their customer disputes .
I checked their page and looks like they are a pretty clean cut company .
The BBB has got to get their act together .
We will continue to work on it . ”
This concludes Macworld ’s live coverage of Steve Jobs ’ keynote address to Macworld Expo 2006 attendees .
Please visit Macworld News or the Macworld Expo topic page for more details from the show .
Steve Jobs started his Tuesday presentation with a recap of some of Apple ’s highlights from the previous calendar quarter .
He said that Apple now has 135 retail stores open around the world , and saw 26 million visitors over the holiday quarter .
Apple ’s retail stores pulled in more than $ 1 billion in revenue for the quarter .
i Pod and iTunes
Jobs said that Apple sold 14 million iPods this holiday season , compared to 4.5 million for the 2004 holiday season — that averaged to more than 100 sold every minute .
The total number of iPods Apple has sold since the music play was first introduced in 2001 — 42 million .
Apple has sold 850 million songs through its iTunes Music Store .
Jobs said that 3 million songs are being sold per day , worldwide — a run rate of more than 1 billion songs per year .
TV show sales have been going well since they were introduced this past fall : Eight million have been sold and downloaded from iTunes since the video service went online in mid-October .
Apple ’s new $ 49 iPod remote control sports an integrated FM tuner , making it possible for iPod users to listen to FM radio stations while they use their iPods .
The station frequency is displayed on the iPod ’s screen .
It ’s compatible with current models .
It ’s on sale today .
ABC Sports and ESPN content is now available through iTunes — last week ’s Rose Bowl was the top - selling sports program on iTunes , said Jobs .
Jobs also used his time on the keynote stage to discuss Apple ’s recent integration with Chrysler vehicles — as was recently announced , most of the new 2006 model year vehicles from Chrysler , Jeep and Dodge feature built - in iPod connectivity as an option .
Forty percent of cars sold in the United States have iPod integration as an option , according to Jobs .
Mac OS X v10.4.4
Mac OS X v10.4 “ Tiger ’s ” Dashboard feature has been a big success , according to Jobs : More than 1500 Dashboard widgets have already been created .
Apple on Tuesday will release Mac OS X v10.4.4 , the latest incremental update to Tiger — which includes updates to Dashboard including a new Google widget .
Also new is an ESPN sports score widget , a “ white pages , ” calendaring widget , ski conditions and new widget that works with Apple ’s Address Book application .
i Life ‘ 06
Apple on Tuesday also announced a major update to its iLife package — iLife ‘ 06 .
Calling it a “ giant new release , ” Jobs touted the dramatically improved speed of iPhoto , which also includes new one - click effects .
i Photo features a new limit of 250,000 photos .
New full - screen editing has been added to this release .
A major new feature of iLife ‘ 06 is what Apple calls “ Photocasting . ”
Described as podcasting for photos , photocasting makes it possible to share photos over the Internet using one mouse - click .
The photos are updated to your .
Mac account , where users can subscribe to them using Really Simple Syndication ( RSS ) .
i Photo also has a new greeting card creation feature , and the ability to create calendars using iPhoto images .
The new version of iMovie features the ability to open more than one project at a time .
Trickling down from Apple ’s pro video applications , iMovie now gains new real time titling effects .
And , of course , with the introduction of the video - capable iPod , iMovie now supports the ability to export to iPod and create vidcasts — the video version of podcasts .
At long last , support for third - party DVD burners has finally come to Apple ’s DVD creation software , iDVD .
“ Magic DVD ” is a new feature that lets you create a DVD using drag and drop techniques , rather than having to manually assemble your project .
Also , you can produce wide - screen menus for your DVD content .
New themes and new slideshows have been added .
Map view editing has also been enhanced .
Podcasting has been a major trend in 2005 , with innumerable companies and individuals hopping on the bandwagon to produce audio files that they provide for download using RSS feeds .
Last year Apple updated iTunes with podcasting support , and now Garageband gets the podcast treatment with new podcast studio features .
You can incorporate artwork and more than 200 different effects and sound snippets built - in to Garage Band in your podcasts .
iChat , Apple ’s own instant messaging , audio and video teleconferencing application , can now be used for podcasting .
Ducking is a new feature that will automatically lower the volume of music when a voice track is introduced .
A new World Music JamPack — an add - on for GarageBand — has also been produced .
i Web
The rumors were true :
There ’s also a new application bundled with iLife ‘ 06 called iWeb .
iWeb has been developed to help iLife users share their content — photos , blogs , music , movies and more — through Web publishing .
The integrated media browser provides you with direct access to the content managed by your other iLife applications .
i Web supports one - click publishing to .
Mac accounts , and features a variety of built - in templates , support for RSS feeds and more .
A theme - based motif lets you create a coherent site and update it whenever the mood strikes without having to worry about breaking the site in the process .
i Life ‘06 is now available , and costs $ 79 — the same price as last year ’s version .
It ’s also being bundled for free on new iMacs starting today .
Jobs mentioned in passing that Apple ’s .
Mac service , a subscription - based online service that provides users with Web publishing , online synchronization and other tools and features , now has more than one million paying subscribers .
i Work ‘06
Last year Apple introduced a new product suite called iWork .
The suite comprised Apple ’s Keynote presentation software with a new word processor / page layout application called Pages .
iWork has been updated for 2006 .
Shipping today , iWork ‘ 06 costs $ 79 , same as before .
There are no new applications in iWork ‘ 06 , but new to this release is the ability to create 3D charts , more advanced imaging , masking , calculating tables and more .
A 30 - day free trial demo will be included on new Macs .
Intel inside the new iMac
Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini emerged from the stage in a white “ bunny suit . ”
He called his company ’s efforts to get their CPUs working on the Mac “ energizing , challenging and fun . ”
“ We ’re a little head of schedule , ” said Jobs , introducing the first Mac to feature an Intel microprocessor .
Using the new Core Duo chip from Intel , Apple ’s new iMac , which goes on sale today in 17 and 20 - inch versions , is two to three times faster than its predecessor , according to Jobs .
It ’s available in the same design as before , with the same prices .
Both cores of the new dual - core Intel chip are faster than the G5 was , according to the benchmarks Jobs showed on the screen .
Mac OS X v10.4.4 , which ships on the new machine , is running natively on the Intel microprocessor .
What ’s more , Apple ’s new iLife ‘ 06 and iWork ‘ 06 applications have been produced as “ universal binaries , ” which means they ’ll also run natively .
Jobs indicated that Apple ’s pro applications , including Final Cut Pro and Aperture , will be available in universal binaries starting in March .
If you already own the software , you can trade up to the universal binary versions for $ 49 .
For third - party pro application support , Microsoft is “ on track ” for universal binaries of Microsoft Office and Microsoft Messenger , but for now , the company has made sure that its software runs well using Rosetta , the emulation technology that makes it possible for Intel - based Macs to run PowerPC - optimized software .
Quark is releasing a beta version of a QuarkXPress universal binary version today .
Calling it an “ incredibly successful product , ” Microsoft ’s spokesperson Roz Ho reiterated its support for the Macintosh version of Microsoft Office , and told the crowd that the company is “ here to stay . ”
“ Rosetta is going to be a great bridge until we get all apps Universal , ” said Jobs .
MacBook Pro
Of course , no Steve Jobs keynote would be complete without his trademark “ one more thing . ”
This year ’s was a doozy : a new laptop computer called the MacBook Pro .
That ’s right — no more PowerBook .
The MacBook pro features an Intel Duo Core chip that runs four to five times faster than the PowerBook G4 , according to jobs — he called it the fastest notebook ever .
All this , in a chassis that ’s actually slimmer than Apple ’s 17 - inch PowerBook G4 model , and weighs in at 5.6 pounds .
It features a 15.4 - inch LCD screen that ’s as bright as Apple ’s desktop Cinema Displays .
The new MacBook Pro features a built - in iSight camera , much like Apple ’s iMac systems , and an integrated InfraRed ( IR ) sensor supports Apple ’s remote control , which can operate Front Row — the software that helps turn a Mac into a media center , which Apple first introduced in a refreshed iMac model in 2005 .
Apple is taking orders today , but does not expect to begin shipping the MacBook Pro until sometime in February .
A 1.67GHz model will cost $ 1,999 .
A 1.83GHz model will cost $ 2,499 .
The keynote address closed with an image of Steve Jobs and Steve “ Woz ” Wozniak , who founded Apple on April Fool ’s Day , 1976 .
April 1 , 2006 will be Apple ’s 30th anniversary .
This story , " Macworld Expo Live Keynote Coverage " was originally published by PCWorld .
Lindsay Lohan 's latest celebrity confrontation made headlines in Page Six and made money for those who predicted it would be with Diddy .
According to the New York Post , Lohan left her table at Butter in New York City last Friday to go over and argue with Paris Hilton .
When she left her table , Diddy and his posse took it over , much to Lohan 's dismay .
Lindsay then began " mixing it up " with Diddy , before his security escorted her out .
So how did anyone profit from this ?
Well , BetUs.com , which frequently posts odds on entertainment related bets , had posted a wager entitled , " Who will Lindsay Lohan fight with next ? "
They listed Sean " Diddy " Combs as a relative underdog at 30 - 1 .
A simple $ 10 bet would have paid out $ 300 .
The favorite , according to executives at BetUs.com , was Nicole Richie at 2 - 1. Mischa Barton was next at 3 - 1 , followed by Britney Spears at 4 - 1 .
Since allmost all energy policies in the world are based on scenario's from these two institutes , it is of the utmost importance that the USGS figure of 3345 billion barrels for ultimate recovery of conventional oil + NGL is correct .
If not so , then the studies from the IEA and EIA give far too rosy projections on continuously rising oil producion .
Instead , the world will encounter a shortfall in the supply of oil far earlier then now anticipated .
Besides the studies cited above the figures of the USGS are also used by oil companies such as ExxonMobil and even the Saudi's to give the impression that there is plenty of conventional oil remaining .
If you would read a random energy scenario study there is a very high chance that it is based on the United States Geological Survey 's World Petroleum Estimate from the year 2000 .
This is because the estimate for the ultimate oil recovery of conventional oil +
Natural Gas Liquids ( NGL ) of that study is being used as the basis for oil production projections in the :
The USGS World Petroleum Assessment 2000 came up with two estimates .
One for the potential of oil to be discovered between 1996 and 2030 , the other for the amount of reserve growth between 1996 and 2030 .
Reserve growth is the increase in reserves over time due to past underestimates of oil reserves in oil fields and new technology that increases the recovery factor in a given field .
In this first part I will deal with the first branch of the report , expected discoveries between 1996 and 2030 .
First a look at the study itself , in 2001 , Jean Laherrerre , geophysicist of ASPO France already wrote some critical remarks about the USGS report :
This study [ USGS world assessment 2000 ] was a good project to define all the petroleum Systems of the world with the help of the major oil companies and to draw good maps , but the results were poor because the oil companies did not participate in the assessment , preferring to keep their knowledge and ideas confidential since they were competing with each other for the prime areas .
It was left to a single USGS geologist to assess each individual basin ( in the past it was done with Delphi inquiries involving many geologists ) .
It was done without the benefit of seismic coverage and well data .
Most of the estimates were made by academic geologists with little oil exploration practice .
The database for reserves by field from 1995 & 1996 was out of date for a 2000 assessment and it was also inconsistent , with Proved reserves being used for the US and Canada ( P ) and Proved & Probable reserves ( 2p ) being used for the rest of the world . "
The results of the study are summarized in the main table below :
Click for full screen .
The table outlines three categories , Oil , Gas and Natural Gas Liquids ( NGL ) .
In this post I focus on the expectations for Oil + NGL only .
These two liquid sources currently provide 98 % of the world 's liquids needed to fuel our cars , airplanes , plastics etc . .
Below the categories are the probabilities of the expected recovery values , citing the figures for 95 % , 50 % , 5 % and the mean value .
The mean value is derived from taking the probabilities at 95 % , 90 % , 85 % , 80 % and so on until 10 % and 5 % , then dividing between the amount of probabilities taken ( in total 20 ) .
The probabilities are derived from numerous statistical runs ( monte carlo ) .
The categories cited are the undiscovered conventional ( yet to be found ) Reserve growth ( expected increase of reserves due to new technology / insights ) , Remaining reserves and Cumulative production .
The ultimate recovery value for conventional oil +
NGL is calculated by adding the 3021 billion barrel figure for oil + the 324 billion barrel figure for NGl .
That adds up to 3345 billion barrels that will be recovered eventually according to the USGS .
This 3345 billion barrel figure is the one that is being used by all the institutes such as the IEA for their scenario's .
It is very important to note that the figures start at 1 January 1996 as noted above the table !
The end year of the estimate is 2030 .
As an example , the USGS expects the potential for discoveries between 1996 and 2030 to be 649 billion barrels for conventional oil ( excluding the United States )
One may wonder why there has been no new assessment , since the study is already six years old .
The authors in August of 2005 looked back at their study in a publication in AAPG bulletin ( " An evaluation of the U.S. Geological Survey World Petroleum Assessment 2000 " , AAPG Bulletin , v. 89 , no. 8 ( August 2005 ) , pp. 1033 -1042 ) .
In this evaluation the authors ( Albrandt et al. ) claim that their study is still valid .
Discoveries in the past ten years
The USGS stated that between 1996 and 2030 a total of 939 billion barrels ( 649 + 207 + 83 ) could potentially be discovered .
According to the ASPO International database and my own guesstimates between 1 January 1996 and 1 January 2006 around 110 billion barrels of oil were found .
At the same time , 265 billion barrels of oil were produced .
This is shown in the chart below .
Click for full screen .
Of the USGS potential of 939 billion barrels , around 12 % - 13 % has been realised so far , while already 30 % of the time period ( 1996 - 2030 ) has passed .
This is confirmed by figures from IHS Energy , as shown in the chart below .
Chart from IHS Energy presentation by Ken Chew at the Energy Institute conference in London
IHS Energy states that 17.5 % of the USGS potential for discovery has been realised by the beginning of 2006 .
In this figure they include a 25 % increase in reserves from those discoveries ( reserve growth ) .
If we subtract the 25 % , we get an amount of 14 % that is realised from the USGS potential for discovery , or about 131 billion barrels .
The USGS authors ( Albrandt et al ) in their August 2005 publication in the AAPG journal do acknowledge the low amount of discoveries in the past ten years .
However , according to them this falls in line with what could have been expected :
" Most of the undiscovered resources reported in the U.S. Geological Survey World Energy study are in environmentally , economically , or politically difficult locations . "
" Some of the oil resources estimated by the U.S. Geological Survey were expected to come from remote localities such as northeast Greenland , but the World Petroleum Assessment 2000 predicted that most of the undiscovered oil could be found in and around the existing major petroleum provinces of the Middle East , North Africa , and the countries of the former Soviet Union .
Large parts of these important areas were not available to exploration during the first 8 yr of the forecast span .
This is certainly the case in some of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa .
Iraq , Iran , and Libya presented limited investment opportunities during the 8 - yr period of this study , and investment in oil and gas exploration in Russia , Azerbaijan , and the central Asian republics has been limited also by various constraints on pipeline construction and perceived political and economic instability . "
" In this context , it is surprising that as much as 11 % [ end 2003 ] of the estimated undiscovered oil resource was found "
While it is actually the case in some countries such as Iraq that very little exploration has taken place , for others this is simply not true .
A significant amount of exploration is taking place in Iran , with good results .
The country had the largest amount of large discoveries between 1993 and 2002 for oil and gas , as shown in the chart below from IHS Energy :
The authors also quote the lack of access due to environmental regions such as northeast Greenland , where no drilling has taken place so far .
Recently several oil companies have been given rights to start drilling in the remote region .
The USGS expects a potential of 51 billon barrels to be discovered in Greenland .
What do the two regions with the largest potential for oil discoveries tell us ?
Saudi Arabia
The USGS noted a potential of 136 billion barrels of conventional oil + NGL to be discovered between 1996 and 2030 in Saudi Arabia ( 9 % of the total of 939 billion barrels ) .
Between 1 January 1996 and 1 January 2006 approximately 5 billion barrels have been discovered in Saudi Arabia .
Since the nationalisation in the ' 70s foreign companies could not drill in the country .
Only since 2004 have several western oil companies have been allowed to drill for gas in the Rub Al Khali Region ( empty quarter ) , which is positioned in the south and south / west .
In the chart below we see that drilling so far has taken place mainly in the east :
Chart from Saudi Aramaco presentation by Abdul Baqi and Saleri at a CSIS meeting in Washington in 2004 .
The Saudi 's describe three regions as being relatively unexplored as shown above .
the Rub Al Khali , the border with Iraq and the Red Sea .
The USGS gives the following expectations for these regions in Saudi Arabia :
According to the USGS , there is very little potential in the Northern part and the Red Sea .
Most of the potential lies in the already extensively explored region around Ghawar !
The remainder is to be found in the Rub Al Khali .
Only 4 % of the expected potential has been found so far in the first ten years of the period given by the USGS .
Furthermore , the main potential for discoveries according to the USGS is in the already extensively explored part of the country .
The authors of the study ( albrandt et al ) seem to contradict themselves in the case of Saudi Arabia , by stating that " Large parts of these important areas were not available to exploration during the first 8 yr of the forecast span " .
Those parts may not have been available , but that was not were the oil is expected to be .
In the chart below by geophysicist J. Laherrere drilling ( new field wildcats ) versus the amount of oil discovered is plotted .
This clearly shows that new drilling does not deliver any giant discoveries in regions in Saudi Arabia were drilling has already taken place .
No large field has been discovered since the end of the ' 70s in the country .
Russia
The USGS states a potential of 115 billion barrels for discovery in Russia between 1996 and 2030 .
The largest part , 75 billion barrels , is to be expected in the West Siberian Basin .
This is the same Basin were the main stay of Russian production is currently coming from .
However , the basin is very large .
Most fields in the basin are concentrated in the centre .
Very little fields have been discovered in the past ten years in Russia .
Discovery in Russia peaked in the ' 60's , rose to a lower 2nd discovery peak at the end of the 70's .
After that discoveries declined until after the fall of the Soviet Union .
Around 1995 some discoveries started to pour in again , but no real big fields have been found .
The largest discovery in the past ten years has been found at the beginning of this year .
The Vladimir Filanovsky discovery in the Russian part of the Caspian Sea containing 600 million barrels .
It is difficult to obtain reliable discovery for Russia .
Discovery in the past ten years amounted to an approximate of 6 to 15 billion barrels , depending on the source .
Will discoveries lead to the 115 billion barrels eventually ?
Due to the lack of data on Russian exploration it is very hard to answer this question .
However , the discoveries in the past ten years are not a good sign .
What does shell think about future discoveries ?
Oil majors almost never disclose any of their data or vision on future production potential .
In the back of the latest Shell Global Scenarios to 2025 , however , Shell printed a graph that showed future discovery expectations :
Under the graph
Shell wrote :
" While major new finds cannot be ruled out , recent statistics do provide worrisome signals ...
Discoveries only replaced some 45 % of production since 1999 .
In addition , the number of discoveries is increasing but discoveries are getting smeller in size .
The 25 biggest fields hold some 33 % of discovered reserves and the top 100 fields 53 % ; al but two of the giant fields were discovered before 1970 . "
" A simple extrapolation of the volumes discovered annually suggests that volumes to be found between now and 2050 could be as low as 500 billion barrels .
However , this magnitude of undiscovered potential is considered conservative by some , who believe it is influenced too much by the declining exploration success of late and by cautious views about the commercial viability of future finds . "
If we take the 500 billion barrels and subtract the period of 2030 to 2050 it gives an expected 350 billion barrels between 2005 and 2030 .
An amount that is far lower then the USGS expected figure of 939 billion barrels .
Concluding remarks
1 ) In the first ten years of the 34 year time period of the USGS WPA 2000 between 110 and 140 billion barrels have been discovered .
An amount that is far lower then the expected 939 billion barrels between 1996 and 2030 from the USGS WPA 2000 .
2 ) If the estimate from the USGS WPA 2000 is correct , approximately 800 billion barrels are awaiting discovery in the coming 25 years .
Implying a tripling of current annual discovery for a period of 25 years .
3 ) There has been limited exploration access to several regions due to environmental , economical and political restrictions .
However this does not necessarily imply that there is a large amount of oil in these regions .
4 ) Many of the environmental , economical and political restrictions have been lifted in the past few years .
If the authors of the USGS study are correct ( albrandt et al ) this should result in a sharp increase in discoveries in the coming years .
5 ) The authors of the study ( Albrandt et al ) do appear to overestimate the discovery potential in Saudi Arabia .
6 ) It seems unwise to bet our future on a single study which has so far turned out te be too optimistic .
Unfortunately , this is common practice throughout the world .

Popular culture makes gratuitous use of powerful lie-repelling agents known as Truth Serums .
They are usually depicted as injected drugs which strongly inhibit a subject ’s ability to lie , causing him or her to mechanically recite the truth to an interviewer upon questioning .
Such drugs have been utilized by some of the three - letter government agencies in the not - so - distant past ( CIA , FBI , DOD , KGB , etc. ) , particularly during the rampant paranoia of the Cold War .
And in the aftermath of 9/11 , there was some discussion on the idea of bringing them back into use for interrogation .
But are these truth serums effective ?
Do they produce any useful results ?
The short answer is , no .
The long answer is “ Noooooooooooo ! ” , preferably while running in slow - motion .
Many barbiturates fall under the “ truth serum ” category , including scopolamine , sodium amytal , and Sodium Pentothal .
Scopolamine was tested in the 1950s as a truth serum in project MKULTRA , and is now infamous as a date - rape drug due to its tendency to cause retrograde amnesia ( the inability to recall events prior to its administration ) .
Sodium Pentothal is a drug which is commonly used in operating rooms as general anesthesia , though in recent years it has been largely replaced by better alternatives .
Another of the most common truth serums is ethyl alcohol , the same agent that is found in alcoholic beverages .
As a truth serum , it is usually injected in a nearly pure form , but its effects are indistinguishable from those caused by consuming large amounts of alcohol orally .
If you ’ve ever been intoxicated , then you are personally familiar with the effects that truth serum has on the mind and body .
While a drunk person may be more likely to confess their secrets , they are not incapable of lying , nor will they necessarily share any information that is asked of them .
All of these truth serums work in the same manner :
They depress the central nervous system and interfere with judgment and higher cognitive function .
A person in such a state tends to regurgitate a cocktail of information which is a blend of facts and fantasy , with many details exaggerated or omitted .
In a word , unreliable .
In 1963 the Supreme Court ruled that a confession produced under the influence of truth serum was unconstitutionally coerced , and therefore inadmissible .
After that , the use of such drugs fell rapidly from popularity in the U.S. .
But truth serums may not be gone for good , as the Supreme Court asserted shortly after 9/11 that terrorism may require “ heightened deference to the judgments of the political branches with respect to matters of national security . ”

We picked up an iSight for those of us in the office who have older powerbooks without a builtin webcam … and I was playing with the magnet that came with it and somehow did n’t think twice about setting it down on my laptop … loud noise … 2 seconds later …. black screen !

UPDATE
... the magnet is now in the garbage .
TAKE THAT !
UPDATE #2
I ’m not the only person that this happened to …
It ’s interesting to hear so many people say , “ It takes a really powerful magnet to destroy a hard drive .

Don Rumsfeld is fond of historical analogies when pontificating about Iraq ; he particularly favors comparisons to the Nazi era and the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II .
Unfortunately , any historian will tell you that Rummy ’s parallels are invariably false , even ludicrous .
So we thought we ’d give the beleaguered Pentagon warlord a more accurate and telling analogy to chew on .
Try this one , Don. Imagine that British occupation troops in , say , Hanover , had been forced to abandon a major base , under fire , and retreat into guerrilla operations in the Black Forest — in 1948 , three years after the fall of the Nazi regime .
And that as soon as the Brits made their undignified bug - out , the base had been devoured by looters while the local , Allies - backed authorities simply melted away and an extremist , virulently anti-Western militia moved into the power vacuum .
What would they have called that , Don ?
" Measurable progress on the road to democracy ? "
" Another achieved metric of our highly successful post - war plan ? "
Or would they have said , back in those more plain - spoken , Harry Truman days , that it was " a major defeat , a humiliating strategic reversal , foreshadowing a far greater disaster ? "
You ’d have to wait a long time — perhaps to the end of the " Long War " — to get a straight answer from Rumsfeld on that one , but this precise scenario , transposed from Lower Saxony to Maysan province , unfolded in Iraq last week , when British forces abandoned their base at Abu Naji and disappeared into the desert wastes and marshes along the Iranian border .
The move was largely ignored by the American media , but the implications are enormous .
The UK contingent of the invading coalition has always been the proverbial canary in the mine shaft : if they ca n’t make a go of things in what we ’ve long been told is the " secure south , " where friendly Shiites hold absolute sway , then the entire misbegotten Bush - Blair enterprise is well and truly FUBAR .
The Queen ’s Royal Hussars , 1,200 - strong , abruptly decamped from the three - year - old base last Thursday after taking constant mortar and missile fire for months from those same friendly Shiites .
The move was touted as part of a long - planned , eventual turnover of security in the region to the Coalition - backed Iraqi central government , but there was just one problem : the Brits forgot to tell the Iraqis they were checking out early — and in a hurry .
" British forces evacuated the military headquarters without coordination with the Iraqi forces , " Dhaffar Jabbar , spokesman for the Maysan governor , told Reuters on Thursday , as looters began moving into the camp in the wake of the British withdrawal .
A unit of Iraqi government troops mutinied when told to keep order at the base — and instead attacked a military post of their own army .
By Friday , the locals had torn the place to pieces , carting away more than $ 500,000 worth of equipment and fixtures that the British had left behind .
After that initial , ineffectual show of force , the Iraqi " authorities " stepped aside and watched helplessly as the looters taunted them and cheered the " great victory " over the Western invaders .
The largely notional — if not fictional — power of the Baghdad central government simply vanished while the forces of hardline cleric Moqtada al - Sadr , which already controls the local government , stepped forward to proclaim its triumph and guide the victory celebrations in the nearby provincial capital , Amarah .
" This is the first city that has kicked out the occupier ! " blared Sadr - supplied loudspeakers to streets filled with revelers , as the Washington Post noted in a solid — but deeply buried — story on the retreat .
British officials were understandably a bit sniffy about the humiliation .
First , they denied there was any problem with the handover at all : the Iraqis had been notified ( a whole 24 hours in advance , apparently ) , the exchange of authority was brisk and efficient , and the Iraqis had " secured the base , " military spokesman Major Charlie Burbridge insisted to AP .
But when reports of the looting at Abu Naji began pouring in , British officers simply washed their hands of the nasty business .
The camp was now " the property of the Maysan authorities and Iraqi Forces [ are ] in attendance , " said Burbridge ; therefore , Her Majesty ’s military would have no more comment on the matter .
In this casual — not to mention callous — dismissal of the chaos spawned in wake of the Hussars ’ departure , we can see in miniature the philosophy now being writ large across the country in the Bush administration ’s " Iraqization " policy : " We broke it ; you fix it . "
And where are Her Majesty ’s Hussars now ?
Six hundred of them have dispersed into guerrilla bands in the wilderness , where they will survive on helicopter drops of supplies while they patrol the Iranian border .
The ostensible reason behind this extraordinary operation is two - fold , said the doughty Burbridge : first , to find out if the Bush administration is up to its usual mendacious hijinks in claiming that the evildoers in Iran are fuelling the insurgency among the happily liberated Iraqi people ; and second , to do a little more of that Iraqization window dressing before finally getting the hell out of Dodge completely , beginning sometime next year , according to reports across the UK media spectrum .
Of course , the good major did n’t put it quite like that .
" The Americans believe there is an inflow of IEDs and weapons across the border with Iran , " he told the Post .
" Our first objective is to go and find out if that is the case .
If that is true , we ’ll be able to disrupt the flow . "
The second aim is training Iraqi border guards , he added .
Yes , a few hundred men wandering through the wasteland , dependent on air - dropped rations , will certainly be able to seal off an almost 300 - mile border riddled with centuries - old smuggling routes .
And modern - day Desert Rats rolling up in bristling Land Rovers to isolated villages where Shiite clans span both borders will no doubt be gathering a lot of actionable intelligence from the locals .
And of course it is much easier to " train Iraqi border guards " on the fly in the wild than at a long - established base with full amenities and , er , training facilities .
In other words , the British move makes no sense — if you accept the official spin at face value , i.e. , that it ’s an act of careful deliberation aimed at furthering the Coalition ’s stated goals of a free , secure , democratic Iraq .
But those in the reality - based community will see it for what it is : a panicky , patchwork reaction to events and forces far beyond the Coalition ’s intentions or control .
The other six hundred Hussars driven out of Abu Naji have retreated to the main British camp at Basra — another " safe " city that has now degenerated into a level of violence approaching the hellish chaos of Baghdad , the Independent reports .
British troops who once walked the streets freely , lightly armed , wearing red berets instead of helmets , are now largely confined to the base , except for excursions to help Iraqi government forces in pitched battles against the Shiite militias that control the city .
Harsh religious rule has long descended on the once freewheeling port city , again presaging the sectarian darkness now settling heavily across Baghdad .
Just a few months ago , the UK’s Ministry of Defence was churning out " good news " PR stories about life at Abu Naji — such as the whimsical tale of the troop ’s pet goat , Ben , a lovable rogue always getting into scrapes with the regiment ’s crusty sergeant major , even though the soldiers " knew he had a soft spot for Ben . "
The goat , we were told , had enjoyed visits from such distinguished guests as the Iraqi prime minister and the Duke of Kent .
Now this supposed oasis of British power has been destroyed , with the Coalition - trained Iraqi troops meant to secure it either fading into the shadows or actively joining in with the rampaging crowds and extremist militias .
Meanwhile , the Hussars are reducing to roaming the countryside on vague , pointless , impossible missions , killing time , killing people — and being killed — until the inevitable collapse of the whole shebang .
The goat is gone .
The canary is dying .
The surrender and sack of Abu Naji is a preview of what ’s to come , on a much larger scale of death and chaos , as the bloodsoaked folly of Bush and Blair ’s war howls toward its miserable end .
The Best of Chris Floyd
The active ingredient of marijuana could be considerably better at suppressing the abnormal clumping of malformed proteins that is a hallmark of Alzheimer 's than any currently approved drugs prescribed for the treatment of the disease .
Scientists report the finding in the Oct. 2 issue of the journal Molecular Pharmaceutics .
About 4.5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer 's disease , which gradually destroys memory .
As more people survive into old age , cases of Alzheimer ’s disease are expected to triple over the next 50 years .
There is no known cure .
The researchers looked at THC , the compound inside marijuana responsible for its action on the brain .
Computer models suggested THC might inhibit an enzyme with the tongue - twisting name of acetylcholinesterase ( also called AChE ) that is linked with Alzheimer's .
AChE is known to help accelerate the formation of abnormal protein clumps in the brain known as amyloid plaques during Alzheimer's .
This enzyme also helps break down the brain chemical acetylcholine , which is linked to memory and learning .
Acetylcholine levels are reduced during Alzheimer's .
In lab experiments , the scientists found THC was significantly better at disrupting the abnormal clumping of malformed proteins .
THC could completely prevent AChE from forming amyloid plaques , while two drugs approved for use against Alzheimer 's , donepezil and tacrine , reduced clumping by only 22 and 7 percent , respectively , at twice the concentration of THC used in the tests .
" We 're not advocating smoking dope , but if we can make analogues of THC , it could play a role in treating Alzheimer 's , " researcher Kim Janda , a chemist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , Calif. , told LiveScience .
" It would be nice to do more animal studies along these lines . "
Past research on human brain tissues and experiments with rats have suggested that synthetic analogues of THC can reduce the inflammation and prevent the mental decline associated with Alzheimer 's disease .
However , marijuana is not necessarily good for the mind .
Prior investigations have shown that years of heavy marijuana use , consisting of four or more joints a week , can impair memory , decision making , and the ability to pay attention to more than one thing at a time .
In a column on March 23 ( “ A Vision , Bruised and Dented “ ) , David Brooks of the New York Times wrote about “ the rise of what Richard Lowry of the National Review calls the ‘ To Hell With Them ’ Hawks . ”
In part , Brooks characterized these hawks as being conservatives who “ look at car bombs and cartoon riots and wonder whether Islam is really a religion of peace . ”
One of the advantages of history is that you have to check such thoughts at the door .
If Islam ca n’t be considered a “ religion of peace , ” thanks to what Mike Davis calls “ the quotidian workhorse of urban terrorism , ” then at least its jihadists join a roiling crowd of less - than - peaceful car - bombers that has included Jews , Christians , Hindus , anarchists , French colonials , Mafiosos , members of the Irish Republican Army , and CIA operatives , among others .
Now , consider joining TomDispatch in one of the more original and less expectable voyages into the recent history of our world .
The car bomb seems such a weapon of the moment that who even knew it had an 80 - year - long , tortured history .
But Mike Davis , whose most recent projects include the only significant book on the avian flu , The Monster at Our Door , and Planet of Slums , a startling analysis of the way significant parts of our planet have been rapidly urbanizing and de-industrializing all at once , almost invariably produces the unexpected .
This week , TomDispatch offers his two - part history of the car bomb , a series that puts one of the more terrifying phenomena of our moment into a new perspective and shines a dazzling light into any number of dark corners of our recent past .
It will , at some future point , be expanded into a small book , and so Davis would like to hear from anyone with information on other car bomb campaigns of the last half century .

A History of the Car Bomb ( Part 1 )
by Mike Davis
Buda ’s Wagon ( 1920 )
“ You have shown no pity to us !
We will do likewise .
We will dynamite you ! “
– Anarchist warning ( 1919 )
On a warm September day in 1920 , a few months after the arrest of his comrades Sacco and Vanzetti , a vengeful Italian anarchist named Mario Buda parked his horse - drawn wagon near the corner of Wall and Broad Streets , directly across from J. P. Morgan Company .
He nonchalantly climbed down and disappeared , unnoticed , into the lunchtime crowd .
A few blocks away , a startled postal worker found strange leaflets warning : “ Free the Political Prisoners or it will be Sure Death for All of You ! ”
They were signed : “ American Anarchist Fighters . ”
The bells of nearby Trinity Church began to toll at noon .
When they stopped , the wagon  packed with dynamite and iron slugs  exploded in a fireball of shrapnel .
“ The horse and wagon were blown to bits , ” writes Paul Avrich , the celebrated historian of American anarchism who uncovered the true story .
“ Glass showered down from office windows , and awnings twelve stories above the street burst into flames .
People fled in terror as a great cloud of dust enveloped the area .
In Morgan ’s offices , Thomas Joyce of the securities department fell dead on his desk amid a rubble of plaster and walls .
Outside scores of bodies littered the streets . ”
Buda was undoubtedly disappointed when he learned that J.P. Morgan himself was not among the 40 dead and more than 200 wounded  the great robber baron was away in Scotland at his hunting lodge .
Nonetheless , a poor immigrant with some stolen dynamite , a pile of scrap metal , and an old horse had managed to bring unprecedented terror to the inner sanctum of American capitalism .
His Wall Street bomb was the culmination of a half - century of anarchist fantasies about avenging angels made of dynamite ; but it was also an invention , like Charles Babbage ’s Difference Engine , far ahead of the imagination of its time .
Only after the barbarism of strategic bombing had become commonplace , and when air forces routinely pursued insurgents into the labyrinths of poor cities , would the truly radical potential of Buda ’s “ infernal machine ” be fully realized .
Buda ’s wagon was , in essence , the prototype car bomb : the first use of an inconspicuous vehicle , anonymous in almost any urban setting , to transport large quantities of high explosive into precise range of a high - value target .
It was not replicated , as far as I have been able to determine , until Jan. 12 , 1947 , when the Stern Gang drove a truckload of explosives into a British police station in Haifa , Palestine , killing four and injuring 140 .
The Stern Gang ( a pro-fascist splinter group led by Avraham Stern that broke away from the right - wing Zionist paramilitary Irgun ) would soon use truck and car bombs to kill Palestinians as well : a creative atrocity immediately reciprocated by British deserters fighting on the side of Palestinian nationalists .
Vehicle bombs thereafter were used sporadically  producing notable massacres in Saigon ( 1952 ) , Algiers ( 1962 ) , and Palermo ( 1963 )  but the gates of hell were only truly opened in 1972 , when the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) accidentally , so the legend goes , improvised the first ammonium nitrate - fuel oil ( ANFO ) car bomb .
These new - generation bombs , requiring only ordinary industrial ingredients and synthetic fertilizer , were cheap to fabricate and astonishingly powerful : they elevated urban terrorism from the artisanal to the industrial level , and made possible sustained blitzes against entire city centers as well as the complete destruction of ferro - concrete skyscrapers and residential blocks .
The car bomb , in other words , suddenly became a semi-strategic weapon that , under certain circumstances , was comparable to airpower in its ability to knock out critical urban nodes and headquarters as well as terrorize the populations of entire cities .
Indeed , the suicide truck bombs that devastated the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 prevailed  at least in a geopolitical sense  over the combined firepower of the fighter - bombers and battleships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet and forced the Reagan administration to retreat from Lebanon .
Hezbollah ’s ruthless and brilliant use of car bombs in Lebanon in the 1980s to counter the advanced military technology of the United States , France , and Israel soon emboldened a dozen other groups to bring their insurgencies and jihads home to the metropolis .
Some of the new - generation car bombers were graduates of terrorism schools set up by the CIA and Pakistani intelligence ( the ISI ) , with Saudi financing , in the mid-1980s to train mujahedin to terrorize the Russians then occupying Kabul .
Between 1992 and 1998 , 16 major vehicle bomb attacks in 13 different cities killed 1,050 people and wounded nearly 12,000 .
More importantly from a geopolitical standpoint , the IRA and Gama ’a al - Islamiyya inflicted billions of dollars of damage on the two leading control - centers of the world economy  the city of London ( 1992 , 1993 , and 1996 ) and lower Manhattan ( 1993 )  and forced a reorganization of the global reinsurance industry .
In the new millennium , 85 years after that first massacre on Wall Street , car bombs have become almost as generically global as iPods and HIV - AIDS , cratering the streets of cities from Bogota to Bali .
Suicide truck bombs , once the distinctive signature of Hezbollah , have been franchised to Sri Lanka , Chechnya / Russia , Turkey , Egypt , Kuwait , and Indonesia .
On any graph of urban terrorism , the curve representing car bombs is rising steeply , almost exponentially .
U.S. - occupied Iraq , of course , is a relentless inferno with more than 9,000 casualties  mainly civilian  attributed to vehicle bombs in the two - year period between July 2003 and June 2005 .
Since then , the frequency of car - bomb attacks has dramatically increased : 140 per month in the fall of 2005 , 13 in Baghdad on New Year ’s Day 2006 alone .
If roadside bombs or IEDs are the most effective device against American armored vehicles , car bombs are the weapon of choice for slaughtering Shi’ite civilians in front of mosques and markets and instigating an apocalyptic sectarian war .
Under siege from weapons indistinguishable from ordinary traffic , the apparatuses of administration and finance are retreating inside “ rings of steel ” and “ green zones , ” but the larger challenge of the car bomb seems intractable .
Stolen nukes , sarin gas , and anthrax may be the “ sum of our fears , ” but the car bomb is the quotidian workhorse of urban terrorism .
Before considering its genealogy , however , it may be helpful to summarize those characteristics that make Buda ’s wagon such a formidable and undoubtedly permanent source of urban insecurity .
First , vehicle bombs are stealth weapons of surprising power and destructive efficiency .
Trucks , vans , or even SUVs can easily transport the equivalent of several conventional 1,000 - pound bombs to the doorstep of a prime target .
Moreover , their destructive power is still evolving , thanks to the constant tinkering of ingenious bomb - makers .
We have yet to face the full horror of semi- trailer - sized explosions with a lethal blast range of 200 yards or of dirty bombs sheathed in enough nuclear waste to render mid-Manhattan radioactive for generations .
Second , they are extraordinarily cheap : 40 or 50 people can be massacred with a stolen car and maybe $ 400 of fertilizer and bootlegged electronics .
Ramzi Yousef , the mastermind of the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center , bragged that his most expensive outlay was in long - distance phone calls .
The explosive itself ( one half ton of urea ) cost $ 3,615 plus the $ 59 per day rental for a 10 - foot - long Ryder van .
In contrast , the cruise missiles that have become the classic American riposte to overseas terrorist attacks cost $ 1.1 million each .
Third , car bombings are operationally simple to organize .
Although some still refuse to believe that Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols did n’t have secret assistance from a government or dark entity , two men in the proverbial phone booth  a security - guard and a farmer  successfully planned and executed the horrendous Oklahoma City bombing with instructional books and information acquired from the gun -show circuit .
Fourth , like even the “ smartest ” of aerial bombs , car bombs are inherently indiscriminate : “ Collateral damage ” is virtually inevitable .
If the logic of an attack is to slaughter innocents and sow panic in the widest circle , to operate a “ strategy of tension , ” or just to demoralize a society , car bombs are ideal .
But they are equally effective at destroying the moral credibility of a cause and alienating its mass base of support , as both the IRA and the ETA in Spain have independently discovered .
The car bomb is an inherently fascist weapon .
Fifth , car bombs are highly anonymous and leave minimal forensic evidence .
Buda quietly went home to Italy , leaving William Burns , J. Edgar Hoover , and the Bureau of Investigation ( later , to be renamed the FBI ) to make fools of themselves as they chased one false lead after another for a decade .
Most of Buda ’s descendants have also escaped identification and arrest .
Anonymity , in addition , greatly recommends car bombs to those who like to disguise their handiwork , including the CIA , the Israeli Mossad , the Syrian GSD , the Iranian Pasdaran , and the Pakistani ISI  all of whom have caused unspeakable carnage with such devices .
Preliminary Detonations ( 1948 -63 )
“ Reds ’ Time Bombs Rip Saigon Center ”
– New York Times ’ headline ( Jan. 10 , 1952 )
The members of the Stern Gang were ardent students of violence , self - declared Jewish admirers of Mussolini who steeped themselves in the terrorist traditions of the pre-1917 Russian Socialist - Revolutionary Party , the Macedonian IMRO , and the Italian Blackshirts .
As the most extreme wing of the Zionist movement in Palestine  “ fascists ” to the Haganah and “ terrorists ” to the British  they were morally and tactically unfettered by considerations of diplomacy or world opinion .
They had a fierce and well - deserved reputation for the originality of their operations and the unexpectedness of their attacks .
On Jan. 12 , 1947 , as part of their campaign to prevent any compromise between mainstream Zionism and the British Labor government , they exploded a powerful truck bomb in the central police station in Haifa , resulting in 144 casualties .
Three months later , they repeated the tactic in Tel Aviv , blowing up the Sarona police barracks ( five dead ) with a stolen postal truck filled with dynamite .
In December 1947 , following the UN vote to partition Palestine , full - scale fighting broke out between Jewish and Arab communities from Haifa to Gaza .
The Stern Gang , which rejected anything less than the restoration of a biblical Israel , now gave the truck bomb its debut as a weapon of mass terror .
On Jan. 4 , 1948 , two men in Arab dress drove a truck ostensibly loaded with oranges into the center of Jaffa and parked it next to the New Seray Building , which housed the Palestinian municipal government as well as a soup - kitchen for poor children .
They cooly lingered for coffee at a nearby café before leaving a few minutes ahead of the detonation .
“ A thunderous explosion , ” writes Adam LeBor in his history of Jaffa , “ then shook the city .
Broken glass and shattered masonry blew out across Clock Tower Square .
The New Seray ’s centre and side walls collapsed in a pile of rubble and twisted beams .
Only the neo-classical façade survived .
After a moment of silence , the screams began , 26 were killed , hundreds injured .
Most were civilians , including many children eating at the charity kitchen . ”
The bomb missed the local Palestinian leadership who had moved to another building , but the atrocity was highly successful in terrifying residents and setting the stage for their eventual flight .
It also provoked the Palestinians to cruel repayment in kind .
The Arab High Committee had its own secret weapon  blond - haired British deserters , fighting on the side of the Palestinians .
Nine days after the Jaffa bombing , some of these deserters , led by Eddie Brown , a former police corporal whose brother had been murdered by the Irgun , commandeered a postal delivery truck which they packed with explosives and detonated in the center of Haifa ’s Jewish quarter , injuring 50 people .
Two weeks later , Brown , driving a stolen car and followed by a five - ton truck driven by a Palestinian in a police uniform , successfully passed through British and Haganah checkpoints and entered Jerusalem ’s New City .
The driver parked in front of the Palestine Post , lit the fuse , and then escaped with Brown in his car .
The newspaper headquarters was devastated with one dead and 20 wounded .
According to a chronicler of the episode , Abdel Kader el - Husseini , the military leader of the Arab Higher Committee , was so impressed by the success of these operations  inadvertently inspired by the Stern Gang  that he authorized an ambitious sequel employing six British deserters .
“ This time three trucks were used , escorted by a stolen British armored car with a young blond man in police uniform standing in the turret . ”
Again , the convoy easily passed through checkpoints and drove to the Atlantic Hotel on Ben Yehuda Street .
A curious night watchman was murdered when he confronted the gang , who then drove off in the armored car after setting charges in the three trucks .
The explosion was huge and the toll accordingly grim : 46 dead and 130 wounded .
The window of opportunity for such attacks  the possibility of passing from one zone to another  was rapidly closing as Palestinians and Jews braced for all - out warfare , but a final attack prefigured the car bomb ’s brilliant future as a tool of assassination .
On March 11 , the official limousine of the American consul - general , flying the stars and stripes and driven by the usual chauffeur , was admitted to the courtyard of the heavily - guarded Jewish Agency compound .
The driver , a Christian Palestinian named Abu Yussef , hoped to kill Zionist leader David Ben Gurion , but the limousine was moved just before it exploded ; nonetheless , 13 officials of the Jewish Foundation Fund died and 40 were injured .
This brief but furious exchange of car bombs between Arabs and Jews would enter into the collective memory of their conflict , but would not be resumed on a large scale until Israel and its Phalangist allies began to terrorize West Beirut with bombings in 1981 : a provocation that would awake a Shi’ite sleeping dragon .
Meanwhile , the real sequel was played out in Saigon : a series of car and motorcycle bomb atrocities in 1952 - 53 that Graham Greene incorporated into the plot of his novel , The Quiet American , and which he portrayed as secretly orchestrated by his CIA operative Alden Pyle , who is conspiring to substitute a pro-American party for both the Viet - Minh ( upon whom the actual bombings would be blamed ) and the French ( who are unable to guarantee public safety ) .
The real - life Quiet American was the counterinsurgency expert Col. Edward Lansdale ( fresh from victories against peasant Communists in the Philippines ) , and the real leader of the “ Third Force ” was his protégé , Gen. Trinh Minh
The of the Cao Dai religious sect .
There is no doubt , writes
The ’s biographer , that the general “ instigated many terrorist outrages in Saigon , using clockwork plastic charges loaded into vehicles , or hidden inside bicycle frames with charges .
Notably , the Li An Minh [ The ’s army ] blew up cars in front of the Opera House in Saigon in 1952 .
These ‘ time - bombs ’ were reportedly made of 50 - kg ordnance , used by the French air force , unexploded and collected by the Li An Minh . ”
Lansdale was dispatched to Saigon by Allen Dulles of the CIA some months after the Opera atrocity ( hideously immortalized in a Life photographer ’s image of the upright corpse of a rickshaw driver with both legs blown off ) , which was officially blamed on Ho Chi Minh .
Although Lansdale was well aware of Gen .
The ’s authorship of these sophisticated attacks ( the explosives were hidden in false compartments next to car gas tanks ) , he nonetheless championed the Cao Dai warlord as a patriot in the mould of Washington and Jefferson .
After either French agents or Viet - Minh cadre assassinated The , Lansdale eulogized him to a journalist as “ a good man .
He was moderate , he was a pretty good general , he was on our side , and he cost twenty - five thousand dollars . ”
Whether by emulation or reinvention , car bombs showed up next in another war - torn French colony 
Algiers during the last days of the pied noirs or French colonial settlers .
Some of the embittered French officers in Saigon in 1952 - 53 would also become cadres of the Organisation de l’Armé Secrete ( OAS ) , led by General Raoul Salan .
In April 1961 , after the failure of its uprising against French President Charles de Gaulle , who was prepared to negotiate a settlement with the Algerian rebels , the OAS turned to terrorism  a veritable festival de plastique  with all the formidable experience of its veteran paratroopers and legionnaires .
Its declared enemies included De Gaulle himself , French security forces , communists , peace activists ( including philosopher and activist Jean - Paul Sartre ) , and especially Algerian civilians .
The most deadly of their car bombs killed 62 Muslim stevedores lining up for work at the docks in Algiers in May 1962 , but succeeded only in bolstering the Algerian resolve to drive all the pied - noirs into the sea .
The next destination for the car bomb was Palermo , Sicily .
Angelo La Barbera , the Mafia capo of Palermo - Center , undoubtedly paid careful attention to the Algerian bombings and may even have borrowed some OAS expertise when he launched his devastating attack on his Mafia rival , “ Little Bird ” Greco , in February 1963 .
Greco ’s bastion was the town of Ciaculli outside Palermo where he was protected by an army of henchmen .
La Barbera surmounted this obstacle with the aid of the Alfa Romeo Giulietta .
“ This dainty four - door family saloon , ” writes John Dickie in his history of the Cosa Nostra , “ was one of the symbols of Italy ’s economic miracle  ‘ svelte , practical , comfortable , safe , and convenient , ’ as the adverts proclaimed . ”
The first explosive - packed Giulietta destroyed Greco ’s house ; the second , a few weeks later , killed one of his key allies .
Greco ’s gunmen retaliated , wounding La Barbera in Milan in May ; in response , La Barbera ’s ambitious lieutenants Pietro Torreta and Tommaso Buscetta ( later to become the most famous of all Mafia pentiti ) unleashed more deadly Giuliettas .
On June 30 , 1963 , “ the umpteenth Giulietta stuffed with TNT ” was left in one of the tangerine groves that surround Ciaculli .
A tank of butane with a fuse was clearly visible in the back seat .
A Giulietta had already exploded that morning in a nearby town , killing two people , so the carabinieri were cautious and summoned army engineers for assistance .
“ Two hours later two bomb disposal experts arrived , cut the fuse , and pronounced the vehicle safe to approach .
But when Lt. Mario Malausa made to inspect the contents of the boot , he detonated the huge quantity of TNT it contained .
He and six other men were blown to pieces by an explosion that scorched and stripped the tangerine trees for hundreds of metres around . ”
( The site is today marked by one of the several monuments to bomb victims in the Palermo region . )
Before this “ First Mafia War ” ended in 1964 , the Sicilian population had learned to tremble at the very sight of a Giulietta , and car bombings had become a permanent part of the Mafia repertoire .
They were employed again during an even bloodier second Mafia war or Matanza in 1981 - 83 , then turned against the Italian public in the early 1990s after the conviction of Cosa Nostra leaders in a series of sensational “ maxi- trials . ”
The most notorious of these blind - rage car bombings  presumably organized by “ Tractor ” Provenzano and his notorious Corleonese gang  was the explosion in May 1993 that damaged the world - famous Uffizi Gallery in the heart of Florence and killed five pedestrians , injuring 40 others .
“ The Black Stuff ”
“ We could feel the rattle where we stood .
Then we knew we were onto something , and it took off from there . ”
– IRA veteran talking about the first ANFO car bomb
The first - generation car bombs  Jaffa - Jerusalem , Saigon , Algiers , and Palermo  were deadly enough ( with a maximum yield usually equal to several hundred pounds of TNT ) , but required access to stolen industrial or military explosives .
Journeymen bomb - makers , however , were aware of a homemade alternative  notoriously dangerous to concoct , but offering almost unlimited vistas of destruction at a low cost .
Ammonium nitrate is a universally available synthetic fertilizer and industrial ingredient with extraordinary explosive properties , as witnessed by such accidental cataclysms as an explosion at a chemical plant in Oppau , Germany , in 1921  the shock waves were felt 150 miles away and only a vast crater remained where the plant had been  and a Texas City disaster in 1947 ( 600 dead and 90 percent of the town structurally damaged ) .
Ammonium nitrate is sold in half - ton quantities affordable by even the most cash - strapped terrorist , but the process of mixing it with fuel oil to create an ANFO explosive is more than a little tricky as the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) found out in late 1971 .
“ The car bomb was [ re ] discovered entirely by accident , ” explains journalist Ed Maloney in his The Secret History of the IRA , “ but its deployment by the Belfast IRA was not .
The chain of events began in late December 1971 when the IRA ’s quartermaster general , Jack McCabe , was fatally injured in an explosion caused when an experimental , fertilizer - based homemade mix known as the ‘ black stuff ’ exploded as he was blending it with a shovel in his garage on the northern outskirts of Dublin .
[ Provisionals ’ ]
GHQ warned that the mix was too dangerous to handle , but Belfast had already received a consignment , and someone had the idea of disposing of it by dumping it in a car with a fuse and a timer and leaving it somewhere in downtown Belfast . ”
The resulting explosion made a big impression upon the Belfast leadership .
The “ black stuff ”  which the IRA soon learned how to handle safely  freed the underground army from supply - side constraints : the car bomb enhanced destructive capacity yet reduced the likelihood of Volunteers being arrested or accidentally blown up .
The ANFO - car bomb combination , in other words , was an unexpected military revolution , but one fraught with the potential for political and moral disaster .
“ The sheer size of the devices , ” emphasizes Moloney , “ greatly increased the risk of civilian deaths in careless or bungled operations . ”
The IRA Army Council led by Sean MacStiofain , however , found the new weapon ’s awesome capabilities too seductive to worry about ways in which its grisly consequences might backfire on them .
Indeed , car bombs reinforced the illusion , shared by most of the top leadership in 1972 , that the IRA was one final military offensive away from victory over the English government .
Accordingly , in March 1972 , two car bombs were sent into Belfast city center followed by garbled phone warnings that led police to inadvertently evacuate people in the direction of one of the explosions :
Five civilians were killed along with two members of the security forces .
Despite the public outcry as well as the immediate traffic closure of the Royal Avenue shopping precinct , the Belfast Brigade ’s enthusiasm for the new weapon remained undiminished and the leadership plotted a huge attack designed to bring normal commercial life in Northern Ireland to an abrupt halt .
MacStiofain boasted of an offensive of “ the utmost ferocity and ruthessness ” that would wreck the “ colonial infrastructure . ”
On Friday , July 21 , IRA Volunteers left 20 car bombs or concealed charges on the periphery of the now - gated city center , with detonations timed to follow one another at approximately five - minute intervals .
The first car bomb exploded in front of the Ulster Bank in north Belfast and blew both legs off a Catholic passerby ; successive explosions damaged two railroad stations , the Ulster bus depot on Oxford Street , various railway junctions , and a mixed Catholic - Protestant residential area on Cavehill Road .
“ At the height of the bombing , the center of Belfast resembled a city under artillery fire ; clouds of suffocating smoke enveloped buildings as one explosion followed another , almost drowning out the hysterical screams of panicked shoppers . ”
A series of telephoned IRA warnings just created more chaos , as civilians fled from one explosion only to be driven back by another .
Seven civilians and two soldiers were killed and more than 130 people were seriously wounded .
Although not an economic knockout punch , “ Bloody Friday ” was the beginning of a “ no business as usual ” bombing campaign that quickly inflicted significant damage on the Northern Ireland economy , particularly its ability to attract private and foreign investment .
The terror of that day also compelled authorities to tighten their anti-car - bomb “ ring of steel ” around the Belfast city center , making it the prototype for other fortified enclaves and future “ green zones . ”
In the tradition of their ancestors , the Fenians , who had originated dynamite terrorism in the 1870s , Irish Republicans had again added new pages to the textbook of urban guerrilla warfare .
Foreign aficionados , particularly in the Middle East , undoubtedly paid close attention to the twin innovations of the ANFO car bomb and its employment in a protracted bombing campaign against an entire urban - regional economy .
What was less well understood outside of Ireland , however , was the enormity of the wound that the IRA ’s car bombs inflicted on the Republican movement itself .
Bloody Friday destroyed much of the IRA ’s heroic - underdog popular image , produced deep revulsion amongst ordinary Catholics , and gave the British government an unexpected reprieve from the worldwide condemnation it had earned for the Blood Sunday massacre in Derry and internment without trial .
Moreover , it gave the Army the perfect pretext to launch massive Operation Motorman : 13,000 troops led by Centurian tanks entered the “ no - go ” areas of Derry and Belfast and reclaimed control of the streets from the Republican movement .
The same day , a bloody , bungled car bomb attack on the village of Claudy in County Londonderry killed eight people .
( Protestant Loyalist paramilitary groups  who never bothered with warnings and deliberately targeted civilians on the other side  would claim Bloody Friday and Claudy as sanctions for their triple car bomb attack on Dublin during afternoon rush hour on May 17 , 1974 , which left 33 dead , the highest one - day toll in the course of the “ Troubles . ” )
The Belfast debacle led to a major turnover in IRA leadership , but failed to dispel their almost cargo - cult - like belief in the capacity of car bombs to turn the tide of battle .
Forced onto the defensive by Motorman and the backlash to Bloody Friday , they decided to strike at the very heart of British power instead .
The Belfast Brigade planned to send 10 car bombs to London via the Dublin - Liverpool ferry using fresh volunteers with clean records , including two young sisters , Marion and Dolours Price .
Snags arose and only four cars arrived in London ; one of these was detonated in front of the Old Bailey , another in the center of Whitehall , close to the prime minister ’s house at Number 10 Downing Street .
One hundred and eighty Londoners were injured and one was killed .
Although the eight IRA bombers were quickly caught , they were acclaimed in the West Belfast ghettoes and the operation became a template for future Provisional bombing campaigns in London , culminating in the huge explosions that shattered the City of London and unnerved the world insurance industry in 1992 and 1993 .
Hell ’s Kitchen ( the 1980s )
“ We are soldiers of God and we crave death .
We are ready to turn Lebanon into another Vietnam . ”
– Hezbollah communiqué
Never in history has a single city been the battlefield for so many contesting ideologies , sectarian allegiances , local vendettas , or foreign conspiracies and interventions as Beirut in the early 1980s .
Belfast ’s triangular conflicts  three armed camps ( Republican , Loyalist , and British ) and their splinter groups  seemed straightforward compared to the fractal , Russian - doll - like complexity of Lebanon ’s civil wars ( Shi’ite versus Palestinian , for example ) within civil wars ( Maronite versus Muslim and Druze ) within regional conflicts ( Israel versus Syria ) and surrogate wars ( Iran versus the United States ) within , ultimately , the Cold War .
In the fall of 1971 , for example , there were 58 different armed groups in West Beirut alone .
With so many people trying to kill each other for so many different reasons , Beirut became to the technology of urban violence what a tropical rainforest is to the evolution of plants .
Car bombs began to regularly terrorize Muslim West Beirut in the fall of 1981 , apparently as part of an Israeli strategy to evict the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) from Lebanon .
The Israeli secret service , the Mossad , had previously employed car bombs in Beirut to assassinate Palestinian leaders ( novelist Ghassan Kanfani in July 1972 , for example ) , so no one was especially surprised when evidence emerged that Israel was sponsoring the carnage .
According to Middle Eastern scholar Rashid Khalidi , “ A sequence of public confessions by captured drivers made clear these [ car bombings ] were being utilized by the Israelis and their Phalangist allies to increase the pressure on the PLO to leave . ”
Journalist Robert Fisk was in Beirut when an “ enormous [ car ] bomb blew a 45 - foot - crater in the road and brought down an entire block of apartments .
The building collapsed like a concertina , crushing more than 50 of its occupants to death , most of them Shia refugees from southern Lebanon . ”
Several of the car bombers were captured and confessed that the bombs had been rigged by the Shin Bet , the Israeli equivalent of the FBI or the British Special Branch .
But if such atrocities were designed to drive a wedge of terror between the PLO and Lebanese Muslims , they had the inadvertent result ( as did the Israeli air force ’s later cluster - bombing of civilian neighborhoods ) of turning the Shias from informal Israeli allies into shrewd and resolute enemies .
The new face of Shi’ite militancy was Hezbollah , formed in mid-1982 out of an amalgamation of Islamic Amal with other pro-Khomeini groupuscules .
Trained and advised by the Iranian Pasdaran in the Bekaa Valley , Hezbollah was both an indigenous resistance movement with deep roots in the Shi’ite slums of southern Beirut and , at the same time , the long arm of Iran ’s theocratic revolution .
Although some experts espouse alternative theories , Islamic Amal / Hezbollah is usually seen as the author , with Iranian and Syrian assistance , of the devastating attacks on American and French forces in Beirut during 1983 .
Hezbollah ’s diabolic innovation was to marry the IRA ’s ANFO car bombs to the kamikaze  using suicide drivers to crash truckloads of explosives into the lobbies of embassies and barracks in Beirut , and later into Israeli checkpoints and patrols in southern Lebanon .
The United States and France became targets of Hezbollah and its Syrian and Iranian patrons after the Multinational Force in Beirut , which supposedly had landed to allow for the safe evacuation of the PLO from that city , evolved into the informal and then open ally of the Maronite government in its civil war against the Muslim - Druze majority .
The first retaliation against President Reagan ’s policy occurred on April 18 , 1983 , when a pickup truck carrying 2,000 pounds of ANFO explosives suddenly swerved across traffic into the driveway of the oceanfront U.S. embassy in Beirut .
The driver gunned the truck past a startled guard and crashed through the lobby door .
“ Even by Beirut standards , ” writes former CIA agent Robert Baer , “ it was an enormous blast , shattering windows .
The USS Guadalcanal , anchored five miles off the coast , shuddered from the tremors .
At ground zero , the center of the seven - story embassy lifted up hundreds of feet into the air , remained suspended for what seemed an eternity , and then collapsed in a cloud of dust , people , splintered furniture , and paper . ”
Whether as a result of superb intelligence or sheer luck , the bombing coincided with a visit to the embassy of Robert Ames , the CIA ’s national intelligence officer for the Near East .
It killed him ( “ his hand was found floating a mile offshore , the wedding ring still on his finger ” ) and all six members of the Beirut CIA station .
“ Never before had the CIA lost so many officers in a single attack .
It was a tragedy from which the agency would never recover . ”
It also left the Americans blind in Beirut , forcing them to scrounge for intelligence scraps from the French embassy or the British listening station offshore on Cyprus .
( A year later , Hezbollah completed their massacre of the CIA in Beirut when they kidnapped and executed the replacement station chief , William Buckley . )
As a result , the Agency never foresaw the coming of the mother - of - all - vehicle - bomb attacks .
Over the protests of Col. Gerahty , the commander of the U.S. Marines onshore in Beirut , Ronald Reagan ’s national security adviser , Robert McFarlane , ordered the Sixth Fleet in September to open fire on Druze militia who were storming Lebanese Army Forces positions in the hills above Beirut  bringing the United States into the conflict brazenly on the side of the reactionary Amin Gemayel government .
A month later , a five - ton Mercedes dump truck hurled past sandbagged Marine sentries and smashed through a guardhouse into the ground floor of the “ Beirut Hilton , ” the U.S. military barracks in a former PLO headquarters next to the international airport .
The truck ’s payload was an incredible 12,000 pounds of high explosives .
“ It is said to have been the largest non-nuclear blast ever [ deliberately ] detonated on the face of the earth . ”
“ The force of the explosion , ” continues Eric Hammel in his history of the Marine landing force , “ initially lifted the entire four - story structure , shearing the bases of the concrete support columns , each measuring 15 feet in circumference and reinforced by numerous one and three quarter inch steel rods .
The airborne building then fell in upon itself .
A massive shock wave and ball of flaming gas was hurled in all directions . ”
The Marine ( and Navy ) death toll of 241 was the Corps ’ highest single - day loss since Iwo Jima in 1945 .
Meanwhile , another Hezbollah kamikaze had crashed his explosive - laden van into the French barracks in West Beirut , toppling the eight - story structure , killing 58 soldiers .
If the airport bomb repaid the Americans for saving Gemayal , this second explosion was probably a response to the French decision to supply Saddam Hussein with Super - Etendard jets and Exocet missiles to attack Iran .
The hazy distinction between local Shi’ite grievances and the interests of Tehran was blurred further when two members of Hezbollah joined with 18 Iraqi Shias to truck - bomb the U.S. embassy in Kuwait in mid-December .
The French embassy , the control tower at the airport , the main oil refinery and an expatriate residential compound were also targeted in what was clearly a stern warning to Iran ’s enemies .
Following another truck bombing against the French in Beirut as well as deadly attacks on Marine outposts , the Multinational Force began to withdraw from Lebanon in February 1984 .
It was Reagan ’s most stunning geopolitical defeat .
In the impolite phrase of Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward , “ Essentially we turned tail and ran and left Lebanon . ” American power in Lebanon , added Thomas Friedman of the New York Times , was neutralized by “ just 12,000 pounds of dynamite and a stolen truck . ”

This is a wonderful time to be a software engineer .
Every new frontier is the exhilarating domain of inventors and explorers .
Life on the frontier can be primitive and even dangerous , but in return pioneers have an overwhelming compensation :
There 's so much room , so much uncharted territory , and everything is just waiting to be discovered and invented .
The 1950s and 1960s were like that .
Computer science was new , and you know the pioneersnames like Edsger Dijkstra and Sir Tony Hoare .
But have you ever felt that all the cool stuff was already done back in the '50s and ' 60s , back when electronic computers were new ?
Consider that all of the major " new " technologies of the past 15 years were originally invented in those early days : Garbage collection ?
Java did n't invent it ; McCarthy invented it for Lisp in 1958 , and published his paper in 1960 .
Object - oriented programming ?
Smalltalk and C++ did n't invent it ; Simula did , vintage 1965 , and released in 1967 .
Parameterized generic types ?
Ada and C++ did n't invent those ; Strachey did , also in 1967 .
Incidentally , 1967 was a banner year ; it also saw the first design meetings for the ARPANET .
But bringing those technologies to mainstream programmers required developing them further , including doing new R&D to make the technologies more broadly usable ( think Mosaic ) , and making them into widely usable polished products .
Languages like Smalltalk , C++ , Java , C# , Python , and many others , and all the smart people who developed them and worked on their many implementations , deserve huge credit for making that big engineering leap .
So , yes , it surely is humbling to realize that all the hot stuff that seems so new today actually existed back when our parents still had to carry their stacks of punched cards to school in snow up to their armpits and uphill both ways .
But Java did bring garbage collection to the mainstream , Smalltalk and C++ did the same for objects and next we 're going to do the same for concurrency and parallel programming .
Just think :
For the first time in the history of computing , mainstream computers will no longer be von Neumann machines they will be parallel .
Given that our applications are going to run on parallel machines , this is a time of enormous opportunity , along with a great deal of work .
Sure , concurrency has been done before ; parallel computing was researched by some of the very people already mentioned ( see Hoare 's seminal paper on " Communicating Sequential Processes " ) , and companies like Cray have been doing it for years .
But the mainstream programmer and mainstream environments have most certainly not been doing it routinely , and we have only now just begun the process of bringing concurrency and parallel programming to the mainstream .
In 2004 , I wrote that " the biggest sea change in software development since the OO revolution is knocking at the door , and its name is Concurrency " ( http://www.ddj.com/184405990).
The concurrency revolution now getting underway will be as significant as the object revolution of the late 1980s and 1990s in its impact on programming languages and development tools .
Just as during the early 1990s we attended conference sessions with breathless topics like " what is an object " and " what is a virtual function , " in coming years we 'll attend conference sessions with breathless topics like " what is an active object " and " what is a future . "
Sometimes it might seem that all the cool stuff was invented in the 1950s and 1960s , and that the pioneers had all the fun when everything was new and waiting to be discovered .
The truth is that our industry is still in its infancy .
We can admire the contributions of the Galileos and the Newtons , but they themselves stood on the shoulders of earlier giants just as we will stand on theirs .
Yes , this is a wonderful time to be a software engineer .
For the rest of this decade and into part of the next , we 're going to do for concurrency what we did for objects and garbage collection :
Stand on the results of past giants , develop their ideas still further , and bring the concepts into the mainstream .
It 'll require using the best techniques of the past , developing new ones , and a pile of work to turn it all into broadly usable products .
But , unlike the object revolution , we can see the concurrency revolution coming .
Pedal to the metal , everyone .
The world awaits .

The epic fantasy genre is relatively new in a commercial sense .
People did n’t start stringing together a bunch of bid , elf - like characters until Tolkien did it in the 60s .
Of course , after that monumental event in the publishing industry , no can make these guys and gals stop .
The fantasy genre , that over bloated , multi-volume epic copycat forum for those with incredible imaginations and way too many books on their book shelves , is running strong , much as it has for the last 45 years .
The books that these authors churn out may or may not be worth reading , but they surely do n’t skimp on the details and the research .
Many people might find it easiest to point to Tolkien and his work and say that everyone with a dragon or a medieval setting is stealing from Middle earth , but to be fair Tolkien did a little literary pick pocketing of his own when he wrote his epic .
From the book , the person will come to know that Middle - Earth is roughly the size of Europe .
Through the information , the covering of the journey will be accessible for the person .
The fantasy genre goes back thousands of years to the earliest epics and longest stories of contemporary literature .
And as more and more people these days try to find ways around the trap of writing yet another Tolkien clone , other classical sources are tapped open and delved into .
The Lord of the Rings may be the poster child of all things sword and sorcery , but if you take a good hard look at the literature of the ages , you ’ll find that there are numerous influences that not only J.R.R
Tolkien borrowed liberally from but every Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan out there as well .
These are some of the most influential pre-medieval pieces of literature out there that helped to form the genre we all know today as epic fantasy .
The Kalevala
The Kalevala is the national epic of Finland and according to J.R.R
Tolkien an ample provider of inspiration for his novels .
Elias Lonnrot compiled the poetry in the 19th century from the oral tradition of Finland and the hundreds of thousands of lines of verse that existed in different villages and households throughout the countryside .
Lonnrot is given credit for the compilation because he essentially recorded all of these bits and pieces and put it together into an epic .
The Kalevala itself is the epic tale of creation and destruction and the quest of Vainamoinen and a cast of other characters to retrieve the Sampo , or magical mill , the magical device that brought good fortune to whomever held it .
The violent , shamanistic quest of the Kalevala has often been quoted when discussing Tolkien ’s world and how he built it .
The elvish language , written by Tolkien for his novels , is said to be based partially upon the Finnish in which the poem was originally recorded .
Greek Mythology
This is a slightly more obvious addition to the epic tradition .
The myths of old as collected by Hesiod and relayed in the Homeric Hymns , later put into a more grand poetic tradition by Ovid , and of course carried in the epics of Homer , The Iliad and The Odyssey .
Most western literature , regardless of how fantastic or epic it is owes its roots to these original works of literature .
There is a reason they are known only as the classics .
The monsters , gods , and titans as described by poets of the time are the basis for many of the fantastic creatures found in modern fantasy .
The themes of these stories are timeless , showing up again and again in similar works and in modern fantasy epics .
Without mythology , it is likely there would be no fantasy .
Beowulf
Beowulf , the first written literature in the English language , first recorded in the Old English in the middle of the 8th or 9th centuries , it is known for its length , especially compared to other old English poems .
The story of the poem itself pits Beowulf , the hero of the Geats , a Germanic Tribe in Sweden travels to Denmark to defeat Grendel , a mysterious beast terrorizing the people .
After Grendel , he is forced to defeat Grendel ’s mother .
When he returns from his triumphs he becomes king of the Geats and later in his life must battle one last foe , the Dragon , which ultimately kills him .
The origins of the story , while always debated , are believed to be Norse , and the concepts largely Germanic , but the tale has endured as the first lasting piece of English literature and rightfully affected those who write epics now .
The story ’s tale of heroism and revenge , power , and ultimately defeat are common themes alongside the characters and creatures that make up the cast .
Arthurian Legend
Arthurian Legend , as recorded by the likes of Chretien d’Troyes and Jean Bodel , and anonymously in tales such as Gawain and the Green Knight is a classic source of inspiration in film , literature , and music , a series of English language ( ironically , first recorded in French ) legends of chivalry , magic , and divine providence .
The results are a coda of sorts for the modern fantasy epic , especially those that take place in similar medieval settings with high courts and knights .
The ephemeral image that most take with them of Arthur and his court is of a grand tradition of powerful knights on a grand quest to recover the grail or defeat dark forces .
The allegory beneath many of these stories , both religious and political is not lost on modern writers either , many epic fantasies taking the concepts and reutilizing them in their own way metaphorically .
The Bible
The Bible as the most widely read piece of literature in the world has likely had a profound effect on many writers , but the stories within are just as important beyond their religious roots .
The stories , especially in the old testament of Moses , Abraham , and others have been reworked , reworded , and reimagined countless times in modern literature .
Along with that , the myths and pagan stories that sprout from many of the origin stories in the bible , as well as the conceptualized messiah figure as shown in many modern epics .
The fantasy work of C.S. Lewis is imbued entirely throughout with Christian allegory , Aslan nothing more than a direct interpretation of Christ .
The impact of the Western world ’s largest religion of course resonates throughout its literature .
The Divine Comedy
Dante ’s massive , three volume trip through Hell , Purgatory , and Heaven has also been of major importance in the development of fantasy literature .
The approach of religious concepts from a fictional standpoint was for a long time in the history of literature , a touchy area .
Writers like Dante showed how to do it and do it well .
Now it ’s almost impossible to find a fantasy epic without religious or magically related roots that take on these themes .
Volsunga Saga
Tolkien famously rejected that his work was in any way a derivative of this famous Icelandic Epic .
That Icelandic Epic was reworked into the medieval German epic , Nibelungenlied , later translated into Wagner ’s Ring Cycle , with the obvious comparisons available to be made .
Many of the motifs of modern fantasy derive from the Norse and German mythologies , both represented in these epics , with the dragon slayer , Siegfried .
Tracing any one epic to another is always a risky business , but for those that have seen or read the Ring Cycle , the influences are clear .
LIUZHOU , China -
In this obscure corner of southern China , General Motors seems to have hit on a hot new formula : $ 5,000 minivans that get 43 miles to the gallon in city driving .
That combination of advantages has captivated Chinese buyers , propelling G.M. into the leading spot in this nascent car market .
Compact and utilitarian , these vehicles , called Wuling Sunshine minivans , hardly fit the big - is - better image of G.M. , known in the United States for producing some of the largest gas guzzlers on the market , like Hummers .
The minivans , which G.M. builds in a joint venture with a Chinese partner , have a quarter the horsepower of American minivans , weak acceleration and a top speed of 81 miles an hour .
The seats are only a third the thickness of seats in Western models but look plush compared with some Chinese cars .
Their development was led by an American , Philip F. Murtaugh , a native of Ohio and a maverick executive who was willing to zig while the rest of G.M. was zagging .
Mr. Murtaugh was able to create in China the kind of innovative environment that G.M. has struggled for decades to achieve in its American operations .
But whether G.M. can duplicate elsewhere its achievements in China or even keep its pace here is unclear .
The implication of saying that there are things children must learn to study is that the children may not want to learn them , because they wo n't know that they are valuable until later .
But if you can't enumerate them all , then how do you know , when you are forcing your children to do one of them , that you are not preventing your children from doing another ?
Also , if you can't enumerate them all , how do you think the children are going to learn the ones you are unable to enumerate ?
In fact , I believe that not only can you not enumerate them all , but you ca n't KNOW
Senator Mary L. Landrieu offered a devastating critique on Friday in Baton Rouge .
" I have been telling him from the moment he arrived about the urgency of the situation , " she said .
" I just have to tell you that he had a difficult time understanding the enormity of the task before us . "
Since then , the news for Mr. Brown has not gotten better .
The Times - Picayune , Louisiana 's largest newspaper , asked Mr. Bush in an open letter to clean house at FEMA , calling " especially " for the ouster of Mr. Brown .
On Monday , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff placed the Coast Guard 's chief of staff , Vice Admiral Thad W. Allen , in charge of the New Orleans relief effort , clearly a move to beef up management where the problems have been most severe .
And on Tuesday , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , in calling for FEMA to be made a separate cabinet - level agency , said its director should have emergency management experience .
Mr. Brown 's friends say they have cringed watching the criticism of a man they describe as compassionate and dedicated to difficult work .
Mary Ann Karns , who worked as city attorney in Edmond , Okla . , in the 1970's when Mr. Brown was her assistant , said , " He was interested in politics not for glory and not for power , but because he wanted to make things better for people . "
Michael DeWayne Brown was born on Nov. 11 , 1954 in Guymon , Okla .
He and his wife , Tamara , have two grown children , Jared and Amy .
His friends say he is an admirer of Theodore Roosevelt , an avid hiker and fly fisherman , and a collector of antique maps of the West .
In addition to his brief experience as a city official , Mr. Brown has practiced law , worked for the Oklahoma State Senate and served as counsel to an insurance company .
He lost a race for Congress in 1988 .
But the job he did for a decade before joining FEMA is curiously omitted from his online agency résumé .
From 1991 to 2001 , as commissioner of the International Arabian Horse Association , Mr. Brown enforced the rules administered by judges at the association 's 300 annual horse shows .
His decisions provoked a number of lawsuits , including one from David Boggs , a trainer whom Mr. Brown accused of having cosmetic surgery performed on horses .

" Americans ca n't handle another impeachment . "
So say the supporters of George W. Bush in their anti-impeachment propaganda .
The truth is Americans CAN handle another impeachment .
They CAN handle the truth .
In fact , if Americans do n't bring Bush and Cheney to justice after the atrocities they 've committed , this nation will never reclaim its moral authority .
And the people of this nation will be despised for unleashing these dangerous men on the world .
" Americans ca n't handle another impeachment " is n't a truth .
It 's a device .
Like ' weapons of mass destruction . '
' A mushroom cloud . '
' Gassed his own people . '
' Sought significant quantities of uranium from A - f - r - i - c -a . '
These are the sound bytes , the parroted propaganda , which brought us to war .
Each is a proven lie , told time and again by well - rehearsed pundits .
Verbatim delivery .
Robotic form .
Repeated ad nauseam by grown - up children of the damned .
It sounded good for Nicholson in " A Few Good Men , " but rings pretty hollow here .
Americans CAN handle and probe for the truth .
As soon as the midterm elections were settled and Democrats took back control , the Republican parrots flew onto the scene .
The first to land was smooth talking Connecticut Congressman Christopher Shays , who perched on cspan the morning of November 9th .
Within minutes
Shays proclaimed the pitfalls of impeachment , responding to an oped by former Republican House Majority Leader , Dick Armey .
In his article , Armey advised Republicans to " demonstrate an ability to be good stewards of the taxpayers ' hard - earned money .
If Republicans do these things , they will also restore the public 's faith in our standards of personal conduct . "
Shays ' indoctrinated response : " He 's totally right , but we did n't lose that [ the public 's faith ] in the last week or two or month .
We lost it when we decided to go after the President [ Clinton ] and impeach him .
The moment we did that Republicans thought this is how we gain the absolute majority .
The irony is after trying to impeach the President in the sixth year of President Clinton 's term in office we should have picked up seats .
We lost seats .
You would have thought right then and there that we would have woken up .
We never got back to our agenda after impeachment . "
Observe Shays ' specific reference to the sixth year of the President 's term .
The message from Shays to Democrats : Impeaching George Bush will cost you in 2008 .
The message from Democrats to Shays :
We wo n't succumb to your sound bytes .
We wo n't listen to your lies .
An analysis by John Nichols , written that same day in The Capital Times , proves historically that impeachment is not a political liability .
Nichols says , " There have been nine attempts since the founding of the republic to move articles of impeachment against a sitting president .
In the cases in which impeachment was proposed by members of an opposition party , that party either maintained or improved its position in Congress at the next general election .
In seven instances the party that proposed impeachment secured the presidency in the next election . "
Thus quashing Shays ' Republican propaganda .
If America and Americans are to be resurrected in the eyes of the world , proper investigation of the Bush administration is a Democratic mandate .
If , as I believe , incontrovertible evidence of Bush and Cheney 's high crimes and misdemeanors is uncovered , impeachment proceedings should go forth .
Already , prior to any Congressional investigations taking place , volumes have been written delineating the impeachable crimes of Bush and Cheney .
High level symposiums have been held .
Dozens of Constitutional scholars have spoken , all convinced of their guilt .
Conversely , prior to Bill Clinton 's impeachment , just one principal volume detailing his " crime " was prepared .
A scandalous and shameful project , salaciously compiled by Special Prosecutor Ken Starr in a political witch hunt that was obvious to the world .
The impeachment of Bill Clinton was an international embarrassment .
To most of the world , Clinton was a beloved and respected leader , guilty of a personal indiscretion .
Not of high crimes and misdemeanors .
Not of lying the nation into war .
Not of bypassing and ignoring the Constitution .
Not of reversing a Constitutionally prescribed centuries old law .
What shocked the world most about Bill Clinton 's impeachment was that he was ever impeached at all .
It made a farce of our political system , and our values .
Americans appeared petty and juvenile .
Unable to distinguish between what was crucial to good governance and what was not .
Impeaching Bill Clinton was a black mark on our history .
Not against him .
Against us .
But impeaching George W. Bush will be constructive for America and Americans .
It will be educational .
Americans will watch the proceedings and learn about the Constitution .
They 'll receive a long overdo lesson on the Constitutional responsibilities of their President , the balance of powers , and gain a clearer understanding of their own rights and freedoms .
Americans will acquire an insight into proper governance to make them better stewards of their democracy .
America , the nation , will regain some of the moral authority diminished by Bush and Cheney .
The rest of the world will know that America can distinguish between insignificant and substantial .
Clinton was impeached for matters insignificant to his leadership of the nation .
Bush will be impeached for matters so substantial that they caused the deaths of thousands and endangered the whole world .
Americans need n't worry that Impeachment proceedings and investigative hearings will detract from Congress ' time to attend to its legislative responsibilities .
I have the utmost confidence in the organizational skills of Speaker Pelosi .
I 'm certain she will institute a process which permits Congress to fulfill its legislative duties while addressing the Executive 's dereliction of duty .
Unlike prior Speaker Hastert , Speaker Pelosi has made clear her edict to put an end to the House as a part - time Institution and return it to a full - time , fully functioning place of governance .
We will hold her to that promise .
Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid were voted a mandate to probe for the truth .
Though Pelosi contends " Impeachment is off the table , " we patriots contend that it is not .
When Pelosi says " Democrats do n't get even , " we say , Madame Speaker , we 're not impeaching to get even .
We 're impeaching to make even ... the Branches of government that have gotten out of line .
Let the proceedings begin !!
