While Independence Day comes just once a year , millions of consumers are mired in financial dependence day after day .
Too many count on credit cards and their next paycheck just to get by .
The Fourth of July holiday is a good time to resolve to clean up your finances and start freeing yourself from debt , especially because it often kicks off two months of overspending on summer fun .
High unemployment , the prospect of spending cutbacks by strapped local and federal governments , and an uncertain economic outlook make for the possibility of even tougher times ahead .
Make this the year you tighten up your own personal economy and sharpen your long - term money plans .
Here are some essential steps to achieve financial independence : 1 . Pay yourself first .
This personal finance axiom is one of the wisest , but Americans tend to make it a priority only in challenging times .
The savings rate was less than 1 % of income before the stock - market crash in 2008 .
It was still just a modest 4 % in May .
Set aside a portion of every paycheck , preferably automatically , for long - term savings before you pay bills or spend any of it .
Start small and add 1 % every six months as you adjust to having less spending money .
Build up to saving 15 % of all income for retirement .
2 . Keep an emergency fund .
Save a minimum of three to six months ' expenses in a separate interest - earning account .
The fund will help cover expenses in the event of a job loss , car accident or big medical bills , or if you want to switch careers and have a financial cushion while you 're doing it .
Some financial advisers even advocate building up to a year 's worth of expenses since the specter of layoffs looms so large .
Fifteen million people are jobless and the average length of unemployment is 34 weeks .
That 's more than two months ' longer than the 26 weeks of unemployment benefits that many states offer .
" When you work to provide yourself with a safety net like this , you are truly financially independent , " says John Chladek , a certified financial planner in Overland Park , Kan .
" Your decisions are not based on money and you are n't backed into a corner where a credit card is your best option . "
3 . Be smart about credit cards .
Before you can pay off your debt , you have to stop adding to it .
Get in the habit of using credit cards only when you must , and do n't buy non-necessities like TVs or iPods until you can pay cash .
Do n't get sucked in by sales .
Pay off your card balance monthly .
Do n't fall victim to the minimum payment trap , which could keep you on the hook for years and pile thousands of dollars of interest onto what you owe .
Thanks to one aspect of the recent legal reforms , credit card issuers now must spell out on every bill how many years it will take to pay off the balance and how much extra it will cost if only minimum payments are made .
" Carrying a credit card balance is never a great idea , and you will find yourself going backwards , " says Justin Sinnott , a financial consultant for Charles Schwab Corp. in Seattle .
4 . Live within your means .
Or better yet , well beneath them .
You 'll increase your future options .
Setting up a budget and sticking to it is one way to help ensure you stay frugal .
To really achieve your long - term goals , you may also need to take major cost - cutting actions such as skipping vacation travel for a year , getting rid of a car , moving to a less expensive home or taking the kids out of private school .
5 . Insure yourself adequately .
Make sure your medical , home and disability insurance policies are in order , along with life insurance if you have a family .
A setback could destroy your best intentions .
But do n't buy more insurance than you need .
It will slow down your quest for financial independence .

The man singlehandedly responsible for the smallest , " biggest inconsistency " in US budgetary history ( that whole $ 6.3 billion in GSE 's left off the US balance sheet , for the full post read " Obama 's budget has one small , missing piece ... For $ 6.3 trillion " ) , Peter Orzsag , currently head of Obama ' budget office and previously head of the Congressional Budget Office , and also responsible for the most ridiculous budget in US history ( what is the most recent 2020 projected deficit : $ 100 trillion ?
$ 100 quadrillion ?
does anyone even care ? ) is out .
Bloomberg reports : " White House Budget Director Peter Orszag plans to leave President Barack Obama ’s Cabinet in July , before the White House begins preparing its next budget , administration officials said . "
This is arguably the biggest slap in the face of the administration 's failed budgetary efforts : the rats are now openly jumping ship , knowing full well that the US will soon be ( $ 20 billion in debt ) underwater .
Orszag , 41 , considered leaving his post as director of the Office of Management and Budget in April and stayed on after an appeal from the president , the officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said .
Orszag ’s decision to leave this summer will accelerate the process of picking a successor .
Orszag ’s spokesman declined to comment directly on his plans .
“ Peter ’s focused on his work , not on Washington speculation , ” said Kenneth Baer , the budget office ’s communications director .
The departure comes as Obama is putting his focus on slicing the federal deficit , forecast to reach a record $ 1.6 trillion this year .
The president appointed a bipartisan panel to recommend ways to cut the shortfall , and its report is due in December .
Upon leaving the administration , Orszag will likely join a think tank , said one of the administration officials .
Yup .
Think Tank Sachs .
Here are the potential replacements :
Among the potential replacements under consideration are Laura Tyson , a former director of the National Economic Council under President Bill Clinton , and Rob Nabors , who served as OMB deputy director under Orszag before moving to the White House to work under Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel , said one of the officials .
On the other hand , could Peter 's departure have been mandatorily " voluntary " ?
Earlier this month , Orszag announced a plan to force some federal agencies to reduce their fiscal 2012 budget requests by 5 percent to help cut the deficit .
“ As stewards of the American people ’s tax dollars , we cannot afford to waste money on programs that do not work , that are outdated or that are duplicative of one another , ” he said in a speech on June 8 at the Center for American Progress .
In other words dissent will not be tolerated comes to throwing away tens of billions .
The penalty for fiscal prudence is testing the helicopter 's eject seat mechanism .

The BBC has been given the go - ahead for a project which could kick - start demand for internet TV .
Project Canvas is a partnership between the BBC , ITV , BT , Five , Channel 4 and TalkTalk to develop a so - called Internet Protocol Television standard .
The BBC Trust - the corporation 's governing body - made its decision after extensive consultation .
The trust 's Diane Coyle said the partnership " will deliver significant public value for licence fee payers " .
The trust will review the BBC 's involvement against the conditions of its approval , 12 months after Canvas launches to consumers .
The service will see a range of set - top boxes available to access on - demand TV services such as iPlayer and ITVplayer .
Project director Richard Halton said he was " delighted " by the trust 's decision .
" This brings the benefits of next - generation TV to all consumers , including those who choose not to subscribe to pay - TV , " he said .
" We look forward to rising to that challenge . "
Conditions
The trust gave the BBC a provisional go - ahead to become involved in the project last December .
It was decided that Canvas would have a series of positive impacts , including furthering the growth of on - demand TV .
" People with a broadband connection will be able to access a wide range of on - demand content including BBC iPlayer , free of charge , through their TV sets , " said Ms Coyle .
" We have however applied a number of conditions to the BBC 's involvement in the venture in recognition of the potential impacts on the market if Canvas is successful . "
The trust has imposed several conditions on the BBC , including :
Unlike firms geared for a high volume of low settlements , we take the time to build strong cases and client relationships .
The skilled personal injury lawyers of KG Injury Law are prepared to invest in experts and let a jury decide damages when the defense ’s best offer is unacceptable .
Our diligent approach consistently produces favorable verdicts and settlements for families dealing with the aftermath of a serious injury or accident .

Dividend Income Investing – Constructing a Dividend Income Stock Portfolio
Investing for dividend income is a smart way to invest in the market and participate in the profits of successful businesses .
Sure , the income from dividends might not be as tax efficient as long term capital gains , but there are many other benefits .
Depending on your goals and your situation in life , a well constructed dividend income portfolio maybe something to consider .
Is Dividend Investing the Same as Income Investing ?
Great question .
Sure , dividends are income so all dividend investing is income investing .
But income investing can be done in a variety of ways , stock dividends are only one of them .
The interest or coupon payments on bonds is also one way of income investing , and so is private loans to individuals or businesses , either negotiated as a commercial note or done through online debt exchanges such as Prosper or Lending Club .
Income from rental property also classifies as income investing .
When you compare interest income vs. dividend income or even rental property income , keep in mind that their tax treatments can be quite different .
Interest income typically earns the regular income tax rates , while dividend income may be taxed at a lower rate .
The income tax laws regarding dividend income keep changing , but the tax rates are generally the same or lower than regular interest income .
You Should Consider a Dividend Portfolio if any of the Following is True
You are retired or are close to retirement and need a regular , fairly dependable income stream to live on without having to sell your investments
You have a full time job or a business and want to invest in unrelated businesses ( diversify your income ) and generate additional passive income through dividends
You are investing for the long term and are looking for an easy way to find profitable companies to invest in .
Dividend paying companies are typically better managed , and the cash flow is less likely to be misrepresented as real cash needs to be paid out to the shareholders as dividends
You are looking to invest in DRIPs ( Dividend Reinvestment Plans ) either for yourself or may be to teach a child about investing using DRIPs .
DRIPs allow you to bypass a traditional stock broker and their fees for the most part and invest directly with the company , and you get a real stock certificate in your name .
You want the peace of mind that can only come when the stock you invest in shows you the real cash .
Frankly , I like dividend stocks just because they throw up cash that I can than use to make new investments .
This allows me to stay fully invested in my stocks so I do not miss those precious few days of stock appreciation in any year that make all the difference between a great performance and a dismal one .
Whatever your reasons may be , there are many choices available to you as you select stocks that you want to include in your dividend income portfolio .
Your Investing Choices
Depending on your income requirements , the amount of risk you want to take , as well as the level of complexity you want to handle in your taxes , you may want to integrate one or more of the following types of investments in your portfolio .
Stable no or little growth dividend payers :
Most utility companies fall in this category .
While these companies do not expect to grow much or grow their dividends much in the future , these companies have a stable customer base , predictable revenue streams and typically some sort of regulatory protection that keeps competition away .
You will be rewarded with a predictable quarterly dividend stream and you can sleep better at night knowing it is unlikely that these companies will disappear overnight ( Enron and Calpine were exceptions , they went way beyond what a typical staid utility companies do ) .
They also generally pay higher dividends .
4 % - 6 % dividend yield is not uncommon .
Two examples are DTE Energy and Southern Company .
Beats putting money in a CD any day .
Dividend growth companies :
These companies have a long history of not only paying uninterrupted dividends , but they also grow their dividends every year as their business grows .
Johnson and Johnson is my favorite , but of course there are many others .
It is not uncommon with these companies to find after decades of ownership that the dividends you are getting now every quarter per share are actually more than the original investment in each share of these companies .
In other words , you get paid back and more .
If you reinvest these dividends in more shares , you actually compound your dividend income even faster .
Pretty powerful !
REITs : Real Estate Investment Trusts , or REITs , technically do not pay dividends .
The trust payments are classified more as a traditional income .
Still these are structured and more liquid way of enjoying real estate / rental income without the hassle of property management , mortgage negotiations , etc. REIT income yield can be high , but depending on what the REIT invests in , you may be on a riskier territory .
If you want to go this route , make sure you understand what the REIT is investing in .
For example , a REIT that invests in hospitals and medical offices maybe safer than a REIT that invests in developing Florida marshlands for baby boomer retirees .
Royalty Trusts and Master Limited Partnerships :
These are less understood but can be highly lucrative .
Royalty trusts and MLPs also in the strict sense of the word do not pay dividends .
Due to their corporate structure , they pay out a distribution to their unit holders .
This distribution is directly linked to the profits in the business they are involved in , as profits technically flow through to the unit holder .
As a unit holder , you are considered as a partner in the business , which means that you will receive a partnership K1 form for completing your taxes , which might get quite involved .
You will definitely want to get a competent CPA for your taxes .
Understand that many CPAs are also not properly educated on how these entities work .
The yields can be very high and as a flow through entity , accounting expenses such as depreciation or resource depletion can be used to offset your income tax liability .
The risk with US based Royalty trusts are that they will eventually dissolve .
They are not allowed to raise new capital or fund growth so as the wells or mines are depleted , so is the income .
An alternative is to invest in Canadian trusts ( also called CanRoys ) that have no such restrictions .
Most of the companies pay dividends on a quarterly basis .
There are a few companies that pay annual or semi-annual dividends .
REITs , MLPs and Royalty Trusts are your best bets if you are looking for monthly dividend income .
Alternatively , you can structure a portfolio of quarterly dividend paying stocks whose dividend schedule fall on successive months .
This way you are sure that you will be earning predictable income every month .
Julius Caesar began his career as an adherent of Marius 's popular party .
However , Caesar allied with Pompey and Crassus in the First Triumvirate ( 60 ) .
This enabled him to win command in Gaul .
" Cisalpine " Gaul , in northern Italy , was already Roman .
" Transalpine " Gaul , beyond the Alps , he conquered from 58 to 51 .
This gave him a large and loyal army , with which he invaded Italy in 49 , when he crossed the Rubicon River , the boundary of his command .
By 44 BC , he had defeated Pompey ( at Pharsalus , 48 ) , dallied with Cleopatra , married her as a second wife ( rather shocking to the Romans ) , and consolidated his position as de facto monarch .
This was the Roman Empire in most essentials , though disposing of final opposition and the definitive forms of Imperial power had to be engineered by Augustus , who also had to defeat Caesar 's own friend and adherent , M. Antonius M.f. -- Marc Anthony , who famously succeeded Caesar in the arms of Cleopatra .
The cause of the Republican assassins of Caesar ended at the battle of Philippi in 42 .
Most notable among the assassins was Brutus , Marcus Iunius Brutus , " the noblest Roman of them all . "
Although Brutus 's name meant " heavy " or " immovable , " and was used to mean dull or stupid , and is now used to mean brutal ( " You brute ! " -- indeed , " brutal " is just the adj .
brutalis from brutus ) , it was a cognômen of the gens Iunius and recalls the name of the first Consul of the Republic , L. Iunius M.f. Brutus .
Brutus was widely respected for his conscientiousness , integrity , and patriotism -- though Cicero thought him guilty of extortion .
He joined Pompey but was pardoned by Caesar after Pharsalus .
His adherence to the plot against Caesar gave it most of its moral weight .
When Caesar saw that Brutus was among his attackers on the Ides of March , he reportedly lost heart .
Suetonius , C. Suetonius Tranquillus [ " The Deified Julius , " Lives of the Caesars ] , reports that Caesar said nothing during the attack , " though some have written " that he said to Brutus , ; kaì sù téknon ?
" And you , child ? " in Greek [ Loeb Classical Library , Suetonius , Volume I , Harvard , 1913 , 1998 , p.140-141 --
Shakespeare puts it , loosely , in Latin , Et tu , Brute ? ] .
This phrase , among other things , continues to fuel speculation that Brutus was actually Caesar 's own natural son , a twist that puts the whole business in an even more tragic light than it already has .
Although driven out of Rome by riots , in 43 the Senate itself rewarded Brutus with a proconsular command in the Balkans .
Nevertheless , the matter would be settled by force , and after the defeat by Anthony and Octavian at Philippi , Brutus committed suicide .
The Roman Republic thus may be said to have ended with a Iunius Brutus the way it had begun with a Iunius Brutus .
So , we must ask , what went wrong with the Roman Republic ?
From Polybius to Machiavelli and beyond , it was admired as a system of government , and it did have a good run , but in the end it unquestionably failed .
What happened ?
Machiavelli , in a tradition from the Greeks to the present , thought that that the Roman Republic worked because of a mixture of institutions , designed to correct each other and limit the abuses that various pure forms of government would have .
Thus , he believed that Monarchy alone led to Tyranny , Aristocracy alone let to Oligarchy , and Democracy alone led to Anarchy .
The Republic included a ( limited ) Monarchical power in the Consuls , Aristocratic power in the Senate , and Democratic power in the Tribunes and other institutions of the Plebs .
We have other features , such as the custom for most of the Republic that one Consul would be from the Patrician / Senatorial class , while the other would be a Pleb .
Since , for at least the last century , most trendy political opinion has despised the principles of limited government and naively imagined that the more democracy the better , most recent judgment about the Roman Republic would be that it was insufficiently democratic .
Indeed , a great deal of the political conflict through the whole history of the Republic was in the direction of greater democracy , of greater power for the Plebs ; and for the last century , from Marius to Caesar , there was a virtual , and sometimes very real , civil war between Senatorial and Popular factions .
That was perhaps initiated by the two Gracchi brothers , Ti. Sempronius Gracchus ( Tribune 133 ) and C. Sempronius Gracchus ( Tribune 123 & 122 ) .
A land reform bill , trying to redistribute agricultural holdings to small farmers , instead of their being worked by slaves for landlords , got Tiberius lynched by Senatorial opponents .
Gaius continued with other democratizing proposals but also provoked , for the time being , successful opposition .
Their cause , however , continued and would be championed , not always consistently , by Marius and Caesar .
The trouble with viewing this history as a simple Aristocracy vs. Democracy morality play is that in winning , the leader of the Popular faction , Julius Caesar , did not usher in utopian Democracy but simply dictatorship and then a very durable Monarchy .
Disturbingly , this is no less than what Plato would have predicted for the outcome of democratization .
The key to all this is the prinicple of rent - seeking , the desire to live off one 's capital , off the labor of others , or off pseudo - property created by political fiat ( e.g. monopolies , unnecessary offices , etc. ) .
With the cynicism of politicians , this is obvious .
Even uncynical politicians , who may be above mere power seeking , inevitably pass from the scene and are rapidly replaced by more mercenary and venal successors .
Roman politicians are rarely either purely idealistic or completely cynical .
Whether someone like Caesar thought he was doing good or was simply out for himself is a good question .
They were rarely unwilling to employ the support of the opposition if circumstances warranted or allowed it .
None of this is suprising .
More importantly , however , is the fact that democracy can also easily become a form of rent - seeking , with politicians promising benefits in general .
The triumph of Caesar and the Empire depended , in a sense , on the essential tendency of democracy , even if the forms and functions of democracy were overriden and gradually eliminated .
The means of this triumph can be summed up in a familiar phrase : Panem et Circenses , " Bread and Circuses . "
Free food and free entertainment .
The population of Rome , and later of Constantinople , was favored with a free ration -- one reason why Augustus kept Egypt , with its agricultural productivity , as his personal possession .
This meant that large parts of the populations of the metropolitan cities of the Roman Empire did n't need to work much for a living and were provided with something else to do .
The loss of productivity , creativity , and enterprise can hardly be imagined .
The migration of power and intiative out of Rome itself , however , does not surprise .
The state was much better off once that happened , and the simple conclusion that Rome " fell " because of the corruption of " bread and circuses " is falsified by the actually survival , not the " fall , " of the Empire -- something serious historians , and not just superficial writers , often forget .
The subsequent loss of North Africa and then Egypt , the breadbaskets of the Empire , eventually ended the possibility of free rations -- though , at the same time , such reductions in territory greatly limited the resources available for recovery .
The institutions under which this all happened , however admired by Machiavelli or others , obviously allowed for their degeneration .
The principles were not wrong , but their weaknesses can be identified .
When military commands were political offices , the danger of a successful general , with loyal troops , using his army for his own political purposes became very great .
Caesar could cross the Rubicon because his men were willing to obey illegal orders and because there was no army or commander his equal in his way .
In comparison to such a general , who might hold a command for years , the power of the legal Executives of the state , the Consuls , was paltry .
With this in mind , one understands why the President of the United States , in office for a substantial four years , is Constitutionally the Commander - in - Chief over armed forces whose own tradition is apolitical .
The political appointment of generals , especially in the Civil War , has existed in American history , but successful generals , from the Civil War on , have tended to be career military professionals .
Generals dissatisfied with political decisions concerning them , like Robert E. Lee , Joseph Stillwell , or Douglas McArthur , might complain , but would end up doing nothing worse than resigning .
Also , a modern army is so dependent on its logistical support , ultimately back to civilian sources , that no general really commands an independent force .
Thomas Jefferson said that when he was young , he and his friends used to say , " Where annual election ends , tyranny begins . "
He was unhappy with how long the term of the President was , was appalled at the term of a Senator ( six years ) , but was terrified that the President could be elected over and over again .
What frightened him so was the example of Poland , where the election of the Kings of Poland had come entirely under the control of foreign powers .
As it happened , for more than the first century of American history , all the Presidents who might have successfully run for a third term -- Washington , Jefferson , Madison , Monroe , Jackson , and Grant -- declined to do so .
The precedent of Washington , who could easily have been President , or King , for Life , came to be viewed as morally binding .
Thus , the Julius Caesar of American history was no general but a President , the one who broke with Washington 's precedent ( literally becoming President for Life ) , and the one who turned government into a promise of ever increasing benefits , rations , and subsidies .
This was Franklin D. Roosevelt , and the damage done to American government is still evident , not just in the rent - seeking practices that now overwhelm political life , but in the respect paid to Roosevelt by both Democrats and Republicans .
Neither Party intends to reverse the principle , ennunciated in their day by Hamilton and rejected by Jefferson and Madison , but embraced by Roosevelt , that the United States Government can tax and spend money for any purpose , as long as this can be construed as promoting the " general welfare . "
Free benefits for everyone would certainly produce a kind of " general welfare , " except for the effects produced similar to the Panem et Circenses .
Again the damage to productivity , creativity , and enterprise can only be vaguely estimated , though the decline in all of these in countries , like France , where taxation and welfare provisions are much greater than in the United States , is obvious to anyone who cares to look .
While dictatorship is not an immediate threat , we already see one interesting effect , where aggitation for more democracy and honest elections has led to a law , passed by Congress , approved by the President , and allowed by the Supreme Court , that prohibits criticism of candidates for federal office in advertisements purchased by advocacy groups .
This grotesquely abridges the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , and is rather obviously motivated , like most campaign " reform " laws , by the desire to protect politicians from criticism .
Avenues thus open to real tyranny and perhaps even to real Caesars , leaving us with no confidence that modern Democracies , or even the Great Republic itself , might not go the way of the Respublica Romana .
As Caesar was rising to power , one of his most vocal critics was Cato the Younger , M. Procius Cato .
Cato originally opposed all the Triumvirs ; but as hope for withstanding Caesar focused on Pompey , he threw his lot with that faction .
Cato ended up holding Utica in North Africa ( hence the informal agnômen " Uticensis " ) under Q. Caecilius Q.f. Metellus Pius Scipio ( Consul with Pompey in 52 ) , who fled there after Pharsalus .
Caesar invaded North Africa in 46 and defeated the Pompeian forces at Thapsus .
Metellus and Cato both committed suicide .
Cato 's defense of the Republic was remembered in the British Whig politics of the 18th century .
Joseph Addison ( 1672 -1719 , admired more than Locke by Hume ) wrote a play , Cato : A Tragedy , in 1713 :
While Cato lives , Caesar will blush to see
Mankind enslaved , and be ashamed of empire .
[ Act IV , scene iv ]
This was followed by a series of 138 letters under the pseudonym " Cato , " published by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon , between 1720 and 1723 .
These Cato's Letter were reprinted many times , in Britain and in America , and played a large part , after the pattern of John Locke 's natural law and natural rights justification of the Glorious Revolution ( 1688 ) , in the formulation of the ideology of the American Revolution .
Trenchard died in 1723 ; and Gordon , who did not die until 1750 , threw his lot , a bit like Cato himself , with a particular political faction .
The Whig Party of Sir Robert Walpole ( considered the first Prime Minister of England ) , however , was rather more suitable than the faction of Pompey the Great .
Today , both Cato himself and the Cato's Letters are remembered in the work of the Cato Institute , whose efforts on behalf of limited , Jeffersonian , and Constitutional government are occasionally even noticed in Washington .

For almost 50 years , the Franciscan Brothers of the White Cross have run care homes across Spain , looking after the sick and the needy .
Now the Catholic order and its centre in Cordoba are the focus of allegations of sex abuse that have shocked the city .
Image caption A Cordoba Catholic care home is at the centre of sex abuse allegations
They have also thrust Spain into the global dispute over how the Church handles claims of abuse .
The Francis of Assisi centre is housed in a pristine low - rise building on the edge of Cordoba .
Since the centre 's head and two colleagues were formally accused of sexual abuse last week , no - one has been answering the bell to strangers .
Most staff dash through the tall gates , eyes averted .
Only one woman pauses to say that she supports Brother Manolo .
Well - known and respected for his charity work , the Catholic brother is now under a court order to keep away from the centre he once ran , and from its residents .
Moments later , a minibus pulls up and three young men are helped across the street .
All clearly have severe mental disabilities , as do their 50 or so fellow residents at the centre .
New accusations
The details of what is alleged to have gone on have not been disclosed .
In contrast with other countries like the Republic of Ireland or the US , Spain has featured relatively little in discussions about sexual abuse by Catholic clergy
The centre first came under scrutiny last October when an anonymous letter led to the detention of a lay worker .
He has since been charged with three counts of sexual abuse .
More anonymous letters then appeared , and three other staff members , including Brother Manolo , are now under investigation .
In contrast with other countries like the Republic of Ireland or the US , Spain has featured relatively little in discussions about sexual abuse by Catholic clergy and accusations of an institutional cover-up .
Since 2001 , Spain has reported 14 confirmed cases of clerical sex abuse to the Vatican .
But this month brought two fresh accusations : one against a Carmelite monk in eastern Spain , the other against Franciscan brothers in the south .
They came as Pope Benedict visited Portugal and made his strongest comments yet about the abuse scandal that has rocked the Church .
Unlike senior Vatican officials who have talked of a hate campaign against Catholicism , the Pope acknowledged " the sin within " the Church , which he called " terrifying " .
He also reminded Catholics that forgiveness does not exclude justice .
Delay ?
Church officials in Cordoba say they have learnt that lesson .
In a statement issued after Brother Manolo appeared in court , the Bishopric said it was doing everything within its jurisdiction to assist the court , and for the welfare of the victims .
Image caption Most Spaniards say they are Catholic and many are shocked by allegations of sexual abuse
And yet , a Church official has revealed that the Bishopric received confidential information about potential sexual abuse at the Catholic care home at least two weeks before the court stepped in , and informed no - one .
" We heard about it at the end of April .
There were certain accusations , charges of sexual abuse , " Father Fernando Cruz Conde recalls .
The vicar general of Cordoba says the claims were brought to the Church in confidence , and officials began an internal inquiry .
He is convinced there was no need to inform the courts .
" We have to be certain of the truth first , " Fr Fernando says .
" It might be revenge , or whatever . "
He insists the Church would have reported the case to prosecutors " very shortly " .
As it was , the court got its own tip - off , and acted on it .
At another care home for people with disabilities nearby , Juan Solano gives me a guided tour of the facilities .
As the man in charge here , he has no doubt about best practice for abuse claims .
" These cases should be handed over to the police immediately , " Mr Solano believes .
" The police are much better prepared to handle them .
It 's up to them to determine how serious a case is . "
Shock and disbelief
Outside the city 's magnificent historic mosque , now Cordoba Cathedral , a crowd gathered last week for the annual nine - day pilgrimage to a shrine at Rocio .
There 's a tendency to over - emphasise these cases in order to criticise and isolate the Church .
I think it 's probably a misunderstanding Miguel , Rocio pilgrim
Women in flamboyant flamenco - style dresses and men on horseback crowded into the narrow cobbled streets , singing and clapping .
It is a sign of the central place religion still occupies in Spanish society , especially in the " reconquered " south , once ruled by the Muslim Moors .
The procession set off , showered with flowers - a riot of colour and music behind carriages loaded with candles and religious imagery .
Three in four Spaniards call themselves Catholic , and many in Cordoba are shocked by allegations of sexual abuse in their parish .
" There 's a tendency to over - emphasise these cases in order to criticise and isolate the Church , " one man , Miguel , says , echoing the disbelief of many .
" I think it 's probably a misunderstanding . "
The court will now consider the evidence , and Church officials say they will co-operate .
But their language may raise doubts that the approach to such cases has changed much .
" We have to condemn the sin , but show mercy to the sinner as our Lord told us , " Fr Fernando underlines .
" We must show mercy so he may repent and [ … ] go again to the good path . "
His words spell out Catholic teaching on forgiveness .
But that focus lays the Church open to criticism that its priorities are misplaced , from those who prefer talk of " criminals " to " sinners " , and who want assurances that abuse claims will be reported promptly to secular courts , not handled in silence behind the tall , heavy wooden doors of the Bishopric .

Swiss government officials and Geneva - based financial advisers have come to London to lure rich residents with glowing descriptions of the country ’s low taxes , safe streets , private - banking options and convenient ski weekends .
“ We are here to make it easier for you to come to Switzerland , ” says Martin Meyer , head of economic development for the Swiss canton of Valais , which borders Lake Geneva , Bloomberg Markets reports in its June issue …
Fed - up financial professionals say they ’re ready to quit the U.K. because of a lethal combination of high taxes , looming European regulation and public anger toward bankers following taxpayer rescues of some of Britain ’s biggest lenders .
London ’s highest earners must now pay a 50 percent tax on incomes above 150,000 pounds ( $ 227,200 ) that came into force on April 6 , replacing a 40 percent top rate …
As the taxman ’s take grows larger , Switzerland is shaping up as the most - welcoming alternative for British exiles .
Light - touch regulation and the willingness of cantons , as regional governments are called , to negotiate special tax rates for both individuals and businesses have prompted at least 30 London hedge fund managers to consider moving to Geneva in the past year , says Shelby du Pasquier , a Geneva - based partner at Lenz & Staehelin , a Swiss law firm .
Investment management and advisory services are n’t regulated in Switzerland , apart from anti-money laundering rules , and the federal government and several cantons last year reduced taxes on dividend payments for entrepreneurs , including owners of hedge fund firms , he says …
Asked what he had said to Murray as they embraced at the net , Nadal said : " I wished him best of luck for the rest of the season , and sorry for today .

Up to 100 youths rioted for a second night in Rinkeby , Stockholm
Rioters in the Swedish capital , Stockholm , have burned down a school building and thrown stones at police in a second night of disturbances .
The trouble began on Monday after a group of youths in a suburb with a mainly immigrant population were refused entry to a school dance .
Police say up to 100 youths went on the rampage , throwing stones and setting several cars alight .
Two people were detained but later released .
' Little Mogadishu '
Police said the rioters threw stones at the fire engines , preventing them from reaching the school building before it burned to the ground .
The youths also attacked a police station .
Rinkeby is home to a large number of first - and second - generation immigrants .
Many of them are from Somalia , so the area is sometimes nicknamed Little Mogadishu .
Government ministers have visited Rinkeby to assess the situation .

Here ’s a video of the James Corden / Sir Patrick Stewart argument at the Glamour Awards .
It ’s pretty funny though , even if it gets a little testy .
Jennifer Szymaszek / Associated Press
On Wednesday , the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the New York City Police Department can withhold 1,900 pages of data detailing police surveillance in advance of the 2004 Republican Convention in New York .
So now and forever , the reason that 1,800 people were arrested , many pre-emptively , during the convention and placed in a pen on the Hudson River – nicknamed Guantanamo on the Hudson by some – will remain very much a mystery .
Those documents also might have shed some light on the efforts of undercover police officers sent all over the country to gather intelligence on people who might come to the city to protest .
The city has paid out millions to those who were arrested and a Federal District Court judge , along with a federal magistrate , had ruled that the city was required to release the data that led to the arrests , but the Second Circuit decided that transparency could “ undermine the safety of law enforcement personnel and would likely undermine the ability of a law enforcement agency to conduct further investigations . ”
The 43 - page ruling has the collateral effect of preventing the press from inspecting the rationale that New York used to fence off protests and to raid various church , theater and civic groups before the convention .
In part , the city was able to keep the information secret by conflating peaceful political protest with the Gollum of terrorism .
“ The real tragedy in today ’s ruling is that it may further embolden the police to play the terrorism card in trying to suppress lawful protest , ” said Christopher T. Dunn , the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union .
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said it was n’t just police tactics being protected , but you and me .
“ This was an important decision for New York and for the protection of society at large . ”
Nice thought that , but I ’ve covered many national conventions and since the attacks of Sept. 11 , various cities have become increasingly aggressive and proactive in tamping down protests .
The issue seems to be less about public safety and far more about civic hygiene .
No police department or host city wants their moment in the national spotlight with thousands of roaming camera crews to be spoiled by thousands of protesters exercising their right to loud and sometimes messy protest .
There are always provocateurs in any mass protest , but their crimes are measured in broken windows , not a threat to the people who attend a convention or live in a host city .
Since the terrorist attacks , convention protests have been sealed off and in many instances , access to the protesters themselves was limited .
During the Democratic convention in Denver in 2008 , I was inside a security perimeter and tried to leave it to join a videographer to cover the protests .
Both local law enforcement and the Secret Service refused to allow me to leave the fenced - in area , citing a concern for my personal safety .
Whether it is Denver in 2008 or New York in 2004 , law enforcement in various cities have used the permissions granted by a terrorist attack to engage in the kind of tactical aggression that is in a tool belt that is more commonly used by less democratic societies .
And in some instances in New York , the police themselves covertly served as faux protesters and provocateurs .
Jim Dwyer , columnist for The New York Times , wrote a great deal about the surveillance efforts , discovering that some of the subjects of the investigations were a long way from being potential terrorists .
In hundreds of reports stamped “ N.Y. P.D. Secret , ” the Intelligence Division chronicled the views and plans of people who had no apparent intention of breaking the law , the records show .
These included members of street theater companies , church groups and antiwar organizations , as well as environmentalists and people opposed to the death penalty , globalization and other government policies .
Three New York City elected officials were cited in the reports .
In at least some cases , intelligence on what appeared to be lawful activity was shared with police departments in other cities .
Ninety percent of the cases resulting from mass arrests were dropped – many people not involved in the protests were swept up along with people who had chosen to participate – so you have to wonder whether one of the motives for the arrests was a kind of preventative detention , locking up people who otherwise might have created a fuss .
You have to wonder what a reporter like Mr. Dwyer might have found in the 1,900 pages of documents that will remain sealed , but that ’s now a moot question .
Scary , huh ?
This is Izzet Sahin , founder of a human rights office in the West Bank , arrested by Israel last week as he was passing through the Bethlehem checkpoint–and then taken into Israel .
Oh , and he ’s a Hebrew student .
Who ’s reporting on this in the U.S. , beside JVP and Sahin ’s group IHH , which is out of Europe ?
The End of the Bush Tax Cuts The Hammer is About to Fall
It goes without saying that when you come across a man with one leg , it does n't make much sense to take a sledgehammer to his kneecap .
Yet that is exactly what is about to happen on December 31st at midnight .
When the clock strikes twelve , Uncle Sam will be at it again , doing his best to separate you from your money .
~~ad_0 ~~
Without a renewed lease on life , the Bush tax cuts will be gone forever — costing taxpayers $ 115 billion in 2011 and $ 2.6 trillion through 2020 , according to the Congressional Budget Office .
It 's a blow the economy can ill - afford at the moment as the government works to squeeze more blood from the barren stone , leaving consumers with an even smaller slice of the pie and less — not more — to stare down the worst economy since the Great Depression ...
Honey , I 've wrecked the car
But in a way , that 's not even the worst part of the whole thing .
What really bugs me is this :
The same government that is spending us into oblivion will use it as a pretense for making us pay more .
“ We will have to be more fiscally responsible , ” all of them will moan and groan as they stick us with their ever - growing bill .
They 've totaled the car again , and they want us to pay for it .
But that is what happens when you let politicians buy you with your own money .
You reach the point where you realize that there really is no such thing as a free lunch .
It 's as phony as the Trojan horse they sold it to you with .
Even still , these characters never miss a beat , looking for some poor group to offload their bills on as they sell you the stars .
After all , the warfare / welfare / corporate / bankster / police state has to be maintained at all costs — even if it means the village gets destroyed in the process .
Meanwhile , a government of the people , by the people , for the people has become claptrap , as hollow as a campaign promise .
So here 's what you have to look forward to as the government decides once again that you can get by on less .
I mean , you really would n't expect them to scrape by , would you ?
You see , they own you and they 've decided that those chains need to be a little heavier .
Between the endless state of war , bailing out their banker friends , and buying votes , they just can't keep their hands of out of our wallets .
It 's as natural to them as talking out of both sides of their mouths .
No matter how much we send them , it 's never enough .
It does n't matter that 61 percent of Americans " always or usually " live paycheck to paycheck ; or that a staggering 43 percent of Americans have less than $ 10,000 saved up for retirement ...
A bigger bill is on the way in 2011 .
How the end of the Bush tax cuts will affect you
And it 's not just “ the rich ” who will get stuck with it .
For instance , earners in the lowest bracket will see their tax bill jump 50 % , as their tax rate goes from 10 % to 15 % .
Meanwhile , every other bracket will creep higher with the 25 % rate going to 28 % ; the 28 % rate going to 31 % ; the 33 % rate going to 36 % ; and the top bracket moving back to 39.6 % from the current 35 % .
Married couples will be punished again for their monogamy , as the standard deduction for couples returns to the same level as it is for single filers .
And parents will see the current child tax credit of $ 1000 cut in half to $ 500 .
For those poor souls who pass on or after January 1 , 2011 , the death tax also makes a big comeback ...
It slams the living with a 55 percent tax rate on estates over $ 1 million — which is hardly “ rich ” these days .
( After all , a middle class person with two homes and a retirement account can easily fall into this confiscatory bucket . )
Did n't they spend their entire existence among the living paying taxes ?
But the wallet draining does n't end there .
Investors will also get hammered in 2011 , as the capital gains tax will jumps from 15 percent this year to 20 percent the next .
On top of that , the tax rate on dividends will jump by 164 % — going from 15 % to 39.6 % if nothing is done .
For dividend investors , that means that the budget battle shaping up in Congress is critical , since the size of the increase will be a key consideration in deciding whether or not to hold onto high dividend - paying stocks .
The Obama Administration budget proposal for fiscal 2011 does call for the tax rate on dividends to rise to just 20 percent ...
But at this point , nothing is certain .
Either way , it promises to be a blow to the fixed income crowd , as the government prepares to take a bigger bite .
So here 's the bottom line : Without action , nearly every taxpayer will pay more in 2011 — not less .
If that happens , you can write off this “ recovery ” for good .
By the way , if you are wondering what your tax bill is going to look like next year if these tax cuts expire , pour yourself a stiff drink and click here : http://www.mytaxburden.org/.
I promise you that when the hammer lands , it is not going to be painless .

No more 400 % loans in Arizona
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Payday loan lender Advance America is abandoning Arizona now that the state has become the 17th state to get rid of these firms , which legislators see as predatory .
Payday loans are small , 14 - day cash advance loans with hefty interest rates .
In Arizona , lenders of these petty loans were permitted to charge interest rates of more than 36 % .
But on June 30 , the legislature allowed the law to expire , putting the firms out of business unless they are willing to reduce their annual interest rates to 36 % or lower .
Advance America ( AEA ) said it is shuttering 47 loan centers and could lay off as many as 100 employees because it cannot afford to stay open with a 36 % interest rate , said company spokesman Jamie Fulmer .
" This is a tough time to be losing your job [ and ] the government took a hand in losing your job , " Fulmer said , noting that payday loans are " the simplest , most transparent , most fully disclosed product in the marketplace . "
But Arizona Attorney Terry Goddard applauded their exit .
" Advance America made millions in Arizona off a business model that preyed on vulnerable borrowers and charged them unconscionable interest rates and fees , " Goddard said in a release .
" They could have amended their business practices like other companies and charge lawful rates , but they chose to fold their tent here . "
Fulmer said that in Arizona his company typically charged $ 17 per $ 100 worth of borrowed money in a 14 - day loan .
While this exceeds a 400 % annual interest rate , he said that would only apply to a borrower who carried over the loan over a full year .
Plus , he added , his company was providing a needed service during hard times .
" In Arizona they did nothing to address the consumer 's need for the product , " he said .
" All you do is take it away from them . "
But many more states are following quickly behind Arizona .
Montana , Mississippi and Colorado , for example , are considering changes to their pay - day lending laws .
" There are a lot of states that are looking at payday abuses , because a lot of people realize that it's a very abusive product and they do n't want their citizens to pay 400 % interest , " said Susan Lupton , senior policy associate for The Center for Responsible Lending , a non-profit research association .
Plus , the default rate is up to 50 % on these type of loans within the first 12 months , added Uriah King , vice president of state policy for The Center for Responsible Lending .
Colorado legislators just passed a law that will go into effect in August , which will cut payday loan interest rates by two - thirds and extend the minimum loan term to six months , said King .
He said the next state where payday loans face an uncertain future is Montana , where voters take up a ballot initiative in November to decide whether they want to cap interest rates .
Also , Mississippi faces an expiration date in 2011 that 's similar to the one that just occurred in Arizona .
The South Carolina - based Advance America continues to operate in 32 states , but its future in some of those states is uncertain .
" It 's our strong desire to work with the legislatures in Mississippi and Montana to address concerns about this product , " Fulmer said .
Also , the Wall Street reform bill that is currently being considered by the Senate would give regulators the authority to oversee payday lenders .
Updated with an addendum ( see below )
The HTS ( Human Terrain System ) and the U. S. Marine operations in Marja had nothing to do with the presence of the Taleban resistance forces , “ winning the hearts and minds of Afghans ” , “ winning the cooperation of Afghan civilians ” , or “ uprising against the insurgency ” .
The representation of Marja as a “ rural community ” and its population as “ the prize ” and “ center of gravity ” , are part of an elaborate deflecting strategy by the U. S. military machine in order to disguise what Operation Moshtarak was really all about .
Invoking the irrelevant typologies of “ village ” , “ town ” , “ city ” , “ metropolis ” , “ megalopolis ” from an introductory sociology textbook are a layer in this diversionary strategy designed to camouflage what really happened in the desert to the north of the point where Helmand and Arghandab rivers meet , about sixty miles west of Kandahar city .
Here is where Marja , Girishk , Lashkar Gah , and Nad-e ‘ Ali are located .
The area is the site of imposing ruins of ancient Qala - ye Bust and Lashkari Bazar on the once fertile but now deserted eastern banks of the Helmand River .
Girishk , Lashkar Gah ( called Bust in Afghan government publications during late 1950s to 1967 ) , and Nad-e ‘ Ali are named in the media as the staging points of Operation Moshtarak .
The desert in which Marja , Girishk , Lashkar Gah , and Nad-e ‘ Ali , are located received technical assistance for irrigation from the Germans and the Japanese during the 1930s .
The American interest in this area followed these activities .
The United States government has the deepest and most intimate historical relationship and familiarity with this sparsely populated area and the nearby Helmand and Arghandab watersheds .
A general photographic and descriptive survey of Afghanistan with concentration on deserts and major river systems was published in 1943 by the U. S. Geological Survey .
In fact , in several important respects , these four locations owe their origin and demographic , physical , and political characteristics to the American presence in this area during the late 1940s and 1950s when extensive surveys of the Helmand and Arghandab river systems were conducted by the Idaho based Morrison - Knudsen company and the U. S. Geological Survey .
I cannot find the place name “ Marja ” ( or Marjah , Marjeh ) in writing or local lore before 1956 .
The Gazetteer of Afghanistan ( 1914 [ Adamec 1980 ] ) compiled by the British colonial government of India during late 19th and early 20th centuries does not include a place , a community , a tribe , or a tribal segment named Marja .
Nor is there any reference in this comprehensive historical and ethnographic source to Lashkar Gah , Nad-e ‘ Ali , and Girishk .
To my knowledge , the place name Marja first appears in print during the construction of dams on the Helmand and Arghandab rivers in early 1950s by the Morrison - Knudsen ( Morrison - Knudsen - Afghanistan [ MKA ] ) construction company as part of an irrigation and resettlement project undertaken by the government of Afghanistan for which it created a cabinet level bureaucracy named the “ Helmand - Arghandab Valley Authority ” ( HAVA ) — modeled after the TVA , Tennessee Valley Authority .
An American engineer , Paul Jones ( 1956 ) , an employee of MKA during 1951 - 53 , mentions “ Marja Desert ” in his published recollections of his work for MKA .
The 1956/57-1961/62 five year plan of the government of Afghanistan refers to Marja as “ a new desert project … with 26,700 net irrigable acres ” ( p. 39 ) .
The etymology of Marja is rooted in the word “ Maar ” , snake in Farsi and Paxto .
The parched flat desert in which Marja is located is the area where in earlier centuries a branch of Helmand River had dispersed into smaller streams leaving behind the effect of winding dried beds of water which might have been called Maarjoi ( Farsi , snake stream ) .
The Geographic Names Division of the U. S. Army ( 1971:93 ) for Afghanistan lists “ Marjeh ” in explicit preference to “ Marja ” ( probably through a Tehrani phonetic construction ) at 31.31N , 64.07E , identical to coordinates listed for Marja in Wikipedia .
However , Louis Dupree ( 1973 : 738 ) , with archaeological and ethnographic ( 1956 ) experience in the area and a longtime collaborator with the intelligence and military agencies of the United States , locates Marja at 34.20N , 61.59E .
The Afghan government publications “ Second Five Year Plan , 1962 - 1967 ” and “ Third Five Year Plan , 1967 - 1971 ” and the “ Survey of Progress ” reports for the years 1960 to 1969 - 1970 repeatedly refer to problems of drainage and extensive salinity in Marja and the surrounding area .
American sources repeat and elaborate these problems ( United States Operations Mission 1958 , 1960 , 1961 ) .
The most detailed descriptions of the plans and prospects of Marja are described by Aloys Michel ( 1959 ) .
He describes Marja as a 27,000 acre tract occupied by 18 villages , each village housing 40 families ( pp. 180-184 ) .
If these figures have real human counterparts , we could imagine Marja with a population of 720 families .
The average size of these families could reasonably be estimated at five individuals .
Thus , theoretically , Marja would have had a population of about 3,600 during 1957 — the year of Aloys Michel conducted research in Afghanistan .
Michel indicates about the same acreage and population for Nad-e ‘ Ali , about ten miles to the southeast of Marja .
Lashkar Gah ( 31.8N , 64.20E ) , the Afghan government administrative center for HAVA , is located about 7 miles southeast of Nad-e ‘ Ali. Michel ( 1959 : 171 ) provides a detailed drawing of the locations of Marja and Nad-e ‘ Ali in relationship to the Boghra canal which diverted water from the Helmand River .
In 1958 , under the sponsorship of the U. S. International Cooperation Agency ( ICA ) , aerial maps of Afghanistan were produced by the Fairchild Aerial Surveys , Inc . The Afghanistan Institute of Cartography was established in that year in the Afghan Defense Ministry .
Some of these detailed maps are available in the 6 volume Gazetteer of Afghanistan .
Marja is not listed in these maps .
A large ( 4 by 3 ft ) wall map of Afghanistan I purchased in 1970 from this institute does not list Marja .
Highly detailed maps of Kabul and its surrounding rural communities were available at the institute .
A very detailed aerial map of the city of Kandahar and its adjacent rural areas is printed in the 1958 booklet by the United States Operations Mission to Afghanistan ( not paginated ) .
In its detail , this map is comparable to the map that is attached to the 27 June 2010 posting by Maximillian Forte .
A large selection of these highly detailed maps and drawings for the area that surrounds Marja is provided in the volume about the Shamalan project produced by the United States Department of the Interior ( 1967 ) .
Until 1960 Afghanistan was divided into seven provinces ( sing. wilayat ) .
The Helmand and Arghandab watersheds were part of the Kandahar Province .
By 1969 Afghanistan was reorganized into 28 provinces .
Helmand province was created out of the western part of the old Kandahar province .
The newly built Lashkar Gah ( 31.35N , 64.21E [ Dupree 1973 : 727 ] ) settlement at the confluence of Helmand and Arghandab rivers , near the ruins of historic Qala - ye Bust , became the administrative center of Helmand province .
In 1967 Lashkar Gah “ municipality ” ( in this case a sub- province , hukumati ) had a total population of 27,407 — 4844 “ urban ” and 22,563 “ rural ” in 19 villages ( Survey of Progress 1968 - 1969 : 39 ) .
During 1967 the Helmand Province ( including the places named here ) had a total population of 302,842 ( Government of Afghanistan 1968 : 40 ) .
According to Samad Salah ( 2010 ) , a German - educated geologist and former Afghan minister of mines and industries , by 1965 Marja consisted of a cluster of less than a dozen shambled houses occupied by about fifty people in the midst of a totally flat dry desert .
Salah had visited Marja as a member of the joint Afghan - German geological survey of Afghanistan during 1965 .
The American presence in the Kandahar and Helmand provinces through the Morrison - Knudsen Company and the U. S. Geological Survey during the 1950s and early 1960s created the cultural effect of a colonial “ Little America ” in Southwest Afghanistan ( Hanifi , in press , [ see Beardsley 1959 and Jones 1956 for personal accounts of this effect ] ) .
But the U.S. - led combined American and Afghan material investment in the Helmand - Arghandab irrigation and resettlement project produced negligible economic developmental results for Afghanistan .
The reasons for this failure are discussed in detail by Dupree ( 1973 ) and Stevens and Tarzi ( 1965 ) .
Environmental changes including the significant decline in the Helmand River water level also contributed to this wasteful effort ( Hanifi 2003 ) .
The current American imperial venture in Afghanistan echoes the wastefulness of the Helmand - Arghandab venture .
Only now the cost to Afghanistan includes the massacre of hundreds of thousands of innocent , unarmed , and helpless Afghans by the American military machine fueled by Zionism and the American - Israeli weapons industries .
How did Marja , the ill - planned rural community for 18 villages and 3600 souls in the middle of a vast dry and flat desert during the 1950s and an off the main track ruin housing about 50 residents during the 1960s become the home for 80 - 85,000 Afghan farmers in a plush agricultural environment hosting the Taleban armed resistance ?
The answer is simple .
The area in which Marja is located has been surveyed , mapped , and explored by the United States decades ago .
The purpose of Operation Moshtarak was not to drive out the Taleban ; there were no Taleban ; the objective of OM was to test new high - tech weapon systems currently being developed in Israel and the United States and being tested on live human beings in a very well known , perhaps the best known area of Afghanistan .
Talk of 30,000 heroic American troops , invading the “ city ” , “ village ” , or “ town ” of Marja and circulating digital pictures of plush agricultural oases in the middle of what in reality is a parched and totally dry desert are all part of an elaborate scam by the armed forces of the United States and its allies .
Inflating quantity is driven by chunks of venture capital .
On a deeper level , this is another symptom of the American malaise of disinclination ( perhaps inability ) to conceptualize cultural and social reality .
During the 1950s the population of Afghanistan was estimated at about ten million .
In early 1970s AID ( in the context of a family guidance project ) estimated the settled population of Afghanistan at 10,020,099 ( AID and Government of Afghanistan 1975 , v. 1 , p. 15 ) .
The nomadic population of the country could be estimated at 3 - 4 million which will gives us 14 million for the 1970s before the upheavals triggered by the 1978 revolution .
During the 1980s the American government and international agencies began using the figure 20 million .
The current number being circulated for the population of Afghanistan being by its occupiers is 30 million .
I have even seen the figure 35 million .
How is this tripling demographic effect in fifty years possible while global population has only doubled during the same period — from 3 billion in the late sixties to the current 6 billion ?
This kind of exaggerated quantification of the population of Afghanistan becomes even more problematic if we consider some unique depressive demographic dynamics in the country .
Five to six million Afghans have migrated to Pakistan , Iran , and elsewhere over the last thirty years .
Afghanistan has the highest infant mortality rate and the highest post - partum death rate for women in the world .
It is widely stated that about two million Afghans lost their lives in the 1980s during the Russian occupation and the American sponsored assembly - line “ jehad ” .
But large numbers of consumers or clients — real or fictive –generates larger pieces of pieces of capital , larger military and civilian ( NGO ) presence , more killing machines , expanded employment opportunities for young Americans .
In America quantity trumps quality .
Talk of “ success ” , “ failure ” , or other outcomes of Operation Moshtarak is an affair in the production and circulation of packages of lies by the American military and the collaborating media .
For an HTS social scientist to conclude that she had become “ quite impressed by the hospitality of the Afghans ” through interviews with Afghans in Helmand is a bizarre way of distilling and digesting a profoundly complex local cultural construct .
This kind of scripted simplistic prattle is indeed very thin “ C3 ” — HTS ’ “ cross- cultural competence ” — totally uninformed by the cultural , historical , and political complexities of Afghanistan .
The positive and negative results of Operation Moshtarak are available only in the research laboratories of American and Israeli manufacturers of high - tech weapons .
Some questions about the design and public face of Operation Moshtarak ( Farsi , combined , together — “ amaliyat -e moshtarak ” !!
This phrase does not produce cultural gravity in a Paxru speaking place where Marja is allegedly located .
If the target of OM is a Paxtun community , why not use Paxtu language ingredients like “ yaw - zaee ‘ amaliyat ” ?
Were there Paxtu speakers in the 4000 Afghan soldiers who accompanied the Americans in this exercise of togetherness ?
Why were the Afghan interpreters ( “ terps ” ) whose voices we could regularly hear in the media coverage of OM all speaking Farsi ?
Is there a relationship between the Northern Alliance and the “ National Army of Afghanistan ” ?
Theoretically , what are the implications of a strictly Farsi - speaking armed force of Afghanistan a large unit of which accompanies foreign invaders in high - tech experiments in a Paxtu - speaking neighborhood of the country ?
Whichever way these questions are pitched and answered , operation togetherness is another bloody step toward the political fragmentation and eventual destruction of Afghanistan by the dark minded American imperium .
For the United States Afghanistan is the real human version of violent video games on which young Americans spend 5 - 6 hours daily .
Afghanistan has become a human laboratory for testing Pain Rays , Microwave Weapons , and depleted uranium .
The number of defective newborns in Afghanistan has skyrocketed .
But it would be unrealistic to expect anything else from a state that has a thick file of crimes against humanity .
Let us recall the massacre of hundreds of thousands of unarmed civilians in Hiroshima , Nagasaki , and Vietnam ; the Tuskegee experiment and who knows how many more like it ; the massacre of exactly 3,000 innocent Afghans in Dasht-e Lailee in a delusionary exchange with the “ 3000 ” casualties of 9/11 ; the atrocities of Abu Ghraib and Guantanemo ; the bloody depopulation of Faluja and Haditha ; the conversion of the secular state of Iraq into a theocracy ; subsidizing and being a partner - in - crime with fascist Israel .
Everything touched by this fascist apparatus has turned to dust .
Afghanistan is the latest victim of this American Zionist - controlled killing machine .
So , President Obama , General Petraeus , Dr. McFate , the crowd at Ft. Leavenworth , and the wielders of joysticks in the Nevada airbase stop this cowardly , Zionist - fueled bloodbath in Afghanistan .
Stop covering it up and lying about it .
But no matter how crafty your disguise and cover-ups , some of us can see right through them .
History will remember your savagery in Afghanistan and Iraq by discharging saliva symbolically aimed at your face .
The people of Afghanistan will never trust you just as you have not and will never trust them .
Every Afghan hand you shake is physically and ritually cleaned as soon as you disappear .
Underneath all those Afghan smiles and gestures that you confuse with hospitality are oceans of energy screaming : O sarkooza !
palida !
de ma la korna woowza !!
Stop killing unarmed Afghan children and women .
Stop polluting our land and culture .
Our resistance to your defiling presence is eternal .
Get the hell out of our lives !
Go home , attend to the decayed cultural and social spaces from sea to shining sea .
Addendum ( 19 July 2010 )
Producing Proof for the “ Killing Fields of Marja ”
What I wrote in the “ Killing Fields of Marja ” dealt with the dynamics of and the relationships among several cultural and social aspects of Operation Moshtarak .
Establishing the validity and internal consistency of these dynamics requires competence in and / or familiarity with the historical , ethnographic , geographic , and demographic realities of the region where this operation allegedly took place .
Human culture and cultural constructs are arbitrary .
Validity and verifiability , indeed “ proof ” , are appropriate givens in an anthropological discourse about cultural constructs and social processes .
Culture and social relations are not mathematical arrangements .
Logical or illogical outcomes are givens in armchair mathematical formulations .
Meaningful participation in discourse about the military and political dynamics of Operation Moshtarak requires knowledge about the bloody history , structure and operations of the American and Israeli weapons industries and an adequate dose of critical awareness about the thinking and behavior of a desperate , capital - driven , and disintegrating post - industrial imperial apparatus using pre-industrial Afghanistan as a human laboratory for the development of tactics , strategies , and high - tech weapons in fearful anticipation of population centered wars in Afghanistan , Palestine , Watts , East St. Louis , Chicago , and in other locations superpower hubris might take the imperial dragon .
Jeremy , Max , and others on this blog have provided us with rich analytical discourse about this aspect of Operation Moshtarak and its HTS component .
Here , somewhat risking accusations of naivety , but counting on Matt ’s devotion to the truth and his sense of righteousness , I want to accept his challenge for the production of proof for my claims about Operation Moshtarak in Helmand and Kandahar provinces earlier this year .
Not that I “ want a * really * great article ” but to produce “ relevant and factual observations ” and to “ SHOW how it can be proven ( or even reasonably understood ) that military operations have been initiated [ in Afghanistan ] as a vehicle to conduct commercial scientific tests on human beings ” and to ethnographically verify that the Helmand and Kandahar provinces of Afghanistan have been regularly used by the U. S. military and American - Israeli weapons industry as experimental killing fields , I propose a two week ethnographic tour of the culturally constructed spaces bordered by a line stretching from Kandahar city to the Kajaki dam to Girishk to Nad-e ‘ Ali to Lashkar Gah to Kandahar city .
Participants in the tour will include Matt , General David Petraeus , Dr. Montgomery McFate , their interpreter , and this writer .
This writer will be accompanied by three individuals , two observers and a journalist .
Matt , Pertaeus , and McFate , as a triad , will exercise the same option .
All eleven members of the group will be unarmed and dressed in culturally proper civilian clothes .
Except for the two journalists , members of the tour will carry no electronic devices .
The journalists will produce audio-visual recordings of all transactions between members of the tour and the local population .
There will be no military presence or involvement of any kind in this tour by NATO and its subsidiaries in the Kabul government including the “ national ” Afghan army and police .
This will be guaranteed publicly by the commander of the NATO occupation forces in Afghanistan .
This writer will be responsible for his own travel expenses and lodging arrangements for the entire group for the duration of the tour .
He will also be responsible for local transportation and the security of the group .
Members of the tour will meet on September 1 , 2010 at Shahre - Safa , about 20 miles east of Kandahar city .
The tour will commence on this date and end on September 15 , 2010 at Shahr-e Safa .
The group will travel throughout the area and will engage in informal civil interaction including , participant observation and open ended interviews , with randomly selected members of the local population in twelve selected human settlements throughout the area indicated above .
The subject of these interactions will be the contents of what has been written on this post dealing with military operations in Helmand and Kandahar provinces including the contents of “ The Killing Fields of Marja ” .
During the week after the tour , starting on September 17th , all members of the tour will gather in a public forum and air out what they have learned about Operation Moshtarak during this ethnographic tour .
Three public forums will be held : Kabul ( September 17th ) , London ( September 19th ) , and New York ( September 21st ) .
Matt , please start the ball rolling for your - self , General Pertaeus , Dr. McFate , interpreter , two observers , and a journalist .
My team of four is ready .
I look forward to meeting members of this ethnographic tour at noon on September 1 , 2010 at Shahr-e Safa , Kandahar province , Afghanistan .

AN INTERNET service provider has rejected a claim that it supports the federal government 's controversial plan for an internet filter .
The Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy , told The Sun-Herald four of the five big internet service providers , including Telstra , Optus , iPrimus and iiNet had welcomed the controversial filtering policy .
But iiNet , the country 's third - largest internet service provider , denied Senator Conroy 's claim , and iPrimus said it was finalising its position .
'' We do not and never have supported such a system , " said the chief executive of iiNet , Michael Malone .
'' The proposed filter is fundamentally flawed , will not achieve its stated purpose and simply will not work .
It is fundamentally bad policy . "
Most internet users also strongly oppose the filter .
An online poll by smh.com .au attracted more than 88,000 votes , and 99 per cent disagreed that the government should filter extremely pornographic , violent and illegal content .
Noah Sachs , an associate professor at the University of Richmond School of Law in Virginia and an expert in regulation of hazardous waste , said he had been hoping for movement on a bill in Congress that would overhaul and strengthen the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act and allow the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to control the use of some chemicals more tightly .
So far , however , not much has happened .
“ I think the oil spill in the spring has deflected attention from that bill , ” Mr. Sachs said .
In Texas , Mr. Metzger said that while the spill was important to focus on , “ definitely the trade - off is putting less resources into some of the other issues we ’re working on . ”
In some ways , the relentless focus on the spill over the past two months has paralleled the constant attention to climate change over the past several years .
In 2005 , the Sierra Club , a leading American environmental group , decided to switch its attention more fully to climate , and most other groups have also increased their attention to the issue .
As with the oil spill , concerns have arisen that climate change has crowded out other causes .
“ As a conservation biologist I am continually frustrated by all the attention given to climate change by the media and politicians , ” wrote Reed Noss , a professor at the University of Central Florida , in the Conservation Northwest Quarterly in 2007 .
He urged a stronger focus on the fragmentation of wildlife habitats — in other words , humans ’ habit of building houses or roads almost everywhere .
But climate change has the potential to affect just about everything — and it has conversely afforded a range of groups the opportunity to hitch their causes to the climate bandwagon .
This has resulted in some odd pairings : for example , the magazine of the Audubon Society , an American bird conservation group , has advocated “ feed - in ” tariffs , said John Farrell , a researcher with the Institute for Local Self - Reliance , a U.S. group .
Feed - in tariffs are a mainly European method of requiring utilities to pay above - market rates for electricity from solar panels and other green sources .
They have nothing to do with birds , except insofar as clean energy can moderate climate change in a small way , thus helping to preserve habitats .
As for the spill in the gulf , Mr. Plater of Boston College suggests that it may become a “ wake - up call ” for environmental causes across the board .
Mr. Plater should know : he spent two years heading the legal task force of the Alaska oil spill commission after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker disaster in 1989 .
THE arrest of Mirza Hussain - alias '' Babrak ' ' - accused of trying to take 53 Afghans to Australia illegally by boat , is a rare victory over people smugglers .
Senior Pakistani police hailed the detention of Mr Hussain as an example of the growing regional co-operation between Pakistan , Indonesia and Australia .
Hussain 's vessel was in the final preparations for the voyage to Australia when he was arrested .
Mr Hussain , 45 , was arrested in December on the Indonesian island of Lombok after procuring a boat , allegedly to smuggle the asylum seekers to northern Australia .
He was deported from Indonesia on June 14 and Pakistani agents arrested him when he arrived at Islamabad airport .
'' This man is now in jail .
His bail has been rejected by the court because of the seriousness of the charges , '' said Shahzad Haider , assistant director of Pakistan 's Federal Investigation Agency .
Did you know that the Edmonton Oilers had the best playoff winning percentage since the lockout at the start of last season ?
Crazy , eh ?
Well , not any more !
Those darned Chicago Blackhawks have taken over first place .
First Khabibulin , now this !
Here 's hoping those jerks get knocked out in the first round next Spring .
Since the Oilers probably are n't going to make the playoffs , that should be enough to put Edmonton back on top .
The full list of playoff win-loss records and winning percentages after the jump , but for those who like trivia , try to guess the twelve teams with more playoff wins than the Oilers ' total of fifteen .
Poor Nashville .
That 's a lot of playoffs with not much success .
Only the Calgary Flames have played more playoff games without at least one series victory ... :) :) :) ...
As for Edmonton 's current futility , the two teams at the bottom of this chart prove that things can always be worse .
14 Bizarre Insurance Policies You Wo n’t Believe are Actually True
1. Alien Abduction Insurance
The Skinny :
If you ’re worried about potential loss of health , life , property or sanity as a result of alien abduction , you ’re not alone .
But luckily , there are number of insurance agencies willing to sell you a policy to protect you in case of a close encounter of the third kind .
More of a lark than a serious protection of one ’s assets , alien abduction insurance policies have been issued to over 20,000 people since the 1990s .
“ Of course , the burden of proof lies with the claimant , ” says Simon Burgess , managing director of British Insurance .
“ Let ’s face it – insurance is so tedious that if I can enlighten my dreary life with a bit of humor every now and again , I will . ”
It ’s not all for laughs , though .
The infamous Heaven ’s Gate cult purchases insurance policies for all of its members before the group ’s mass suicide , leading Goodfellow Rebecca Ingrams Pearson ( GRIP ) , the company that issued the policy , to cease offering the service .
If you ’re wondering how much alien abduction insurance might cost you , you could n’t do much better than $ 9.95 , the price of a lifetime policy from the Alien Abduction Insurance Corporation .
The Payout :
The value of a policy varies from $ 10,000 to as much as $ 10,000,000 , and the St. Lawrence Agency has even paid out at least two such claims .
The company pays the owner of the policy $ 1 a year for one million years , or until death , whichever comes first . -

2. Mustache Insurance
The Skinny :
Although many celebrities have insured the body parts that make them famous , few have gone the extra mile and insured their facial hair .
Except , of course , for Merv Hughes .
The powerful right - handed bowler for Australia ’s national cricket team was so worried about his trademark mustache that he purchased a large policy to cover the walrus - like whiskers , while leaving his bowling arm uninsured .
Along with his impressive playing ability and large 6 ’ 4 ″ frame , the bodacious mustache made him one of the world ’s most recognizable cricket stars .
The Payout :
Hughes ’ mustache was insured for a whopping $ 317,000 ( Australian ) during his time spent as Australia ’s star bowler from 1985 - 1994 . - Source
The mustache in action :
3. Run-For - Your - Life Insurance
The Skinny :
In some respects , cheaper insurance for fast runners makes a lot of sense .
After all , you do n’t need to be able to outrun a bear to survive a bear attack , just outrun the slower hikers .
That ’s not the philosophy behind Indianapolis Insurance Company ’s discount for 5 k runners , however .
The real reason is much simpler : statistically , runners are healthier and live longer .
Run America Club , an organization geared toward promoting fitness through running , has teamed with the insurance provider to secure discounts for its members , sort of as an incentive to encourage more Americans to take up the sport .
It benefits the insurance company too ; after all , who would n’t want to ensure a bunch of health nuts ?
The Payout :
The monetary reward is a “ competitive , discounted term insurance policy , ” but do n’t think you can just sign up and get it .
You actually need to participate in a 5 k race and achieve a qualifying time .
– Source
4. Paternity Insurance
The Skinny :
Taking out an insurance policy just in case you accidentally become a father may seem extreme , but when you ’re a rockstar on the road , you ca n’t be too safe .
Van Halen front man David Lee Roth did exactly that while he was on tour in the 1980s .
As Van Halen ’s popularity was waxing in 1981 , Lloyds of London issued the policy , which stated that if “ Diamond Dave ” were ever the victim of a paternity suit , the company would cover the expenses .
It was obviously worth it to David Lee Roth : “ I get letters all the time saying , ‘ I got a kid and it looks like you and it needs a bicycle now and some pencils and a notebook by next year . ”
The Payout :
Roth was so worried about a paternity suit that he was willing to shell out $ 10,000 a year to Lloyds .
The policy ’s value : $ 1,000,000 . - Source
Dave at his best :
5. Riot Insurance
The Skinny :
In Thailand , where political upheaval is a way of life , insurance against riot damage is a sensible thing to have , especially if you ’re just a visiting tourist , worried about having your vacation spoiled .
The Thai government has recently grown so concerned about the effect rioting has on the tourism industry that it has issued a blanket , free insurance policy to all visitors .
The policy , first instated in 2008 after protesters seized control of two of the country ’s airports , has been extended through the end of 2010 , and covers “ any foreign visitor who experiences loss or damage from political upheavals . ”
This measure failed to placate potential visitors , however .
2009 saw an 8 % reduction in tourist dollars spent from the previous year , even with the promise of insurance .
The Payout :
If you ’re unfortunate enough to be the victim of a riot in Thailand , the government will pay you $ 10,000 .
– Source
You do n’t want to be in Thailand when this happens :
6. Leg Insurance
The Skinny :
Numerous celebrities have insured their legs against career - ending accidents .
Models , actors and hosts have all signed up with Lloyds of London to make sure they ’re compensated if they can no longer proffer a living out of their legs .
Mary Hart , co-anchor for Entertainment Tonight , is well known for her shapely legs , and has taken out a sizable insurance policy for them .
It ’s rumored that the producers of the show even had a glass desk installed just to show them off to Hart ’s adoring viewers .
Mariah Carey became leg insurance policy holder after Gillette awarded her the “ Legs of a Goddess Award , ” though it ’s unclear why she insured her legs instead of her singing voice .
The Payout :
Mary
Hart ’s policy will pay her $ 1 million if anything happens to her legs .
Heidi Klum took out a $ 2.2 million policy .
Perhaps most shocking of all is Mariah Carey ’s policy , worth an unprecedented $ 1 billion .

Billion dollar legs ?

7. Rapture Insurance
The Skinny :
Not a true form of insurance , but pretty close , YouveBeenLeftBehind.com gives Christians one last chance to reach their friends and loved ones during “ the time of tribulation after the rapture . ”
By delivering personalized messages to non-believers in the event that good Christians are called up to heaven , the website claims it can give its customers one last chance to save the ones closest to them .
Although weird , it ’s hard to deny that the offer is tempting to True Believers .
Yet , this bizarre form of insurance does raise one very important question : if all the Christians are called up to heaven , who ’s left at the company to click “ send ” on all those messages ?
The Payout :
It ’s hard to put a price on saving a soul , but You ’ve Been Left behind will do it for $ 14.95 .
Paypal is accepted .

8. Cow Dehydration Insurance
The Skinny :
Up until 2010 , it has been virtually impossible for farmers in rural Africa to insure their herds of livestock , an advantage that farmers in the rest of the world have long enjoyed .
This has led to numerous disasters , such as the massive drought in Kenya back in 2009 which killed hundreds of thousands of animals , all of them uninsured .
The reason for the region ’s lack of insurance was purely logistical .
It was almost impossible for adjusters to come out and count every single dead animal .
However , this operation can now be performed easily and remotely via satellite .
The Payout :
The policy pays about $ 150 per cow , but the premiums vary depending on region , since some places are drier , hotter or just more hazardous than others .
According to a spokesman for the International Livestock Research Institute , “ Upper Marsabit is more drought - prone and the premium will be 5.5 % of the value of the livestock whereas in Lower Marsabit people will pay 3.25 % . ” – Source
Kenyan drought :
9. Crossed Eye Insurance
The Skinny :
It ’s hard to over state the importance of vision , and out of all our body parts , eyes are one of the more reasonable to want to insure .
But only one man in history has purchased insurance to cover him in case his eyes become uncrossed .
Silent film star Ben Turpin ’s stock in trade were his trademark crossed eyes , which lent him comedic stage presence and made him one of the world ’s most recognizable film stars .
As his fame grew , he became increasingly paranoid about his eyes coming uncrossed .
Reportedly , any time he sustained a blow to the head , he immediately rushed to a mirror , or else asked an onlooker , to check that his eyes had not come uncrossed .
The Payout :
Ben Turpin purchased an insurance policy valued at $ 25,000 from Lloyds of London .
Adjusted for inflation , that would be almost $ 300,000 in 2010 .

The man himself :
10 . Chest Hair Insurance
The Skinny :
Perhaps the only insurance stranger than mustache insurance is chest hair insurance .
Yet , Tom Jones , one of the world ’s most enduring and iconic singers , holds a preposterously huge policy from Lloyd ’s on his chest hair .
A purchase this bizarre has to raise a lot of questions .
Why would he insure his chest hair instead of his voice , or even his face ?
What does he think would happen to his career if something happened to his hirsute physique ?
And what precisely does he believe puts his chest hair in such jeopardy ?
An explosion at the Nair factory ?
Chemotherapy ?
A mad fan with a razor ?
All that ’s known is the enigmatic singer felt his chest hair was so valuable that he could n’t afford not to purchase insurance for it .
The Payout :
Should any of the above scenarios befall Tom Jones ’ chest , he ’ll receive a whopping $ 7,000,000 .
– Source
The chest in action :
11 . Taco Insurance
The Skinny :
Back in 2001 , Taco Bell ran an unusual promotional stunt .
At the time , the Mir space station was scheduled to make its splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean .
Taco
Bell took advantage of this once - in - a - lifetime event by placing a 40 ′ x 40 ′ target in the Pacific , with a promise that if the space station hit it , everyone in American could receive a free taco .
The promotion yielded a large increase in traffic at Taco Bell ’s website , and “ captured the imaginations of millions of people , ” admirable goals to be sure .
However , in the event that the space station actually hit the floating target , the restaurant chain stood to lose a lot of money .
An insurance policy was purchased in case the long shot came through .
The Payout :
The policy covered the anticipated value of the taco promotion , though the company did not issue a statement saying what that amount was .
If everyone in America took advantage of the free taco deal , the retail value of the promotion would be $ 272.8 million dollars .
– Source
12 . Nose Insurance
The Skinny :
They say the nose knows , and nobody knows that better than Dutch winemaker Ilja Gort .
After winning several major awards for his wine , he had a revelation .
“ We won some important medals and I realized how necessary it was to have a nose , ” he told The Times .
“ It is my most important asset .
A lot of people feel that wine making is about the taste buds but we do it with the nose , in fact . ”
With a hefty insurance policy in place , he can afford to be a little more cavalier about his olfactory organ , but he ’s not .
“ Every time I look in the mirror now I feel rich .
I just hope I fall on my face . . .
No , actually , I ’m a bit more careful with my nose than before .
I ’ve stopped nose - picking .
And I like skiing very much but from now on , no more . ”
The agreement he signed actually forbids him from taking part in winter sports , as well as several other hazardous activities including fire - breathing and acting as a knife - thrower ’s assistant .
The Payout :
As careful as Gort is , if something did happen to damage his sense of smell , Watkins Syndicate would pay out 5 million euro , or just over six million US dollars .
– Source
13 . Fantasy Football Insurance
The Skinny :
You can insure almost anything you own , and now you can insure things that you only wish you owned , too .
If you ’re in a paid Fantasy Football league , where participants draft real NFL players into theoretical teams , and your star player is injured , you can recoup your losses by buying an insurance policy from Fantasy Sports Insurance .
The service came into being after Tom Brady ’s untimely injury in the first game of the 2008 season .
Henry Olszewski was crushed when his # 1 draft pick had to sit out the entire season .
“ That Monday , [ Olszewski ] came in the office , and he was bummed out , ” said Anthony Giaccone , president of Intermarket Insurance .
“ He asked , ‘ Why ca n’t we buy insurance for fantasy team players ? ’ ”
“ Why not , ” indeed ?
The Payout :
If your star player sits out a certain number of games , FSI will refund your entire entry fee .
Other companies offer their services to mediate “ disputes ” between players and fantasy sports leagues .
– Source
14 . Erectile Dysfunction Insurance … For Horses
The Skinny :
Horse racing is big business , so it ’s no surprise that many companies will issue life insurance policies for horses .
Horse breeding is big business as well , but it does n’t make it any less weird that those same companies will cover your stallion ’s nether regions with a comprehensive policy .
Redland Insurance Co. , in Council Bluffs , Iowa as well as at least six other companies sell breeding insurance , which allows you to claim damages on a horse even if he is otherwise alive and healthy , if for some reason he cannot breed .
The Payout :
Redland ’s life insurance plan for quarter horses are valued at $ 10,000 .
For an extra $ 100 in yearly premiums , the policy will pay the same amount for a horse that shoots blanks .

Lemony Miso Soup
Miso , a fermented paste made from soy beans , grain , salt , and bacteria , comes in a full range of flavors and colors .
White miso , also called shiro miso or simply rice and soybean miso , has a lighter flavor than dark miso .
This light and lemony soup takes no time to make .
It was served for lunch at a yoga retreat with fresh pea-and - zucchini salad , dense whole grain bread , and fresh unsalted butter .
It tasted so wonderful .
Try serving this soup alongside a couscous salad with garbanzo beans or a sandwich spread with hummus and topped with grilled vegetables .

The fancy new Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer 1844 is coming to China with a fancy price tag : $ 44 a bottle .
While forty - four bones is too much for almost any beer , especially a PBR , it ’s not just an overseas repackage .
1844 is a whole new brew that ’s spent some time in premium wooden casks .
So , barrel aged ?
Interesting .
From the 1844 ad copy :
It ’s not just Scotch that ’s put into wooden casks .
There ’s also Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer 1844 .
Many world - famous spirits
Are matured in precious wooden casks
Scotch whisky , French brandy , Bordeaux wine …
They all spend long days inside wooden casks

UPDATE :
A Gawker reader found 1844 brewing notes from the brewmaster ’s Modern Brewery Age interview back in March :
“ We just produced China ’s first real specialty beer , an all - malt , reddish brown strong ( 15.7 plato ) ale , dry hopped with Cascade ( 38 IBU ) and aged in new uncharred American whiskey barrels …
It ’s being bottled in a nice looking 720 - ml brown bottle with an enamel label and it is called Blue Ribbon 1844 , a reference to Pabst ‘s founding date .
It will only be sold in China … ”

Fears that the Gulf of Mexico oil spill could contaminate Irish shores were today dismissed by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , which said it was “ unlikely ” that remnants of the BP leak could reach Ireland via the Gulf Stream .
“ Due to the distance between the Gulf of Mexico and Europe and also the nature and frequency of autumnal storms in the Atlantic Ocean , the likelihood is that the oil will disperse and evaporate in the ocean , possibly leaving “ tar balls ” which should sink to the bottom before reaching Ireland , ” a spokeswoman for the agency said .
The Marine Institute has said that there is a “ very remote ” possibility that oil leaking from the BP well in the Gulf of Mexico will reach European waters .
It said it had no details on the chemical composition of the oil spilled , but in most cases the fuel evaporates into the atmosphere after some days and “ the rest generally sinks to the bottom ” .
Professor Mark Johnsonm , of the Environmental Change Institute at National University of Ireland Galway , said any tar balls appearing on Irish beaches as a result of the oil spill , would not be much of an increase on the tar balls already present .
" It would take months before it [ the oil ] would come to Ireland , " he added .
The ruptured well has been gushing oil since the Transocean - owned Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and killed 11 people aboard on April 20th .
To minimize the leak 's environmental impact , BP is capturing as much as 24,000 barrels a day of crude using two containment systems but that is a fraction of the 35,000 - 60,000 barrels the US Coast Guard says is pouring from the well .
The Dallas Cowboys announced Thursday they have agreed to terms with first - round pick Dez Bryant .
The deal is for five years and $ 11.8 million , with $ 8.3 million guaranteed , according to a source .
The wide receiver received $ 2.5 million to sign and will earn a base salary of $ 320,000 this year .
He also has bonuses tied in to playing time .
Eugene Parker , Bryant 's agent , said some of the language of the contract is still being worked out .
Bryant , the 24th pick of the draft , is expected to report on time for Cowboys training camp on Saturday in San Antonio .
" This was very important to me to be able to get this done in time for the first practice , " Bryant said in a statement released by the team .
" I want to help this team .
I want to compete .
I can't wait to start playing football again . "
Bryant becomes the first first - round pick to agree to a contract , coming to terms before St. Louis Rams quarterback Sam Bradford , the No. 1 overall pick .
" It was important to get Dez in on time , " Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones said .
" We think he can be helpful to us .
He knows we have a good football team and we 're counting on him to be a big part of it . "
The Bryant deal is a relief for the Cowboys because there was speculation he would not make it to camp on time .
Parker had worked deals with previous Cowboys first - round selections Mike Jenkins and Felix Jones , who both reported late .
Last season , Michael Crabtree , a client of Parker 's , did n't sign his deal with the San Francisco 49ers until October .
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was assured by Parker that if he drafted Bryant , he would avoid a long , drawn - out contract process .
" It helped to have a sense of urgency because it made the deal get done , " Parker said .
" Jerry and Stephen and I have a relationship of trust in doing deals and we give each other the benefit of doubt . "
Bryant played only three games for Oklahoma State last season , then was dogged by all sorts of questions about his integrity , starting with an NCAA suspension for lying to investigators about a meeting with former Cowboys star Deion Sanders .
There was talk that Bryant skipped meetings and classes and was late to games .
There were concerns about his mother 's private life , enough that Miami Dolphins general manager Jeff Ireland asked if she ever was a prostitute .
After Bryant skipped the NFL combine and held his own pro day , there were whispers that he forgot to bring the right cleats .
But the Cowboys did their homework and wanted Bryant so badly that when they saw him slipping in the draft , they moved up three spots to No. 24 and nabbed him .
Jerry Jones gave Bryant No. 88 , the jersey worn by Hall of Famer Michael Irvin and , a generation earlier , by Drew Pearson .
Irvin was Troy Aikman 's favorite target , and Pearson was Roger Staubach 's favorite target .
With this deal done , it wo n't be long before Tony Romo starts his relationship with Bryant , perhaps adding the duo to that list .
what 's the big boast about froyo ?

Three New Photos from The Walking Dead
New Shot of Frank Grimes & Zombies
On The Walking Dead blog , AMC and ScreenCrave have released two new photos from the upcoming television series adaptation of the Robert Kirkman written comic series about the survivors of a zombie apocalypse .
A few weeks ago we got our first look at Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes .
The new pictures give us a better look at Lincoln and show off a new zombie .
Another picture from the blog features Kirkman hanging out on the set with a few of his friends .
The Walking Dead television series is written , produced and directed by Frank Darabont and produced by Gale Anne Hurd .
Catch the first episode on AMC in October .
I thought I might flinch but I did n't .
It was so quick that for a split second I think I wondered if it had actually happened .
There was no blood splattered across the white cinderblock wall at the Utah state prison .
No audible sounds from the condemned .
I could n't see his eyes .
I never saw the guns and I did n't hear the countdown to the trigger - pull .
A twice - convicted killer who had a troubled upbringing , 49 - year - old Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed by firing squad shortly after midnight on Friday .
I was one of nine journalists selected to observe his death , which the state classifies as a homicide .
But it was n't like other homicides I had covered .
In those instances the media showed up after the death , not before .
This , however , was a meticulously orchestrated event with a sober , prepackaged ending .
Inside the prison we walked in single file and were asked not to talk .
We were restricted from bringing our notebooks and pens and from asking questions at certain times .
When the prison warden pulled back the beige curtain Gardner was already strapped into a black , straight - backed metal chair .
His head was secured by a strap across his forehead .
Harness - like straps constrained his chest .
His handcuffed arms hung at his sides .
A white cloth square – maybe 3 inches ( 8 cm ) across – affixed to his chest over his heart bore a black target .
Seconds before the impact of the bullets Gardner 's left thumb twitched against his forefinger .
When his chest was pierced he clenched his fist .
His arm pulled up slowly as if he were lifting something and then dropped .
The motion repeated .
Although the dark blue prison jumpsuit made it difficult to see , blood seemed to be pooling around his waist .
The silence was deafening .
A medical examiner checked Gardner 's pulse on both sides of his neck , then lifted the black hood to check his pupils with a flashlight , offering a brief glimpse of the dead man 's now ashen face .
It was 12.17 am .
Only two minutes had passed since the shots were fired but it felt like things had moved in slow motion .
About an hour later prison officials let the media inspect the chamber .
There was a strong smell of bleach but no sign of blood .
The only evidence that a man had been shot and killed were four bullet holes in the black wood panels behind the chair .
The distance between them was a few inches .
Prison officials say Gardner willingly made the 90ft walk to the execution chamber on Friday morning .
That 's hard to imagine , particularly of Gardner who , by his own accounts , had spent much of the 30 years he was incarcerated " obsessed " with escape .
Despite being surrounded by dozens of prison officials and witnesses he essentially died alone .
No one from his family watched him go .
His attorneys were not present .
He chose not to utter any final thoughts or feelings .
Maybe it was his way of holding on to a small slice of privacy amid his very public death .

COEUR d'ALENE , Idaho -
An Idaho thrift store manager has her laptop back after it was accidentally sold for $ 5 last week .
Sandra Bechthold says she was stunned when a customer returned the computer to the store Tuesday .
the man refused her offer of a reward and would n't even give them his last name .
The man explained that his wife had heard about the mistake through the news and he decided to return the computer to the Women 's Center Thrift Store .
Bechthold told the Coeur d'Alene Press she did n't know how her laptop ended up among the items in the donation receiving room or how it ended up being sold without having a price tag .
She ran a classified ad in the paper seeking its return but had nearly given up when the man returned the computer .
This is basically insane .
I am paddling a kayak into a body of water most people think of as a sewer .
What should I call this activity ?
E. coli kayaking ?
It 's late April in an unusually cool spring for Dallas .
I launched my boat 20 minutes ago at the top of White Rock Lake and now am headed up the creek .
With a paddle .
And an extra paddle , as a matter of fact .
White Rock Creek rises in Collin County three - and - a - half miles southeast of Frisco and flows to White Rock Lake in East Dallas , a distance of 18 miles as the crow flies , but half again that distance in the meandering miles of the creek itself .
From the lake it flows southwest another straight - line distance of 14 miles , meeting the Trinity River about six miles south of downtown Dallas .
I 've lived in Dallas a long time .
I love canoeing and kayaking but far , far from Dallas .
The closest places I ever think of seriously for paddling are Galveston Bay , 300 miles south , or rivers in Oklahoma and Arkansas , 300 miles north .
And then there 's the story about Dallas not having any nature .
It 's our origin myth :
We 're the poor little spot that had no reason for being except for gumption , by golly .
Try kayaking in gumption some day .
But lately I have been hearing these odd stories .
Urban legends about people who refuse to accept the myth — some kind of Indiana Joneses who strike out into the city 's forbidden realms seeking the Lost Treasures of Natural Dallas .
So that 's what I 'm supposed to be doing today by paddling up White Rock Creek — not Indiana Jones , exactly .
More like urban explorer E. Coli Clem .
At this moment I am in my small blue plastic kayak approaching a construction site where crews are building a new bridge at Northwest Highway .
Two guys in hardhats are carrying a piece of steel on their shoulders in tandem across the old bridge just ahead of my kayak .
They stop when they see me , and then , while balancing the steel with free hands , lean over the edge , peering at the low , dark passage beneath their feet where I am headed .
They smile and exchange meaningful shrugs , almost toppling the steel onto me .
They catch it and continue across the bridge with their burden .
Just what I need — Abbott and Costello .
The space beneath the bridge is dark and low — a foot or so above my head .
I am paddling upstream against a mild current through reefs of wadded Styrofoam and other offal , which I do n't want to examine too closely , except that I am keeping an eye peeled for poisonous water snakes .
I know these " moccasins " or " cottonmouths " and have great respect for them based on past experience .
Here under the bridge , it occurs to me that this whole E. coli paddling thing was not my idea .
On March 14 , BJ Austin , a reporter with KERA Radio , did a story about 15 years of hold - ups and snafus in the multi-billion dollar project to rebuild the Trinity River — the part where it flows through the center of the city — and the problems with planned manmade lakes , levee safety , construction of fake rapids for kayakers and so on .
She opened the story with a quick snippet about two guys , Bret Bolton and Donny Hutchinson , who had just kayaked the West Fork of the Trinity River from downtown Fort Worth to downtown Dallas in three days , camping along the way .
I was fascinated .
I phoned Bolton .
He told me they had guerilla - camped two nights on the edges of golf courses and parks , paddled through sunken trucks and collapsed railroad trestles and discovered a kind of secret wilderness where most people are afraid to go .
So now I am trying to do my own cheapo version .
And here beneath the rumbling traffic on Northwest Highway , I must make a decision .
Go home .
Or gut up , stop looking for snakes and dead dogs .
Make an adventure of it the way I might have done as a boy .
When I was little , I lived in Ann Arbor , Michigan , which had a polluted river .
We boys were warned never to go near the Huron River , so we spent long summer days building rafts and playing Tom Sawyer on the river .
Like this stream , the Huron River was beautiful to us in ways more beguiling than any pretty park could be , probably because the pollution and scary trash kept the grownups away .
I 'm not sure how much I have progressed .
I decide to press on .
The day is cool .
When I break out into daylight again on the other side of the bridge the creek is running 40 feet broad and straight down a manmade channel .
The surface is coal - black flecked with floating white cottonwood seeds .
A tousled wall of green rises above both banks .
I pass beneath another bridge at West Lawther Road , and now the creek begins to dodge left and right between steep mud banks , back on its natural course .
Huge old cottonwoods reach down with leafy arms almost to the surface of the water .
I glide between their green fingers , completely separate from the man - built universe .
Ahead I see a mother wood duck and 12 ducklings scattered out in the center of the creek .
I can't hear her yet , but she 's definitely talking about me .
The babies are all streaming quickly to her side .
She bears for the far bank with her young in tight single file behind her .
I see trash — plastic bags hanging from roots and branches , floating beaches of rotten Styrofoam .
But as I go farther upstream , the world around me grows deeper green and quieter .
Suddenly I feel like Charles Marlow , the ferry boat captain on the Congo in Joseph Conrad 's Heart of Darkness .
Maybe if I keep pushing upstream far enough I will find Kurtz , the mad ivory dealer .
He should be somewhere in the area where Skillman Street crosses Abrams Road , a mile and a half east of Central Expressway .
If I were Kurtz , that 's definitely where I 'd hang out .
Cell phone rings .
Son in L.A. tells me about visiting a home the day before with a stunning view up into Angeles National Forest — a breathtaking panorama of mountains and sky .
I tell him I am in my kayak in East Dallas staring at a half - sunken shopping cart .
But beauty , like gold , is where you find it .
Same with adventure .
Before setting out , I talked to Randy Johnson , director of horticulture at the Texas Discovery Gardens at Fair Park — an urban bushwhack paddler from way back , a man who slides his canoe down steep mud banks at the end of a rope to find lost pockets of wilderness in the heart of the city .
Johnson told me he once paddled his way far up White Rock Creek , up into the Heart of Darkness , got out and struck overland through the forest to see what he could see .
" I found a homeless encampment out there the size of a small town , " he said .
Kurtzville .
Dead ahead I see a long black creature sliding lazily across the surface of the water , thick as a man 's bicep , head the tell - shape of a shovel .
Water moccasin .
Know him well .
We have an old understanding .
The moccasin 's presence here is a marker not for wilderness but for wildness .
I can pass him without incident , or I can be stupid and show aggression by shaking a paddle at him , in which case he will attack .
He is wild , not tame , and this place is his world .
My GPS shows us at four tenths of a mile from Skillman Street .
But his world is a million miles from the land of cages where I live .
A sharp odor assails me .
I look around for it .
Right beneath my paddle a dead dog straddles a branch , bloated , hairless , buzzing with flies , crawling with maggots .
I was just about to hit it with my paddle .
As I paddle ahead the creek twists and bends , swelling to 40 feet in width , choking to 20 , swelling again .
Then the creek is barricaded all the way across by trash clutched in the branches of a fallen tree .
The water is about four feet deep in the center , deeper in some holes , but I am able to get out of the boat next to the bank in water up to my calves .
I crawl through an opening in the branches and then pull the boat behind me by a rope .
Not far ahead I do the same thing at a larger trash dam .
Now I 'm standing on a beautiful little gravel beach .
The air is clean and green .
Shapes of fish flit past my feet like shadows of birds .
The water is semi-clear .
I can see only patches of sky through a thick canopy of trees .
When I stop moving , stop listening to myself , the world here is quiet and soft , a symphony of bird calls .
And yet in the distance I can hear traffic at about the volume of far - away cattle in the country .
On the way back down to the lake and my car , slipping along easily with the current past the place where I saw the moccasin and past the stench of the dead dog and the cloistered ducklings , I round a bend in the creek and two enormous barred owls fly from the same tree in front of me , their diverging flight paths forming a V in the air .
I bet Joseph Conrad would have done something very literary with that .
Weeks after I heard BJ Austin 's story on the radio and after I had already explored some creeks on my own , I finally met Bret Bolton and Donny Hutchinson , the urban bushwhackers whose exploits on the West Fork had inspired me .
Over beers at a bar in Uptown one Saturday afternoon in mid-May , they poured out their story , talking over each other like Chief Martin Brody and Sam Quint swapping tales of derring - do in the 1975 Spielberg movie , Jaws .
They have known each other and fished together for five years .
Last year they shared a period of mutual unemployment and heavy fishing , during which they talked about doing a three - day voyage by kayak on the West Fork from downtown Fort Worth to downtown Dallas .
The Trinity , the biggest river contained entirely in Texas , is either more than 700 miles of river or more like 425 if you do n't count its various forks .
The West Fork arises in Archer County about 125 miles northwest of Dallas and flows through Fort Worth on its way here to join the main branch of the Trinity near the intersection of Loop 12 ( Walton Walker ) and Irving Boulevard .
Fort Worth , for whatever reason , has been able to complete a lovely remake of the river in its own downtown , replete with kayaking white - water features .
Dallas , meanwhile , has stumbled for 15 years without ever getting any of the basic features of its own river project off the ground , unless you count the footings of one make - believe suspension bridge designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava , now in a state of suspended suspension while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decides whether it can be safely completed .
The Fort Worth project does not include any faux suspension bridges and certainly does not include anything like the controversial high - speed multi-lane highway that Dallas wants to build out between its flood control levees where floods occur .
Maybe that 's why Fort Worth 's Trinity River project is complete and ours is stuck in the mud .
There is great public focus , then , on the Trinity River in downtown Fort Worth and great focus again 30 miles east in downtown Dallas but no focus on the stretch of the West Fork that meanders from Fort Worth eastward , mainly north of I - 30 ( Tom Landry Freeway ) through Arlington and Grand Prairie .
So what made two responsible family men decide they wanted to mount yellow kayaks and paddle from one city to the other on that abused and forgotten body of water ?
Bolton , a 38 - year - old Unix software engineer and father who lives in Irving , told me he had read an article about some guys who paddled through Houston on Buffalo Bayou to the Houston ship canal .
" It sounded terribly fun and terribly disgusting at the same time , " he said .
Hutchinson , a 34 - year - old research technician and soon - to - be first - time father who lives in Fort Worth , said , " Bret and I thought about this for a full year . "
Hutchinson , the experienced backpacker of the pair , provisioned them with ultra - light cooking gear and freeze - dried food .
Bolton had the two kayaks they needed .
Both men studied the system of reservoirs that release water into the West Fork .
If the lakes upstream from them released no water or small amounts , then the water in the river where they were paddling would be too shallow .
But if the lakes suddenly released large amounts , the water in the river might be dangerously high and fast .
Bolton found the U.S. Geological Service
Web page that posts notices of releases from dams and the downstream water volume .
Hutchinson found an iPhone app that allowed them to keep track of the USGS information as they paddled .
They timed their trip to avoid major water releases from the reservoirs .
" I looked at the river today on my way over here , " he said the day we met .
" We would have been killed if we had tried it with that much water in the river . "
But then that was also what made them want to do it — the risk and sheer unpredictability .
" Who 's done this before ? " Hutchinson said .
" When 's the last time ? "
I asked how their wives felt .
" We tried very hard not to send out a vibe that this could be dangerous , " said Hutchinson , the backpacker .
The river flows beneath steep banks walled by ancient trees .
Right above the banks is suburban sprawl , but the two men did not see or hear or sense the world up there .
They might as well have been on the Congo River searching for Kurtz .
But on this Congo , the white water has steel teeth .
Each was in his own kayak .
Bolton said , " The best rapids was somewhere between Highway 360 and Roy Orr Boulevard .
There is a railroad trestle that has fallen into the water .
We 're getting ready to portage around it , and by the time I look at it , we 're in it .
So we punch right through it .
When we get past it , I have the biggest , nastiest gash in the side of my kayak . "
Hutchinson said , " We looked back , and we could see metal sticking out of it — re- bar and sections of the trestle . "
Note to self :
There is a big difference between white water in Arkansas , where you can get wet , and white water on the Trinity , where you can wind up with a rusty steel rod through your neck .
" There 's quicksand everywhere , " Hutchinson said .
" One time we pull up to the bank for a restroom break .
I get out and put my left foot in and it sinks up to my ankle right away .
I put my right foot in , and it 's up to my knees .
I go to lift up my right foot , and by the time I put it down , my left leg is up to my thigh . "
In seconds , he was in the sand up to his waist and still sinking , with soupy sand dangerously close to pouring over the top of his chest waders .
" I start thinking back .
I watch Man Versus Wild [ on the Discovery Channel ] , and Man Versus Wild says grab a stick , whatever you can use as leverage .
I grabbed a paddle . "
With the paddle as a lever , he pushed against the hard mud bank and was able to get himself back over to his boat .
" I basically dragged myself up and laid across the boat and was able to pull myself up on it . "
Their boats , by the way , were the super - buoyant " sit on top " models of kayak , kind of like thick surfboards .
Hutchinson 's maneuver would have been much more difficult in the kind of hollow - hull kayak that you sit inside .
When we talked in the bar that afternoon , one subject animated Hutchinson and Bolton more than their tales of narrow escape .
When they strove to describe to me the natural beauty through which they had passed on their voyage , their voices grew earnest and excited .
They forgot their beers and finished each other 's sentences .
In spite of thousands of tires and countless rusting cars in the water , the West Fork they discovered out there was a paradise .
Bolton said , " Except for the bald eagle , we saw absolutely every bird of prey in North Texas , including ... "
" Peregrine falcons , " Hutchinson interrupted .
" Hawks . "
" Vultures — both kinds — black and turkey .
Kingfishers . "
" Tons of kingfishers , " Bolton added .
" You do n't see kingfishers around here .
Every one of them must live in the river .
You can't go 10 feet without seeing one .
Herons , egrets .
Amazing .
Amazing .
Red - winged black birds . "
" And you know , " Hutchinson said , " at some point in the year , there have to be bald eagles on that river . "
" Night herons . "
" We chased ducks for miles . "
They saw one coyote .
They saw countless tracks left by feral hogs but no hogs .
While the hogs were shy , the beaver were gregarious .
Hundreds of them came rushing out of dens in the river bank to watch the strange creatures pass by on yellow boats .
The two men camped in jungle hammocks hung from the trees above the banks , protected by mosquito netting from thick clouds of voracious mosquitoes that swarmed over them as soon as they left the water .
They pulled a few nerdy tech - tricks , like texting to a friend the GPS coordinates for a bridge they would pass later that day .
When they arrived at the location , a small cooler full of ice and two frosty beers had been left there for them in honor of their journey .
At the end , they knew they had accomplished something real , Bolton said .
" When we came out of the river , we both felt like telling somebody what we had just done .
But we realized when we told them , they would n't actually understand it . "
I asked them if they felt like explorers .
" I felt that way the entire time , " Bolton said .
" An urban explorer .
Because no one ever goes down there . "
Hutchinson was hesitant about the explorer thing .
" People have done sections of river , " he said .
" But we did do the whole thing . "
" It was almost a rediscovery of the river , " Bolton said .
" It 's amazing that there 's so much crap in this river .
There 's plastic everywhere .
But still , even with all that stuff it 's almost the best adventure you can get . "
" The best , " Hutchinson said .
" What else can you do to be by yourself alone that 's kind of out there and kind of like adventurous ? "
Bolton said .
" There 's really nothing else .
It 's one of the biggest adventures you can have in DFW if not the biggest . "
Of course by now you are asking :
What about the water ?
E. coli , after all , is n't really a joke .
And what about toxic chemicals ?
It 's a more tangled web than you might expect .
First off , the best reference I can steer you toward for dirty streams and lakes is the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 's list of impaired bodies of water .
Just Google " Draft 2010 Texas Index of Water Quality Impairments . "
If you search the list for " Trinity , " you will find that the Upper Trinity River in Dallas has serious issues including bacteria , chlordane and PCBs .
The West Fork where Bolton and Hutchinson kayaked is n't much better .
White Rock Creek is n't on the list , nor is Rowlett Creek , which runs from Collin County down to Lake Ray Hubbard — another very pretty stream I have investigated by kayak .
But Ken Kramer , director of the Sierra Club of Texas , says you have to be careful not to take the TCEQ list as permission to dive in without your nose plugs .
He says the number of water quality monitoring stations in Texas is few , so some streams may not be on the bad water list simply because they are not measured .
" As you might imagine , if you do n't look for a problem , you wo n't find a problem , " Kramer said .
Kramer pointed out that bacteria are everywhere and some evidence of bacteria in water — as from the feces of wild animals — is not an automatic bar to all recreational uses .
He also explained that there is a substantial upside to people taking a chance on going out there .
The state allows lower standards — that is , it allows more pollution — in streams where there is no evidence of recreational use .
Kramer said if TCEQ finds that nobody ever goes into a stream anyway , " There is a higher than average chance that TCEQ will lower the standards " for that stream .
I asked him about Hutchinson and Bolton .
By going out there , taking chances and just doing it , are they then blazing a kind of legal and regulatory trail for the rest of us ?
Wo n't they and people like them establish recreational activity on a stream , forcing the state to clean it up ?
" Absolutely , " Kramer said .
" If they survive . "
This is not to detract from what Bolton and Hutchinson accomplished — they are true explorers , because they are daring guys who pierced the myth and found the kingdom of nature in our midst .
There are , however , more experienced explorers on the Trinity River and other area streams .
Randy Johnson of the Texas Discovery Garden is one .
And on the Trinity , the grand master explorer , everyone would agree , is Charles Allen .
At 53 , with hair below his shoulders and a handlebar moustache , Allen looks like a cross between Davy Crockett and Chingachgook , the Indian guide in James Fennimore Cooper 's Last of the Mohicans .
In fact he is a modest , soft - spoken careful student of the Trinity River and of river geography in general .
Allen has explored the Trinity for more than 30 years .
Today on a cool morning in early May he and I are paddling down the Trinity in a 16 - foot Old Town canoe , one of 19 boats he uses in his business as a river guide and outfitter — Trinity River Expeditions .
We put in at 9:30 a.m. this morning at the Sylvan Avenue bridge boat ramp and will paddle to the take - out at Loop 12 ( Ledbetter ) , a distance of about 10 river miles which , he says , we should accomplish in five hours .
Yeah .
There 's a reason man invented motors .
Even when we are still inside the barren downtown levee system , before we enter the Great Trinity Forest at the Corinth Street bridge , the river is powerful and broad - shouldered .
Maybe because we are on it , paddling along its surface like a water bug , the river feels bigger and more important than the distant towers of downtown or even the bridges soaring overhead .
I 'm in the front of the boat , where one merely paddles .
He is in the back , where the steering is done .
The day is overcast and mild .
Allen knows better than to believe the story about Dallas having no reason for being .
The city was settled in the 1840s where several important overland trails converged at a ford over the Trinity River — an important means of communication and travel .
" There was river - boat traffic on the Trinity probably up into the 1920s , " he says , seated behind me .
" It was a way of moving big loads , lumber and machinery and so on .
By then we were probably talking some kind of diesel power with a screw or propeller .
Before that , it was paddle wheels . "
I am a longtime , openly declared , way - out - of - the - closet non-fan of the fake suspension bridge .
As we glide beneath its construction site , we see enormous steel members of the bridge un-erected , dormant in the mud , a monument to civic glory interruptus .
All that money , and what a shame .
They could have just come down here and gone for a paddle .
The river chokes down to 50 feet in width at some of the bridges , where it runs faster , then splays to twice that width and slows down .
Allen tells me the water is moderately low today but good .
He is not the type to keep up with water volumes by using an iPhone app .
After 30 years , he can take a glance when he 's coming over the Sylvan Avenue bridge and know immediately whether he will put boats in the water or send everybody home because it 's either too low or too high .
As we paddle , I ask him about a man who died in a canoe on the Trinity in July 2008 .
The man was not one of Allen 's clients , but Allen made inquiries into the incident and spoke with the man 's canoeing partner , who survived .
Allen tells me the two men came to one of the old lock and dam sites built at the turn of the century in an effort to make the river navigable for large barges .
By the time they were able to get a good look at the obstacle , they were already in strong current and decided to punch through , as Bolton and Hutchinson did at the collapsed railroad trestle on the West Fork .
But this roll of the dice cost one man his life .
" When in doubt , " Allen says , " get out . "
You can make mistakes out here and die .
This is not Six Flags .
And now at Corinth Street , we pass out of the walled confines of the levee system and into the " Great Trinity Forest , " an area of about 6,000 acres of land , treated historically by Dallas as a dump on unusable flood plain , much of it never settled or developed , now thickly grown in native trees and invasive species .
As part of the Trinity River project , Dallas promises to develop this area as a great urban wilderness park one day , presumably after it finds the money to mow the grass in the parks it already has .
If Joseph Conrad 's Kurtz is out here somewhere today , he 's probably cooking meth instead of dealing in ivory tusks .
Along some stretches , the black mud banks soar up 50 feet above the river .
At the tops of the banks , a wall of trees rises another 80 feet .
No sound of man is here .
Leaves clattering high above us sound like disembodied voices .
An enormous gar — a prehistoric fish with heavy scales and long toothy jaws — rises and swirls just ahead .
It 's half the length of a paddle .
We slide down along limestone ledges glistening with water from springs and seeps deep in the woods .
A huge heron lifts up from a log in the center of the river ahead and flaps off downriver like a visitor from Jurassic Park .
We come to the mouth of White Rock Creek where it meets the river .
Allen turns the canoe up the creek so we can explore .
How strange , almost sacred , to find this place where such a public feature of our lives carries its secrets back to the sea .
Allen points out " shell lenses " in the riverbanks — places where Native Americans camped for centuries , feasting on freshwater mussels and creating huge mounds of discarded shells , the faintest outlines of which now appear in the eroding banks .
There are far fewer plastic bags the farther from downtown we go , although they bloom again after every bridge .
Allen tells me he sometimes looks at long rows of bags flying in the breeze on the tips of branches and thinks of Tibetan prayer flags .
I wonder .
Getting rid of the bags , cleaning up the chemical runoff from lawns , pulling out the junk : all of those are only decisions .
Acts of will .
What if we did it ?
What if we do it ?
What will this river be then ?
I ask him if he ever canoes on rivers other than the Trinity .
" I did back in the ' 90s , " he says , " when I was doing a lot of white - water canoeing .
Then I realized I was spending too much time canoeing and not enough time on my guide business . "
We paddle along in silence for a while .
Behind me at the stern he says , " I think it 's important to explore other rivers .
It gives you an even deeper understanding of your home river . "
Tell me about it .
I 'm not sure I even understood I had a home river until today .
I wanted to see what the answer was :
What would the main stem of the Trinity just below downtown Dallas look like if it were cleaned up ?
So today , a warmer day in mid-May , we are kayaking the Elm Fork of the Trinity River through an undeveloped and pristine area from just below the dam at Lake Ray Roberts , about 40 miles northwest of downtown Dallas , to a point five river miles south of where we started .
With me in another kayak is Ed Spencer , one of the best unpaid hunting and fishing guides in North Texas .
You have to know him .
The descendant of many generations of North Texas hunters and fishermen including an Olympic rifleman , Spencer is also a former spokesperson for the Dallas Police Department and the Dallas County Sheriff .
A big man with an easy smile that should not be mistaken for innocence , Spencer is what I would call the ultimate casual - attitude anti-REI outdoorsman .
Today , for example , I have shown up with various expensive water containers and dry bags from multiple high - end hiking and paddling outlets , not to mention a four - piece packable emergency kayak paddle for which I spent a pretty penny .
Spencer , on the other hand , tossed a bunch of junk in the bottom of his boat , bungeed a big old ugly beer cooler to the deck and paddled off ahead of me , happy as a clam .
Sometimes I do n't think Spencer takes the outdoors seriously enough .
There he is cruising through overhanging branches , deftly steering through small rapids , keen eye all around .
And we are definitely in paradise .
So this is what it could be .
The day was hot when we were putting in , but down here beneath the canopy the breeze is cool and sweet with the scent of honeysuckle .
Gigantic gar turn and splash in the water just ahead of us around every bend in the river .
Ducks wait until we 're almost on them and then fly from low branches .
This is not at all like those rivers in Arkansas where I have paddled between soaring cliffs and nothing like the little rivers I grew up on in Michigan , silver paths through sand and pine .
The Trinity River here is a tunnel through a dense forest of cedar elm , American elm , willow oak , Southern red oak , white oak , black willow , cottonwood , red ash , sycamore , pecan and bois d'arc .
Every bird species in the region has flown here for respite from the hot plains above .
And what really takes my breath away is the realization that this natural realm — rich , not poor , beautiful , not plain , wild , not tame — reaches into the center of our city .
Speaking of wild , there he is again , just ahead — Brother Water Moccasin .
But this one is much bigger than his cousin — the one I saw on White Rock Creek a few weeks ago .
And he 's not happy .
He swims with a bit of thrash , head well up out of the water , one glittering eye fixed dead on us .
He 's spring - loaded for action .
He pulls himself up on a low branch watching us warily .
I know what that branch is for .
It 's like Donny Hutchinson 's paddle .
Brother Water Moccasin can take that long bicep of a body , use the branch for leverage and fling himself right across the water at me if he wants .
And by the way , how did Brother Spencer get so far back behind me all of a sudden ?
I do n't speak snake .
Ca n't stop now .
It 's all body language from here on out .
I paddle very softly and sweetly .
My body language is saying , " Greetings and peace , Brother Water Moccasin .
We wish you good hunting . "
The snake drops his head slightly .
I think he has just said , " Greetings and peace , Brother Loud Slow Creature Who Walks with Dogs .
I grant you safe passage on your journey back to the land of cages . "
Now we 're past him .
And now it 's easier , somehow , to go back to my land of cages .
Now that I know this wild place is mine , too .

Anticipation of the soon - to - bloom stinky " corpse flower " drew record crowds to the Cockrell Butterfly Center this weekend .
Visitors saw , but did n't yet smell , the endangered species , which is expected to bloom by Wednesday .
The museum is recording the flower 's progress with a live webcam .
And roughly 3,000 people turned out Sunday — five to seven times the center 's average crowd - to catch a glimpse , said Latha Thomas , the vice president of marketing and communications .
" We are staying open late to accommodate the crowds , and we may go 24 hours if we have to , " Thomas said .
" We want everyone to be able to see the flower who wants to . "
The flower , native to the Sumatran rainforests in Indonesia , is one of the biggest and most mysterious flowers in the world .
It 's bloom is so rare that only 28 other bloomings have been observed in the United States .
It gets its name from one of its more unique traits :
When the " corpse flower " opens , the smell of meat flies ' meals permeates .
Those flies - the plant 's primary pollinators - feast on rotting flesh .
" It smells really bad , " said Zac Stayton , a horticulturist at the museum .
" I 'm told it 's one of the worse smells you will come across . "
Crowds that waited an average of 30 minutes to see the flower Sunday were spared the smell .
" Is this it ?
Where is the stinky plant ? " said Carmelita Lapus , a visitor at the museum .
" We were really hoping to see it open now , but if it does n't we will be back tomorrow . "
The odds that the plant will bloom today are about 80 percent , Stayton said .
It should certainly open by Wednesday , he added .
The flower will most likely start blooming around 3 p.m. today and should take four hours to fully open .
The flower will stay in bloom only about two days , Stayton said .
" We do n't know what triggers them to bloom , " said Tom Rice , a docent with the museum .
" It 's one of the great mysteries of botany . "

Though quite a few rare genetic disorders and toxic exposures are known to cause autism ( or autism - like symptoms ) , most cases are considered idiopathic , meaning they are without a known cause .﻿﻿
A person 's biology , surroundings , and other factors may be at play — likely collectively .
One postulated cause that has been disproven ?
Vaccinations .
Known Causes
Some researchers have found differences between brains of those with autism and others .
People with autism seem to have larger brains and they also seem to process information differently .﻿﻿
In other words , their brains are " wired " differently .
Research on this issue is ongoing , with intriguing findings coming out of top institutions .
Again , most of the time , autism cannot be associated with a specific cause .
The few known causes of autism , which are relatively rare , include :
Depakote ( also called Valproatean ) , an anti-seizure medication , taken during pregnancy
Fragile X syndrome ( a genetic disorder )
Rubella
PKU
Tuberous sclerosis ( genetic disorder )
Prader - Willi syndrome ( genetic disorder )
Researchers are further exploring the connection between genetics , the environment , and autism .
Vaccines Do Not Cause Autism
If your child with autism was vaccinated , this did not cause their condition .
The medical community has soundly refuted these theories , though a very passionate group of parents and researchers continue to disagree based on anecdotal evidence .
Risk Factors
In addition to these rare , documented causes , some studies point to a higher risk of autism being associated with older parenthood , ﻿﻿ certain types of pollution , and a variety of other issues .
Association , however , is not the same thing as causation .
It may be , for example , that older parents are associated with autism because they are more likely to have autism themselves .
Additional risk factors that have been noted :
Sex : Autism spectrum disorder is four times more likely in boys than in girls .
Family history of autism
Preterm birth ( before 26 weeks gestation )
In certain cases , autism may be associated with problems in the immune system .
People with autism often have other physical issues related to immune deficiency .﻿﻿
The National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , however , states that the evidence is not yet strong enough to show a causal relationship .
There is also some evidence that children with autism are more prone to gastrointestinal ( GI ) problems , allergies , and food intolerances than other children , but no evidence that these cause autism .﻿﻿
Genetics
Researchers are certain that some cases of autism have a genetic basis .
So , it is quite possible that genetics are involved in all cases of autism .
Many studies have shown that parents from families with autistic members are more likely to have autistic children .
In addition , families with one autistic child are at increased risk of having more than one autistic child .﻿﻿
Importantly , " genetic " and " hereditary " are not the same thing .
Studies have shown many cases of spontaneous genetic mutation associated with autism .﻿﻿
Spontaneous genetic mutation , as the name implies , just happens — usually for unknown reasons .
In other words , a child can be born with genetic differences that are not inherited , but which may be associated with autism .
Nutrition and Autism Children with autism are often very sensitive to tastes and textures , and thus have limited diets .﻿﻿
It may be the case that they are lacking specific nutrients important to learning and social / intellectual growth .
While improved nutrition may be a helpful therapy , it seems unlikely that malnutrition can cause autism .
Debunking Myths
Researchers have done a great deal of work to determine that certain things do not cause autism .
Why work so hard to disprove theories ?
Because several related to autism have led to emotional pain , risky behaviors , health complications , and even some deaths .
For example , avoiding vaccines not only wo n't prevent autism , but it places your child ( and other children ) at risk of diseases .
Parental temperament has also been discussed as a potential cause of autism .
Dr. Leo Kanner , the man who first identified autism as a unique condition , had the idea that cold , so - called “ refrigerator ” mothers caused autism .
He was wrong .
But Dr. Kanner 's thought impressed a major figure in psychology , Bruno Bettelheim .
Bettelheim 's book , " The Empty Fortress : Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self , " created a generation of parents who carried guilt for their child 's disability .
Fortunately , that burden is no longer .
As you explore the question of " what causes autism , " you are likely to come across many individuals who are absolutely certain they know the answer .
It 's important to know , though , that the subject is highly controversial and one parent 's ( or researcher 's ) passionate statements does n't take the place of solid research .
A Word From Verywell
You'd think that with so much information available , someone could tell you what caused autism in your child .
But the odds are you 'll never know ; all possibilities are still under investigation .
This can be , understandably , frustrating .
Remember , though , that the reality is that the vast majority of parents did nothing to cause their child 's autism .
Though you may not determine the cause of your child 's autism , you can do a great deal to ensure that your child reaches their potential and lives the fullest and happiest life possible .
Along with the official announcement of Trine 2 release , during the E2 2010 Atlus unveiled screenshots , a teaser trailer and some artworks of the game .
All the stuff regarding the sequel to the marvellous puzzle - platformer developed by the Finnish company Frozenbyte has been collected for the latest post in the Videogames highlights series , while the topic of today ’s post will be one of the aforementioned artworks which in my humble opinion is worth the evaluation by any fan of games and fantasy in search for a new wallpaper to decorate one ’s own virtual desktop with .
The Trine saga is about travelling fellowships and magical artifacts , great castles and strange machineries , evil creatures created by a dark power and enchanted lands that the three heroes have no time to stop and admire throughout their adventure .
In other words it ’s a classic fantasy story about friendship and bravery as redemption of the world , yet seen not by the perspective of some odd , hairy - feet little man but by the now ingenuous , now lustful and now malicious eyes of three unlikely protagonists each one gifted ( in his / her own way ) with unique skills .
In the artwork depicted above , the three heroes rest at a fire while the forest surrounds them and quietly protects its mysteries .
I do n’t know the author of this true piece of art in HD ( 1920 ×1080 ) , but needless to say the image became my preferred wallpaper of the moment as soon as I glanced at it .
So let me recommend it to visitors of the blog as well , which can use the direct download link attached after the screenshot of my desktop – a bit messed up and full of stuff to move somewhere else , indeed .
Anyway what ’s important here is the view .

I have extremely fond memories of riding in Critical Mass , when on the last Friday of every month hundreds of bicyclists take over the San Francisco streets .
It 's exhilarating to participate , but it also has a huge impact on motorists and pedestrians .
I recall once seeing a group of teenagers , who turned out to be tourists from Nebraska , talking excitedly about the river of bikes streaming past them .
I slowed to a stop and explained to them what was happening , and I could see little lights go on in their eyes .
They were catching a glimpse of another way to live , and I could tell they were going to take that vision home with them .
So how can kids like them organize their own Critical Mass bike rides ?
While there is no national organization for Critical Mass — or CM for short — I found this very handy guide ( slightly edited for Shareable.net ) to starting your own :
1. Understand the structure of Critical Mass .
CM has no leaders .
It 's an event , not an organization .
There is no national group that licenses local rides .
In every city that has a CM , one or more cyclists just picked a day and time and started handing out fliers .
If your city does n't have a CM , that 's what you 'll do .
You do n't need anyone to authorize your ride .
You just do it .

2 . Put it into perspective .
Critical Mass can be fun , but in and of itself , Critical Mass does n't change anything .
CM is effective only when combined with real advocacy — such as lobbying local and state governments for bike lanes and progressive legislation .
If all you and your cohorts do is ride your bikes around once a month , do n't be surprised when nothing changes .
3 . Decide on a recurring time , day , and starting location .
Your CM needs to happen at a consistent time and place each month so that people always know where and when it is .
The last Friday of the month is traditional , but many groups have chosen other recurring days .
5:30 pm is a good time for CM , because it gives people who work until 5:00 a chance to get there , while leaving enough daylight in most months for a decent ride .
( Do n't try to have two times , one for months with daylight savings time and one for months without .
Here in Austin we used to have the split two - time format , but even after we tried to standardize on 5:00 year - round , years later people are still confused as to whether it 's 4:30 , 5:00 , or 5:30 . )
A landmark on a university campus is a typical starting point , but consider using another public place to indicate that CM is n't just for college kids .

4 . Do n't get a permit .
When local police learn of your ride , they may insist that you get a permit , perhaps a parade permit .
Do n't do it .
The point of Critical Mass is that biking is a right , not a privilege .
Cars do n't need permits to ride on the streets , and neither should cyclists .
They may threaten to arrest you if you ride without a permit .
At that point you 'll need to consider whether you 're willing to get arrested to make your point .
If you 're not , and you choose not to ride or choose to get the permit , then you 've allowed them to put cyclists in their place .
It 's not an easy choice for some .
( Austin CM was told it needed a permit , refused to get one , and then suffered arrests of riders .
CM 'ers went to court and either won their cases , or had them thrown out of court .
Riders in other cities , such as NYC , suffered similar harassment but ultimate victory . )
( Here 's more on why you should n't get a permit . )

5 . Do n't necessarily pick a route .
Most CM rides do n't have a set route — they go through the central city randomly , with whoever happens to be in front leading the way .
Of course , you can set a route if you want to , but do n't think that you have to .
6. Learn the traffic laws .
If your ride draws any appreciable number of riders , you can expect attention from the police .
Riders may or may not choose to follow the law , but you still need to know what the law is so you know whether or not you 're breaking it .
Get a copy of your local traffic laws from your state and city websites .
Most states requires cyclists to obey all the same rules as cars ( e.g. , Stop signs & red lights ) .
You 'll probably also be required to have a headlight after dark , and there may be limits to how many bikes abreast ( side by side ) you can ride .
Some riders ignore laws that have no safety consequences ( e.g. , riding 3 - abreast instead of 2 - abreast ) .

7 . Will you block traffic ?
The most controversial aspect of CM is the extent to which it blocks traffic .
CM 'ers are fond of saying " We 're not blocking traffic , we ARE traffic ! "
While that 's a cute phrase , it 's obviously pretty silly .
It 's like a murderer saying , " I did n't kill that human , I am a human ! "
Just because bikes are legitimate road users does n't mean they do n't slow down other road users — especially when they go out of their way to do so by taking up multiple lanes .
Remember that CM is supposed to be a celebration of cycling , not your opportunity to see how much inconvenience you can cause to others .
It 's about asserting our right to the road , not denying others their right to the road .
Leave at least one lane open for cars .
( So if you 're on a 4 - lane road , take no more than 3 lanes .
Except if you 're on a one - lane road , obviously you will take the whole lane . )
Taking all the lanes , all the time , might be fun for you , but it certainly brings the police down on you quicker .
Motorists will ring 911 off the wall with their cell phones if you block them 100 % .
It also does n't win you any friends .
Are you doing CM to show motorists how much fun biking can be , or are you just trying to piss them off because it makes you feel good ?
Only CM riders can answer these questions for themselves .
Also remember that your local laws may have a say about that ( though some riders choose to ignore them ) .
Even if you decide that you do n't want to go overboard with taking lanes , understand that you can't control the riders — some riders may want to take all the lanes all the time .
If this is not the flavor you want for your ride , then make that clear in the fliers you make for the ride , and get other cyclists to apply gentle peer pressure when a few cyclists stray .
Unfortunately if two people out of 200 decide to be jerks then your CM 's reputation will come from them rather than from the other 198 .
But since CM has no leaders , you can't order anyone to ride the way you want , you can only try to encourage them .

8. Confrontation with motorists .
Harassing motorists does n't help anyone .
You can assert your right to the road without being a dick about it .
Many CM 'ers make it a point to be friendly to motorists , such as smiling and waving — even smiling and waving back when motorists are honking and cursing at them .
Some go even farther , handing out flowers , holding signs saying " Sorry for the delay " , or passing out fliers apologizing for the minimal once - a - month delay , and explaining why we ride .
If you want to avoid confrontation with motorists , put something to that effect in the fliers you use to promote the rides .
9 . Make fliers and promote the ride .
The best advertising is fliers placed directly on bicycles — you know a cyclist is going to see it .
Make several strips per page to save paper .
Here 's an example .
( You can attach the fliers to the bike in many ways — such as squeezing the brake lever to open it , slipping in the flier , then releasing the brake lever .
Or you can thread the flier between the brake & gearing cables on the top tube . )
Also put up fliers at local bike shops .
If your city has local bike media ( like newsletters ) , do n't forget to inform them as well .
Set up a simple website , and let me know about your ride so I can add it to the Hub .

10 .
Be prepared for police intervention .
The police may or may not show up at your ride .
( But if you consistently take every single traffic lane or harass motorists , then they almost certainly will . )
If they show up , they may harass you for breaking traffic laws , or they may harass you even if you 're not breaking any laws .
Your best defense against unreasonable police action is a video camera .
( Though in some cases , police have improperly confiscated cameras and tapes . )
One Austin CM 'er mounted a camera to her helmet .
Check out this advice about what to do if you 're stopped or arrested .
11 . Get creative .
CM can be festive .
Many riders wear costumes or decorate their bikes extravagantly .
Use your imagination .
It make the rides more fun .

Image caption Watching football in public is ' un - Islamic ' , the militants say
Somali militants have threatened football fans they will be publicly flogged - or worse - if they are caught watching the World Cup on TV .
Gangs of Islamists are reported to be patrolling the areas they control looking for people watching games .
Dedicated fans are watching matches in secret , or in the few areas controlled by government forces .
On Saturday militants killed two people as they attacked a house where people were watching a game .
Militant group Hizbul - Islam also arrested 10 others at the house north - east of the capital Mogadishu where fans were watching the game between Argentina and Nigeria .
' Mad men '
A spokesman for the group , Sheikh Mohamed Abdi Aros said the rest of Somalia should respect their ban on the World Cup .
I have one eye on the TV and the other on the door , and the sound turned down Mogadishu football fan
" We are warning all the youth of Somalia not to dare watch these World Cup matches .
It is a waste of money and time and they will not benefit anything or get any experience by watching mad men jumping up and down , " he said .
One broadcaster has moved their operations to the fortified airport to protect their equipment from attack during the tournament .
Dedicated football fans have few safe places to go if they want to watch Africa 's first World Cup , with the al - Qaeda inspired group al - Shabab also announcing a ban .
A cinema in the small part of the capital Mogadishu controlled by the government has become a popular place for football fans .
One man , who lives in the militant - controlled livestock market area of the city told the BBC he was watching Algeria v Slovenia at home with his family .
" I have one eye on the TV and the other on the door , and the sound turned down , " he said .
' Enemies of Islam '
The ban dates back to a law that was introduced by the Islamic Courts Union who took control of much of Somalia for six months in 2006 .
It bans Somalis from all forms of entertainment considered un - Islamic under the courts ' strict interpretation of Sharia law , like video games and watching sports in public .
The BBC's Mohammed Olad Hassan says few individual Somalis can afford to have a satellite TV , so such public screenings are often the only way matches can be seen .
In the Juba Valley rebel militias went further , saying young men should not watch football - even in the privacy of their own homes - because it would " distract them from pursuing holy jihad . "
A private broadcaster moved its equipment from the rebel - held Bakara market to the heavily protected airport so it can continue broadcasting , news agency Reuters reported .
They had to do it under the cover of darkness for fear of attack , they said .
Television was already under attack from the Islamist militants .
Al - Shabab has declared Universal TV " enemies of Islam " because they allegedly broadcast pictures of the prophet Muhammad .
Al - Shabab has already banned radio stations from playing music and threatened several radio stations .
The Islamic Courts Union was driven out by Ethiopian - backed government forces .
But since then rebel groups like al - Shabab have taken control of the south of Somalia and much of Mogadishu .
The government , backed by African Union peacekeepers , controls only a small area of the capital .
Rare Prosecution of Mother for Failing to Protect Her Daughter From Abuse Prosecutions of a parent for harming a child by omission are unusual .
June 28 , 2010  -- Houston nurse Abigail
Young went on trial today on charges she failed to prevent the death of her 4 - year - old daughter whose body was battered with 80 bruises , had a severed pancreas and a fractured skull .
There were also indications that the girl had been sexually abused .
Young , 34 , faces up to life in prison if convicted on the one count of injury to a child by omission .
Jury selection began today in Young 's unusual case .
Her daughter , Emma Thompson , died June 27 , 2009 .
Young 's boyfriend at the time , Lucas Coe , 28 , is to be tried in September on charges of aggravated sexual assault .
At the time of Emma 's death , Coe was facing an unrelated child abuse charge in another county .
The prosecution of a mother for not protecting a child is rare , legal experts said .
Sandra Guerra Thompson , a criminal law professor at the University of Houston Law Center , told ABCNews.com that the prosecution of a parent , especially a mother , for causing harm to a child by omission were highly unusual .
" Most of the times when a child is harmed by a parent , the other parent is usually found to be also a victim of the abusive parent , " Guerra Thompson said .
" Although technically , like in this case , the mother has an obligation to protect the child and report the abuse , because of her status as a victim as well and really her psychological helplessness , prosecutors generally exercise their discretion not to charge . "
Guerra Thompson called the case of Abigail Young case " eye-opening . "
" The facts in this case may have indicated that the mother was not a victim herself and that she really was in a position to help her child , " she said .
Colleen Barnett , the Harris County prosecutor trying the case , told the Houston Chronicle , " Emma was a precious 4 - year - old girl and she deserves justice , and that 's what we hope to get . "
Investigators said Young did not call 911 when her daughter allegedly cracked her skull after falling off a toilet .
Instead ,
Young carried her daughter to her car and drove her to the hospital .
Coe and his own daughter , who had been at Young 's house , were seen by neighbors leaving the home shortly after Young left with Emma for the hospital .
Young stopped the car shortly after she left when Emma apparently passed out in the back seat , according to pre-trial testimony .
She called 911 from her car and first responders attended to the girl there .
Emma was believed to be dead already .
After Emma was declared dead at a hospital , Young returned to her two - story home on Haverford Road as neighbors and police investigators assembled outside .
Mom on Trial for Failing to Protect Her Daughter
Julius Villareal , a neighbor , told ABCNews.com .
that Young appeared unusually calm given the circumstances and that she gave neighbors contradictory versions of what had happened .
" She told one group one thing and then told another group of neighbors a totally different story , " he said .
" She was cool , calm and collected .
She seemed kind of normal for someone who just lost a child . "
Villareal said Young told neighbors that Emma had fallen off the toilet in the bathroom , cracking her skull and splitting her lip .
She described in detail how the girl suffered extensive bruising from CPR attempts .
Young said extensive bruising on the girl 's thighs was caused when she pulled Emma from the car once the girl passed out .
" The most surprising thing I saw was her reaction when officers were getting ready to enter her house , " Villareal told ABCNews.com .
" She seemed nervous .
She tried to stall them and said she said she did n't have a key . "
Villareal said Young went out of her way to mention that Coe was good to her and her girls .
" In front of everyone , she was telling her oldest daughter that her boyfriend never hurt any of you girls and that he was nice to everybody , " he said .
" It was like she was coaching her . "
It has also been revealed that Emma 's pediatrician notified Texas Child Protective Services that the girl had tested positive for genital herpes , a sexually transmitted disease , just three weeks before her death .
But she was not removed from her home because there was no sign of sexual intercourse and there are rare cases where the disease is transmitted by nonsexual contact .
Investigators also did not know that Coe was Young 's boyfriend and spent time at her house .
Young 's attorney told the Houston Chronicle that the mother 's unusual behavior may have been her own way of grieving the unexpected death .
In the week before Emma 's death , Young had been on unspecified prescription drugs .
" She ( Young ) had been sick the week before Emma died , " attorney Colin Amann told the newspaper , without elaborating .
" From all I have seen she loved Emma as much as any parent could love any child , " Amann told the newspaper .
Young has been free on bond since the death and living with her mother in Brenham .
She works at a plant nursery and has had had no contact with her other two daughters , who have been placed in the custody of a former husband .
" Hopefully , other children will not have to suffer her fate , but that still does n't take away from the pain she must have gone through in those final hours , " said Villareal , whose wife is expected to testify at the trial .
BUENOS AIRES — As the World Cup gets rolling , the sky - blue and white clad Argentine fans are fired up with hope that their team will capture its third title .

Image caption Anamika Veeramani was one of the favourites to win the coveted trophy
A 14 - year - old girl from the US state of Ohio has won the country 's annual National Spelling Bee contest .
Anamika Veeramani , from North Royalton , claimed victory by correctly spelling the medical term stromuhr .
She takes home $ 40,000 ( £ 27,450 ) in cash and prizes , as well as the coveted championship title .
Anamika , who came joint fifth last year , was one of the favourites to win among the 273 spellers who took part in the three - day final in Washington .
It is the third year in a row that an Indian - American has won the championship .
Eight Indian - Americans have won in the last 12 years .
WINNING WORDS 2010 : Stromuhr , an instrument used to measure the velocity of blood flow
2009 : Laodicean , meaning lukewarm or indifferent in religion or politics
2008 : Guerdon , meaning something that one has earned or gained

A stromuhr is an instrument used to measure the velocity of blood flow .
The 14 - year - old winner , whose hobbies include golf and dancing , wants to go to Harvard to study to be a cardiovascular surgeon , the Associated Press news agency reported .
" It was too surreal , " said Anamika , who only broke into a smile after being handed the trophy .
" It was an amazing experience .
I usually have a poker face , so that 's what that was . "
Her nearest three rivals were eliminated for not being able to spell the word juvia , a term for a Brazil nut .
The popularity of the spelling bee - a peculiarly American tradition - has grown greatly over the past decade , partly as a result of the Academy Award - nominated documentary Spellbound .
The final was broadcast live on US television network ABC .

Then again , Reilly ’s career has been filled with unlikely detours .
After emerging from the Chicago theater scene , Reilly made an indelible impression in supporting roles in Paul Thomas Anderson ’s Hard Eight , Boogie Nights , and Magnolia .
His star continued to rise as he stole scenes in The Perfect Storm , Gangs Of New York , and The Hours .

In 2006 , Reilly ’s career took another unlikely turn when Adam McKay cast him as Will Ferrell ’s best - friend - turned - rival in the smash hit Talladega Nights .
Reilly became a core member of the Judd Apatow repertory , and unleashed his inner funnyman in Walk Hard and Step Brothers , for which he received a story credit alongside Ferrell and McKay .
Reilly also unexpectedly hooked up with cult comic masterminds Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareham , who cast him as a clueless doctor in Tim And Eric Awesome Show , Great Job !
The character was such a hit that he received a show of his own .
In Cyrus , the studio debut of mumblecore titans Jay and Mark Duplass , Reilly teams up with another Apatow favorite — Jonah Hill — to play a struggling divorcée who locks horns with girlfriend Marisa Tomei ’s live - at - home son .
The A.V. Club recently spoke with Reilly about improvisation , searching for truth in comedy , and why people have a hard time accepting him as a man who sleeps with beautiful women .
The A.V. Club :
How did you become involved with Cyrus ?
John C. Reilly : I guess I stared hearing about the Duplass brothers from my wife , who ’s a film producer .
She goes to a lot of film festivals , and she kept saying “ There ’s this movie , The Puffy Chair .
You ’d really love it .
You ’d really love these guys . ”
I just kept hearing their names , and eventually saw the movie , and really liked it .
Then they said they had written a script with me in mind , and I sat down and met them .
I liked them , and they said “ If you do n’t want to do this movie , we ’re not going to do it , because you ’re the only person we were thinking of when we were writing it . ” [ Laughs . ]
So — yeah .
And then Jonah [ Hill ] was also a big fan of theirs , and it kind of all came together .

AVC : At Sundance , a friend of mine said it reminded him of Step Brothers , in that it ’s another film about competition between two man-children .
JCR : Well , I do n’t see my character as so much of a man-child .
He ’s actually one of the more mature characters I ’ve ever played .
There ’s an obvious parallel , with an older guy still living at home , but I think that ’s the cool thing about this movie .
It has all the laughs of a big comedy , or a straight - up comedy , but it ’s very real and honest with the way people deal with each other , and the kind of emotional toll these things take on people .
I think that is a real asset to the movie , how honest we are .
And largely through improvisation — most of the dialogue in the movie was improvised , so it gives it kind of an original feel .
I mean , the story itself is not the most groundbreaking story , you know ?
You could point to other really mainstream movies that have a similar storyline .
But the way we executed it and the way you see the toll it takes on the characters as the story goes along is more honest than most movies dealing with this kind of thing .
Hopefully .

AVC : You talk about your character being more mature than a lot of the characters you ’ve played .
But in the very early scenes , he ’s a bit of a mess .
JCR : Yeah , but he is mature .
He is floundering and kind of failing in his life , and he ’s in kind of an emotional freefall .
But I did n’t feel like I had to play younger than I am in this movie .
It was very much written with me in mind , and the age that I am , and , whatever , the world - weariness that comes with that .
[ Laughs . ]
So when we ’re improvising , I did n’t feel like I had to , you know , spiff it up .
I just had to be honest .

AVC : What do you think Marisa Tomei ’s character sees in your character ?
JCR : God only knows .
I think , not to keep harping on the same thing , on and on , but what she says when she sees me flopping around from person to person at that party where we meet in the movie — she overhears me say something to this girl about how people do n’t really see the real me , and I ’m actually really fun .
I have a lot to give , and I lay my heart out , and then this girl ’s like , “ I have to make a phone call , ” and gets up , and Marisa ’s character witnesses that .
And so the first thing she says to me is , “ I really liked what you said .
I think it was really honest and frank . ”
I think people are like , you get into your 40s — if you ’re still looking for somebody , you ’ve gone through a lot of different phases of the dating thing , you ’re ready to tell the truth .
“ Let ’s not have these illusions .
Tell me what ’s really going on with you . ”
I do n’t know .
I think that can have a real impact on somebody .
He ’s been working his way through a lot of relationships where people do n’t really present their true self up front , you know ?

AVC : Something he has in common with a lot of the other characters you ’ve played is a vulnerability , and that seems to bring out the maternal side of both Tomei and Catherine Keener ’s characters .
JCR : Well Catherine just feels sorry for me .
[ Laughs . ]
She ’s trying to move on with her life , and I ’m like this barnacle on her side who she just ca n’t help but love .
But Marisa ’s character definitely — I do n’t know .
Despite not looking like a matinee idol , I feel like I have a lot to give .
I ’ve never had any trouble with women .
People are always surprised with the romantic aspect of my movies .
Advertisement
AVC : They ’re angry that you get the girl .
JCR : “ What could she possibly see — that ’s not right ! ” I ’m married to a very beautiful woman , and I do n’t know .
Advertisement
AVC : What could she see in scum like you ?
JR : A lot people like have this weird reaction .
“ That ’s not the way the world works ! ”
It upsets people ’s world order , or something .
“ No , someone who looks like you does not get with someone who looks like her . ”
Just look around , in life , there ’s people who want to date people who look like themselves , and there are people who are just looking for a good fit .
And a lot of times , a good fit is someone different than yourself .
I ’m not one to get too hung up on outside appearances .
I find people attractive for more subtle reasons than just the way they look .

AVC : With Steve Brule , there ’s kind of element of humor based in discomfort .
JCR : You ’re stretching there .
[ Laughs . ]
You ’re just trying to tie it into Steve Brule somehow .
Advertisement
AVC : You do n’t think there ’s kind of a through - line between the two ?
JCR : No .
AVC : You do n’t think some of the comedy in this film is derived from the characters feeling awkward , and the audience , by extension , feeling awkward as well ?
Advertisement
JCR : I guess so .
I had n’t really put the two together , but yeah .
AVC : And that seems like a form of comedy that you ’re attracted to .
JCR : Well , I ’m a big fan of not letting the audience of off the hook , as they say .
I like it when things feel real , and that ’s oftentimes not comfortable .
Life is often confusing and sad , and I ’m a big fan of the slap and the tickle , as they say .
You get them laughing , and then you can …
Any movie or play or whatever that ’s too downbeat —
Like , I ’ve seen stories about working - class characters , and it ’s just [ drumming on the chair ] one horrible thing after another , and then just marching through their lives .
I come from a working - class family , and that ’s just not how it is .
The way you get through having a shitty job is to laugh a lot and goof around .

AVC : A Sullivan ’s Travels sort of thing .
JCR : Sullivan ’s Travels ?
AVC : Yeah , where the character wants to make a big message film about society , and then realizes he can do better for society by making silly movies .
Advertisement
JCR : Yeah , well , that ’s not exactly the point I ’m making .
The point I was making is more like , life is varied .
Things are often complicated , and in the saddest situations , funny things happen .
Oftentimes , a funny situation is funny because it ’s uncomfortable or weird .
The most memorable stories , or the stuff that you repeat to your friends , it ’s not like , “ Oh , I had a pleasant day , nothing happened on the bus today . ”
It ’s when strange things happen , when you become uncomfortable or knocked out of your own reality , those are the things that are interesting .
AVC : When you ’re improvising in a film like this , is there ever a conflict between wanting to go for the big laugh vs. wanting to go for realism , or staying more in character in the movie ?
Advertisement
JCR : There was n’t in this one .
Kind of the exhausting thing about doing pure comedy , or something that ’s broader , is you ’re kind of a slave to the laugh .
If it ’s not funny , then there ’s not much point in doing it .
The kind of über - objective is to make people laugh .
You always have to have that in the back of your mind , “ Eh , I ’ve got to figure out a way to make this funny . ”
And as much as I love to improvise — it was an incredible , life - changing experience to work with Will Ferrell and Adam McKay on Talladega Nights and Step Brothers .
But part of me , coming from a more dramatic background …
I love to improvise , but I always thought “ Man , it ’s like the final frontier for improvisational actors , to really go for something emotional , something that ’s not just chasing the laugh . ”
So this movie was like the Holy Grail of that .
It was a funny movie — the circumstances are often funny — but it was n’t on me to make it funny .
I just had to be as honest as I could , and the laughs would just come .
In fact , a lot of the biggest laughs in the movie — I ’ve only seen it , I think , twice now with an audience — but a lot of the biggest laughs are things where I was n’t trying to be funny at all .
When Jonah ’s character goes into the bathroom while Marisa ’s in the shower , I have this kind of slow burn , like “ What the hell did I just see ? ” I was n’t trying to be funny , but it ’s this big laugh .
AVC : So can you talk a little bit about the evolution of Steve Brule ?
JCR : I think the less I say about Steve Brule , the better .
Honestly .
I think it ’s best just — whenever people ask me about him , I say , “ That ’s one crazy doctor . ”
Advertisement
AVC : You do n’t want to ruin the mystique ?
JCR : The more I talk about it , the less funny it is .
It is this thing .
It is what it is .
I ’m not really interested in analyzing it .
Advertisement
AVC : There was a lot of improvisation in Cyrus , and you ’ve also worked with Adam McKay and Robert Altman , who were famous for encouraging improvisation .
How would you compare their styles ?
JCR : Well , I end up improvising in almost everything to some degree , ’ cause it ’s often necessary on movies .
The script is one thing , and it ’s this kind of theory of what you ’re going to do , and then you get there on the day and you realize , “ Oh , the script is not appropriate to this room , the door ’s over here . ”
So you ’re always having to kind of custom - fit things to make stuff work .
But Robert Altman was sheer beauty .
He would be happy if you said the words , but perfectly happy if something else happened , too .
It seemed like Altman was always trying to make you forget where the camera was .
He wanted to catch you when you were n’t acting , which was kind of liberating .
Because a lot of times when we were doing Prairie Home Companion , there were so many cameras rolling , there was literally no time or no way to figure out where the frame was .
“ There ’s a camera over there somewhere , I guess we ’re on ! ”
So it was a kind of immersive experience for that reason .
Then , Adam McKay … he and Will work really hard on writing good scripts .
They go through a long process of improvising while they ’re writing .
And we wrote a lot of Step Brothers together , and the whole writing process was like improvisation .
And then different people would come in , gagmen or comedy specialists would come in to do little structural things .
But for the most part —
Advertisement
AVC : Highly paid professionals ?
JCR : Yeah .
But then you know , you get there , we usually do one or two takes of what ’s written , and then it starts changing .
Sometimes very quickly , and sometimes just slowly , things start to evolve .
And Adam does shoot a lot of film .
But basically , you have that script to rely on .
If nothing — in case the inspiration ’s just not there , if something does n’t make us laugh that we wanted to try , we always have the script .
We ’ve worked really hard on making the script good .
It comes from an improvisational place anyway .
Advertisement
AVC : It ’s like a safety net .
JCR : Yeah .
But this one , [ the Duplass brothers ] wrote a pretty good script , and then they did n’t want to do it .
They did n’t want to do any of the dialogue , so the structure of the story stayed the same , pretty much , with a couple little changes in the editing room , and we would go in pretty much expecting to accomplish what the scenes accomplished in the script , but not with any of the words .
So it was really a kind of intimidating responsibility .
It was like , “ Even though I love to improvise , and I do it a lot , it ’s nice to know if I do n’t reinvent the wheel this morning , we have the script , we can always do the script . ”
It was really cool .
These guys have an interesting way of working .
They really stuck to their guns , too .
When they worked on their movies The Puffy Chair and Baghead and other ones they ’ve done , they ’ve had much smaller budgets , and they ’re used to the luxury of time and being able to just , “ Well , if we do n’t get the scene today , we ’ll just go back tomorrow and re-shoot it . ”
It ’s just friends of theirs , and very low pressure .
And this was a very different situation for them , but they stuck to their guns .
And so we ’d go and do these long takes with digital - video cameras .
Advertisement
We ’d do like 20 - minute takes and just kind of find our way through the scenes , and then they ’d stop and go walk around by themselves for 20 minutes , talking about the direction they wanted things to go in .
I thought they did a really good job of maintaining their aesthetic and their filmmaking point of view while taking on this heavier baggage of a bigger crew and more money and shooting in Los Angeles with permits and all that stuff .
The improv was pretty — every time I would say “ Well , what do you want to happen ? ” they ’d be like , “ What do you want ?
What is the character ?
What does your instinct say ? ”
And I would be like , “ Well , my instinct , I could do anything , but you ’re the authors of the story , what do you want to happen ? ”
Even though it was often disconcerting and made me uncomfortable to take on the responsibility , they would always pass it back .
And it worked great for the movie .
AVC : It ’s hard to do improvisation well if you do n’t have a baseline of trust .
JCR : Yeah , or a sense of play at least .
A lot of times , good improv is when both people , or however many people are in the scene , really have no idea what the next thing you ’re going to say is .
A lot of times what happens is , people just get scared , and they ’re like , “ Okay , I ’ll say this and this and this , ” and they ’ll try to remember it , and they ’re not really reacting to what you ’re saying , they ’re just trying to remember this list of things they thought beforehand .
But Jonah ’s not like that .
I thought it was really cool the way Jonah used his ability to riff in the Apatow films , the work he ’s done before .
It was fun to play with him and riff in a — I keep saying emotional , but in a more real way .
Rather than just try to find something to top each other with jokes , or who could say the next outrageous thing , it was more like this game of trying to outsmart each other .
We ’re often at cross purposes , and we ’re trying to manipulate each other , and it was really fun to see the different ways we would come up with to work the next move in the game .
And Jay and Mark would encourage that .
They would talk to us separately .
They would do very little directing to the group .
They usually would pull someone to the side and be like , “ Okay , this is your agenda , ” and then they ’d go tell me something else , and then we ’d roll cameras .
I do n’t think we did really any rehearsals , other than some very basic blocking rehearsals without dialogue , just so the camera people would know where we were going .
So a lot of the best stuff in the movie is the first take , as soon as we took our first stab at it .

AVC : What part of Chicago did you grow up in ?
JCR : I ’m from Marquette Park .
Southwest side .
AVC : Do you think growing up in Chicago affected your evolution as an actor ?
If nothing else , it ’s a great theater city .
Advertisement
JCR : I started doing plays when I was a young kid .
I like Chicago for its lack of aggression .
New York and L.A. , they ’re both such commercial places .
New York especially , as an actor , it will just eat you alive , and Chicago — the lessons I learned here doing theater were like , “ The play ’s the thing , and I only succeed if all of us succeed . ”
That kind of thinking .
It ’s a lot different in New York .
Usually , the people I ’ve met from there have much more of an attitude of , “ Well , good luck to you out there , I ’m going to take care of myself .
Hopefully you ’ll be fine too . ” [ Laughs . ]
But it ’s dog - eat - dog out there , baby .
AVC : There ’s more of a sense that you ’re in competition with everybody .
JCR : And Chicago ’s more of a sense of a community .
And it does n’t seem like , when I was coming up here — maybe it ’s different now — no one really felt like , “ Well , if I do well in this play , I ’m going to be an overnight sensation . ”
The stakes were lower .
Most of the people doing it here do it because they really love it , not because they want to be famous or get rich .

AVC : You ’ve made a lot of smaller films .
Of all the movies you ’ve made , which did you feel did n’t get the attention or the praise you felt they should have ?
JCR : Well , they all kind of find their way .
They all kind of eventually percolate down and find the audience .
I thought a movie I made here called The Promotion really did n’t get a very fair shake .
And I think [ the writer - director ] , Steve Conrad , is a really great writer .
It ’s a weird movie , but that was one I thought — but again , it is finding its audience now on cable and DVD .
More and more people come up to me and talk to me about that movie .
Hard Eight , Paul Anderson ’s first movie , which is really called Sydney , had some of the best reviews of any movie I ’ve ever been in , and I think the shortest theatrical run .
But as a result of Paul ’s work , after that , he has definitely found an audience .
I think just getting a movie done is an accomplishment in itself .
It ’s almost like a success that you ’ve got the money to do it , and you made it , and it ’s good .
Criminal , I thought , was another movie that was pretty good .
The smaller movies , it ’s tougher .
A lot of times , mainstream critics are much tougher on small , independent movies because they can be .
If it ’s Shrek 3 and they say something really mean about it , they ’re not going to be invited to the buffet at the hotel the next time , they ’re not going to get the gift bag .
They ’re not going to be thought of well within the matrix , but the little movie that does n’t have some big corporation behind it , it ’s like they get out all their bile on that .
It ’s like “ Pick on the weak kid in school , what ’s he going to do ? ”
Even I can pick on him .
Pandemonium Warden (? ) Gameplay details Type Notorious Monster Data Stats
This is the end ... of nothing ...
Defeating me proves only that you harbor the seeds of evil within your trembling flesh ...
Someday ... they shall come ... into fruition ...
Pandemonium Warden , Final Fantasy XI
Pandemonium Warden is one of two High Notorious Monsters in Final Fantasy XI ( along with Absolute Virtue ) to garner special maintenance to weaken its powers .
Upon its introduction into Final Fantasy XI , more than 36 players marathon fighting Pandemonium Warden for 18 hours were unable to defeat it .
They were forced to retire after members of the party started to become physically ill ; after such a prolonged period of gaming , they began to faint and vomit , creating news reports to be filed in argument of the game 's User Message present at every login , which states that Square Enix " ... does not wish to see [ their players ' ] lives ... " suffer as a result of extensive play .
Following the 18 hour attempt , the monster ( along with Absolute Virtue ) was patched to only have a spawn time of two hours , and its overall difficulty was significantly decreased — if not beaten within that time , it despawns and vanishes ; also , its satellites no longer have 25,000 HP each , but closer to only 2,400 .
Though rewards for felling the Warden are essentially negligible , they are unique to its loot pool , making the ornate weapon and armor models more trophy items than applicable gear choices .
Until the update to augment additional damage to Relic Weapons , the Shenlong 's Baghnakhs , for example , were a particularly strong hand - to - hand weapon for Monks and Puppetmasters , but no longer hold a fight against a fully - upgraded pair of Spharai .
However , with the addition of Mythic Weapons , the Mulcibar 's Scoria item that the Warden drops is an essential part of the upgrade process for Mythic Weapons ; specifically using 3 to fulfill the Trial of the Magians quests to upgrade the weapons from level 95 to level 99 .
Garnering an additional 150 scoria for a further Trial will grant the Afterglow effect to the weapon as well .

It is initially seen in one base form , a Dvergr , but instantly shifts to resemble other High Notorious Monsters from the Aht Urhgan expansion , such as Cerberus , Khimaira , and Medusa .
It will spawn multiple satellite monsters , which assist each version in battle .
When one form is defeated , it transforms into another .
It has a total of ten forms , which when defeated forces it to return to its " base form " .
All eleven forms must be defeated to claim victory .
The primary difficulty with defeating the monster nowadays involves how to deal with its use of the Summoner 2 - Hour ability Astral Flow , which all 8 satellites execute simultaneously three times when it is in its final form .
Pandemonium Warden was defeated first by the North American Linkshell Apathy on the Remora server , and several other times by various other groups since .
The first kill involved using Blue Mages to sacrifice themselves using a strong spell called " Cannonball " to deal damage and then be the single person take all of the damage dealt by Pandemonium Warden 's intense attacks .
Pandæmonium comprises the Greek words pan , " all " , and daimonion , " demon " ; it can roughly be translated as " all demons " .
Pandæmonium is the castle of Lucifer and the capital of Hell in John Milton 's Paradise Lost , and the word was invented by him .
The word has also come to mean any wild disorder or chaos in English .
Certain natural and man-made events that loom on the near horizon have the power to completely transform our world .
Below , the editors of Scientific American contemplate a handful of possibilities and rate their likelihood of happening by 2050 .
Some may bring to mind long - standing dystopian visions — species extinction , war - waging machines , Frankenstein ’s monster .
Yet the best thinking today suggests that many events that have been widely feared will not unfold as popular conceptions have predicted they will .
Synthetic life
Odds : Almost certain
A scientist adds a few chemical compounds to a bubbling beaker and gives it a swirl .
Subtle reactions occur , and , lo and behold , a new life form assembles itself , ready to go forth and prosper .
Such is the popular imagining of synthetic biology , or life created in the lab .
But even after last month ’s announcement that researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute had successfully booted up a cell using a synthetically created genome , scientists remain far from understanding the basic processes that could allow inert , undirected compounds to assemble into living , self - replicating cells .
Most scientists working in synthetic biology today are exploring the effects of modifying only parts of existing genetic codes .
In fact , manipulating genomes has become so widespread that even high schoolers do it .
A major aim of such work is to bring the principles of large - scale engineering to biology .
Imagine a world where bamboo is programmed to grow into a chair , or where self - assembling solar panels ( otherwise known as leaves ) feed electricity to houses .
Reprogrammed bacteria might even be able to invade our bodies to heal , acting as an army of living doctors inside us .
“ In principle , everything that is manufactured could be manufactured with biology , ” argues George M. Church , a geneticist and technology developer at Harvard Medical School .
It is already happening on a small scale : Enzymes from high - temperature microbes used in laundry detergent have been re-engineered to perform in cold water , thereby saving energy .
With great promise comes great risk , of course — namely in the form of modified organisms escaping the lab .
Most such creations today are too ungainly to survive in the wild .
For more sophisticated creations in the future , synthetic biologists expect that various safeguards would have to be instituted , such as including a new kind of self - destruct sequence in the genetic code .
Asteroid collision
Odds : Unlikely
The good news is that no giant asteroids appear poised to rewrite history anytime soon .
The bad news is that we can expect that in the next 200 years , a small space rock will burst into the atmosphere with enough force to devastate a small city .
NASA classifies any asteroid or comet that comes within 195 million kilometers of
the planet as a near - Earth object , or NEO .
Of the estimated 1,100 that are one kilometer or more in diameter , 85 percent have been spotted , and none of those will collide with Earth .
The bigger threat now , however , involves smaller rocks , according to a National Research Council report released earlier this year .
These asteroids and comets are too small to bring about an Armegeddon — as did the 10 - kilometer - wide asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs — but any that are 140 meters or more could still deliver an impact energy of 300 megatons of TNT .
Researchers concerned about the greatest risk are thinking even smaller , because the most likely NEO scenario is a 30 - to 50 - meter “ city killer , ” a fireball that would detonate in the atmosphere .
The most famous of such devastating “ airbursts ” occurred in 1908 over Tunguska , Siberia , an event that flattened an area the size of London .
The famous Meteor Crater in Barringer , Ariz. , resulted from a meteorite in this size category .
The NRC report estimates that 25 - meter airbursts occur every 200 years .
Most explode over oceans , where the direct risk to life is low but where the initiation of a tsunami is possible .
But what would we do if we spotted an NEO with our name on it ?
For these smaller , city - detroying rocks the choices are limited , perhaps restricted to evacuation .
Nuclear exchange
Odds : Unlikely
The threat of global nuclear annihilation has been greatly reduced by the end of the Cold War and ongoing arms - control efforts by the U.S. , Russia , and other countries .
But rogue nations and continued tensions make a local exchange of nuclear firepower all too real a possibility .
A single detonation could cause horrible death in several ways .
The Hiroshima blast generated supersonic wind speeds that crushed concrete buildings near ground zero .
Heat from the blast scorched to death anyone within one kilometer .
People many kilometers away eventually succumbed to radiation poisoning and cancer .
Global effects , however , would not happen unless dozens of bombs exploded , as might occur in an exchange between Pakistan and India .
In modeling the effects , scientists have assumed that those nations would unload their entire arsenals , so that about 100 Hiroshima bombs would go off .
Aside from the 20 million killed in the war , many outside the conflict would perish over time .
That is because the blasts would throw 5 million metric tons of soot into the upper atmosphere .
Within two months they would blanket the planet .
Darkened skies would rob plants of sunlight and disrupt the food chain for 10 years .
The resulting famine would kill the 1 billion people who now survive on marginal food supplies .
Self - aware robots
Odds : Likely
Today ’s computers and robots are for the most part designed to perform specific tasks under known conditions .
Tomorrow ’s machines , though , could have more autonomy .
They should be able to self - replicate , teach themselves , and adapt to different conditions .
“ As the kinds of tasks that we want machines to perform become more complex , the more we need them to take care of themselves , ” says Hod Lipson , a mechanical and computer engineer at Cornell University .
As machines get better at learning how to learn , he says , “ I think that leads down the path to consciousness and self - awareness . ”
Once a machine can understand its own existence and construction , it should be able to design an improvement for itself .
That will be a “ critical measurement of when things get interesting , ” says Will Wright , creator of the SimCity videogames and co-founder of the Berkeley , Calif . –based robotics workshop the Stupid Fan Club .
Improvements would be manifested in subsequent generations , which , for machines , can arise in only a few hours .
“ Personally , I ’ve always been more scared of this [ doomsday ] scenario than a lot of others , ” he says .
“ This could happen in our lifetime .
And once we ’re sharing the planet with some form of superintelligence , all bets are off . ”
Not everyone is so pessimistic .
Selmer Bringsjord , a logician and philosopher at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , says that because machines follow the logic of their programming , “ the machine is n’t going to get some supernatural power ” if the programming is done properly .
The emergence of more intelligent AI wo n’t come on “ like an alien invasion of machines , ” agrees futurist and prominent author Ray Kurzweil .
Machines , he says , will follow a path that mirrors the evolution of humans .
Ultimately , however , self - aware , self - improving machines will evolve beyond humans ’ ability to control or even understand them , he says .
Wright , for one , wonders if people should even try to govern this new breed of AI .
“ Who says that evolution is n’t supposed to go this way ? ” he asks .
“ Should the dinosaurs have legislated that the mammals not grow bigger and take over more of the planet ? ”
Cloning of a human
Odds : Likely
Ever since the birth of Dolly the sheep in 1996 , human cloning has seemed inevitable .
Yet despite the success scientists have had with other animals , the process had proved much more difficult in humans .
Scientists generate clones by replacing the nucleus of an egg cell with that from another individual .
They have cloned human embryos , but none has yet successfully grown past the early stage where it is a solid ball of cells known as a morula .
It may be that the act of transferring the nucleus disrupts the ability of chromosomes to align properly during cell division .
“ Whenever you clone a new species , there ’s a learning curve , ” says Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technologies in Worcester , Mass. , who made headlines in 2001 for first cloning human embryos .
Especially tricky steps include discovering the correct timing and mix of chemicals to properly reprogram the cell .
Even with practiced efforts , some 25 percent of cloned animals have overt problems , Lanza notes .
This is because minor slips during the reprogramming , culturing , or handling of the embryos can lead to developmental errors .
Attempts to clone a human would be so risky , Lanza says , it “ would be like sending a baby up into space in a rocket that has a 50 - 50 chance of blowing up . ”
If human cloning happens , it probably will be performed “ in a less restrictive area of the world , probably by some wealthy eccentric individual , ” Lanza conjectures .
Will the rest of us recoil in horror ?
It ’s possible that we ’ll grow to accept cloning , for reproductive purposes , as readily as we accepted in vitro fertilization .
Polar meltdown
Odds : Likely
The U.S. is shrinking — physically .
It lost nearly 20 meters of beach from its East Coast during the 20th century .
The oceans have risen by roughly 6.7 inches since 1900 through expansion ( warmer water taking up more space ) and the ongoing meltdown of polar ice .
That increase , however , is a small fraction compared with what ’s to come .
“ Plan on 1 meter [ of ocean rise ] by the end of this century , ” says glaciologist Robert Bindschadler , an emeritus scientist at NASA .
“ The heat in the ocean is killing the ice sheet . ”
Some of the famous predictions — Florida under 5 meters of sea - level rise and a gaping bay where Bangladesh used to be — may be centuries away .
But because ice sheets are shrinking faster than scientists expected even a few years ago , expect an ice - free Arctic and different coastal contours by 2100 .
By the reckoning of economist Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics , 200 million people live at altitudes within 1 meter of the present sea level , including eight of the world ’s largest cities .
“ They ’re going to have to move , ” Bindschadler suggests .
Even if greenhouse gas emissions decline , the polar meltdowns will be difficult to avoid because ice sheets lag the overall climate and , once melted , have a hard time re-forming .
Just how humans will adapt to a more watery world is not known .
Of today ’s trend , Bindschadler notes , “ We ’re not going to avoid this one . ”

WILL INDIA DEPLOY ITS ARMY AGAINST MAOIST TERRORISTS ?
India is considering a large - scale redeployment of specialized counterterrorist commandos based in Kashmir - Jammu and a paramilitary force based in Northeast India to combat a growing Naxalite ( Maoist ) insurgency in East India .
With nearly 300 deaths attributable to Naxalite violence since April , there is concern that existing security forces are losing their grip over the region .
The deliberate May 28 derailment of the Jnaneswari Express that killed 150 people appears to have convinced the Home Ministry that new measures were needed to deal with the Maoists ( Telegraph [ Kolkota ] , June 8 ; The Hindu , June 12 ) .
The new plan calls for the redeployment of roughly 10,000 men in 10 battalions drawn from the Rashtriya Rifles and the Assam Rifles .
The force would operate across four states , Jharkhand , Bengal , Orissa and Chhattisgarh , to aid the existing state police and federal paramilitary forces .
The heartland of the insurgency is in the thick forests of Dantewada in Chattisgarh state .
The Home Ministry is also calling for the Armed Forces Special Powers
Act to be imposed on the region in order to give the military a freer hand in conducting operations .
A June 10 Meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security ( CCS ) led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh failed to come to a decision about the redeployment .
Home Minister P. Chidambaram ’s requests for Army support in the Eastern states were rebuffed by Defense Minister A.K. Antony , who opposes weakening forces currently deployed near the borders with China and Pakistan ( Times of India , June 11 ) .
Chidambaram ’s presentation may have been better received by the Prime Minister , who recently identified the Naxalites as the greatest internal threat to India ’s security ( see Terrorism Monitor , June 4 ) .
It is expected the CCS will meet again soon on the issue .
More specifically , the Army turned down calls for mine - clearing teams to operate in the region , saying such teams could not operate without the prior establishment of intelligence networks and control of the region by infantry forces .
Similarly , the use of Special Forces could not happen until the infantry had already taken control on the ground .
The Special Forces could not be asked to hold ground , only carry out targeted operations ( Chandigarh Tribune , June 1 ; Times of India , June 11 ) .
The Assam Rifles is a paramilitary organization with 46 battalions reporting to the Home Ministry but operating under the administrative and operational control of the Indian Army .
The unit was originally raised as the Cachar Levy by the British in 1835 for use as a police force against the tribes of the Northeast .
Their mission expanded during World War One , when they served in Europe and the Middle East as part of Britain ’s Gurkha regiments .
In World War Two they served closer to home against the Japanese in Burma .
The Rifles also fought a successful delaying action against the Chinese in the high - altitude Sino - Indian War of 1962 .
These days the Assam Rifles are occupied with small operations against Northeastern insurgent groups such as the People ’s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak ( PREPAK ) , the tribal Zou People ’s Army ( ZPA ) , the United National Liberation Front ( UNLF – seeking independence for Manipur state ) and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland ( NSCN ) ( Sangai Express , June 9 ; Nagaland Post , June 1 ; Hueiyen News Service , June 7 ; Imphal Free Press , June 6 ) .
Eighty - five percent of the Assam Rifles is officered by regular army officers on three year assignments and recruiting is now carried out across India ( IndiaDefence.com , June 19 , 2007 ) .
The much newer Rashtriya Rifles consists of 40,000 men organized in five Counter Insurgency Forces ( CIF ) named Delta , Kilo , Romeo , Uniform and Victor .
The Rashtriya Rifles is an elite counterterrorism unit first raised in 1990 to exclusively tackle terrorists and insurgents active in India ’s Jammu - Kashmir region .
The force is lightly armed but has established a reputation for effectiveness .
Personnel are drawn from all Army services and earn additional pay and benefits while serving in the counterterrorist force .
Men and officers usually spend four to five years in the unit before returning to the regular army ( India Today , June 2 ) .
The Indian Air Force ( IAF ) will also be asked to do more .
At present , the IAF has four helicopters on rescue and evacuation duties in the region , but will land only when a site has been completely secured , even if the mission calls for the evacuation of wounded troops ( Telegraph [ Calcutta ] , June 8 ) .
The Home Ministry is looking for Russian - built Mi-17 helicopters to help ground forces with transport , surveillance and evacuation ( Chandigarh Tribune , June 10 ; India Today , June 2 ) .
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) have been offered instead .
If a decision to redeploy is not made soon , the onset of the June - September Indian monsoon season may postpone any mass movement of troops and equipment .
There are also signs that the Maoists may make a transfer of the Assam Rifles difficult by intensifying insurgent activities in Northeast India ( Asian Age [ Mumbai ] , June 8 ) .
CLASHES WITH SPLA REBELS MOVE INTO SUDAN’S OIL - RICH UNITY STATE
The Government of South Sudan ( GoSS ) continues to struggle with renegades who have broken away from GoSS security forces after losing in local elections in April to official candidates of the Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement ( SPLM ) ( see Terrorism Monitor , May 20 ) .
The latest commander to take up arms against the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army ( SPLA – the armed wing of the SPLM ) is police Colonel Gatluak Gai ( a.k.a. Galwak Gai ) , who called a Khartoum daily to announce his men had taken 27 machine guns with the intention of joining the forces of another renegade , Lieutenant General George Athor Deng ( Al - Ra ’y al - Amm [ Khartoum ] , May 29 ) .
SPLA spokesman General Kuol Diem Kuol claims that Colonel Gai is working to further the interests of the ruling National Congress Party ( NCP ) in Khartoum and to “ disturb security ” in Unity State ( Sudan Tribune , May 29 ) .
On June 2 , Colonel Gai ’s loyalists engaged in a firefight with SPLA troops , with a combined loss of nine lives .
One of the captured Gai loyalists was reported by the SPLA to be a member of the Sudanese Armed Forces ( SAF ) ( AFP , June 2 ) .
Colonel Gai ’s followers were later defeated in a clash with the SPLA in Unity State ’s Mayom County on June 7 , in which 21 of his men were killed and 32 others captured .
The SPLA reported Colonel Gai and an estimated 50 men had fled by night into a region of thick bush controlled by the Joint Integrated Units ( JIU ) , forces composed of fighters drawn from both the SPLA and the SAF ( Sudan Tribune , June 8 ) .
Colonel Gai and his fighters were last seen headed for the important Heglig oil field , a territory still disputed by Khartoum and the GoSS ( Reuters , June 9 ) .
General George Athor Deng , another defeated candidate who is leading a rebellion in similarly oil - rich Jonglei State , announced on June 2 that he was coordinating operations with Colonel Gai and another failed electoral candidate , David Yauyau , also of Jonglei State ( Reuters , June 1 ; June 9 ) .
Yauyau is a SPLA veteran who ran as the candidate of the United Democratic Front ( UDF ) , a pro-independence Southern political party .
Containing some of the largest oil reserves in Sudan , Unity ( Wahda ) State was part of the South ’s Upper Nile Province until boundaries were reorganized in 1994 .
The state has been repeatedly ravaged by government troops , militias and tribal clashes since 1997 , resulting in a massive displacement of the local population ( Business Daily Africa , June 16 ) .
Exact boundaries between North and South in the area have yet to be determined with the Southern referendum on independence now just a year away .
Unity State is a potential flashpoint that could reignite the civil war between North and South Sudan .
The SPLM also faces dissension from a breakaway group , SPLM - Democratic Change ( SPLM - DC ) .
Elements of this group are believed responsible for the assassination of the paramount Shilluk chief , Peter Oyath , on May 22 .
SPLA forces reported clashing with SPLM - DC forces near Malakal international airport on June 6 ( Sudan Tribune , June 8 ; June 10 ) .
However , SPLA spokesman General Kuol Diem Kuol has denied reports that SPLA forces entered Malakal ( under JIU authority ) to kidnap SPLM - DC politicians , including MP Mustafa Gai ( Sudan Tribune , June 6 ) .
It seems the Empire has fallen on hard times .
Presumably to get finishing funds for his latest Death Star , Darth Vader — or a man pretending to be Darth Vader ? — was reduced to robbing a bank on Long Island this morning .
Impotent Rebel Alliance security forces tell Newsday ( paywall ) that Vader marched into a Chase bank in Setauket around 11:30 a.m. today .
Brandishing a completely unnecessary handgun — as he had the power to choke the oxygen out every teller 's throat — the fallen Jedi demanded cash .
It 's unclear whether he also found their lack of faith disturbing , but one Rebel policeman says , " The teller complied with the robber 's demands and gave him money from the drawer . "
Vader is described as 6 feet , 2 inches tall , also wearing camouflage pants , and was last seen boarding a starfighter headed in the direction of Long Island 's sinister Sith stronghold , in Valley Stream .
( Is n't this also where Improv Everywhere has their headquarters ? )
Below , a surveillance photo from the teller 's point of view :
Update 7/23 : Witnesses say bank customers thought it was a joke at first — but then Darth Vader used the Force .
Update 7/24 : Now it 's reported that Darth Vader truly was trying to do this for the Evil Empire — the Yankees , that is :
He threw a Yankees backpack at the teller .

America at Risk : Camus , National Security , and Afghanistan ( AEI ) Former Speaker of the House and AEI senior fellow Newt Gingrich will warn that now is the time to awaken from self - deception about the nature of our enemies and rebuild a bipartisan commitment , in Afghanistan and elsewhere , to defend America .
Drawing on the lessons of Camus and Orwell , Gingrich will describe the dangers of a wartime government that uses language and misleading labels to obscure reality .
He will explain why we need a debate about this larger war against the irreconcilable wing of Islam — which mortally threatens America ’s way of life , freedom , and rule of law — and how it relates to the nuclear threat from Iran and the various other risks posed to America ’s very existence .
Most importantly , Gingrich will argue that America will remain at risk until it confronts this willful blindness about the nature of its enemies and the nature of the war in which it is engaged .
The Air They Breathe : How Media May Shape Boys and Girls ' Beliefs About Sex and Gender , Their Sexual Behavior , and Their Futures ( RAND ) Each day , youths spend more than seven hours with some kind of media , and when one accounts for the use of two media at once , they clock in at nearly eleven total hours of watching , listening , or generating content .
This creates the potential for powerful influence on young people 's lives , both positive and negative .
How might current media images of girls influence how they see themselves and their potential ?
Do the portrayals of sex that saturate popular music , television , and film influence behavior ?
We will discuss when and how media use might put well - being and future opportunities at risk , and how it might be harnessed by parents , content creators , and others to help young people build happier , healthier futures .
Were people in the Old Testament really that Old ?
I would like to jump ahead to chapter 5 of Genesis for a moment , and then go back to chapter 4 .
The fifth chapter of Genesis is the genealogy of Adam and Eve .
It gives us the ages of some of Adam 's children ( and their children ’s children ) .
Many times in the Old Testament we see the life span of humans reaching great ages .
Many as old as 900 years .
The Bible tells us that :
Adam lived 930 years .
( Genesis 5:5 )
Seth lived 912 years . ( Genesis 5:8 )
Methuselah lived 969 years . ( Genesis 5:27 )
And Noah lived 950 years .
( Genesis 9:29 )
Many people wonder how , or if this is possible .
" These great ages are not presented in the Bible as if they are in any way extraordinary for their times , let alone miraculous . "
Carl Wieland Creation Ex Nihilo 20 ( 4) :10 –13 , September–November 1998
What is the answer ?
Did humans once have a much longer lifespan ?
If so , why is it that many people today do not live to be 100 ?
The answer I believe in part lies in the state of the earth when God first Created it , compared to the sin wrecked world we live in today .
When you look at the age of the Patriarchs ( Adam 's descendants ) in Genesis you will see two things .
One , is that from Adam to Noah the average life span was somewhere in the neighborhood of 900 years .
These people lived in a very different world than we do today ( this was at a time before the flood described in Genesis ) .
God Created the earth perfect .
But when Adam sinned this world began to decay .
Then when the flood came , things really got wrecked .
Some Creationists believe that the pre-flood vapor canopy ( the firmament in GEN 1:6 ) would filter out radiation , and hold in incoming solar heat making the earth a warmer place to live .
This " expanse " separated the " waters above " from the " waters below " in the Creation week .
I believe that the firmament may have collapsed at the time of the flood .
As a result harmful radiation can enter the earth more easily than before , bringing with it all kinds of damaging effects .
The life span of man has been declining since the flood .
The average age of man quickly dropped to less than 100 in the 200 years after the flood .
( chart from AIG )
Some critics claim that the 900 years of life mentioned in the Bible were not literal years .
They claim that back then people counted each month as a year .
They claim that you have to take the age given in the Bible and divide by 12 months .
This is wrong for many reasons .
The Bible tells us how old the patriarchs were when their children were born .
Cainan was 70 when his son was born .
If you divided the age by 12 , then that means he would have had a child at 5 years old .
-
This is impossible .
Also Moses compiled Genesis .
He could clearly differentiate between a month and a year .
He did so many times in his writing .
Also , when Jesus came to earth he taught us many things .
If the Patriarchs did not live as long as the Bible claims then Jesus would have told us .
The ages given in Genesis are literal years .
Rather than evolving , we are degenerating .
And will continue to do so until Christ returns .
Neanderthal man -
Why did they look the way they do ?
This page will show you that these people were human , but had odd facial features resulting from living to great ages .
----------------------
Why do Neanderthals look the way they do ?
The Neanderthal morphology is one of the most misunderstood in all of anthropology .
Many people claim that Neanderthals were primitive , dimwitted cave men .
The truth is Neanderthals were fully human .
Neanderthals did look a little different than we do today .
The question is " How different ? " and " Why did they look this way ? "
How did the Neanderthals look different ?
Compared to people living today , the Neanderthal adults had a more prominent brow ridge and some also had a chinless appearance .
These features do not make them less human , nor do they make them primitive .
Why did they look this way ?
The bible describe people in the early parts of Genesis that lived for hundreds of years .
One of the things that we have learned from modern science is that the bones of the head and face continue to grow through our entire adult life ( though at a slower rate than when we are children ) .
What would the faces of people who lived for hundreds of years look like ?
Dr. Jack Cuozzo has studied both the Bible and the Neanderthal remains in depth , he believes these people would look like ( and consequently are ) the Neanderthals .
I recommend Dr. Jack Cuozzo's book : " Buried Alive : The startling truth about Neanderthals " which explains in detail his research and uncovers some tampering with fossils ( some people changed them to make them look more ape like than they actually were ) .
" Buried Alive "
Age Changes in Our head and face
" Bishara , Treder , and Jacobsen recently wrote in the American Journal of Orthodontics that after the normal growth period for modem man is finished ( 18 to 25 years ) , growth still continues in the face and head . ’
They measured the same 15 men and 15 women with precision cephalometric ( measurable ) x-rays over a time frame of 21 years . "
" Hrdlicka also emphasized that overall the results are not entirely uniform but the general tendency is clear .
He believed that adult growth of the head was a fact not to be ignored . "
" Therefore , it can be concluded that with the exception of the females of one isolated Indian tribe in the United States , all other groups of peoples studied by the aforementioned anthropologists showed the following : a skull whose proportions changed as it aged with the lengths gaining the most , the widths next , and the heights the least .
" T. Wingate Todd in 1924 measured 448 male skulls for thickness of the bone itself in various places .
He found a sporadic thickening of the cranium ( skull ) during later life .
He also found no evidence of real dimunition in thickness of the cranium ( skull ) with increasing age . ’
( 12 ) It has long been a myth in our society that aging was synonymous with bone loss .
Here we find a top scientist early in this century contradicting that opinion .
The skull gets thicker in certain places with age . "
" Buchi studied 200 Swiss adults and separated them into six age classes .
He concluded in 1950 that aging resulted in gains in diameter of the head and face and also of the long bones . ( 23 ) "
This also explains the robusticity of Neanderthal post- crania .
Thompson and Kendrick in 1964 used cephalometnc ( measurable ) x-ray analysis of 71 men aged 22 - 34 years .
They took measurements once a year .
They saw that without much attrition ( wear ) of the teeth the vertical dimension of the face increased significantly .
( 24 ) Kendrick and Risinger in 1967 measured the same 71 men and reported increases in head length and facial depth . ( 25 )
" Susanne in 1977 published a work done on 44 Belgian men .
Susanne measured their heads twice between the ages of 25 and 60 years and found consistent increases in head length and head width , also demonstrating gains in the lengths of their faces , their noses , and their ears .
He found a decrease in the size and thickness of the .
lips , too . ( 27 ) "
" When are the Bible - believing people going to wake up and put two and two together ?
If there were genuinely old people who lived in the past , do n’t you suppose they would have undergone the same changes in the face and head that the aforementioned studies have described ?
If so , where are the remains of these people ?
Do you think that the museums have any skulls of these very old people ?
Do you think the museums would ever consider this type of reasoning ?
The answer to the latter question is no , since the museums and secular universities are dominated by evolutionists who do not believe that the Bible has anything valuable to say in the area of science or history . "
Dr. Cuozzo
I was surprised at first to find how many people had never heard that the Bible teaches Adam and his descendants lived for hundreds of years .
Then I realized , if no one knew this fact , then no one could apply that fact to the fossil record and interpret it correctly .
If you have any questions on Creation , Evolution , or just want to say " Hi " please feel free to email me .
as of 2/03
Even if you only casually follow the World Cup , you ’ve no doubt heard about the controversial finish to the match between the United States and Slovenia , which ended in a 2 - 2 draw .
Of course , the result should have been a miraculous 3 - 2 come from behind victory for the Yanks but referee Koman Coulibaly disallowed Maurice Edu ’s goal in the 86th minute of action .
Why did he disallow it ?
We ’d show you the video , but apparently FIFA prohibits that ( and hot chicks in the stands ) :
Assuming you ’ve seen the actual video , could you see any reason that this goal should have been disallowed ?
Because we sure as hell can’t , and neither can basically anyone else in the world ( including Coulibaly , who either could n’t or would n’t explain just why the goal was disallowed after the match ) .
FIFA is taking notice , thankfully , and will conduct an expedited performance review for Coulibaly , meaning he ’ll likely never referee another World Cup match .
But hey , he should n’t feel too bad , because he ’s not the first referee to make a controversial blunder .
Hell , it ’s not even the first time in the last month that an official has completely blown a big call .
It does n’t make him suck any less , though .
Here are some other famous boneheaded decisions by referees …
1 Thierry Henry is a Cheating Bastard
We ’ll start off with another blunder in the world of football , err soccer .
With Ireland desperately trying to qualify for the 2010 World Cup , the fightin ’ Micks had France on the ropes and looked to be in good position to qualify , particularly when French star Thierry Henry slapped down a ball near the goal , which would mean a penalty kick for Ireland and the victory .
Oh , wait , the ref never called the handball , and Ireland would wind up being eliminated from World Cup contention by Henry ’s play inside the box .
Since the match Henry has come out and admitted that not only did the ball strike his hand , but he intentionally swatted it down .
Meanwhile , the Irish are left at home during the World Cup drowning their sorrows in beer , rather than celebrating their team playing on the world ’s biggest stage with even more beer .
2 USA vs USSR in the 1972 Olympics
World basketball dominance by the United States is n’t something new that only began to occur after the Dream Team gained fame .
In fact , beginning in 1936 the US men ’s team won seven straight gold medals and had never lost a single game in the Olympics heading into the 1972 summer games .
And then this happened :
That ’s only the short version , of course , and the full game can be found in bits and pieces on YouTube .
Even so , you can see simply by watching this short clip that the game - winning basket by the Soviets never should have counted .
Why ?
Well go back and watch the guy inbounding the ball , who steps onto the court as he heaves the ball down the floor .
In case you were curious , that ’s not legal .
Even before that , the US led 50 - 49 with one second remaining .
However , the refs decided to halt the game and put three seconds on the clock , saying the Soviets had actually called a time out between two free throws by Doug Collins ( which is still disputed to this day ) .
The Soviets inbounded again and the horn sounded , with the US apparently winning .
That is , until the refs once again decided to put even MORE time on the clock and give the Soviets yet another opportunity , which leads us to the above clip .
This blunder was so controversial that no member of the 1972 US team has ever accepted their silver medals .
3 The Steelers Are n’t Thankful for Phil Luckett
In 1999 , families across America sat down to cram as much food down their gullets as they could while celebrating that time their ancestors stole the US from a bunch of Indians , and then they settled in for the NFL game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Detroit Lions .
This was back when the Lions did n’t totally suck , and the game went into overtime .
And that ’s when the US learned that referee Phil Luckett either hates the Steelers , loves the Lions , or is somewhat unfamiliar with the English language .
Pittsburgh ’s Jerome Bettis called tails , though for whatever reason Luckett heard heads .
The coin landed on tails , and the ball went to Detroit .
The Lions would then go on to earn one of the only wins in franchise history .
4 Colorado Needs Five Downs to Score
For those who are visiting the site from outside of the US , in the game of American football a team has four downs to either advance 10 yards or score .
But when Colorado met Missouri in 1990 , apparently the refs decided that the Buffalos needed a little more help than that to accomplish either , and gave them a 5th down .
Putting aside the fact that the CNN anchor in that clip looks kind of like the dude who makes those crazy sounds in Police Academy , Colorado would use its extra down to punch it into the endzone and pick up a 33 - 31 victory over Mizzou .
What happened was that the Buffs spiked the ball to stop the clock , but for whatever reason the refs either did n’t notice , did n’t care , or had money on Colorado to cover the spread , and decided that spiking the ball did n’t count as an actual down .
5 Maradona ’s “ Hand of God ”
And we ’ll come full circle by ending with another controversial play in the World Cup , this time going all the way back to 1986 when Argentina toppled England behind Diego Maradona ’s goal , sending the Brits home and advancing the Argentinians to the semifinals .
Maradona dubbed the goal the “ Hand of God , ” stating that the goal was scored “ partly by the hand of God and partly by the head of Maradona . ”
Or , you know , entirely by the hand of Maradona .
See , in soccer / football ( Soofball ? Foccer ? ) you ’re not allowed to use your hands .
If you were paying attention when we told you about Thierry Henry , you ’ll know that .
In reviewing the footage , it ’s pretty clear that Maradona goes up and punches the ball past the keeper and into the net , though the ref apparently never saw it .
The good news is that since Maradona is now the coach of Argentina at this year ’s World Cup , the hopes are high for unintentional comedy and controversy .
Oh Maradona , what wacky shenanigans will you get up to next ?
I ’ve always wanted to eat at a fine dining restaurant but it ’s too expensive for me .
Whenever I see people on TV eating at fine dining restaurants , they all seemed too satisfied and happy with the food they were served .
Not sure if I ’ll ever be willing to spend at least Php 2,000 ( about $ 44 ) for a single meal , with very liltle serving .
I ’d rather spend that much money on other things .
BUT , I still want to try out some fine dining food .
So , a few days ago , we had our very first Steak day .
For lunch , I decided to make Steak Diane , one of Chef Gordon Ramsay ’s main courses in Hell ’s Kitchen , just to experience a little taste of fine dining at home . 😀
I saw this recipe in one of the episodes from Hell ’s Kitchen and I was a bit excited about making it myself .
I , then , watched a video from Youtube where Chef Gordon made Steak Diane for his show The F Word .
He really made it look like it ’s so easy to cook .
That ’s what I like about him and his videos : simple to follow as long as you know how to cook .
Some of you who prefer following recipes with measurements , you might not enjoy his videos since he wo n’t show you any measurements for his ingredients .
But , if you already know the basics and you know how to estimate the seasonings to your liking , you will love the way he makes his cooking videos – short and fast .
Here ’s the video I was referring to 2 paragraphs ago : Chef Gordon Ramsay making Steak Diane :
So , here is the recipe :
Steak Diane
INGREDIENTS :
Steak :
Beef Tenderloin
Salt & Pepper
Olive Oil
Sauce :
Salt and Pepper
Onion / Shallots , chopped
Mushroom , sliced
Dijon Mustard
Brandy
Cream
Parsley , chopped
Worcestershire sauce
Side :
Potato , half - boiled , cut in half
Olive Oil
Salt & Pepper
Rosemary , chopped
PROCEDURE :
Place pan in medium heat and add olive oil .
Make sure that the tenderloin meat is at room temperature and pat it dry with a napkin or kitchen tissue .
I bought two ( 2 ) large cuts of beef tenderloin .
And I had to cut them to 2 more portions each for the other steak meal I was preparing for dinner on our Steak day .
So , here ’s the steak cuts I used for our Steak Diane .
The 2 large cuts of beef only costs me almost Php 300 at the grocery ( SM Hypermarket in SM Mall of Asia ) .
Imagine the savings !
If you had this at a fine dining restaurant , you might have paid for over Php 6,000 for 2 orders of Steak Diane !
Season it generously with salt and pepper .
When oil is hot enough , pan fry the steak .
After steak is cooked to your liking ( I prefer medium - rare .
Mhel likes it medium - well ) , set it aside without turning the heat off .
This is how our steaks looked before I set them aside .
I cooked Mhel ’s steak a li’l longer than mine til it was a li’l well - done .
In the same pan , add shallots or onions , sliced mushrooms , then , butter to the caramelized juice of the steak .
Add worcestershire sauce .
Then , add in Dijon mustard .
Season with salt and pepper .
Add brandy and flambé .
( You can skip the flambé part if you ’re not comfortable setting your pan in flames .
Hehehe . )
Once alcohol is burnt off , mix well and , then , add the cream and stir in the chopped parsley .
Place the steak in the pan with the sauce and let it cook for a few seconds .
Then , set it aside while you make the sauteed potatoes .
Prepare the sauteed potatoes .
Place pan in medium heat and add olive oil .
Add half - boiled potato in pan , with the cut side down .
Add garlic , salt and pepper .
Stir , then , add rosemary .
You can poke the potatoes to check if it ’s cooked perfectly for you .
Lastly , place your Steak Diane on a plate with the sauce and potatoes .
Steak Diane with sauteed potatoes …
DONE !
I love saying that !
Hahaha !
Got that from Gordon Ramsay himself .
Here are more photos of the steak taken while we were devouring it .
Hehehe .

I wept on Friday evening when I heard the news of the death of Coach John Wooden .
I had seen him the day before at UCLA looking frail and tired after 99 good years — as long and rewarding a life as one could hope .
Coach Wooden was ready for a good death , surrounded by family and friends , knowing that he would soon meet his beloved Nellie again , who had passed on some 25 years earlier .
But the tears in my eyes were not for Coach ; in losing him , we lost not just one of the great American men of the last century — one of our greatest teachers — but someone who transcended our differences and cared for everyone .
There are many dichotomies we are fond of dividing America into : black and white , rich and poor , native and immigrant , gay and straight , urban and rural , and however else you draw your lines .
Coach Wooden transcended many of those simple dichotomies , offering wisdom accessible to almost anyone .
He was born in Hall , Indiana , four years before the Great War , later moving to the “ big ” town of Martinsville , population 4,800 .
So Coach knew the rural life .
In 1948 he moved to Los Angeles where he would live for the rest of his life .
As a part of the great migration from the rural Midwest to the urban West , he could sympathize with both urban and rural concerns .
Basketball , of course , was common to both , played with equal fervor by farm boys in Indiana and gang bangers in South Central .
And not only did he survive in the wilds of Los Angeles , he thrived , voted by the Sporting News in 2009 as the greatest coach of all time .
As a young Muslim kid growing up in Toronto in the 1970s , I had very few Muslim role models .
One of them was Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , Coach Wooden ’s 7 - foot - 2 - inch center at UCLA .
In learning more about Kareem ( born Lew Alcindor ) , I came to appreciate the influence that Coach Wooden had had on him during the racially and politically charged period of the late 1960s .
I wrote to Coach Wooden as an undergraduate asking for a copy of his famous Pyramid of Success .
About a month later I received an autographed copy , along with a nice note .
That in turn led me to his textbook , Practical Modern Basketball , first published in 1966 , which helped me to work on my game .
I was the nerdy kid in high school , not becoming a jock until university .
There , I developed and flourished as an athlete .
To this day , one of the awards of which I am most proud was when I graduated from University College in 1987 as the best male athlete .
As I tell my students at LMU , I do n’t look like much now , being old and slow and fat , but I used to be somebody .
When I moved to the San Fernando Valley in 1997 to start teaching at Cal State Northridge , I sought out Coach Wooden .
That was another of the amazing things about him .
He was approachable , answering his own phone and mail , meeting with complete nobodies like me .
I thanked him for the basketball lessons that I had learned from him , but more importantly for the life lessons .
His beloved wife Nellie had passed away in 1985 after 53 years of marriage , and my wife had died suddenly in 1992 .
Coach gave me a powerful model for dealing with that loss , a reminder that those we loved were always in our lives .
On the 21st of each month ( Nellie had passed on March 21 ) , Coach would write a letter to Nellie , adding it to the neat pile on her side of the bed .
During my development as a teacher , I came to realize even more powerfully the skills that Coach Wooden had , and tried to incorporate his ideas into my pedagogy .
He was also a man of deep faith , though he did n’t wear his religion on his sleeve .
None of the fifteen blocks of the Pyramid of Success , for example , are about religion ; the mortar was patience and faith ( “ through prayer , ” as he wrote ) .
Family , faith , and friends were the three most important things to him .
He never imposed his Christian faith on anyone , only insisting that his players “ have a religion and believe in it . ”
Coach was a pluralist long before many of us had heard of the term .
Of his own faith , one of his favorite maxims was “ If I were ever prosecuted for my religion , I truly hope there would be enough evidence to convict me . ”
Many of us have grown tired of the hypocrisy of self - described “ Christian athletes ” who can glibly quote Bible verses but ca n’t manage to live by them .
Coach , as always , was different .
We both agreed that Abraham Lincoln was the greatest American , but he said that the greatest person of his generation was Mother Teresa .
Like her , he lived out his Christianity in service to others .
In 2005 , I moved from a secular religious studies department at Cal State Northridge to a department of theological studies at Loyola Marymount University .
One of the first theological pieces I wrote , on “ Theology and the Intellectual Life , ” I dedicated to Coach Wooden , who I thought was underappreciated for the theological reflection that was his life .
For a man who was the best there ever was at what he did , he still did n’t care about winning and losing .
A teacher at heart , he cared about his players not so much as athletes , but as students with promise and potential .
That ’s something that fits in perfectly with the Jesuit and Marymount traditions of LMU , what we call cura personalis , or the care of the whole person .
What we do as teachers is a sacred trust , and Coach Wooden did it better than any of us .
He did n’t like being called “ the Wizard of Westwood , ” and he would have hated to be called a saint , so let us call him what he was , simply and with great pride : a teacher .
And let us thank God for the life and teachings of John Wooden .
Obama weighs in on Helen Thomas controversy
updated Tuesday , 10:30 a.m .
Count the leader of the free world among those offended by veteran journalist Helen Thomas 's comments that Jews should " get the hell out " of Israel and go " home " to countries such as Poland and Germany .
In an interview with the " Today " show 's Matt Lauer , President Obama said the remarks " were out of line .
Obama said Thomas , 89 , " made the right decision " Monday when she announced through her employer , Hearst News Service , that she would retire .
Thomas had covered the White House for decades .
But toward the end of her career , she increasingly became known for diatribes against Israel and the U.S. military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" It 's a shame , because Helen was ... really an institution of Washington , " Obama said .

Veteran White House reporter Helen Thomas announced Monday that she is retiring , effective immediately , in the wake of a controversy over her comments on Israel , according to a report from her employer , Hearst News Service .
Thomas told a rabbi at a White House event last week that Jews should " get the hell out of Palestine " and go back to Germany and Poland .
" I deeply regret my comments I made last week regarding the Israelis and the Palestinians , " Thomas said in a statement on her Web site .
" They do not reflect my heart - felt belief that peace will come to the Middle East only when all parties recognize the need for mutual respect and tolerance .
May that day come soon . "
Thomas 's comments provoked sharp criticism within the close - knit world of White House reporters , and drew a rebuke from the White House podium Monday .
With her seat conspicuously empty at the daily briefing , White House press secretary Robert Gibbs assailed Thomas for her words .
" Those remarks were offensive and reprehensible , " Gibbs said , noting that Thomas has apologized .
Her sentiments " do not reflect certainly most of the people here and certainly not those of the administration . "
Thomas , 89 , who has covered the White House for decades , canceled a speech over the weekend and was dropped by a speakers ' bureau that represented her .
The controversy comes at a precarious moment in the Middle East , after an Israeli assault on an aid flotilla that left 11 dead and prompted an international outcry .
The Board of the White House Correspondents Association also issued a statement Monday calling her comment " indefensible . "
The full WHCA statement follows :
Helen Thomas ' comments were indefensible and the White House Correspondents Association board firmly dissociates itself from them .
Many in our profession who have known
Helen for years were saddened by the comments , which were especially unfortunate in light of her role as a trail blazer on the White House beat .
While Helen has not been a member of the WHCA for many years , her special status in the briefing room has helped solidify her as the dean of the White House press corps so we feel the need to speak out strongly on this matter .
We want to emphasize that the role of the WHCA is to represent the White House press corps in its dealings with the White House on coverage - related issues .
We do not police the speech of our members or colleagues .
We are not involved at all in issuing White House credentials , that is the purview of the White House itself .
But the incident does revive the issue of whether it is appropriate for an opinion columnist to have a front row seat in the WH briefing room .
That is an issue under the jurisdiction of this board .
We are actively seeking input from our association members on this important matter , and we have scheduled a special meeting of the WHCA board on Thursday to decide on the seating issue .

This post has been updated since it was first published .
[ On July 5 , 2010 , in the aftermath of the largest mass arrests in Canadian history at the Toronto G20 summit , about 250 rank - and - file labour activists sent an open letter to the President of the Canadian Labour Congress .
The union members critiqued Georgetti's public attacks against protesters paired with inaction on sweeping police brutality and repression , and called for a change of course toward solidarity with prisoners and enhanced cooperation with diverse community movements - the basic idea of social unionism .
The same day , Georgetti responded to the letter 's organizers , dismissing the union members statement as a " piece of fiction " .
The open letter and Georgetti's response are both reproduced below . ]

[ Rank - and - file union activists ' open letter to CLC President ]

Open Letter to Ken Georgetti and the Canadian Labour Congress :
We are labour activists , many of whom were involved in organizing against the G20 Summit in Toronto and solidarity actions across the country .
After the “ Peoples First ” march , many of us remained on the streets throughout the weekend contesting the unprecedented militarization of our city and the G20 neoliberal agenda .
We are disturbed and concerned to read the statement by Ken Georgetti , President of the Canadian Labour Congress , issued during the G20 summit .
The CLC issued a statement condemning ‘ vandalism ’ and declaring their commitment to working with the police throughout the summit ; however , the CLC ’s statement is shockingly silent about the violence perpetrated by the state and police , aimed at rendering the right of people to assemble , organize and resist obsolete , brutalizing our sisters , brothers and children .
Union members and our allies in the community were victims of the organized confusion that led to the massive violations of our basic civil liberties including house raids without warrants , indiscriminate searches , and the warehousing of activists , innocent bystanders and others for hours without charges in a dehumanizing detention centre .
Thousands of union members and others gathered on the streets and in the state and police - sanctioned “ free speech zone ” , otherwise known as Queen ’s Park .
As the mainstream media was glued to unattended burning police cars , protesters were being charged and trampled by police horses , subject to indiscriminate arrests , rubber bullets , tear gas and various forms of police brutality .
The focus on vandalism and attacks on private property espoused by the CLC statement and some mainstream media outlets , expels from the debate the legitimate concerns and lived injustices of many within the labour movement who turned out to protest the G8 / G20 .
By commission or omission this limited focus legitimizes the suspension of rights and liberties in this city , including the right to assembly and the right to political protest .
Thousands mobilized in front of police headquarters on June 28th in solidarity with the hundreds of activists still being detained and our unions and union flags were absent .
We believe union solidarity should have been present .
While we are encouraged to see the CLC 's recent decision to join the call for a public inquiry , we feel that the CLC and Ontario Federation of Labour ( OFL ) must support our allies , call for the release of all prisoners in the detention centres and jails , and resist the attack on our human rights in all its forms .
We as a labour movement must commit to organize social movements along with our allies in social justice , environmental justice , grass - roots , anti-poverty , anti-racist , feminist , non-status , Indigenous , Queer and international movements to challenge and resist neoliberal capitalist governments ’ ruthless assaults on the working people in Canada and globally .
We will not and cannot win the struggle we face against the violent onslaught of neoliberalism by abandoning our allies and our communities in the wake of a massive crackdown on dissent .

[ CLC President Ken Georgetti's response ]
From : Ken Georgetti < kgeorgetti@clc-ctc.ca >
Date : Mon , Jul 5 , 2010 at 7:52 PM
Subject : Re : Open Letter regarding the G20
To : CLC G20 Open Letter < clcopenletterg20@gmail.com >
I presume that you , whoever you are , are the author of this piece of fiction that some activists , retirees , and other parties have signed .
As a courtesy to those who signed on to your misleading and slanted " open letter " I will set the record straight for them .
I would hope you would have the courtesy to share it with them .
First , I report to a board made up of unions affiliated to the Canadian Labour Congress .
You should note that none of them signed your letter .
Second , if any members of a CLC - affilated union feel " disturbed and concerned " with statements that I or the Congress make , they should take up their concerns with the heads of their respective unions .
Third , let 's get the facts and chronology corrected .
Weeks before the G8 and G20 happened , the Canadian Labour Congress was making public statements , speaking at Union and public forums , and appearing in the media about the unprecedented police presence and the chilling effect it would have on the public 's right to express themselves at these events .
We went further and joined with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and went to court where we challenged the police use of sonic cannons at the G20 .
We were successful in having their use limited .
We expended the lion 's share of staff and financial resources for the huge civil , peaceful protest on Saturday involving an estimated crowd of 40,000 people .
Most all of them were there to demand the world 's leaders focus on the issues of jobs , maternal health , peace , the environment , the list goes on .
Unfortunately , all of that attention was stolen by a small group of thugs who instead wanted to destroy street cars and public property and vandalise and steal from small store owners on Queen and Young Streets .
We issued our statement , you refer to , at 5:00 PM that day .
The CLC does not and will not condone that kind of behaviour or tactics perpetrated by a few and must disassociate itself from it when it appears to be part of our action .
People and groups who loot and steal and vandalise are not those whom we want as allies .
Many other labour organizations and national unions issued similar statements , and I note you did not send your open letter to them .
For the record , as soon as the Civil Liberties Association was satisfied that a public inquiry was necessary , they informed us and we were the first labour organization to publically support the call .
I find your letter slanted and predicated on misleading and incorrect information , and I hope my correction of the facts gives you and the signatories some comfort to know that the CLC is always in the lead on the important issues .
With Cincinnati Pride fast approaching , local media coverage has been really heating up with anyone and everyone throwing in their two cents .
Citizens for Community Values came out against the annual festival .
Pride planners have been relentlessly defending it .
The Cincinnati Enquirer even asked me to weigh in .
Check out the stories :
The Cincinnati Enquirer : Letter : Gay pride parade shirt - shrifts Northside
The Cincinnati Enquirer : Equinox Cincinnati gay pride parade ’s move Downtown draws positive reviews
The Cincinnati Enquirer : Moving gay pride events draws praise , criticism
City Beat : Pride timing irks CCV
WCPO : Cincinnati gay pride moves from Northside to Downtown
WKRC : Controversial time and place for annual gay pride parade
WLWT : Gay pride parade causing fireworks
And , as always , the comments sections of these stories have become an open forum for bashing queers .
For people who have an IQ of over 150 , questions like this cause them so much physical pain that it literally takes years off of their life .
Clearly some idiot kept pestering him with inane questions and he died .
Awfully sad .
WHEN we talk about bubbles , we tend to think of recent history but in fact this is an age - old phenomenon .
( Note to patient readers ; this is a long post because it is a condensed version of my BCA speech . )
Asset bubbles and rising debt levels go together .
And it is not just government debt we have to worry about .
US private sector debt has increased as a proportion of GDP from around 60 % in the early 1950s to almost 300 % at its peak .
Some increase in debt may have been inevitable as societies became more sophisticated .
Many would say a certain degree of debt is beneficial since it allows individuals and companies to smooth their consumption over the cycle .
Others would say it does n't matter .
In aggregate , the world owes the money to itself ; debt is just an accounting issue .
A family is no poorer if a wife lends money to her husband , or vice versa .
Another rationale is that asset prices have also been rising so that one needs to look at both sides of the balance sheet ; it is net , not gross , debt that matters .
But that is wrong .
Gross debt levels matter because , as is well known , the value of debt is fixed in nominal terms while the value of assets can fluctuate .
High gross debt levels thus create a number of flash points when creditors start to doubt the value of their collateral , and when the debts have to be rolled over .
These crisis points are now rippling through the system ; first US homeowners , then investors in structured products , then banks , and now sovereigns .
It is no coincidence that this massive debt explosion has coincided with the end of the Bretton Woods system of the early 1970s .
This destroyed the final link to gold and crucially , removed the balance of payments constraint from the concerns of economic policymakers , at least in the developed world .
The author Richard Duncan compiled this chart
from IMF data showing the growth in foreign exchange reserves since the end of Bretton Woods .
From modest origins , they climbed above $ 1 trillion in the early 1970s before accelerating to almost $ 7 trillion in recent years .
It is his contention that these reserves allowed surplus countries to expand their money supplies , while the deficit countries were not forced to cut back .
It was true that , in the main , developed countries found that they could run deficits without being punished by the markets .
Indeed , eventually , they found that they could depreciate their exchange rates without being penalised by their creditors in the form of higher yields .
This was an easy option in the short - term .
But it was a bit like the 25 - year old who boasts that smoking , drinking and overeating has n't harmed him ; the bad habits will catch up with him eventually .
Floating exchange rates gave countries an escape valve after the 1970s .
And that was very important because attitudes were changing in another area of government policy .
As one contemplates today 's massive fiscal deficits , it seems incredible to remember that Keynesianism was virtually discredited in the mid-1970s .
A Labour prime minister , Jim Callaghan , said
" We used to think that you could spend your way out of recession and increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting government spending .
I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists and that in so far as it ever did exist , it only worked on each occasion since the war by injecting a bigger dose of inflation into the economy , followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step . "
He was describing what used to be known as the stop - go cycle , in which governments entered office eager to expand the economy ( think of the Barber boom in the early 1970s ) only to slam on the brakes as inflation rose .
One could describe it as the Keynesian ratchet in which each turn seemed to bring higher inflation .
After a chaotic 1970s , the world came up with a new system , based on the use of monetary policy .
Inflation would be tamed by an independent central bank , and monetary policy would be used to limit the excesses of the cycle .
The system appeared to work brilliantly .
It delivered the great moderation , two decades of steady growth with generally declining inflation and very mild recessions .
There was an enormous boom in the financial markets , as lower inflation allowed nominal yields on bonds and equities ( and thus capital values ) to rise substantially .
And so we turn to Hyman Minsky who argued that these periods of moderation lead eventually to speculation and crisis .
Rising asset prices encourage people to borrow money and buy assets , most obviously in the housing market .
Initially , people take out loans where they can meet both interest and capital repayments ; then they take out loans where they can only meet the interest ; in the final Ponzi stage ( for which read subprime ) they cannot even meet the interest payments but need rising prices to service the debt ( essentially by flipping the asset ) .
It is my contention that we switched from a Keynesian ratchet to a monetary ratchet .
Lower rates encouraged more borrowing and higher asset prices ; when those prices faltered , central banks worried about a repeat of the debt deflation of the 1930s so they slashed rates to help markets recover .
This became known as the Greenspan put after 1987 , the first time it was clearly used but it was used many times , arguably most egregiously in 1998 after the collapse of LTCM .
The end game of this process seems clear in retrospect , even though it may not have been at the time .
Valuations were driven to historically unprecedented levels , first in shares in 2000 and then in housing
in 2006 .
And interest rates have reached the event horizon of zero .
Let us think about that for a moment .
The Bank of England was set up in 1694 .
For the next 300 years which included world wars , the Great Depression , a century or so of alternating deflation and inflation between 1815 and 1914 , and the bank never previously felt the need to reduce rates below 2 % .
And this is combined with a fiscal deficit which , relative to GDP , is unknown outside world wars ; one in four of the pounds spent by the British government is borrowed from the markets .
Even with all that , the Bank of England has been obliged to add QE on top .
If zero rates and huge deficits were the answer to mankind 's problems , we would have discovered this long ago .
After all , governments would be delighted to borrow as much as they can for as little as possible .
What the authorities are clearly trying to do is to wind up one more round of the ratchet .
If asset prices are higher , balance sheets will look healthy ; if interest rates are low , borrowers can service their debts .
Indeed , the Bank of England does n't think British house prices are too high , even though they are well above historical averages relative to incomes ; they are rational when compared to real interest rates .
But who has been setting real interest rates ?
The bank , of course , at both the short ( and via QE ) at the long end .
This may be an early sign that central banks are falling into their old habits .
Bubbles are very hard intellectually to deal with .
Those who ride the bubble look smart ; those who try to buck it , like the late Tony Dye , get fired .
The bubble will often accompany a growing economy , rising corporate profits and rising tax revenues ; governments , regulators and central banks tend to feel that all is well , and that the wisdom of their policies is being amply demonstrated .
But it is surely very hard to argue now that the right thing for central banks to do about bubbles is to ignore them , on the grounds that it is easy to clean up after they burst .
The cost of the financial sector crisis has been enormous ; never mind the actual bail - out , think of the lost tax revenues .
Surely it is clear that the monetary expansion of the last 30 years led to asset price , not consumer price , inflation perhaps because the rise of China and south - east Asia represented a massive deflationary shock for the manufactured goods sector .
The fundamental contradiction at the heart of the recovery is that the markets are dependent on the governments for support , but many governments are also dependent on the markets .
The European debt crisis has shown there is a limit to the extent that markets will be willing to finance government deficits , and also a limit to the extent that politicians want to be dependent on markets .
European countries , with Germany in the intellectual lead , are now acting to withdraw the stimulus .
Eventually , one would expect the US to be forced , by political rather than financial pressures , to follow suit .
Given that economies may have to slam on the fiscal brakes , and that interest rates are already near zero , central banks may be forced into other means of boosting the economy , in particular quantitative easing or QE .
I confess to being rather cynical about QE .
We know of occasions in history when it did n't work ( Japan ) and we know when it resulted in hyperinflation ( the Weimar republic ) .
We do n't know of any occasions when it definitely did work .
And we know it is a tactic that is ancient .
The Emperor Nero was short of a few denarii to pay his soldiers so he created some more by debasing the currency .
In effect he financed his deficit by printing money , just as the Bank of England has bought £ 200 billion of gilts from a country with a £ 157 billion deficit .
Of course , Nero did n't have any economists to give his actions a sophisticated spin .
But were his actions really that different ?
I am not arguing that we are heading for hyperinflationary hell .
But I think we have in the course of this long debt boom started to confuse claims on wealth with wealth itself .
And I think that has been a further negative effect of the bubble mentality .
Indeed , just to provoke you , how about thinking of the last 40 years as one long bubble , in which fiat money has led to asset price inflation .
Before you dismiss the idea , think about this ; with gold at $ 1250 an ounce , the dollar has lost 97 % of its purchasing power
in terms of what used to be though of as " real money " since 1971 .
The Romans took 200 years to achieve the same effect , cutting the amount of silver in their copins by 96 % .
Progress !
Go back to the early 18th century and there was another experiment with fiat money conducted by John Law on behalf of the French regent .
Law was hired to improve the regent 's finances and believed that a shortage of currency was holding back French growth .
His clever scheme combined QE , subprime lending and an emerging markets fund .
A new bank was formed , Banque Generale , and the regent decreed that taxes could be paid in notes issued by the bank , effectively making them legal tended .
Meanwhile , the Compagnie l'Occident was created to exploit the trading opportunities in the Mississippi basin , the emerging market of its day .
Banque Generale lent investors the money to buy shares in this great opportunity and the money raised from the issue was used to repay the monarchy 's debts .
In short , money was created via a roundabout fashion to buy government bonds ; an exact description of QE .
Investors bought shares because of the promise of a high dividend .
But the Mississippi delta was a swamp with no prospect of generating any actual earnings .
So the key was to keep pushing up prices ; this was achieved by the offer of new shares which investors could buy with only a small deposit .
The scheme faltered when some chose to take profits .
So Law resorted to guaranteeing to buy the shares at a set price ( think of the TARP ) involving the creation of more money .
When people doubted the value of the bank notes , the company bought the bank ( think Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ) to keep the system going .
Eventually the whole thing collapsed some four years after it started .
Now I am not trying to suggest that , in the last forty years , the global economy has not become a lot wealthier .
Clearly one can point to three great changes in productivity ; the entry of the communist world into the capitalist system ; the use of technology to spread information and reduce frictional costs ; and the entry of women into the developed world workforce .
But I think it is possible to argue that the development of the bubble mentality has distorted monetary policy , led to the rise of an overpowerful rent - seeking financial sector , and in the Anglo - Saxon economies , led to the excessive focus of investment in housing .
Some of this wealth may prove illusory and just like John Law , attempts to prop up asset prices that have lost relationship with the wealth of the underlying economy , may end up being a failure .

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - A 16 - year - old California girl trying to sail solo around the world is safe and well after a massive search and rescue was launched in the Indian Ocean when she triggered distress signals , her parents and Australian authorities said Friday .
A map of the search area for 16 - year - old Abby Sunderland released June 11 , 2010 .
A 16 - year - old Californian girl attempting to sail solo around the world is safe and well , her parents said , after a massive search and rescue was launched in the Indian Ocean after she triggered distress signals .
Teenage adventurer Abby Sunderland was last heard from about 6 a.m. Pacific time ( 1300 GMT ) on Thursday , when she broke off a satellite phone call as her yacht Wild Eyes was pounded by huge waves in the remote southern Indian Ocean .
REUTERS / Australian Maritime Safety Authority / Handout
Her parents had lost contact with teenage adventurer Abby Sunderland Thursday as her yacht Wild Eyes was pounded by huge waves in the remote southern Indian Ocean , but an Australian plane flew over her Friday and made contact with the girl , Australian authorities said .
A French fishing vessel was on the way to rescue the young American , who began her trip in January , her parents said .
“ The aircraft spoke to her , they told her that help was on the way , and she sounds like she is in good health , ” said Mick Kinley of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in Canberra .
“ She is going to hang in there until the vessel can get to her in about 24 hours , ” Kinley told a news conference .
The search for Sunderland involved Australia , U.S. and French rescue authorities sending ships and a commercial airliner to an area about 2,000 miles southeast of Madagascar and 2,000 miles southwest of Australia .
“ The boat is upright but the rigging is all down , which means she was probably rolled by a rogue wave .
But she reported that she was fine .
She seems to be in good spirits , but that is all we really know for sure , ” Marianne Sunderland , the girl ’s mother , told U.S. cable television network CNN .
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said conditions in the area were poor , with 56 mph winds and an 18 foot ( six meter ) swell .
“ It ’s a huge relief , obviously .
There is a great deal of jubilation and elation that Abigail is safe , ” Laurence Sunderland , her father , told CNN .
‘ WE’RE CONFIDENT ’
“ The severe weather conditions that she was experiencing the day before this all happened have abated .
We ’re confident that when the fishing vessel arrives alongside that she ’ll have about 10 to 15 knots of wind and there will be a successful rescue , ” Laurence Sunderland added .
Sunderland had hoped to become the youngest sailor to circumnavigate the globe alone nonstop but had to give up her chance at that record when she was forced to pull into a port at Cape Town , South Africa , for repairs to her boat .
" Wild Eyes is upright but her rigging is down .
The weather conditions are abating .
Radio communication was made and Abby reports that she is fine ! " her parents posted on her blog ( soloround.blogspot.com / ) .
The Australian aircraft flew over Sunderland Friday , reporting the yacht had been dismast and the keel apparently had been detached .
Laurence Sunderland said his daughter had all of the safety equipment she needed , including a cold water survival suit , life raft and bag with emergency supplies .
Her parents have been criticized by some in the media for allowing her to undertake the solo voyage at age 16 .
Sailing experts have said that she was ill - advised to leave California in January because she risked arriving in the Indian Ocean at the start of the winter season .
The area is one of toughest parts of the world to launch rescue operations .
British solo sailor Tony Bullimore had to be rescued by an Australian navy frigate in 1996 after his yacht capsized during a race in which another competitor died .
Veteran Australian sailor Ian Kiernan , who held the Australian record for solo circumnavigation of the world , said Sunderland ’s trip was badly planned , given the mountainous seas and huge wind strengths of winter in the area .
“ I do n’t know what she ’s doing in the Southern Ocean as a 16 - year - old in the middle of winter .
It ’s foolhardy , ” Kiernan said .
Marianne Sunderland told CNN her daughter loves sailing , but added , “ I do n’t think she ’ll attempt something of this magnitude again . ”
Between smoking banana peels , suffocating each other and eating nutmeg , it seems like teenagers will do nearly anything to get the high associated with illegal drug use .
But if educators at Mustang High School in Mustang , Oklahoma are to be believed , an even more unlikely pseudo - drug has found its way into common use : psychedelic music and tones that can be downloaded through the Internet .
But drug experts are highly skeptical that such " digital drugs , " or " i- doses " as some are calling it , are actually harmful or addictive .
Teenagers at the high school claim that listening to these monotonous , layered sounds in a dark room can cause the same effects as ingesting illegal drugs like marijuana or LSD .
The problem has reached the point where Mustang High School recently sent a letter to parents warning them about this growing trend .
However , the parents should n’t worry , as the music almost certainly does not cause a high , or encourage future drug use , said Harriet de Wit , the principle investigator of the University of Chicago ’s human behavioral pharmacology lab .
Although experiments show that the expectation of getting high can enhance the symptoms associated with drugs , even when someone takes a placebo instead , no sound or music could trigger the exact pathways activated by specific drugs like PCP or Quaaludes , de Wit said .

Similarly , even if the teenagers did experience some form of placebo effect , it would n’t be strong enough to cause addiction or the decision making and coordination impairments that results from taking drugs like ketamine and peyote , de Wit said .
“ It ’s unlikely to cause any problems , ” de Wit said .
The Placebo effect " is a very moderate effect , and the problems you see with drugs are associated with high dosages . ”
As the pace of new Mel Gibson rant tapes has slowed down , news emerged on Wednesday that the investigation into allegations of domestic abuse by the troubled actor 's ex-girlfriend , Oksana Grigorieva , has been expanded to include a probe into whether the aspiring singer attempted to extort money from the " Lethal Weapon " star .
According to the target = " _blank " >
Los Angeles Times , a Los Angeles County sheriff 's spokesperson said that investigators are " looking into " claims of an extortion attempt related to the series of taped arguments between Gibson , 54 , and Grigorieva , 40 , that have been leaked on RadarOnline over the past few weeks .
Sheriff 's detectives are in the midst of an investigation into whether Gibson struck Grigorieva while she was holding the couple 's infant daughter during an argument in January .
Unnamed sources close to the investigation said detectives met with Gibson 's lawyers — who have denied the allegations of physical abuse — in the domestic violence inquiry on Tuesday .
The detectives also recently obtained copies of the explosive audio tapes during a closed - door hearing in the couple 's child custody case .
Though Gibson 's camp has not made any statement on the tapes , his representatives have not denied that the voice heard hurling racist and sexist slurs and threatening violence on the recordings is that of the Oscar - winning star .
The Times noted that it 's questionable whether the tapes — including one section in which Gibson tells Grigorieva that she " deserved " to be hit — would even be admissible if a domestic violence case went to criminal court because it appears that they were recorded without Gibson 's knowledge .
California law requires that both parties must consent to having a conversation recorded ; the paper said that under normal circumstances , not having the consent of one of the participants would make the tapes inadmissible in court and possibly open the taper to criminal charges .
The tapes would not be considered illegal if the person recording them did so because he or she thought the conversations related to the commission of a felony involving violence .

Organizers of a " forbidden art " exhibition in Moscow have been convicted of fueling national and religious hatred for displaying such works of art as Jesus Christ with the head of Mickey Mouse .
Yury Samodurov , former head of the Sakharov Museum that staged the show , and Andrei Yerofeyev , a former curator at the Tretyakov gallery , were convicted of " committing acts aimed at inciting national hatred and strife , " according to RIA Novosti .
The two men , who staged the exhibit in 2006 to fight censorship of art in Russia , could have been jailed for up to five years .
They were fined around $ 11,000 .
Last week , 13 prominent Russian artists called on President Dimitry Medvedev to stop the trial , saying a guilty verdict would be a sentence " for the whole of Russian contemporary art . "
Last month , in a letter to the church , Yerofeyev apologized if the show unintentionally offended Christians , the BBC reports .
Oleg Kassin , a representative of Council of the People , which filed the complaint with the court , told the AFP news agency that he had been disgusted by the exhibition which contained " anti-Christian " images .
" If you like expressing yourself freely , do it at home , invite some close friends , " he said .
But when it's on public display " especially if it contains insults , it 's no longer art but a provocation . "

" Dr. No , " as some call him on Capitol Hill , does n't agree with Obama 's decision to remove Gen. Stanley McChrystal from command of U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
Ron Paul bucks wisdom on McChrystal
Ron Paul thinks President Obama got it wrong yesterday when he got rid of Stanley McChrystal .
Of course , Paul , who 's earned the nickname " Dr. No " in Congress , is used to being an outlier on congressional issues .

" They should have changed the policy and kept the general .
Maybe that would have been better , " Paul said on Thursday .
" But it 's the policymakers that are at fault , not the generals , they tried to follow the orders but the policy behind it is at fault . "
Paul , a fierce critic of the war in Afghanistan , said that the inflammatory comments made by members of McChrystal 's staff in Rolling Stone were evidence of frustration over what he says is the war 's failed policy .
" That McChrystal thing is just a symptom of what we wo n't face up to , which is that it 's a totally failed policy , " Paul said .
" If we were on the verge of a great success , do you think we 'd fire the general ?
So it was an absolute confirmation of the failed policy , and yet the policy does n't change . "
Republican members have mostly been supportive of Obama 's decision to replace McChrystal but keep the same counterinsurgency policy , which was largely based on McChrystal 's recommendations .
The Western rating agencies put a high value on a long - established rule of law and government institutions that have proved resilient over many decades , or even centuries .

Who has n’t heard of a tyrannosaurus Rex or a velociraptor thanks to movies like Jurassic Park ?
When we think of dinosaurs , we almost all think of a very small subset of these giant creatures from history .
But perhaps more interesting are those which are far less familiar to us all .
This list is just a small selection of monstrous or weird - looking creatures from ancient times , most of which are little known to the public .
15 Estemmenosuchus
They do n’t make animals like this anymore .
Estemmenosuchus is one of the most bizarre - looking prehistoric monsters ; it belonged to the group of the dinocephalians , and despite their dinosaur - like appearance , they were actually more closely related to mammals … including us !
Estemmenosuchus was the size of a rhinoceros , and it too had a horn on its nose , but it also had antler - like horns on the top of its head , and strange , bony protrusions coming out of its cheeks ; no one knows what they were used for .
It also had a set of monstrous , sharp teeth , but scientists are n’t sure about its food preferences .
Personally , I believe this thing was big and scary enough to eat anything it wanted .
Fossil remains of Estemmenosuchus have been found in Russia ; it lived in the Permian period , long before the appearance of dinosaurs .
14 Acrophyseter
This was an ancient relative of today ’s sperm whale , which as we all know ( or should know ) is huge , eats lots of squid and has never been known to attack humans without provocation .
Acrophyseter was the complete opposite ; it was moderately sized , and did n’t feed on squid but rather on other marine mammals and even on sharks !
Its horrible - looking teeth were deadly weapons and have given Acrophyseter and its ancient relatives the nickname of “ killer sperm whales ” .
Acrophyseter ’s fossil remains have been found in Peru ; it lived in the Miocene period , which seems to have been the best epoch for scary marine monsters including giant dolphins , colossal sharks and even monster penguins and seals .
13 Gigantopithecus
It ’s name says it all ; it was a monstrous ape , closely related to the orangutan , that roamed the bamboo forests , jungles and mountains of China , India and Vietnam during the Pleistocene .
It was a vegetarian , but scary nonetheless ; it could grow up to three meters tall and weigh up to 550 kgs !
Its strength must have been extraordinary and probably kept it safe from most predators .
It finally went extinct 300.000 years ago , possibly due to overhunting by early human species or as the result of climate change .
Of course , all yeti and bigfoot believers like to think that Gigantopithecus survived somehow in the most remote parts of the Himalaya …
12 Epicyon
Epicyon could well be described as a giant pitbull on steroids .
It was a member of the Canidae or dog family , but whereas modern day canids are built for speed and endurance , Epicyon was built for brute strength , and had jaws so powerful that they could crush bone as if they were crackers !
This beast ruled the plains of North America for fifteen million years , before it was replaced by big cats ( including sabertooths ) .
11 Edestus
Today ’s great white shark probably has some of the most nightmarish set of teeth in Nature , but its distant prehistoric relative Edestus was so scary that it would make the great white look almost cute .
Edestus was about seven meters long and was one of the top predators of the Carboniferous seas .
However , scientists still do n’t know how it used its extraordinary teeth ; instead of constantly losing the worn out teeth and replacing them with the new ones growing in rows behind , as modern day sharks do , Edestus did n’t lose its teeth at all ; instead , the new teeth pushed the old teeth out of the mouth and , eventually , the gums and teeth would protrude out of the mouth like a pair of monstrous scissors .
Regardless of how it did it , it seems obvious that Edestus could possibly cut any other creature in two with ease .
But we still have trouble to imagine how a very old Edestus would “ function ” , or even how would it look !
10 Gorgonopsid
This creature has earned some popularity recently thanks to the British sci fi show “ Primeval ” , where it was the very first monster to appear .
Although real life gorgonopsids where a tad smaller than the TV version ( the largest species , such as Inostrancevia and Leontocephalus , could grow up to six meters long ) , they were just as terrifying ; as a matter of fact , they were the dominant predators during the late Permian , before dinosaurs and their relatives took over .
Gorgonopsids had a set of deadly saber - teeth ( some species had two sets of them ) which came handy when hunting some of the largest Permian herbivores , often the size of rhinos or bigger .
They were quite agile and could probably run quite fast , unlike the predators that came before them .
Despite their reptilian appearance , gorgonopsids were actually closely related to mammals , and it is even possible that they were covered in fur !
9 Terror bird
Terror birds , formally known as Phorusrhacids , were the top predators in South America and parts of North America during the Miocene , Pliocene and Early Pleistocene periods , before they were replaced by big cats and other carnivorous mammals .
They were unable to fly , but could run very fast ( as fast as a cheetah , according to some scientists ! ) and were very large ; the largest species could grow up to three meters tall and weigh up to half a ton .
Their main weapon was their head , which could be up to one meter long , allowing them to swallow prey as large as a dog in one single gulp !
However , thanks to the hooked tip of the bill , similar to that of eagles and hawks , the terrors birds could kill and devour prey much larger than a dog , including horses , camels , etc .
8 Madtsoia
Madtsoia would be the worst nightmare of anyone with a phobia of snakes .
Although only fragmentary remains are known , it is claimed to have reached the immense length of 15 - 20 meters !
This creature appeared in the Cretaceous period and possibly dined on dinosaurs .
It was similar to today ’s boas and pythons in that it was not venomous , but rather squeezed its victims to death using its immense muscular strength .
Madtsoia was such a successful predator , that it managed to survive the extinction that wiped out dinosaurs and other animals , but it finally went extinct about 45 million years ago .
Other giant snakes are known to have existed , including one that was said to reach 29 meters in length !
7 Purussaurus
Purussaurus was a gigantic caiman ( a relative to alligators ) that lived in what is today known as the Amazonian rainforest .
Back in Purussaurus ’ days , 8 million years ago , that region was actually a vast inland sea teaming with crocodiles , gharials , fresh water whales , giant rodents and enormous turtles .
Purussaurus was the top predator in that sea , and with good reason ; at 12 - 15 meters long , maybe more , it was one of the largest crocodilians ever to have existed .
The remains of other animals missing limbs or bitten in half are a macabre proof of this giant caiman ’s appetite .
6 Entelodon
Although pigs , wild boars and warthogs today are known to eat meat on occasion , they are basically vegetarian .
On the other hand , the Entelodon , a prehistoric pig relative , was a full time carnivore and possibly one of the most monstrous - looking mammals ever .
Standing on all fours , this beast was as tall as a man , and had an immense head armed with powerful jaws and sharp teeth .
Scientists believe that it was able to hunt live prey , but that it also scared other predators away from their kills ( which should have been very easy ) .
Its bite marks also suggest that it fought viciously with its own kind , and it is even possible that Entelodonts were cannibalistic .
Entelodons were quite successful beasts , existing for about 9 million years .
5 Azhdarchid
Azhdarchids were a kind of pterosaur ( most popularly known as pterodactyls ) which included the largest flying creatures ever to have existed .
Some of them had wingspans of 12 to 15 meters , making them as large as a small plane ( although they were obviously not as heavy ) .
But what makes Azhdarchids really strange are their body proportions ; they had ridiculously long legs , necks and beaks , and very small bodies , as well as relatively short wings .
Scientists believe that they did not hunt on the wing , but rather walked on the ground hunting for any animal they could catch and swallow whole - that included dog- sized , perhaps even man-sized creatures !
Standing on all fours , the largest Azhdarchids were as tall as a modern day giraffe … and almost as tall as a T - Rex .
4 Pulmonoscorpius
This is by far the smallest creature of the list , but it would still cause hysteria , and perhaps even some heart attacks , if it showed up today .
It was very similar to today ’s scorpions but could grow up to one meter long , perhaps more , and was armed with sharp chelae ( claws ) and a venomous stinger .
Of course , we do n’t know how toxic its venom was , but considering the considerable amount it injected with each attack , it was most likely a very deadly critter indeed .
A predator , Pulmonoscorpius roamed the swampy forests of the Carboniferous in what is today Scotland .
Just so you know , during the Carboniferous there were also giant roaches the size of house cats , dragonflies the size of hawks , and centipede - relatives up to three meters long .
No kidding .
3 Xenosmilus
Since the formidable Smilodon ( better known as saber - toothed tiger ) is too well known , we have decided to go for a refreshing change .
Enter Xenosmilus , possibly the nastiest feline ever to have existed .
The remains of this very large cat ( the size of a lion or tiger , but more robust ) were recently found in Florida along with the remains of many unlucky giant peccaries ( similar to wild pigs ) that fell prey to it .
Instead of strangling prey or breaking their neck as lions do , or stabbing them as the sabertoothed tiger did , Xenosmilus acted more like a shark or a carnivorous dinosaur , biting off a huge chunk of flesh and causing massive blood loss and shock in a matter of seconds .
Compared to modern day felids , a Xenosmilus ’ kill would probably be extremely bloody ; so much in fact that it would probably not be shown in Animal Planet !
Since we do n’t know when exactly Xenosmilus became extinct , we ca n’t tell if humans ever met this cat , or fell prey to it .
2 Megalodon
This is a fairly well known prehistoric monster , but it is just so big and scary that it deserves to be in this list .
Megalodon ( technically called a Carcharocles megalodon ) was a gigantic shark , closely related to today ’s makos and great whites .
It could grow up to 20 meters long and weigh up to 60 tons , being almost six times larger than Tyrannosaurus rex !
Obviously , the only thing in the sea big enough to feed Megalodon where whales , and indeed , the giant shark ’s bite marks have been found in the fossil remains of whales all around the world .
Although many people like to imagine encounters between Megalodon and T - Rex , or dinosaur - like marine reptiles , the truth is Megalodon appeared long after the extinction of such creatures , and it was n’t seen alive by any humans either , although it was still roaming the oceans when our australopithecine relatives took their first steps out of the jungle .
1 Spinosaurus
When Jurassic Park III was released in 2001 , many people complained that the beloved lawyer - eating T - Rex had been replaced with a “ made up ” dinosaur .
In reality , Spinosaurus did exist … and it was indeed bigger than T - Rex .
The remains of this enormous predator where found in Egypt in 1915 , and the paleontologist who studied them was already convinced that it was bigger than T - Rex .
However , this could n’t be proved as the fossils were sadly destroyed in a bombing during WWII .
Recently , however , new fossils have been found , and Spinosaurus was finally declared to be the largest carnivorous dinosaur of all times .
This beastie could grow up to 17 or 18 meters long , weigh up to 10 tons and had a sail on its back taller than an adult man .
Its long , crocodile - like snout suggests that it spend a long time in the water and possibly ate lots of fish … but also crocodiles , giant turtles , and any dinosaur unlucky enough to cross its path .
Even though T - Rex will probably always be the most popular prehistoric monster of all times , Spinosaurus is , and remains , the largest predator ever to walk the Earth … that we know of .

At this year 's Computex event , some of the most unexpected exhibits were socket LGA1155 motherboards based on Intel 6 - series chipsets , across the board , from virtually every major motherboard vendor .
Unexpected , because it 's been less than an year since released mainstream derivatives of the Nehalem / Westmere architectures that use the LGA1156 socket .
LGA1155 will form the base for performance , mainstream , and value segments of processors based on the upcoming Sandy Bridge architecture , which is a generation successor of Nehalem .
With so many motherboard vendors showing off their creations in release - grade conditions , it is obvious that engineering samples of processors to go with them are already on the loose and will land in some enthusiast 's hands .
It did , in the skillful hands of Coolaler , who wasted no time in putting it through a quick run through popular benchmarks .
Coolaler tested an LGA1155 quad - core processor operating at 2.5 GHz , which CPU - Z can't name but marks it as a Sandy Bridge engineering sample .
Among the little that 's known about this processor , is that it has a base clock speed of 100 MHz ( Nehalem / Westmere processors use BClk of 133 MHz ) , which means that to achieve 2.5 GHz , it uses a multiplier value of 25 .
It has all the instruction sets of Westmere including SSE 4.2 and AES acceleration , but also features AVX ( Advanced Vector Extensions ) , a successor to SSE 4.2 which expands the processor 's number crunching abilities , and increases performance per MHz .
The cache structure up to the second level is the same ( 32 KB L1I , 32 KB L1D , 256 KB / core L2 ) , but uses a smaller L3 cache at 6 MB ( compared to 8 MB on Lynnfield ) .
HyperThreading technology provides the OS with 8 logical CPUs to deal with .
The setup was aided with 4 GB of DDR3 memory and ATI Radeon HD 5800 series graphics .
The processor crunched Super Pi 1 M in 16.349 s , it scored 371 points in CPU Mark .
In the multi- threaded Cinebench R11.5 benchmark , the 2.5 GHz chip scored a little under Core i7 860 ( reference score ) .
In the Everest CPU Queen , it 's about as fast a Core i5 750 from what we could say , but in the Photoworxx test , it outperformed the Core i7 965 XE .
In a separate set of tests run on the same hardware albeit in Windows XP , the processor was eight times faster than any other processor in the AES test ( because of its native AES extensions ) , and edged the Core i7 965 XE in memory bandwidth despite having a narrower dual - channel DDR3 IMC .
While the results do n't show a revolutionary processor , it is intended to be one .
Right now it 's eligible for the benefit of doubt .
The real benefits will be for those models which come with embedded graphics , since the IGP and memory controller will be present on the same die , instead of the present design where the package is an MCM for two dies : CPU and northbridge .
When Sandy Bridge releases is a subject of immense speculation .
Since motherboard makers unveiled such mature designs of LGA1155 motherboards as early as in June 2010 , a market release of the platform may not be too far away .

The alt - rock band scored UK hits with Disarm , Tonight Tonight and Ava Adore
Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan collapsed on stage during a gig in Florida on Thursday night .
During the band 's performance of 1995 hit single Bullet With Butterfly Wings , the star fell to the ground .
Writing on Twitter later that night , the musician said : " That was n't a stage move or clumsiness .
That was me blacking out and wiping out . "
The 43 - year - old , who said he was bruised by the fall , gave no explanation for his collapse .
" I have no memory of falling against the drum riser and my guitar cabinet , but I can tell you I 've got quite a good bruise [ and ] am moving slow , " he added .
The Chicago band , who found success with a string of psychedelic alt - rock albums in the mid-90s , are scheduled to play a show on Friday in Tennessee .
Earthworm Jim HD is due out on Xbox Live Arcade this Wednesday , 9th June , and will cost 800 Microsoft Points ( £ 6.80 /  9.60 ) .
Earthworm Jim is a rather weird 2D platformer released for a multitude of formats in the mid 1990s by Shiny Entertainment .
Jim uses his head as a whip , launches cows around and generally behaviours peculiarly .
The HD update aims to make the most of all that and also introduces a four - player co-operative mode .
PlayStation Network and WiiWare versions should follow in a month 's time according to previous reports .
Developer Gameloft has already ported a non-HD version to iPhone .
Check out the trailer below for a bit more insight .
In announcing the Earthworm Jim HD date , Xbox Live 's Major Nelson also revealed that a LEGO Harry Potter demo will be released on Xbox Live today , and that the ranks of titles on Games on Demand will swell tomorrow to include Red Faction : Guerrilla and Need for Speed Undercover .
He also listed upcoming Deals of the Week .

Parking rates have been climbing up all over Canada during the last ten years .
However , if you like to spend a lot of money on parking , you should not miss out our beloved Toronto .
According to an annual survey by Colliers International , Toronto ranked the second most expensive city for parking after Calgary .
Average expenses on parking now reach $ 336.26 ( Calgary reached stunning $ 453.38 a month ) ; that was $ 60 less just a year ago .
The median monthly parking rate rose 2 % to $ 224.10 .
Obviously , parking is a great business , even during the toughest recession .
When considering daily average rate , we are even at the top with $ 23 per day .
The reason is simple – demand is constantly growing , especially with the continuing build - up of condos in Toronto , but supply is virtually constant .
Unfortunately , this is hardly going to change in the upcoming years .
There are only 10 parking garage projects with 1,800 parking spaces announced in the next two year for the whole Canada .
Toronto will get a share of around 220 parking spots …
If you would like to enjoy cheaper parking , you should move to Ottawa ( average monthly cost $ 160 ) , Halifax ( $ 158.20 ) , Winnipeg ( $ 152.25 ) or Saskatoon ( $ 147 ) .
The cheapest one of the ranked cities was Kitchener - Waterloo with monthly expenses only $ 116.94 on average .
On the other hand , Calgary was the only Canadian city , which made it to the global top list .
Parking in cities like London ( $ 933 ) , Hong Kong ( $ 744.72 ) or Tokyo ( $ 654 ) is only for nobility .
We are trying to help you as much as possible with parking in Toronto – check our section about Toronto parking pads and parking permits .
However , it is maybe just about the time to take the development of robust public traffic in GTA seriously .
Hordes of atheists are commenting on yesterday 's post from a Catholic priest who says Christians should pray for the cancer - stricken Christopher Hitchens , even if he is an enemy of religion .
Far from being touched by the priest 's gesture , the atheists are mostly offended :
As an atheist , I find it objectionable that anyone should feel the right to pray for me because I do n't believe as they do .
That 's as bad as that idiot church who thinks its a good idea to baptize dead Jews or protest at military funerals .
It 's the worst kind of pandering .
Here 's another :
There have been multiple scientific studies that show that prayer does not have any impact on whether someone is cured of a serious illness .
It 's time Christians just stopped worrying about people that do n't believe in their sky god .
Atheists do n't care if you pray for them , your god does not exist .
A fair number of believers , meanwhile , challenge the author - a priest and a seminary professor - on his description of Hitchens as a " child of God " :
Rev. Barron 's main point is right on target .
As Christians , we should , indeed , pray for and love those who oppose , ridicule and even persecute us .
However , Rev. Barron states and uses as his basis for praying for Mr. Hitchens that Hitchens is " a child of God . "
For a reverend , a ministry founder , a host of a religious program and a religion professor , I am astounded at Rev. Barron 's ignorance of the Bible .
According to the Bible , as an atheist , Mr. Hitchens is NOT a " child of God . "
That description is reserved for only those who receive and believe in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord ( John 1:12 ) .
Any atheists out there who appreciate prayers for Hitchens ' health ?
Any believers who think he 's a child of God ?
Republicans have undermined the US economy and blocked its recovery at every turn , while accusing Obama and the Democrats of socialism .
Since socialism is such a fearful thing , lets compare how it is practiced today with Republican policies .
Bob Cesca wrote an excellent piece on where Republican policies have gotten us .
We ’re only three months away from the midterm election when a shockingly large number of American voters will inexplicably vote for Republican candidates .
I have no idea if this will mean a Republican takeover of the House or Senate or both , but there will definitely be enough voter support for Republicans to significantly reduce the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate .
Why ?
Because too many voters tend to be low - information , knee - jerk Springfield - from - The - Simpsons types , and the Republicans have lashed their crazy trains to this new wave of inchoate roid - rage to help sweep them into more congressional seats .
Here are a few of the ongoing economic conditions facing a vast majority of Americans , many of whom are all revved up to vote Republican in November .
According to Michael Snyder of the Business Insider :
• 61 percent of Americans " always or usually " live paycheck to paycheck , which was up from 49 percent in 2008 and 43 percent in 2007 .
• 66 percent of the income growth between 2001 and 2007 went to the top 1 percent of all Americans .
• Over 1.4 million Americans filed for personal bankruptcy in 2009 , which represented a 32 percent increase over 2008 .
• The bottom 50 percent of income earners in the United States now collectively own less than 1 percent of the nation ’s wealth .
• In America today , the average time needed to find a job has risen to a record 35.2 weeks .
• More than 40 percent of Americans who actually are employed are now working in service jobs , which are often very low paying .
• Despite the financial crisis , the number of millionaires in the United States rose a whopping 16 percent to 7.8 million in 2009 .
Oh , and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported that wages for the highest 20 percent of earners rose by nearly 300 percent since 1979 , while wages for the bottom and middle 20 percent increased only by 41 percent — combined .
Plotted on a graph , middle and working class wages have flatlined for 30 years .
Roll all of these tragic figures into a slow growth recovery and here we are .
Most of us in the middle class are screwed .
And thanks to an alliance between the Republicans ( which includes the tea party ) , the increasingly dominant far - right media , a traditional " old media " that panders to the far - right , and right - of - center " conservadems " who pander to the Republicans , too many voters have decided that the Republican Party might be better suited to turn all of this around .
The big lie here is that if Congress stops spending , cuts the deficit and makes permanent the Bush tax cuts , especially the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans , our problems will be solved — even though these concepts are in direct conflict with each other .
Not surprising given the ever - lengthening Republican syllabus of contradictions .
Here ’s how this new batch of contradictions plays out .
According to Republicans and their conservadem enablers , we have to cut the deficit and pay for every program Congress passes or else we ’re all doomed .
We ’re stealing from our children , they say .
This has manifested itself in Republican filibusters of both unemployment benefits ( $ 34 billion ) and a new jobs bill ( $ 33 billion over ten years ) .
A Republican filibuster killed the jobs bill , and , after many failed cloture votes , the filibuster of the unemployment benefits was finally defeated and the Senate Democrats passed the extensions .
Throughout the past year and a half , it ’s been the same story .
Any effort made by the Democrats to stimulate the economy has been filibustered by the Republicans .
They say it ’s because of the deficit and debt .
And yet they want to make the Bush tax cuts permanent , which would add $ 678 billion dollars to the deficit — and that ’s just the cost of the tax cuts going to the top two percent of earners .
In other words , the Republicans want to spend $ 678 billion in further giveaways for the wealthiest two percent , and they do n’t care whether it increases the deficit .
By the way , the Republicans also recently voted against and defeated an amendment to strip Big Oil of its $ 25 billion in subsidies .
Just thought I ’d pass that along .
Put another way , $ 678 billion in tax cuts for the wealthy ?
No problem .
Deficit - shmeficit !
But $ 34 billion in unemployment benefits for an out - of - work middle class at a time when companies are n’t hiring ( say nothing of the aforementioned bullet - points ) ?
Evil !
Instead , the Republicans want to give almost as much money to Big Oil in the form of corporate welfare during the worst oil spill in American history while telling unemployed middle class families to piss off .
Do we have a clear picture in terms of who and what the Republicans care about ?… [ emphasis added ]
For the record , this is the existing Nexuiz , not the upcoming console game .
This is confusing !
I 'm not normally into " this game announced to use this engine and this middleware " news , but this announcement caught my eye .
Nexuiz , the upcoming downloadable first - person shooter from Illfonic , is going to run on Crytek 's CryENGINE 3 .
This is the same engine that Crysis 2 will run on when it 's released .
That 's not really a big story on its own , but Nexuiz 's path to the marketplace is a little ... odd .
Nexuiz started out as a free , open - source first - person shooter for the PC , Mac , and Linux , and it runs on something called the " Darkplaces " engine , which is a highly modified Quake 1 engine .
So it 's not exactly advanced technology .
In fact , the game 's official site claims that work began on Nexuiz in 2002 .
So when the game was first announced as an upcoming console release , I figured it was just a way for this community - developed project to bring in a little bit of money , but that it 'd probably look like a polished - up version of the original game .
Obviously , changing to a modern engine opens up all kinds of weird possibilities .
Nexuiz ( the original one ) is kind of a cool game , and since it 's totally free , you might want to give it a look if you 've never seen it before .
You can grab the latest version from the game 's official site .
Meanwhile , this CryENGINE - based Nexuiz game is due for Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network this Winter .

While the recently released US National Space Policy has given NASA and the Defense Dept. , new impetus to work toward removing space debris , the space agency this month outlined the top 10 reasons so much junk is out there in the first place .
NASA ' s Orbital Debris Program
Office this month said that while over 4,700 space missions have taken place worldwide since the beginning of what it called the Space Age , only 10 missions account for one - third of all cataloged objects currently in Earth orbit and of that , six of these 10 debris producing events occurred within the past 10 years .
Debris from China the US and former Soviet Union spacecraft make up majority of junk floating in space .
Approximately 19,000 objects larger than 10 cm are known to exist , NASA stated .
NASA telescopes watch cosmic violence , mysteries unravel
Examples of what NASA calls orbital debris include : " Derelict spacecraft and upper stages of launch vehicles , carriers for multiple payloads , debris intentionally released during spacecraft separation from its launch vehicle or during mission operations , debris created as a result of spacecraft or upper stage explosions or collisions , solid rocket motor effluents , and tiny flecks of paint released by thermal stress or small particle impacts . "
According to NASA the Top 10 space junk producing missions are :
Name Year of Breakup Debris items Cause of Breakup
Fengyun - 1C 2007 2,841 Intentional Collision
Cosmos 2251 2009 1,267 Accidental Collision
STEP 2 Rocket Body 1996 713 Accidental Explosion
Iridium 33 2009 521 Accidental Collision
Cosmos 2421 2008 509 Unknown
SPOT 1 Rocket Body 1986 492 Accidental Explosion
OV2-1/LCS 2 Rocket Body 1965 473 Accidental Explosion
Nimbus 4 Rocket Body 1970 374 Accidental Explosion
TES Rocket Body 2001 370 Accidental Explosion
CBERS 1 Rocket Body 2000 343 Accidental Explosion
NASA noted that the breakup of the Russian Briz - M orbital stage that broke - up into an estimated 1000 plus fragments in February 2007 has not been catalogued because of what it called the " highly elliptical nature of the stage 's orbit " has impeded the U.S. Space Surveillance Network 's ability to detect , to identify , and catalog the debris .
The SSN is tracking more than 19,000 objects in orbit about the Earth .
According to Space.com there is a potentially bigger junk producer on the horizon : " The European Space Agency ( ESA ) in three years will become the owner of what is possibly the most dangerous piece of space debris circling the Earth : the 8,000 - kilogram Envisat Earth observation satellite .
Envisat , whose mission has been extended to 2013 , appears to set records wherever it goes .
Launched in 2002 , it was the biggest nonmilitary Earth observation satellite ever built .
At $ 2.9 billion in today 's dollars , it is one of the most expensive .
Its mission is viewed as a success by its users , all the more so insofar as the original five - year mission has been stretched to 11 years .
And now , once in retirement and in a near - polar orbit at 782.4 kilometers in altitude , Envisat will become what space debris experts say is a huge problem that will not go away for about 150 years . "
While the junk seems to be piling up , there are efforts to try to contain it .
Most recently the Obama administration issued a National Space Policy that among many other things requires the US to : " Lead the continued development and adoption of international and industry standards and policies to minimize debris , such as the United Nations Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines ...
Pursue research and development of technologies and techniques , through the Administrator of NASA and the Secretary of Defense , to mitigate and remove on - orbit debris , reduce hazards , and increase understanding of the current and future debris environment . "
Meanwhile the Air Force plans to launch the Space - Based Space Surveillance satellite , which is supposed to detect debris , spacecraft or other distant space objects .
The satellite , which was to go up this year , has been delayed and no new launch date has been set .
Last year Northrop Grumman grabbed $ 30 million from the US Air Force to start developing the first phase of a global space surveillance ground radar system .
The new S - Band Space Fence is part of the Department of Defense 's effort to track and detect what are known as resident space objects ( RSO ) , consisting of thousands of pieces of space debris as well as commercial and military satellites .
The new Space Fence will replace the current VHF Air Force Space Surveillance System built in 1961 .
The Space Fence will provide continuous space situational awareness by detecting smaller objects in low and medium earth orbit .
The current system requires constant sustainment intervention to maintain operations and does not address the growing population of small and micro satellites in orbit .

ISLANDERS AGREE TO TERMS WITH PARENTEAU AND KONOPKA by Staff Writer / New York Islanders
The New York Islanders announced today that they have agreed to terms on one - year contracts with P.A. Parenteau and Zenon Konopka .
Parenteau played within the New York Rangers organization for the past three seasons .
Last year was his first with the Rangers , playing in 22 games and scoring three goals and five assists for eight points .
The two seasons prior , Parenteau played for the Rangers ’ American Hockey League affiliate , the Hartford Wolf Pack where he averaged over a point per game .
In two seasons with the Wolf Pack , the Hull , QC native tallied 63 goals and 96 assists for 159 points in 149 games played .
Konopka , a native of Niagara On the Lake , ON was a member of the Tampa Bay Lightning the past two seasons .
He led the league in penalty minutes last season with 265 .
Konopka played in 74 games and tallied two goals and three assists while compiling 265 penalty minutes to lead the National Hockey League .
An undrafted free agent , Konopka began his pro career with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in 2005 - 06 , dressing in 23 games and scoring seven points ( four goals and three assists ) .
He also played a total of nine games with the Columbus Blue Jackets and accumulated 35 penalty minutes .
A 29 - year - old center , Konopka has seen stints in Cincinnati ( AHL ) , Portland ( AHL ) , Syracuse ( AHL ) and Norfolk ( AHL ) .
“ To add both Pierre and Zenon puts a tremendous amount of skill and grit into our lineup , ” Islanders General Manager Garth Snow said .
“ Pierre has been one of the top scorers in the AHL the past two seasons and showed he can play in the NHL in his time with the Rangers this season .
Konopka is a high character guy that will do anything to help our team win and adds an intimidating factor into our lineup . ”

Sick of your iPhone 's puny lens ?

This " iPhone DSLR prototype " is a 1.1lb , solid piece of anodized billet aluminum ( that looks to be a modified Owle ) .
It will fit an iPhone 3G , 3GS or 4 along with a complementing , full - size Canon EF lens .
And since Canon converter mounts are widely available for most lens brands , I 'm guessing this rig could fit pretty much any lens you tossed at it with some tweaking .

Is this a real DSLR ?
Of course not .
As many angry camera snobs have pointed out , there 's no internal mirror system to control light hitting the iPhone 's camera sensor .
But could it milk the 5MP iPhone sensor for everything it 's worth given access to some premium glass ?
Theoretically , yes .
The creator has n't shared any sample photos yet .
But it 's a fun project .
We 'll keep an eye out .

President Obama ’s promise to put 1,200 new troops on the border is as empty as the national treasury .
Turns out those troops wo n’t be used to stop the flow of illegal aliens .
AFP has a full report on Obama ’s empty promise :
US National Guard troops being sent to the Mexican border will be used to stem the flow of guns and drugs across the frontier and not to enforce US immigration laws , the State Department said Wednesday .
The clarification came after the Mexican government urged Washington not to use the additional troops to go after illegal immigrants .
President Barack Obama on Tuesday authorized the deployment of up to 1,200 additional troops to border areas but State Department spokesman Philip Crowley told reporters , “ It ’s not about immigration . ”
He said the move was “ fully consistent with our efforts to do our part to stem , you know , violence , to interdict the flow of dangerous people and dangerous goods — drugs , guns , people . ”
He said the extra troops would be used to free up civilians engaged in support functions so that law enforcement personnel can be increased along the 2,000 - mile - long ( 3,200 kilometer ) border .

UPI / Kevin Dietsch | License Photo
WASHINGTON , July 1 ( UPI ) -- U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , said much of his work is " completely opposite " from the Tea Party and predicts the movement will " die out . "
" Everything I 'm doing now in terms of talking about climate , talking about immigration , talking about Gitmo is completely opposite of where the Tea Party movement 's at , " Graham told The New York Times Magazine in a profile that will be published Sunday , The Hill reported Thursday .

" The problem with the Tea Party , I think it 's just unsustainable because they can never come up with a coherent vision for governing the country .
It will die out .
We do n't have a lot of Reagan - type leaders in our party .
Remember Ronald Reagan Democrats ?
I want a Republican that can attract Democrats , " Graham told the Times .
Graham said his first of four meetings with Tea Party representatives was " very , very contentious " and that at a later meeting he asked them , " ' What do you want to do ?
You take back your country -- and do what with it ? ' …
Everybody went from being kind of hostile to just dead silent . "
Graham was elected to the Senate in 2002 and does not face re-election until 2014 .
Class Action – Bank of America Sued by Homeowners for Withholding Federal Bailout Funds Posted by 4closureFraud on March 23 , 2010 · 18 Comments
Bank of America Home Loans
Date Filed : March 22 , 2010 Court : U.S. District Court Location : Seattle Ticker Symbol : BAC
Washington homeowners sued Bank of America claiming the lending giant is intentionally withholding government funds intended to save homeowners from foreclosure .
Hagens Berman represents plaintiffs in the class - action lawsuit .
Attorneys are interested to speak with other eligible home owners who were intentionally deferred or wrongfully declined a permanent mortgage adjustment per the Home Assistance Modification Program ( HAMP ) .
The case , filed in U.S. District Court , claims that Bank of America systematically slows or thwarts Washington homeowners ’ access to Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) funds by ignoring homeowners ’ requests to make reasonable mortgage adjustments or other alternative solutions that would prevent homes from being foreclosed .
Bank of America accepted more than $ 25 billion in government bailout money financed by taxpayer dollars earmarked to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure .
One in eight mortgages in the United State is currently in foreclosure or default .
Bank of America , like other TARP - funded financial institutions , is obligated to offer alternatives to foreclosure and permanently reduce mortgage payments for eligible borrowers struck by financial hardship but , according to the lawsuit , has n’t lived up to its obligation .
Bank of America services more than 1 million mortgages that qualify for financial relief , but have granted only 12,761 of them permanent modification , reported the U.S. Treasury Department .
According to the TARP regulations , banks must gather information from the homeowner , and offer a revised three - month payment plan for the borrower .
If the homeowner makes all three payments under the trial plan , and provides the necessary documentation , the lender must offer a permanent modification .
Bank of America continues to ignore TARP regulations and instead creates more financial pressure on homeowners , the court filing states .
The lawsuit charges that Bank of America intentionally postpones homeowners ’ requests to modify mortgages , depriving borrowers of federal bailout funds that could save them from foreclosure .
The bank ends up reaping the financial benefits provided by taxpayer dollars financing TARP - funds and also collects higher fees and interest rates associated with stressed home loans .
If you received an inadequate response from Bank of America for a home loan modification request after April 13 , 2009 , you are encouraged to join the suit .

MELBOURNE'S
$ 5.5 million bike share scheme is n't attracting many users , and Mike Rubbo reckons he knows why : the helmets .
Fewer than 70 trips are being made a day on Melbourne 's 600 - bike system , a tiny number of journeys compared with the take - up rate seen in bigger schemes introduced in 135 cities around the world .
Mr Rubbo , a Sydney filmmaker and bicycle blogger , will try to underscore his argument on Saturday morning by leading a protest ride from Melbourne University without a helmet , risking a fine of $ 146 .
He wants Roads Minister Tim Pallas to follow Mexico City 's lead and waive compulsory helmet laws for the bike - share scheme .
Melbourne is the only city in the world to have introduced a bike - share scheme and retain its compulsory helmet laws .

EXCLUSIVE NEW AUDIO : Mel Gibson Admits Hitting Oksana , Threatens To Kill Her - Listen To It Here
WARNING : This audio may not be reproduced or republished .
Mel Gibson , under investigation for domestic violence , admits to hitting Oksana Grigorieva and TWICE threatens to kill her in an explosive new audio tape obtained and released exclusively by RadarOnline.com .
The enraged actor tells the mother of his eight - month old daughter Lucia “ you deserved it ” after she says that he hit her and broke her teeth .
TRUE OR FALSE ?
Kim Kardashian ’s Plastic Surgery Rumors !
Mel ’s stunning admission could be a powerful piece of evidence against him in the criminal investigation that is headed for the district attorney ’s office and right now being conducted by the L.A. County Sherriff ’s Department .
The new tape features a ranting , out - of - control , Mel who screams and is so enraged at times that all he can do is pant heavily , seemingly incapable of speaking .
It is one of the most powerful , crazed and bizarre episodes ever caught on tape from a major Hollywood star .
You can listen to the tape here exclusively on RadarOnline.com .
The tape is not only big trouble for Mel in the domestic violence investigation but he could face additional criminal charges based on two death threats heard clearly on this new audio .
WARNING : This audio contains graphic and profane language .
It has been left unedited so that the full impact of Mel ’s rant can be heard .
RadarOnline.com has not altered this tape in any way .
As Mel and Oksana argue , the Braveheart star becomes increasingly incensed , and tells her : “ You need a f*cking bat in the side of the head .
Alright , how about that ? ”
Later on the tape , Mel alludes to killing and burying her .
As the former couple ’s argument grows worse and worse Oksana tells Mel : “ You ’re gonna answer one day , boy , you ’re gonna answer . ”
Infuriated , Mel asks if she is threatening him , and Oksana says she is not .
“ I ’m not the one to threaten , ” the Russian - born beauty says .
And that ’s when Mel makes what certainly can be reasonably interpreted as another death threat , telling Oksana : “ Threaten ya ?
I ’ll put you in a f * ckin rose garden you c*nt !
You understand that ?
Because I ’m capable of it .
You understand that ? ”
Oksana filed a complaint with law enforcement on July 5 triggering a domestic violence investigation of Mel. RadarOnline.com learned that Oksana said she taped Mel because he made death threats against her and she feared for her life .
At one point , on another section of tape not played here , Mel threatens to burn down her house .
The new tape obtained exclusively by RadarOnline.com has Mel admitting that he punched Oksana , confirming our earlier report that she has told friends he knocked out her front teeth .
Here is the key piece of dialogue :
Oksana :
What kind of a man is that ?
Hitting a woman when she ’s holding a child in her hands ?
Breaking her teeth twice in the face !
What kind of man is that ?
Mel :
Oh , you ’re all angry now !
You know what , you f* cking deserved it !
As RadarOnline.com reported Oksana filed a restraining order under seal against Mel last month .
In May they went through two days of arbitration to work out the terms of their separation .
But Mel became infuriated when she would not let him see their daughter on Father ’s day .
RadarOnline.com was first to report that he has also filed orders under seal that restrain Oksana .
Mel ’s lawyers are now claiming that Oksana tried to extort him for more money in their settlement .
PHOTOS : Mel & Oksana Go Public For First Time
On this tape , Mel says he will no longer pay money toward Oksana ’s music career and she answers : “ I do n’t give a damn if you do n’t spend another penny on me .
“ I do n’t care I am just fearing for the life of my daughter . ”
Mel accuses her of leaving him when he stopped spending money but Oksana answers : “ Because I am saving my life and I ’m saving my daughter ’s life !
I do n’t give a damn about my music and I do n’t give a damn about you spending another penny !
I ’m saving her life !
You almost killed us , did you forget ? ”
On July 9 , RadarOnline.com released audio of Mel ’s vile racist rant .
He is heard telling Oksana : “ You look like a f*cking bitch in heat .
And if you get raped by a pack of ni**ers it will be your fault .
Alright ?
Because you provoked it . ”
Shortly after the release of our tape , it was revealed that the William Morris agency dropped Gibson as a client .
Now many are wondering if his career can survive and the new tapes may indicate even bigger problems are directly ahead for the actor , as his threats against Oksana and admission of hitting her may be enough basis for criminal charges .
The Braveheart star is so worked up at times on this tape that he is huffing and puffing , out of breath and in what appears to be a full blown emotional crisis .
Oksana , by contrast , remains calm for most of the tape , but at times she shows more emotion , telling Mel , “ you need medication . ”
She also tells
Mel that she will call the police as he gets more abusive and that sets him into another rage as he screams : “ You ’re in my house honey . ”
Mel and Oksana ’s romantic relationship was revealed exclusively by RadarOnline.com after we obtained photos of them hugging on a beach in Costa Rica .
Mel ’s wife Robyn filed for diovrce shortly after the photos became public .
The new tape offers a brief but interesting glimpse about the end of Mel ’s marriage .
At one point he tells Oksana : “ I left my wife because we had no spiritual common ground . ”
The tape was made earlier this year , after January 6 when Oksana has said Mel punched her in the face while she held their daughter .
Mel and Oksana ’s relationship has unraveled by this point and he rails against her , saying that she does n’t love him and has used him financially .

At one point he alludes that he has quit smoking and says that her behavior wants to make him smoke again .
But the rest of the conversation is far more intense with Mel trying to express he has done everything possible for Oksana and received nothing in return .
He screams at Oksana : “ You do n’t have any f*ucking friends except me , and you treat me like shi* !
So that ’s why I ’m so fucking angry , because I do n’t have any friends !
And I try and make one from you and you treat me like shit and you fucking used me ! ”

On a monthly basis , retail sales decreased 0.5 % from May to June ( seasonally adjusted , after revisions ) , and sales were up 4.8 % from June 2009 .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This graph shows retail sales since 1992 .
This is monthly retail sales , seasonally adjusted ( total and ex-gasoline ) .
Retail sales are up 7.3 % from the bottom , but still off 5.2 % from the pre-recession peak .
The second graph shows the year - over - year change in retail sales ( ex - gasoline ) since 1993 .
Retail sales ex-gasoline increased by 4.5 % on a YoY basis ( 4.8 % for all retail sales ) .
The year - over - year comparisons are easy now since retail sales collapsed in late 2008 .
Here is the Census Bureau report :
The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that advance estimates of U.S. retail and food services sales for June , adjusted for seasonal variation and holiday and trading - day differences , but not for price changes , were $ 360.2 billion , a decrease of 0.5 percent ( ±0.5 % ) * from the previous month , but 4.8 percent ( ±0.7 % ) above June 2009 .
Total sales for the April through June 2010 period were up 6.8 percent ( ±0.3 % ) from the same period a year ago .
The April to May 2010 percent change was revised from - 1.2 percent ( ±0.5 % ) to - 1.1 percent ( ±0.2 % ) .
Retail sales have declined for two consecutive months .
This is another weak report , and the decline in sales was worse than expected .

Lady Gaga takes a tumble thanks to her ridiculous choice of footwear
For most people , a long flight means donning floppy trousers , socks and earplugs that drown out the snoring and dribbling chap next to you .
But not for Lady Gaga , who emerged at Heathrow airport fresh from New York dressed in an outfit that made her look like a cyborg from a sci - fi movie .
Not for her the hardy perennial Ugg boots or trainers .
Instead , the pop star had squeezed herself into a bizarre mix of thigh - high black leather chaps and platform heel - less boots .
Steady now : Lady Gaga loses her balance as she lands at Heathrow airport wearing super high platforms

Bethlehem - Ma'an -
Spare medical parts and replacements are , in practice , barred from entry into Gaza , or only arrive " after great delays , " a World Health Organization spokesman told Ma'an on Friday .
Following the release of a report from the WHO on Gaza City 's Ash - Shifa Hospital , the spokesman emphasized that beyond the impeded access to parts , engineers are unable to enter Gaza to service the equipment .
" Life saving equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars has been held up in Ramallah for over six months , " the statement said .
In the WHO 's profile , it says that most of the medical diagnostic equipment in Ash - Shifa hospital , a 560 - bed facility in Gaza City , remains out of order .
The CT scan , MRI , mammography , endoscope and gastroscope , a statement said , have all been waiting for service or spare parts for months , in some cases years .
The blockade Israel has imposed on the territory for the past three years is affecting the functioning of medical equipment threefold , the report found , with prohibitions , delays , and lack of qualified service personnel and power cuts / surges damaging delicate machines .
The CT scanner , used to diagnose cancers , cardiovascular disease , appendicitis , and dozens of other conditions , has only been running from parts borrowed from other facilities , and , the WHO said , its " radiation levels are above international norms .
Without an alternative , however , it is used about 15 times a day for emergencies . "
According to the WHO report , a replacement machine is available in a warehouse in Ramallah , only " 80 kilometres from Gaza city as the crow flies , " the report noted , adding " it has been lying there for over six months , " but has yet to receive clearance from Israeli crossings officials .
WHO officials say " patients with chronic diseases are particularly hard hit by the lack of appropriate equipment , " particularly the 200 odd dialysis patients served three times every week .
A lack of dialysis machines means patients receive only half their necessary treatment , exposing them to severe health risks , while others are asked to come in for treatment during the late hours of the night and early morning , the statement reported .

An address to Italian executives on a summer night in Rome last week yielded some exceptional candor from former Milwaukeean Jeffrey Immelt , CEO of General Electric Co .
The resulting headlines centered on his new - found frustration with Chinese industrial policy ( he used to be a fan of the Chinese business agenda ) , but he also had some salty words for President Barack Obama and his U.S. economic policy .
Immelt 's PR department later said his words were taken out of context .
That damage - control effort aside , The Financial Times of London reported that he said business did not like the president , and the president did n't like business .
Most Wisconsin business people would say pretty much the same thing , and they would say pretty much the same thing about the Doyle administration in Madison .
Immelt lamented that the U.S. is in a terrible national mood , caused in part by overregulation in response to the financial crisis and the disconnect between the corporate world and the Obama team on trade policy .
GE has its own problems in getting back into a growth mode , and surely that fueled some of his frustrations .
Nonetheless , he spoke from the perspective of many CEOs .
The national business mood is decidedly downbeat .
It might be even worse in Wisconsin , because of the perception that business is getting it from both barrels - federal and state .
Most CEOs are reluctant to speak out about their disgust with government policy , but several have let it be known in business circles that they have no intention of expanding their operations in this state .
One CEO made his thoughts public on Wisconsin Eye , a multimedia public affairs network :
" If the business climate does not improve , I will not expand this facility , " said Jerry Ryder , president of InSinkErator and a 30 - year veteran of its parent , Emerson Electric Co .
His comment is pertinent , because his management team has just finished a five - year capacity plan , and his Racine plant , the largest manufacturer of disposal units in the world , is nearing full capacity .
There will be an expansion somewhere to serve the North American market .
Ryder said his disposal units face a 20 % tariff going into China , while competing Chinese products face no tariff entering the U.S. Hence , it is likely InSinkErator will have to build a plant in China to keep its share of the market there .
The absence of a level playing field spells an end for exports to China from Racine .
Several CEOs are downright sulfurous in their private assessments about doing business in Wisconsin .
Their objections include personal and corporate tax increases , recent court rulings and legislative proposals to raise liabilities for corporations .
The list also includes proposed expansions of regulation through bills like the one on climate change , new pro-union laws , the fiscal disarray in Madison and the proclivity of the state to be an outlier when it comes to conformity with federal taxes and regulations .
Call them crybabies if you like .
But these are the guys making the decisions about where jobs are retained , reduced or added .
And , not so incidentally , they are human beings .
They want to be liked and appreciated .
They look for signals , and if they do n't like what they see and hear , they go elsewhere .
Some would say the state remains a good place to do business , and there certainly are many positives , like the competitive business tax rates , the pool of skilled labor and investments in education at all levels .
But CEOs are paid to look ahead , to try to figure out where things are going .
The changes in the business climate , positive or negative , have a disproportionate effect on their thinking .
As of late , many do n't like the signals coming out of China , Washington , D.C. , or Madison .
They will assess the totality of those signals , and they will act on that assessment as they shape their strategies .
Political leaders who do n't understand or do n't care about the signals they are sending can't pretend to be serious about job retention or creation .
Tommy Thompson was a governor in the 1990s who understood pro-business policies , but also the value of positive signals and strokes .
It looks like he 's not running for office again .
But he could add a lot of value to the job creation efforts by setting up a cheerleading school for presidents and governors .

Let ’s face it : we all make stupid decisions .
Like choosing a fifth over a review session , or bringing that guy home … who stole our iPod in the morning .
That ’s part of college life … and a big part of what makes it so memorable .
But there are some choices that have longer lasting repercussions ; things we do now that will haunt us later .
So here are the 11 things from your 20’s you will most definitely regret when you ’re 40 .
11 . Risque Internet Photos :
What ’s the point of having technology if you ca n’t use it to send a naughty pre-shower photo to your BF ?
Nothing will turn him on quite like a naked photo popping up in his inbox while he ’s brushing up on his Stats knowledge .
You trust him , so what ’s the worst that could happen ?
How about a break up ?
Or the “ forward ” button ?
No matter what you think , those photos are going to come back and bite you in the ( naked - with - a - spot - of - cellulite ) ass .
Just show him the real thing and let him turn to his imagination ( or internet porn ) for a mid-class pick me up .
10 . Trendy Tats :
You totally love butterflies / stars / unicorns now , but I can bet money that you wo n’t want them plastered on the top of your foot or your lower back forever .
No one wants to see a mom with a rose tattoo on her left shoulder , so think before you ink .
9 . Choosing guys over your girls :
You get caught up in your relationship sometimes and blow off the girls .
Fine , we get it .
But when sometimes turns into “ What the hell ever happened to Mary ? ” there is a problem .
Especially when Mr. Douche
Bag finally breaks up with you and you come crawling back to the girls with a tub of Edy ’s and a box of tissues and they are n’t there to wipe the snot from your cheek .
Do you really want to spend the rest of your days holed up in a dirty apartment watching your man play Rock Band and chug Natty Light ?
Learn the balance , honey .
8. Getting married too young : I ’ve seen it too many times – people graduate , freak out and hold onto whatever they can of their youth .
And they get married .
And become super lame married people .
It may be pure bliss now ( and lots and lots of kitchen - ware ) , but just think about all the awesome stuff you will miss by being tied down in your twenties , all that freedom : to travel when you want , to take a job wherever you want , to sleep with whomever you want , to party as late as you want , to discover yourself , to sleep with whomever you want … .
Plus , do you really want pictures of your friends doing keg stands in your wedding album ?
I thought not .
7. Smoking : Mmmm tobacco .
It feels so good when it hits ( and consequently blackens ) your lungs .
Especially after you ’ve had a few Rum and Diets .
And you look so cool doing it .
But you know what does n’t feel good ?
Chemo .
And you know what does n’t look cool ?
Your wrinkley face or your kids stealing the pack from your tobacco stained purse and trying it for the first time .
When they are 6 .
This sh*t will kill you , so stop it .
Right now !
Seriously , put down that Marlboro Light , sister .
and start planning !
5. Bad Credit :
You ca n’t live without that Coach bag right now .
You just have to have that DVF dress for the date party .
Everyone else has an iPhone and you want one too .
You ’ll just charge it and worry about it later , right ?
Wrong , bitches .
Ruining your credit now on stupid stuff ( yes , I am telling you that bag is a stupid investment ) will totally eff things up for you in the future .
Things like getting a house , a car , a boyfriend ( bad credit is a total turn - off ) and sometimes even a job .
Spend wisely , ladies .
That bag is going to be out of style in .25 seconds anyway .
4 . Not finishing school :
Do we really even need to mention this one ?
Could you think of anything you ’d regret more when you are 40 and working the checkout lane at your neighborhood Wal - mart ?
That is , assuming , you can even get that job in this economy .
3 . Pre-vacation tanning :
You tell yourself that you just want to get a base tan before Spring Break in Cabo .
Sure , you will look fiiiine in that white shift dress for the 6 days after you return , but that wrinkley , skin cancer - ed mess is not going to look so hot when you ’re 40 and you look like a Sharpei .
.
( Editor ’s note : I was going to put a picture of a gross foot here , but you Google “ gross feet in sandals ” and tell me how it makes you feel . )
1 . “ It feels better without condoms ” sex :
You ’ll probably regret this one right off the bat as you spend your senior year chasing a kid around the dorms , but you ’ll seriously regret it later when you look back at your life and realize how much you missed out on because you were busy changing diapers and bouncing a kid on your knee .
Oh , and no one likes a woman with a bumpy vagina .
I ’m just sayin ’ ; those genital warts will never go away .
Dealing with stressful events requires a careful balancing act .
Strong physiological responses to a stressful event — heightened awareness , increased energy — can help deal with the matters at hand .
But if you keep responding in the same manner , there are serious and long - term health risks .
So , the mammalian body has a way of toning down the response to a stressful stimulus , and research is indicating that the mechanism involves endogenous cannabinoids , chemicals that stimulate the same receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana .
One of the key events to mobilizing a body 's response to stress is the release of hormones called glucocorticoids , which help coordinate the body 's response .
Long - term exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids , however , has an adverse impact on everything from the heart to the immune system .
So , the brain apparently has a mechanism for toning down this response .
Over time , repeated exposures to the same stressful stimulus result in smaller surges of glucocorticoids , although the response to a novel source of stress can still produce a large spike in hormone release .
In a study that will be released this week by PNAS , the authors stressed out rats via a procedure that ( more or less ) involved stuffing them into a plastic tube for a half an hour daily .
By the end of nine days , the rats had elevated levels of a specific glucocorticoid , corticosterone , even when they were n't undergoing the stress - inducing procedure .
But , relative to the hormone surges seen on day one , the increase of the hormone following the procedure was significantly reduced on day nine .
In other words , there was still a stress response , but it was n't as pronounced .
The authors also tracked the levels of two different endogenous cannabinoids over the course of the nine - day habituation period .
For one of these , termed anandamide , there was a general reduction in many areas of the brain associated with repeated exposures to stress .
Levels of a second , 2 - arachidonoylglycerol , remained steady in most of the brain , but shot up in the amygdala , an area of the brain associated with reward evaluation .
By itself , this data is n't especially interesting ; you 'd expect stress and its associated hormones to trigger a number of changes in the brain , and separating cause and effect is essential if you 're going to draw any conclusions .
So that 's precisely what the authors chose to do .
Using two different classes of molecules that enhance cannabinoid signaling , they could block the long - term increase in steroids that occurred in animals that had been subjected to daily stress .
Cannabinoids also appear to play a role in the acute response that takes place as the rats were stressed out .
As we mentioned earlier , the amount of corticosterone produced during stress gradually declined over time .
But , by putting in an inhibitor of a cannabinoid receptor , the researchers were able to completely block this response .
When cannabinoid signaling was shut down , the rats responded to the later incidents of stress as if they had never seen them before , producing high levels of corticosterone .
The authors conclude that effective cannabinoid signaling helps tone down the response to stressful situations , both in terms of lowering the levels of corticosterone in general circulation , and in terms of limiting its production during acute instances of stress .
Long term , that toning down is essential for the general health of the animal .
But the paper is anything but an argument for self - medication in response to stress .
There was no consistent pattern of change in the production of cannabinoids across different areas of the brain , so this was n't simply a matter of " more is good . "
The authors interpret this as an indication that different areas of the brain are involved in a cross talk to set the levels of glucocorticoids , and not all of them will respond the same to changes in cannabinoid levels .
In addition , it 's important to note that they only looked at the activity of a single cannabinoid receptor .
Still , the recognition that cannabinoids play a role in the day - to - day running of the brain was a relatively late development in neuroscience , so pinning down precisely what that role is will undoubtedly be useful in the long run .

José Luis de Jésus Miranda , leader of Miami - Dade - based congregation Creciendo en Gracia and the self - proclaimed " Man Christ , " has announced the world will go all apocalyptic July 1 , 2012 .
That 's when Miranda claims his physical body will be " transformed , dressed in immortality and incorruptibility . "
It also happens to be Miranda 's 66th birthday .
New Times profiled Miranda in 2006 , when the former heroin addict was splitting his time between Miami and Missouri City and persuading his followers to shower him with money so he could enjoy the finer things in life , like a diamond - encrusted Pasha watch .
How else do you expect the Lamb to tell us lowly humans the exact time the world will blow up in a calamity of earthquakes , hurricanes , plagues , nuclear war , and locusts ?
Miranda claims to have hundreds of thousands of followers spread over 103 countries , and they all tune in to his weekly Internet broadcasts .
And they do n't seem to mind that Miranda uses their charitable donations for personal expenses such as alimony payments to his first wife and buying property in his and his relatives ' names .
Anyway , Miranda 's flock sent over a statement explaining the coming rapture :
Israel has decided to release three Turkish - owned ships that took part in a humanitarian aid flotilla raided by the navy en route to the Gaza Strip two months ago .
The Israel Navy raid sparked international outcry and escalated tensions with Turkey after nine activists were killed and several more wounded .

The navy had dropped commandos onto the ships after the activists refused Israel 's offer to dock at the Ashdod Port and have their cargo transferred to Gaza .
The commandos came under attack the moment they entered the vessel , and three of the soldiers were seriously wounded .
The ships were subsequently towed to Israel 's harbors and have been sitting in the Ashdod and Haifa ports since then .
The Turkey embassy has officially asked the Foreign Ministry on a number of occasions to release the vessels , which are owned by non-governmental companies in Turkey .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman finally acceded to the request during deliberations on Thursday .
In the past , Israel had said it would agree only if Turkey could guarantee that the ships would never again be used in a flotilla aimed at breaking the Gaza blockade .
No such condition was given this time around .
The Defense Ministry will coordinate with a Turkish delegation to see a fleet of tow vessels brought over from Turkey in the coming days to pick up the three ships .
Relations between Israel and Turkey – once close allies – have soured in the wake of the raid , after an already tense year over the Israel Defense Forces ' 2008 - 2009 offensive on Gaza .
Israel has refused Turkey 's demand to apologize for the raid and compensate the families of the victims , though it has said that it regretted the loss of life .
Meanwhile , three Spanish activists who were aboard the Turkish - flagged Mavi Marmara ship during the raid plan to file a law suit against Israel for alleged crimes against humanity .
The 83 - page document takes aim at Netanyahu , his forum of top six cabinet ministers and the Israel Navy .
The three Spanish activists told the Republica newspaper that Israel had arrested them illegally and deported them by force , after subjecting them to hardships during the raid .

Israel continues to lose popularity in overseas vacation resorts .
Israeli Consul in Athens Eli Sneh informed the Foreign Ministry that several groups of young Israelis have been expelled from hotels in the Greek island of Ios over the past few weeks for getting drunk and behaving in an unruly manner .
Meanwhile in Turkey : Turkey : Crisis with Israel improved tourism Ynet Officials in Ankara say country 's tourist industry booming following flotilla incident .
' Decrease in Israeli visitors led to increase in visitors from neighboring countries like Iran , ' says official Turkey : Crisis with Israel improved tourism
Three weeks ago a group of Israeli teenagers was kicked out of one of the hotels in Ios .
Another group was expelled from an island hotel two weeks ago and the most recent incident occurred this week when a third group was kicked out of two hotels .
All incidents involve Israeli teens visiting Greece in a pre-army trip .
According to the report , shortly after arriving at the Homer 's Inn hotel in Ios this Sunday the Israelis got drunk and began spraying fire extinguisher fluid around the hotel .
When asked to pay for the damages they caused the youths refused and began arguing and cursing .
A representative on behalf of the Issta travel agency was called in and transferred the five Jerusalem teens , three aged 18 and two aged 17 , to the Mare Monte hotel , where they continued misbehaving and ruined a stack of towels .
Once again they were kicked out and transferred to a third hotel .
" We made it clear to them that should they continue their unruly behavior they would spend the rest of their holiday on the beach , " an Issta representative said .
The travel agency noted that the parents of only one teen agreed to pay for the damages he caused .
One of the Mare Monte hotel employees described the Israelis ' conduct : " All of the other guests complained about them .
We told them to keep quiet .
They settled down for a while but on the second night they began being loud again and also caused damage to property .
The other guests came to the front desk and presented an ultimatum : ' Either the Israelis go or we go . '
That 's why they were kicked out . "
Sneh said that the hotels which expelled the teens on Sunday have informed they would not be hosting anymore Israeli youths .
Sever damage to Israel 's image
" These hooligans are causing serious damage to our image .
We became entangled in unnecessary conflicts with the locals and resort to diplomacy to handle them , " Sneh said .
" The complaints we receive suggest these Israelis behaved abominably : Getting drunk , breaking things and behaving in a barbaric manner .
We know that Israelis board flights back home utterly drunk , vomit and occasionally lose consciousness .
We received complaints from the Santorini airport of such Israelis . "
Ophir , a representative of one of the travel agencies used by young Israelis said that one of the major problems is that the youths are able to purchase alcohol in the duty free shops .
" They arrive at the shops , the sales woman sees they 're under 18 and wo n't serve them but they can ask their friends to buy alcohol for them .
These kids leave Israel with 20 bottles of alcohol and when they reach the hotel they get plastered and run wild .
Ios is a very small island , word of such cases spreads quickly and the damage is huge . "
Tourism Minister Stas Misezhnikov said Monday that the teens must realize they are causing great damage which is difficult to mend .
Home Secretary Theresa May has signalled the possible end of Asbos in England and Wales , saying it is " time to move beyond " the orders , first introduced by Labour 11 years ago .
They have been imposed on 10 - year - old boys and 80 - year - old women , used to sober up persistent drunks and mute noisy neighbours .
Here are some of the more unusual Asbos .
Sartorial errors
A 60 - year - old man from Northampton was banned from dressing as a schoolgirl .
Image caption Parents complained after he loitered near primary schools
Peter Trigger 's Asbo stopped him from wearing skirts or showing bare legs on school days between 0830 and 1000 and 1445 and 1600 .
The authorities acted after parents complained he was waiting near a primary school dressed in clothes similar to school uniform .
He then breached this in December last year by bending over in front of his neighbours repeatedly .
But a bid to ban an 18 - year - old from wearing low - slung trousers was dropped earlier this year .
Ellis Drummond , 18 , from Rushden , Northants , was instead barred from using threatening behaviour and demanding money .
' Turn it down '
A country and western music fan was given an Asbo in January for tormenting his neighbours with Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash throughout the day .
Partially deaf Michael O'Rourke , 51 , from Peterhead , was warned by the court that he risked becoming " the oldest raver in town " unless he started to turn his music down .
Meanwhile , a woman who made her neighbours ' lives hell by having noisy sex breached her Asbo four times .
A court heard that complaints about Caroline Cartwright " shouting and screaming " during sex and playing loud dance music had been ongoing for years .
But she avoided being jailed for the latest breach in June .
She said : " I have tried to minimise the situation by having sex in the morning - not at night - so the noise was not waking anybody . "
In disguise
A Middlesbrough man who impersonated a barrister in a string of court cases was banned from claiming he was a legally qualified professional .
Ian Clegg , 32 , admitted conning county court judges and magistrates over six months , but his Asbo was later overturned for being unnecessary in August 2009 .
The court heard he defended two people accused of motoring offences at a magistrates ' court and handled several debt cases in the local county court .
He was rumbled when a prosecutor and court clerk became suspicious because he became confused over procedure .
In June , a homeless man who became an expert at faking illness so he could stay in hospital was given a criminal Asbo .
Counter - fraud experts say the scam cost the NHS tens of thousands of pounds .
Christopher Dearlove , 41 , used more than 70 aliases to trick NHS staff into admitting him to hospital , as he knew which symptoms to report and how to be classed as highly infectious so he could get his own room .
Each time Dearlove was admitted to hospital , it cost an NHS trust between £ 400 and £ 1,000 .
Intimidating behaviour
A " militant atheist " who left explicit images in a prayer room at Liverpool John Lennon Airport was given a five - year Asbo in April .
Harry Taylor , 59 , of Salford , was said to have left images of religious figures in sexual poses on three occasions in 2008 .
Among the posters , one image showed a smiling crucified Christ next to an advert for a brand of " no nails " glue .
In another , Islamic suicide bombers at the gates of paradise were told : " Stop , stop , we 've run out of virgins . "
Taylor 's Asbo bans him from carrying religiously offensive material in a public place .
And a shepherd was given an Asbo for using his flock to intimidate neighbours , which he breached in January .
Jeremy Awdry , 60 , lost the right to graze the sheep in Bream in the Forest of Dean after they were reported straying into gardens and damaging fences .
A court heard the 500 - strong flock was " used as a means of intimidating " .
The prosecutor said : " There were situations where sheep were driven and put in places where they would cause trouble for people .
" Sheep were found lying outside houses dead with their name written in red on them . "
KANDAHAR , AFGHANISTAN — Canada may keep a military presence in Afghanistan after its combat mission ends next year to strengthen the country ’s national security forces , an all - party Commons committee on the conflict says .
The Canadian Forces is scheduled to end the combat mission in July 2011 , but there have been persistent calls from NATO for Canada to maintain a small non-combat military presence that would help in the ongoing and often frustrating effort to train local soldiers and police officers .
It ’s an idea that the Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan is willing to explore , said Liberal MP and foreign affairs critic Bob Rae .
“ The door is open to a serious discussion in Canada , and then between Canada and NATO , about what the future looks like , ” Rae said earlier this week as committee members visited Kandahar Airfield .
“ Increasing the capacity . . . of the Afghan police , the Afghan military and frankly the Afghan judicial system has been very much part of what we ’ve been doing and I think it ’s something that needs to continue . ”
The committee spent several days touring facilities in Kandahar and Kabul , but details of the visit could not be reported until Thursday for security reasons .
Tory MP Kevin Sorenson , the chairman of the committee , said Canada could play an integral role in strengthening Afghanistan ’s police and military in 2011 and beyond .
“ We all realize that the Afghan police as well as the military are going to have to increase capacity if they ’re going to be able to secure their own country , and Canada may have a role in that , ” Sorenson said .
The politically sensitive question of Canada ’s future role in Afghanistan has dogged the federal government since Parliament passed a motion two years ago that requires the Canadian military to cease combat operations by July 2011 and withdraw from Kandahar .
Canada has about 50 RCMP and municipal officers and 40 military police personnel mentoring Afghan cops at the provincial reconstruction centre in Kandahar city .
The U.S. recently poured more police mentors into the base and also operates a police training centre near Kandahar Airfield .
Washington ’s preference would be to have the Canadian battle group remain where it is .
But a fallback position , as suggested by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , would be for Canada to play a larger role in doing something it already does : training the Afghan army .
New Democrat MP and defence critic Jack Harris said a post -2011 role for Canada is in the works , but suggested a military presence was not the only option on the table .
“ All Canadians do not want to see the sacrifice that has been made be for naught and we do have obviously a considerable amount of humanitarian concerns and institution - building concerns about Afghanistan , ” Harris said .
“ Whether that involves military or not is another question indeed .
There are lots of other ways that we can help build institutions . ”
The Afghan National Army is considered far more prepared to crack down on insecurity than the Afghan National Police , a force that continues to struggle with a tarnished reputation among local villagers after years of corruption , extortion and drug abuse .
Many officers still lack training and equipment as basic as handcuffs .
During a tour of Kandahar two weeks ago , federal International Development Minister Bev Oda said the U.S. has offered to provide security for Canadian civilian projects past July 2011 , though planning is still at a preliminary stage .

And the Mounties have already started looking at how to continue the police training mission next year , RCMP Commissioner William Elliott said in April .
Since Canada ’s mission in Afghanistan began in 2002 , 146 Canadian military personnel have been killed .
Canada has more than 2,800 military personnel in Afghanistan , the large majority of whom are in Kandahar .

In modern American life , Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner stands out as amazingly resilient and remarkably lucky – despite presiding over or being deeply involved in a series of political debacles , he has gone from strength to strength .
After at least eight improbably bounce backs , he might seem unassailable .
But his latest mistake – blocking Elizabeth Warren from heading the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – may well prove politically fatal .
Geithner was a junior but key member of the US Treasury team that badly mishandled the early days of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and received widespread criticism ( Life # 1 ) .
He was promoted as a result and thereafter enjoyed a meteoric rise .
As President of the New York Federal Reserve from 2003 , and de facto head of the government ’s financial intelligence service , he completely failed to spot the problems developing in and around the country ’s financial markets ; nothing about this embarrassing track record has since stood in his way ( Life # 2 ) .
He subsequently became Hank Paulson ’s Wall Street point person for one of the most comprehensively bungled bailouts of all time – the Troubled Asset Relief Program , TARP , which in fall 2008 first appalled Congress with its intentions and then was n’t used at all as advertised ( Life # 3 ) .
TARP and related Bush - Paulson - Geithner efforts were so completely and clearly unsuccessful in October / November 2009 that the crisis worsened and Geithner was offered the job of Treasury Secretary by President - elect Obama ; the incoming team felt there was no substitute for “ experience ” .
Nevertheless , he almost failed in the confirmation process due to issues related to his taxes ( Life # 4 ) and then stumbled badly with his initial public repositioning of the TARP ( Life # 5 ) , which was going to buy toxic assets again but in a more complicated way ( perhaps his most complete and obviously personal political disaster to date ) .
His next Great Escape was the stress tests in spring 2009 – it turned out , supposedly , that there was really no financial crisis .
Most of the big banks really did have enough capital ; all that had been missing was the government ’s endorsement of this fact ( this is the story , honest ) .
If this seems too good to be true , look at the mass unemployment still around you and tell me if the financial sector really looks healthy ( Life # 6 ) .
Life # 7 was expended concurrent with the forceful arrival on the financial reform scene of Paul Volcker .
The Geithner - Summers “ financial reform ” package from summer 2009 was weak to start with and weakened further as it was discussed in the House ; the entire effort was rudderless .
Volcker ’s new proposals helped rescue the reform and restore momentum – but instead of ( appropriately ) discrediting the Geithner approach in the eyes of the White House , it actually helped the Treasury Secretary climb new pinnacles of influence .
Go figure .
Life # 8 is the blatant failure of the Geithner strategy to “ just raise capital requirements ” as the way to deal with distorted incentives and the tendency to take irresponsible risks at the heart of our financial system .
Treasury insisted on “ capital first and foremost ” throughout the Senate debate this year – combined with their argument that these requirements must be set by regulators through international negotiation , i.e. , not by legislation .
But the big banks are chipping away at this entire philosophy daily through their effective lobbying within the opaque Basel process – as one would expect .
The latest indications are that capital requirements will barely be raised in any meaningful sense .
Secretary Geithner likes to say , “ Plan beats no plan ” and in some positive interpretations this is the secret of his success .
But it turns out that he had no plan really – the stress tests were a grand improvisation ( ultimately implying scary sized government implicit guarantees ) , the initial financial reform proposals fizzled ( the Volcker rescue was against Geithner ’s wishes ) , and the much vaunted tightening of capital standards is completely illusory ( does n’t anyone in the White House read the newspapers ? ) .
On top of all this , it now appears that Secretary Geithner will oppose Elizabeth Warren becoming the new chief regulator responsible for protecting consumers from defective financial products – despite the fact that she has led the way for this issue , on both intellectual and political fronts , over the past decade .
The financial sector has abused many of its customers badly over the past decades .
This simply needs to stop .
Throughout the Senate debate on financial reform , Treasury insisted that complex details regarding consumer protected need to be left to regulators – and thus the Geithner team pushed back against many sensible legislative proposals that would have tightened the rules .
Treasury also promised – although in a nonbinding way – that the new generation of regulators would be an order of magnitude more effective that those who eviscerated whatever was left of our oversight system during the Bush years .
With his track record of survival , Geithner and his team apparently feel they can push hard against Elizabeth Warren and give the new consumer protection job to someone closer to their philosophy – which is much more sympathetic to the banking industry .
This would be a bad mistake – trying the patience of already exasperated Congressional Democrats .
If the Obama administration ca n’t even complete the deal they implicitly agreed with Senators over the past months , this will set of a firestorm of protest within the party ( and with anyone else who is paying attention ) .
Financial “ reform ” is already very weak .
If Secretary Geithner gets his way on consumers protection , pretty much all of the Democrats efforts vis -à - vis the financial sector ’s treatment of customers have been for naught .
Tim Geithner is sometimes compared to Talleyrand , the French statesman who served the Revolution , Napoleon , and the restored Bourbons – opportunistic and distrusted , but often useful and a great survivor with a brilliant personal career .
In the end , of course , no one – including Talleyrand – proves indispensible .
And everyone of this sort eventually pushes their luck too far .
If the Democratic leadership really wants to win in the November elections , they should think very hard about the further consequences of Mr. Geithner .

Japan 's new prime minister , Naoto Kan , today warned that the country risked being sucked into a Greek - style debt crisis unless it quickly reined in its massive public debt .
Kan , who took over last week after the sudden resignation of Yukio Hatoyama , told MPs that Japan risked defaulting if it continued to issue bonds at the current pace .
" Our country 's outstanding public debt is huge , " he said in his first policy speech to parliament .
" Our public finances have become the worst of any developed country .
" We can not sustain public finance that overly relies on issuing bonds .
As we can see from the eurozone confusion that started in Greece , there is a risk of default if growing public debt is neglected and trust lost in the bond market . "
Japan 's public debt stood at 218 % of gross domestic product last year , according to the International Monetary Fund – the highest in the industrialised world .
Kan said the debt problem could not be dealt with overnight .
" That is why we need to have a drastic reform from now in order to obtain fiscal health . "
His prospects for honouring a commitment to devise a tighter fiscal plan by the end of the month improved today after Shizuka Kamei resigned as financial services minister over a disagreement with cabinet colleagues on post office privatization .
Kamei , who leads a junior coalition partner , had advocated big spending to drag the world 's second - largest economy into sustained recovery and fend off long - term deflation .
But other obstacles , including a looming election , remain to the sweeping fiscal reforms envisaged by Kan , who in his last job as finance minister criticised the Bank of Japan for doing too little to encourage lending , even after it lowered interest rates to near zero .
Kan may be able to gain a mandate for reform if his Democratic party performs well at upper house elections next month , giving them an outright majority in both houses .
Support for the Democrats has leaped since Kan 's election , from below 20 % before he took office to almost 70 % this week .
Analysts accused Kan of overplaying Japan 's susceptibility to a Greek - style meltdown .
" Greece had a huge public debt and huge overseas loans , " said Hiromichi Shirakawa , chief economist at Credit Suisse Japan .
" Japan has a trade surplus , and it's a major creditor nation .
I do n't think Japan 's fiscal condition is facing a similar crisis . "
The government 's plan to tackle mid-term debt is expected to include a ¥ 44.3 trillion ( £ 330 bn ) cap on government bond issuance through to the end of March 2012 .
Fiscal reformers in the government appear to have succeeded in including a reference to tax reform in the ruling party 's manifesto for the upper house elections , although it is likely to stop short of suggesting a rise in the consumption tax , currently 5 % , to pay for rising health and welfare costs .
Kan has been one of the few politicians to talk publicly about the need to raise the tax , an unpopular move but one that many voters now accept is inevitable .
Economists have warned , however , that the government will have to abandon some of its spending plans if it is to stand a chance of reining in debt .
In a little - noticed provision in a 1990 law passed after the Exxon Valdez spill , Congress capped a spiller ’s liability over and above cleanup costs at $ 75 million for a rig spill .
Even if the economic damages — to tourism , fishing and the like — stretch into the billions , the responsible party is on the hook for only $ 75 million .
( In this instance , BP has agreed to waive the cap for claims it deems legitimate . )
Michael Greenstone , an M.I.T. economist who runs the Hamilton Project in Washington , says the law fundamentally distorts a company ’s decision making .
Without the cap , executives would have to weigh the possible revenue from a well against the cost of drilling there and the risk of damage .
With the cap , they can largely ignore the potential damage beyond cleanup costs .
So they end up drilling wells even in places where the damage can be horrific , like close to a shoreline .
To put it another way , human frailty helped BP ’s executives underestimate the chance of a low - probability , high - cost event .
Federal law helped them underestimate the costs .
In the wake of Deepwater Horizon , Congress and the Obama administration will no doubt be tempted to pass laws meant to reduce the risks of another deep - water disaster .
Certainly there are some sensible steps they can take , like lifting the liability cap and freeing regulators from the sway of industry .
But it would be foolish to think that the only risks we are still underestimating are the ones that have suddenly become salient .
The big financial risk is no longer a housing bubble .
Instead , it may be the huge deficits that the growth of Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security will cause in coming years — and the possibility that lenders will eventually become nervous about extending credit to Washington .
True , some economists and policy makers insist the country should not get worked up about this possibility , because lenders have never soured on the United States government before and show no signs of doing so now .
But is n’t that reminiscent of the old Bernanke - Greenspan tune about the housing market ?
Then , of course , there are the greenhouse gases that oil wells ( among other things ) send into the atmosphere even when the wells function properly .
Scientists say the buildup of these gases is already likely to warm the planet by at least three degrees over the next century and cause droughts , storms and more ice - cap melting .
The researchers ’ estimates have risen recently , too , and it is also possible the planet could get around 12 degrees hotter .
That kind of warming could flood major cities and cause parts of Antarctica to collapse .
Nothing like that has ever happened before .
Even imagining it is difficult .
It is much easier to hope that the odds of such an outcome are vanishingly small .
In fact , it ’s only natural to have this hope .
But that does n’t make it wise .
Players should not be exempt from ethical criticism for what they do on the field , any more than they are exempt from ethical criticism for cheating off the field – for example , by taking performance - enhancing drugs .
Yet , in soccer , ethical rules do n't seem to apply .

Conservative leader David Cameron has become the UK's new prime minister after the resignation of Gordon Brown .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg will be his deputy after they agreed to the UK 's first coalition government in 70 years .
Mr Cameron , who at 43 is the youngest PM in nearly 200 years , vowed to set aside party differences and govern " in the national interest " .
Mr Clegg said he acknowledged some Lib Dem voters would have doubts about the deal but urged them to " keep faith " .
Mr Cameron 's party won the most seats in the general election last week , but not enough to secure an overall Commons majority , resulting in a hung Parliament .
' Unique opportunity '
Following hours of talks with the Conservatives on Tuesday , the Lib Dem parliamentary party and its federal executive endorsed the coalition agreement by the required three - quarters majority at a meeting that broke up just after midnight .
Speaking minutes later , Mr Clegg said : " I hope this is the start of the new politics I have always believed in - diverse , plural , where politicians of different persuasions come together , overcome their differences in order to deliver good government for the sake of the whole country . "
He acknowledged there would be problems and " glitches " and , in a message to Lib Dem voters , he added : " I can imagine this evening you 'll be having many questions , maybe many doubts , about this new governing arrangement .
" But I want to assure you that I would n't have entered into this agreement unless I was genuinely convinced that it offers a unique opportunity to deliver the kind of changes you and I believe in .

Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Vince Cable has been given responsibility for " business and banks " but it is not known if his title will be chief secretary to the Treasury , a senior Lib Dem source said .
A Downing Street spokesman said it had been agreed that five cabinet posts would be filled by Liberal Democrats , including the appointment of Mr Clegg , although there are expected to be about 20 Lib Dems in government jobs in total .

The David Cameron story Analysis : Now for the hard part Q&A : Tory - Lib Dem alliance Full text : Cameron becomes PM
Send us your comments Mr Cameron 's arrival in Downing Street marks the end of 13 years of Labour rule .
The coalition is also the first Liberal Democrat and Conservative power - sharing deal at Westminster in history .
Mr Cameron , who is six months younger than Tony Blair was when he entered Downing Street in 1997 , is the youngest prime minister since 1812 and the first Old Etonian to hold the office since the early 1960s .
Barack Obama was the first foreign leader to congratulate Mr Cameron in a brief telephone call during which the US president invited the new prime minister to visit Washington in the summer , Downing Street said .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also offered her congratulations and invited Mr Cameron to visit Berlin .
I came into politics because I love this country , I think its best days still lie ahead
David Cameron
Brown resigns as prime minister Gordon Brown 's rise and fall
In a speech outside his new Downing Street home , after travelling to Buckingham Palace to formally accept the Queen 's request to form the next government , Mr Cameron paid tribute to outgoing Prime Minister Gordon Brown for his long years of public service .
He also pledged to tackle Britain 's " pressing problems " - the deficit , social problems and to " rebuild trust in our political system " .
He said he aimed to " help build a more responsible society here in Britain ... those who can should and those who can't , we will always help .
I want to make sure that my government always looks after the elderly , the frail , the poorest in our country .
" We must take everyone through with us on some of the difficult decisions we have ahead .
" I came into politics because I love this country , I think its best days still lie ahead and I believe deeply in public service .
" I think the service our country needs right now is to face up to our big challenges , to confront our problems , take difficult decisions , lead people through those decisions , so that together we can reach better times ahead . "
Emotional statement The Conservatives had been in days of negotiations with the Lib Dems - who also negotiated with Labour - after last Thursday 's UK election .
Earlier the Lib Dems said talks with Labour had failed because " the Labour Party never took seriously the prospects of forming a progressive , reforming government " .
A spokesman said key members of the Labour team " gave every impression of wanting the process to fail " and the party had made " no attempt at all " to agree a common approach on issues like schools funding and tax reform .

" Certain key Labour cabinet ministers were determined to undermine any agreement by holding out on policy issues and suggesting that Labour would not deliver on proportional representation and might not marshal the votes to secure even the most modest form of electoral reform , " he said .
Labour 's Lord Mandelson told the BBC they had been " up for " a deal , but the Lib Dems had " created so many barriers and obstacles that perhaps they thought their interests lay on the Tory side , on the Conservative side , rather than the progressive side " .
After it became clear the talks had failed , Mr Brown tendered his resignation and said he wished the next prime minister well .
In an emotional resignation statement in Downing Street , Mr Brown thanked his staff , his wife Sarah and their children , who joined the couple as they left for Buckingham Palace .
Mr Brown said it had been " a privilege to serve " adding : " I loved the job not for its prestige , its titles and its ceremony - which I do not love at all .
No , I loved the job for its potential to make this country I love fairer , more tolerant , more green , more democratic , more prosperous and more just - truly a greater Britain . "
He also paid tribute to the courage of the armed forces , adding : " I will never forget all those who have died in honour and whose families today live in grief . "
Later he thanked Labour activists and MPs for all their efforts and told them Labour 's general election performance was " my fault , and my fault alone " .
Mr Brown had announced on Monday that he would step down as Labour leader by September .

I have been posting a lot of progress report updates and other Linux Mint KDE related information / questions to the forums in the past but that limits Linux Mint KDE ’s exposure potential feedback .
From now on I will be posting to the Linux Mint blog to gather more support and feedback for Mint KDE .
Look here for the old forum progress report for Isadora KDE .
I have uploaded my Linux Mint KDE dev-022 ISO for testing by exploder , Clem and the other mint developers .
Exploder ’s testing has been positive so far .
Clem had done some heavy / detailed testing on the last development ISO and caught some final bugs that really tidy things up for a clean RC release .
Hopefully the RC of Linux Mint 9 KDE will be so good it will also be the final ISO .
Hang in there Linux Mint KDE fans the wait will soon be over …

PARKER , Ariz . —
He still tells the story about the call he got at 2 a.m. from the woman in Chandler who was upset about changes in her garbage pick up , and the ossified joke concerning two Irish brothers ( “ The only ethnic group in America you can still joke about ” ) boozed up at a bar .
Just as he did in 2008 , and 2000 , and most likely in the tender years of his earliest campaigns here — long before “ that one , ” maverick , and not - a- maverick — he takes extra time for veterans , freshly scrubbed little kids and older women who wait patiently at the back of a senior center with one of his many books and a camera .
He still calls the room “ my friends . ”
But less than two years after he was defeated by Barack Obama , nothing seems quite the same for Senator John McCain , who has gone from being his party ’s candidate for president rallying 1,000 supporters at a Florida football stadium to furiously defending his Senate seat before 60 recession - weary residents in a Hampton Inn in Lake Havasu , Ariz .
Gone are the jovial back - and - forths with veteran biker dudes at state fairs , long bus rides through South Carolina watching the U.S. Open with Senator Lindsey Graham and visions of party dominance in Washington .
Gone are his efforts to engage Mr. Obama directly ; instead , he portrays himself as taking on the status quo of Mr. Obama ’s Washington .
Conservative parties in virtually all western democracies have shifted to the right economically , and the Australian Liberal Party is no exception .
However , in most countries a new generation of conservative leaders display eagerness to adopt more socially liberal policies in tandem with full - throttle free market ( ie right wing ) economics .
In the case of Tony Abbott ’s Liberals , however , the party has not only moved right of the earlier Turnbull leadership years , but it has also shifted to a more authoritarian position on the social scale .
This is a move that will no doubt appeal to the otherwise mostly homeless former supporters of One Nation .
Labor reflects this drift , now occupying a space to the right of the 1980s Liberals .
The debate between the two main parties , however heated , is within narrowing parameters .
The two parties are now closer together than at any other time .
The clash of economic vision of earlier campaigns is absent .
It ’s no longer about whether the prevailing neoliberal orthodoxy is actually desirable , but merely a question of which party can manage it best .
By contrast , the Greens , once pretty much a single issue party , have emerged with a comprehensive social democratic manifesto , more in tune with an earlier Labor Party , and significantly more socially liberal than either of the others .
Hot blobs of magma — the searing liquid rock beneath the Earth 's crust — can spread slow - moving ripples that soar hundreds of meters high across the Earth 's surface , a new study suggests .
This phenomenon , which works on geologic time scales , may explain relatively rapid pre-historical changes in sea level that occurred without the typical waxing and waning of the polar ice sheets , which hold and release water on scales of thousands and millions of years .
This unexplained sea level rise is one of geology 's oldest mysteries .
During the Paleogene era ( 65 million to 23 million years ago ) , the land under Scotland moved up and down like a geological yo - yo .
The surface rippled up to 1,640 feet ( 500 meters ) over the course of only a million years — a relatively short time span , geologically - speaking .
" It appears to be caused by something deep within the Earth , moving sideways — almost like rats running underneath a carpet , " said study author Bryan Lovell of the University of Cambridge .
The sideways movement is actually caused by what 's known as convection currents in the mantle .
These currents are created when the cooler , denser material in the mantle sinks and the warmer , less dense material rises .
" The hot blob would have spread out from the center of the hot spot rather like a doughnut , " Lovell said .
A magma hot spot beneath Iceland , known as the Iceland plume , which is responsible for the European island 's volcanic activity , could be behind this movement .
Data from oil exploration near the Iceland magma plume has revealed that a blob in the Earth 's flowing mantle caused a pulse beneath the North Atlantic about 55 million years ago .
This pulse raised and lowered the land surface and the sea floor in a rippling effect
Although scientists were confident that hot blobs exist in the mantle , evidence for the ripples at the Earth 's surface have been hard to spot .
While the Scotland uplift is the only example of the hot blob effect , Lovell said the movement is a natural effect of mantle convection , so there 's no reason to think it is n't happening all the time , even now .
" I 'm delighted that we have what appears to be a decent geophysical explanation for such a longstanding and significant geological problem , " Lovell said .
" I hope we 'll be able to collect more observations from the geological record that will explain otherwise cryptic features of the Earth 's mantle . "
The study was detailed in the June 25 edition of the Journal of the Geological Society .

Homeland Security Works For Disney Now ?
Announces Shut Down Of Movie Sites At Disney
from the civil - vs.- criminal ?
dept
The head of ICE [ Immigration and Customs Enforcement ] , John Morton , says that the number of illegal movie sites is dramatically rising both in the U.S. and abroad , and organized crime is behind some of them .
ICE is putting movie piracy front and center in this new initiative , by making its first actions to protect the movie studios ' intellectual property .

Well , here we go .
Remember how , a few months back , we noted how odd it was that the Justice Department ( which , of course , employs many former RIAA / MPAA / BSA lawyers ) was designating a special task force to fight copyright infringement ?
After all , copyright infringement is mostly a civil issue , between two private parties .
For years , however , the entertainment industry has been working hard to convince the government to act as its own private police force , and following a totally one - sided " summit " with Joe Biden ( who recently claimed that infringement is no different than doing a smash and grab at Tiffany 's ) , suddenly the feds had a special IP task force ... at the same time that it was downgrading the priority of crimes that cause , such as identity fraud Now , it looks like law enforcement is n't even trying to hide the fact that they 're taking orders from Hollywood .
Dark Helmet points us to the news that Homeland Security proudly announced raids on nine different movie sites , which they accuse of infringing on copyrights .
But what 's most interesting is where the announcements about these raids happened : .
And who else was there on stage ?
Execs from other studios .
Yup , Homeland Security is n't even trying to make the slightest effort to hide the fact that it now works for corporate interests .
It will announce legal activity from the companies , which stand to benefit the most from such activity .
Imagine if the FTC announced plans to charge Google with antitrust from Microsoft 's offices ?
With execs from Yahoo and Apple on stage .
Would n't people cry foul ?
Not only that , but the guy in charge of the raids blatantly admits that it's now ato protect movie studio interests :
What doeshave to do with a domestic dispute over civil copyright infringement ?
And why are Homeland Security officials so closely involved with a few Hollywood Studios that they 're not just protecting their business models , but also announcing these efforts from the studios ' own offices ?
I do n't know anything about these sites that were shut down .
I 've never heard of any of them , but they 're nine out of hundreds , if not thousands .
It wo n't do anything to actually help Disney or these other studios .
Users will quickly shift elsewhere .
The content will still get released just as quickly .
The claims that these sites were run by " organized crime " could very well be true , but I 'd like to see some actual evidence on that .
It 's a common refrain from the industry , but no actual proof has been presented .
At best they 've shown that some DVD counterfeiting operations have some mob ties , but that 's not the same thing .
Note that in the announcement no actual evidence of organized crime links were provided .
In a separate article , US Attorney Preet Bharara is quoted as saying that the government took these actions because " copyright infringement translates into lost jobs . "
Never mind the fact that the GAO just pointed out that such claims are highly questionable the ones from the MPAA -- who wo n't provide their methodology ) , this raises a really serious question about government interference into private markets .
It never has been .
Otherwise it would have " raided " car companies for making horse buggies obsolete .
Using that as justification has no legal basis whatsoever , and is really a very disturbing claim .
The whole thing appears to be a gross misuse of government resources to protect a few movie studios , which are unwilling to adapt to a changing market place .
People should be outraged over such a misuse of government powers , but because these are " pirate " sites , everyone will look the other way .

i Phone Grid System
Tuesday , June 01 , 2010 { 11 Comments }
Responses to “ iPhone Grid System ”
Like a many developers and designers I was tempted to start building application for iPhone and for mobile devices in general .
Beside the problem of choosing the programming language native Objective - C or Javascript + HTML5 was the problem of creating design environment for more easily pre application development and prototyping .
I ’m a fan of the grid design .
Grids can help you understand the design space better , and they usually bring order and the balance to the design process and there are great help in the prototyping stage .
I was inspired with the Massimo Vignelli ’s Unigrid System and I wanted to the similar thing with the iPhone .
So the problem was how to organize the 480px X 320 px iPhone working space .
I decided to build 12:8 ( 480:320 ) Modular Grid System with the unit of 40px and the gutter of 5 px .
I think that 12:8 grid system is a right balance for the iPhone , 24:16 will be probably too much and 6:4 too little .
For the calculating the gutter I first divided 320/8 = 40 and than 40/8 = 5 px .
For the gutter there is no right and wrong size it all depends what the grid will hold and what you want to achieve with the grid .
So please feel free to change the gutter size or not to use it .
I made three version of the grid the first the grid only the second the grid and the iPhone frame and the last version The Grid + iPhone Frame +
Notes with bought .PNG and photoshop .
PSD files .. PSD iPhone Template can be easily personalized , feel free to change anything .
I hope that this grid system can help you in your next iPhone application or site development .
If you want to learn more about the Grid Design this site is great place to start The Grid System Any comments ?
P.S
If you are fan of paper prototyping you one of my previous post useful Sketchbook for web designers
After Jack Backus , an Oakland cyclist , sped down a hill in Joaquin Miller Park recently , he raced home to upload information about the ride to a Web site called Strava .
Once Mr. Backus ’s GPS had sent statistics to the site , he could see his average speed and compare his performance to others on the same stretch .
Mr. Backus , an architect , is one of scores of bicyclists in the Bay Area who are flocking to Strava , a virtual cycling club started in April 2009 .
It lets members record their rides , create routes using computerized maps and ride in virtual competitions .
“ It ’s kind of an interesting way to connect with other cyclists and to have a little bit of a competitive thing going , ” Mr. Backus said .

A chat with Dileep Rao , Dileep Rao interview , Inception , Avatar , Drag Me To Hell
Interviews Home / TV Home / Bullz - Eye Home
When we last left our old friend Dileep Rao , he was just coming off the success of his role as the beard - rific Rham Jas in Sam Raimi ’s “ Drag Me To Hell , ” desperately dancing around telling me too much about his work as Dr. Max Patel in the then - still - upcoming “ Avatar , ” and unabashedly avoiding revealing what film he was about to begin .
That film , as we now know , was Christopher Nolan ’s “ Inception . ”
Seriously , how many actors have that kind of run with their first three motion pictures ?
Clearly , Dileep Rao is awesome … and if you doubt this , then consider that , as the release date of “ Inception ” became imminent , he approached me and asked , “ Hey , are we going to do another interview ? ”
Why , yes .
Yes , we are .
Now if we could just do something about that cell phone reception …
Dileep Rao : Hello , sir !
Bullz - Eye : Hello to you as well , sir !
How are you ?
DR : I ’m really good .
What ’s going on ?
BE : Have you just woken up and found yourself with a post - premiere hangover ?
DR : ( Laughs )
No , I ’m up …and no post - premiere hangover , thank God !
BE : So how was the grand premiere ?
I got the impression from your Facebook status update that it must ’ve been something else .
" Leonardo ( DiCaprio ) … yeah , of course , he ’s one of the greatest fucking actors of our generation , and he proved it every day at work .
That guy is flat - out awesome .
But , you know , there were people I just went to go see work sometimes , that I did n’t work with that much .
Like , I do n’t have that much direct interaction with Michael Caine , but I went down to see him work .
I ’m , like , ' I know I ’m not supposed to be here right now , but …it ’s Michael Caine ! ' "
DR : It was fucking rad , man .
( Laughs )
It was so cool , dude .
It was a great night , and there was some crazy shit .
After we started eating and having some drinks , sitting around chatting with everybody , the stage parted , and …they ’d had a woman up there singing Edith Piaf songs , because some of her songs are in the movie , but then the curtain parted , and there ’s probably a 20 - piece orchestra up there , and there ’s Johnny Marr on guitar and Hans Zimmer on the keyboard , and they performed selections from the score for something like 25 or 30 minutes .
BE : Holy shit !
DR : ( Laughs ) Yeah !
That ’s what I said !
I ’m , like , “ Holy shit , that ’s Johnny fucking Marr ! ”
So I walk over there , and I ’m shaking his hand and saying , “ You know , your music had a huge influence of me . ”
And he ’s excited to meet me !
He ’s , like , “ Congratulations , the movie ’s so good , ” and I ’m , “ Uh , okay , but you ’re Johnny fucking Marr . ” ( Laughs )
That was totally crazy .
How do you even talk about stuff like this , you know ?
BE : Well , as you know , Jenn and I both loved “ Inception . ”
DR : Yes , clearly , you ’re among the people who like the movie .
( Laughs )
Which is great !
I mean , most people do like it , I think .
Some people are a little … ( Hesitates ) I was hearing last night from some of the journalists who were covering it , “ No , it ’s too smart . ”
I ’m , like , “ Dude , what the fuck kind of definition is that ? ”
It ’s like saying , “ Oh , that girl is too beautiful ! ”
BE : I ’ll go ahead with the obligatory kick - off question : how did you get involved with “ Inception ” in the first place ?
DR : Well , I auditioned .
I was in New York reading a movie that was going to go to Sundance , and they were kind of testing it in a focus group , a bunch of people sitting in a room work - shopping this picture that was going to go to the Sundance Institute to shoot .
And I got word … I mean , I ’d said that I really wanted to be in the next Chris Nolan picture , and I knew he was doing something , but nobody really knew anything about it .
It was so top - secret that I do n’t even think anyone knew that Chris had sold the film at that point !
I tried pitching myself to the casting director , and I was told , “ Look , this is not a film where we want ideas from anybody about who we cast . ” ( Laughs )
But when I was in New York , they called my agent and said they were auditioning for the picture , so I flew myself back , I read for Chris once , and I left .
And I heard … I think it was later that day that I heard from my agent , saying , “ They ’ve cut everyone except you .
Now , they ’re going to go to London to see some people , and then we ’ll know more after that .
So do n’t get your hopes up , but …this is great ! ” I said , “ Cool ! ”
Then I came back and read again , and I got the job .
And then , as you might expect , I freaked out completely .
( Laughs )
BE : Dude , you ’ve got a serious trifecta on your hands : “ Drag Me To Hell , ” “ Avatar , ” and now “ Inception . ”
DR : Dude , it ’s , like , this is the great lesson I think I ’ve learned : for all of the disappointments I ’ve suffered in my life , for all the unfairnesses that have come my way … which were all so myopic , anyway , when you look back at them …
I have been more than fairly compensated .
( Laughs )
BE : Okay , so about the film .
You knew this question was coming , I realize , but as soon as I saw you do this in the movie , I knew I had to ask you about it : how much did you enjoy pushing Joseph Gordon Levitt backwards in his chair ?
DR : ( Laughs )
You know , I ’ve got to say that the funniest part of that is that me and Tom Hardy were cracking up , because Joseph had to keep a straight face and do the stunt , and he ’s impeccably good at it , but we were just having so much fun .
I ’m knocking him over , and Tom ’s sitting there watching me doing it , and the fact that he could n’t participate in the fun of knocking him over somehow made it even funnier to both of us .
We had a real blast doing that .
And I got to slap his face !
And I was , like , “ Okay , this is a movie , not a play , so I ’m going to have to actually slap him . ”
So we just kind of went back and forth , and Chris showed me what he wanted , so I got to slap Joseph a couple of times .
I ’m , like , “ Dude , are you okay ? ” “ Yeah , of course I am . ” “ All right , just wanted to make sure . ” ( Laughs )
BE : By the way , I thought it was great that the rainy conditions in one of the dreams only came about because you had to pee .
DR : Yeah !
( Laughs )
I think it ’s because I took a quick swig of something before we went under .
I thought that joke was so funny when they put that in there .
That ’s kind of Chris ’s humor .
It ’s , like , “ Look , let ’s actually play this out , and let ’s go see what would happen . ”
And it was hilarious when we saw it put together .
BE : So tell me the saga of shooting the van sequence .
I ’ve heard it took a month of work , off and on , to finish it all .
On the " Inception " premiere : " The curtain parted , and there ’s probably a 20 - piece orchestra up there , and there ’s Johnny Marr on guitar and Hans Zimmer on the keyboard , and they performed selections from the score for something like 25 or 30 minutes .
So I walk over there , and I ’m shaking ( Johnny Marr's ) hand and saying , ' You know , your music had a huge influence of me . '
And he ’s excited to meet me !
He ’s , like , ' Congratulations , the movie ’s so good , ' and I ’m , ' Uh , okay , but you ’re Johnny fucking Marr ! ' "
DR : Yeah , man , it was one of those things where …
I could n’t believe how many times we walked in , and it was , like , “ We ’re going to the van , ” or , “ We ’re back in the van , ” or , “ I believe we ’re doing the van again . ” ( Laughs )
There were something like 11 vans .
I ’m not kidding .
Okay , maybe it was nine vans .
But they each had different things : some with different glass , some with these huge rigs on them so they could rain over the van , shoot on the van , light the van , shoot the interior and exterior .
One had this crazy motorcycle rig on it , where I knock the motorcyclist with the shotgun off .
I mean , this sequence went on and on and on .
( Laughs )
And I never realized how involved it was going to be , because in the description in the script , it ’s , like , “ Okay , this makes sense , we ’ll shoot this thing , it ’ll take a week , maybe two , and I ’ll be driving around … ”
But we just kept going back to it .
We had the sequence down by the bridge , and , y’know , a lot of the movie was about that .
We spent two weeks , I think , down in San Pedro , shooting on this amazing rising bridge , and it was beautiful .
But , you know , we ’re raining every day , the light would need to change , and Chris would change it .
He ’s such a genius .
But I just could n’t believe the number of days it took to do it .
It was crazy .
There were days where …well , there was one really weird day where it was me , Leonardo DiCaprio , Tom Hardy , Joseph Gordon Levitt , Ellen Page , Cillan Murphy , and Ken Watanabe , with me driving .
Literally , me driving them .
Chris Nolan ’s there , and , basically , we ’re just driving around for the bulk of the day .
It was like camp , actually .
( Laughs )
It was kind of fun , and it really underlined what a special experience it was and what a cool group it was .
BE : So I ca n’t remember : did you get to work with Tom Berenger at all ?
DR : A little bit , yeah .
I think we shot at least two days .
Maybe two or three days .
BE : I could n’t believe he was in there .
I saw him , and I was n’t expecting it , so I ’m , like , “ Holy crap , it ’s Tom Berenger ! ” ( Laughs )
DR : Yeah , I think Chris has really been a fan of his for a long time .
I think when he gets someone like that …it ’s like how he had Eric Roberts in “ The Dark Knight . ”
He ’s , like , “ Look , I really like this guy , let ’s see if he wants to be in that . ”
And , of course , if that actor has any kind of sense , he says , “ Absolutely , yes ! ” ( Laughs ) Tom ’s a very good actor , and he ’s obviously been one for a long time , so I do n’t think it ’s any kind of stretch that Chris would want to use him .
BE : Absolutely not .
So how much of the stunt driving of the van did you yourself end up doing ?
DR : Uh , you know , more than I thought I was going to do .
( Laughs ) I was just kind of , like , “ Okay , whatever , ” and …of course , I had these great doubles who all had my wig on .
One was Greek - British , and one guy was Arab , I think .
There were so many different guys who looked like me who were all stunt dudes , and they handled all the heavy lifting , like , when the vehicle was out of control at high speeds or did a roll or something .
But I had to do all of that stuff on the bridge at high speeds , with the camera coming by my face .
That was me .
I was n’t CGI ’ed or anything , that was actually me .
I had to do all of the stuff where the van is speeding through traffic .
I had to kind of drive up these causeways and stuff and down the bridges .
Sometimes the rain was coming down so thick that I was , like , “ I am so glad there ’s no traffic , because I ca n’t see anything ! ” ( Laughs )
And I had to repeat stuff , as far as driving in a loop and shooting the same piece over and over again .
We did that a lot .
First , though , I had to pass a test .
They were , like , “ Uh , you know , first let ’s see if you can actually drive ! ”
So I did that , and then they trusted me to do my part .
But the dangerous stuff … that was n’t me .
I mean , no one wants to die , right ?
BE : So what you ’re saying is that you yourself did not actually drive the van off the bridge .
DR : ( Laughs )
That is correct .
They actually shot the van out of a cannon , from what I understand …or what I remember .
They shot it directly out of this massive cannon , straight into the air at a very high speed , and then , of course , they had to run it back at that super slow motion rate .
And I love that sequence , but …it ’s going down for , like , the better part of 20 minutes .
( Laughs )
It ’s kind of amazing .
BE : The shot with all of you guys standing in the middle of an empty street : real or special effects ?
DR : Real .
It was at 7th and Hope in downtown Los Angeles .
Traffic was shut down for , like , three or four blocks around us .
And it was one of those moments where you ’re , like , “ Only in a movie would you ever get to experience something like this . ”
BE : You actually got several really big laughs during the course of the movie .
I think my favorite , though , was when you performed your kick - ass driving maneuvers , whipped around excitedly as if to say “ Did you see that ? ” and then realized , “ Oh , right , everybody ’s asleep . ”
DR : The funny thing about that …
( At this moment , Dileep ’s cell phone reception suddenly crapped out on him…or , at least , it did as far my being able to hear him .
He could clearly hear me , though , because when I said , “ I ’m losing you , ” he rearranged himself to find a better signal . )
BE : Okay , so what was the funny thing ?
DR : The funny thing … ( Laughs ) … was that it was n’t indicated in the script , if I ’m remembering correctly , that I actually did anything .
I was just thinking , “ I feel like he should react somehow afterward , ” and Chris said , “ I think maybe you should do something kind of funny here . ”
And I ’m , like , “ Yeah ! ”
So right after that , he said , “ Roll it ! ”
So I just came up with something on the fly , and after he yelled , “ Cut , ” I looked over at him , and he was nodding happily , so I was just , like , “ Okay ! ” I think he knew that it was going to work if I did something funny .
I think we only did maybe one other take , and that was it … which was very much a one - off kind of think , so that was cool .
But I remember the morning we shot that , because it was so funny .
They ’d been rolling the van …without me , obviously , because I was in my trailer … for hours and hours and hours , and then I came up , and they rocked the thing with me in it , lit it , and shot it .
It was , like , done and over faster than you can even think .
I was , like , “ Wow … ” But it was really great .
BE : I made the comment to you about the comparisons between you and John Cazale .
Obviously , I was joking , but not entirely .
You really do have an incredible run going .
Are people actively pitching you stuff and you ’re just being selective ?
DR : I ’m being selective .
I 'm getting scripts , but they 're not the stuff I want to be doing .
There 's all kinds of silliness that 's out there , and I 'm just waiting for the few bits of quality .
It takes patience to sift through the unappealing to get to the exciting , well - thought - through , well - written work , so in proportion , I 'm trying to wade through what 's come my way , and what 's left that 's good is n't very much .
But just like with Jim , with Sam ( Raimi ) , and with Chris , the good stuff is out there , and it will reach out to me .
I have that faith .
But I ’ll tell you the truth : you do n’t want to sit around thinking , “ Stuff should be coming to me now , ” because all that ’s going to lead to is disappointment … and I do n’t want to disappoint myself , y’know ?
( Laughs )
So I ’m just trying to take it a day at a time , seeing what ’s out there that ’s worth doing , and if it ’s worth doing , then I certainly want to be considered .
And I 'm sure that , as time goes by , people will start reaching out a little bit more .
I 'm sure that 'll happen .
All in due time , sir .
( Laughs )
BE : Okay , since it has to be asked , I ’ll ask it : what do you hear about an “ Avatar ” sequel ?
DR : ( Unintelligible )
BE : Dude , I ’m losing you again .
DR : ( Finds a spot with a better signal ) Jesus !
What the fuck , man ?
It ’s not like I ’m in some weird area .
I ’m not in Podunk , Iowa .
I ’m in Los Angeles ! ( Laughs )
As far as an “ Avatar ” sequel , I basically know what you know .
Well , not exactly .
I may know a little bit more .
As far as I know , Jim ( Cameron ) has n’t written it , but he will , and we ’ll start work on it at some point .
But , you know , I ’m just going to let him do his thing , and when he ’s ready to make it , we ’ll reconvene and start the whole thing again .
I do n’t doubt that we ’re going to do one .
In fact , I have a very strong feeling that we are going to do one .
But any more than that , I have zero idea .
BE : I must tell you that , at the end of the movie , Jenn and I turned to each other , and we ’re , like , “ If there ’s a sequel , Dileep ’s gonna be in it ! ”
DR : ( Laughs )
You know , he told me that when we were shooting it , and I was , like , “ Cool , man ! ” But , I mean , I was so blown away while we were making it , I was just kind of , “ There ’s going to be another one … ? ”
But now I see that he …as usual , as always …was 100 % right .
BE : And not to give anything away , but one could argue that , should Chris choose to do one , the potential is certainly there for an “ Inception ” sequel as well … although , with that said , it ends so perfectly that I ’d almost rather than it ’s a closed - ended story .
DR : Yeah , I almost feel like that would make the movie…well , actually , knowing Chris , he ’d find some ingenious , brilliant way to capitalize even on that .
But I do n’t know that Chris wants to do another one of these , at least not in this exact universe .
He likes it a lot , obviously , he has really good taste about that kind of stuff , so he might leave well enough alone .
But , then again , he ’s also a guy who , when he comes up with a good idea , wants to see it out .
So if he came up with something , then maybe .
I mean , I would love to do it just to work with everyone again .
It was really a lot of fun .
But I do n’t know .
I would n’t hold my breath on that .
BE : By the way , I did n’t mention it earlier , but I really dug the whole putting - the - team - together aspect of the film .
DR : Yeah , and it ’s also a pleasure when the team ’s as strong as that one !
BE : Who was the person who you were most excited to be able to work with ?
DR : You know , the answer I have for that , actually , is everybody .
But Leonardo … yeah , of course , he ’s one of the greatest fucking actors of our generation , and he proved it every day at work .
( Laughs )
That guy is flat - out awesome .
But , you know , there were people I just went to go see work sometimes , that I did n’t work with that much .
Like , I do n’t have that much direct interaction with Michael Caine , but I went down to see him work .
I ’m , like , “ I know I ’m not supposed to be here right now , but …it ’s Michael Caine ! ” ( Laughs )
BE : Were you actually in any scenes with him ?
DR : Well , we were shooting the same sequence , at least .
In the airport , we were together when we shot that , so that was really , really cool .
I mean , he ’s just a fucking legend , as you know .
He ’s the real deal and a big , big deal .
I just really enjoyed working on the same picture as him .
BE : Now , I think we touched on this the last time I interviewed you , but …I still think it ’s nuts that you were on all of two TV episodes , and then suddenly you ’re in these three massive movies .
What were you doing between those episodes and working on the films ?
Were you doing theaters , or were you just going to auditions ?
DR : Well , you know , the funny thing about those TV appearances is that I ’d only done one of them ( Fox ’s “ Standoff ” ) before I made my first two pictures … and I only had one line !
( Laughs )
So it really was n’t much of an experience , except that I can say that I ’ve done it and know what it ’s like .
But it was kind of , like , “ Okay , that was one day ’s work . ”
Strangely , though , I still get the tiniest , most ridiculously small residuals from that one line , which is hilarious to me .
( Laughs )
And then I did a day on “ Brothers and Sisters , ” which was really fun .
But I think that , from my experience , the movie thing was more right for me , because it ’s more like plays .
Yeah , I ’ve been doing theater my entire adult life , and I ’m a dedicated theater guy .
In fact , I ’m going to be doing a play at the end of this month .
I ’m going to New York City for two months to do a play .
So it ’s not new to me to do theater .
I love theater .
And moviemaking , to me , is closer to doing plays than television is .
Obviously , part of that is because movies are more verbal , but I also like the purposeful process of making movies .
You make a set , you use it , that ’s it .
( Pauses )
You still there ?
BE : ( Laughs ) Yeah , but your senses were on target : you were just starting to fade out again at the end of your answer .
DR : ( Laughs )
You ’re , like , “ Oh , great , the guy ’s gone again … ”
BE : Oh , yeah , I was pissed .
I ’m sitting here going , “ Goddammit , this son of a bitch has been in three big movies and he can’t even get decent cell phone reception … ”
DR : I know , right ?
It ’s , like , what the fuck ?
What can I do ?
There is no act of will that I can perform to make it better or worse .
I am at the fucking behest of AT&T .
BE : “ Dammit , I worked with Cameron !
I worked with Nolan ! ”
DR : Exactly .
“ Ca n’t you get me a fucking phone with decent reception ? ” ( Laughs )
And they ’re , like , “ Our advice is not to live in Santa Monica . ” Amazing .
Thanks a lot for that .
BE : ( Laughs )
Oh , so I saw your interview online with the Hindustan Times …
DR : Yeah !
( At this point , Dileep ’s reception drops to the point where he is completely off the line .
Moments later , he calls back .
He is not pleased . )
DR : Okay , I ’m going to try moving to a completely different part of my house and try sitting somewhere else .
I ’m going to sit by this big window and see what happens .
BE : The signal does sound better .
Well , you know , comparatively speaking , anyway .
DR : ( Laughs ) Compared to me not being there at all ?
I ’m sure it ’s much better !
BE : It ’s better than hearing a fast - busy signal in my ear .
DR : Yeah , I am more pleasant than a busy signal , thank you .
( Laughs )
Uh , what were we just talking about ?
BE : My God , I ’ve lost my train of thought entirely .
Oh , hell , what were we talking about ?
Oh , right , I ’d brought up The Hindustan Times .
So I understand you ’re of a mind to take a crash course in Bollywood …
DR : Yeah , man , because I saw some films when I was a kid and enjoyed them , but I really have n’t seen any since I ’ve been an adult , so I did n’t want to start throwing around favorites .
It ’d be like someone asking you what you think of Hollywood and you saying , “ Well , ‘ Avatar ’ is cool , ” and that ’s it .
And they ’re , like , “ Okay , so , clearly , you do n’t know anything . ” ( Laughs ) I was in danger of that , so I had to be careful .
BE : “ You ’re betraying your heritage , ” that ’s what they ’ll say .
DR : ( Laughs )
That ’s what they ’d say , yeah .
And I ’d say , “ Uh , not really … ”
BE : Is it weird , though , that people see your name and are , like , “ Oh , well , surely he ’s from India ” ?
Well , no , actually , he ’s an American - born dude .
DR : Yeah , but the thing that ’s interesting is how many people from India think that I ’m suddenly going to do Bollywood movies now .
( Laughs ) I ’m , like , “ Uh , I have no such offers and , at the moment , no real concrete interest in that . ”
BE : Plus , my understanding is that you ’d have a bit of a struggle with the language .
DR : Uh , yeah , considering I do n’t speak Hindi , I ’d probably be pretty bad .
I ’d , be , like , “ What ? ” Critics would say , “ His consistently confusing performances in every movie are amazing . ”
BE : “ As he does not speak in his Bollywood films , it ’s remarkable how much Rao can emote with only a grin and a thumbs - up . ”
DR : ( Laughs )
“ He is the go - to mime for Bollywood films . ”
That ’s what my level of achievement will be .
BE : You , sir , are destined to be the Marcel Marceau of Bollywood .
: Exactly .
John Daly has n’t had a top 10 in a major since he won the 1995 British Open .
In fact , he ’s only made the weekend four times at the British Open since beating Costantino Rocca in a playoff .
But Daly will forever be a member of the eclectic British Open champion fraternity , and he ’ll continue to get invited to photo ops like these .
So that ’s Padraig Harrington standing on the left , Daly in the middle and Woods on the right .
Roberto de Vicenzo is sitting on the left , Lee Trevino is frozen there in the middle and Tom Watson is on the right .
Daly ’s one - track mind desperately needs a drink .
Woods is not only sketched out by the technicolor zombie Daly , but also that Watson is sitting directly in front of him .
Maybe Woods could be more uncomfortable if Elin was also raising a 9 - iron above her head .
Maybe .
And then there ’s Harrington , amused at the whole situation , just like the rest of us would be .
Old Tom Morris is rolling over in his grave .

Sergey Nechayev 1869
The Revolutionary Catechism
Source : Russian Anarchism .
Sergey Genadievich Nechayev was a man so feared by the Czar and the aristocrat , ruling classes , he became the Czar ’s special prisoner .
The Czar received weekly special reports on Nechayev ’s prison activities .
Nechayev was born September 20 , 1847 .
He died at age 35 in prison , on December 3 , 1882 – from dropsy complicated by scurvy .
He was convicted for the murder of a fellow student , but his real crimes were political .
He frightened the state because he claimed to head a secret society four million strong .
In truth , it was a small group , maybe a few hundred , mainly of St. Petersburg students .
The trial sentenced him to 20 years in Siberia .
The Czar intervened and ordered him to be retained for the rest of his life .
He was kept in Cell # 1 of the notorious Alexis Ravelin of the Peter and Paul Fortress .
As a human being , he left much to be desired – he lied , cheated , blackmailed , murdered .
Of course , he would defend his actions based on the principles laid out in the following document .
Regardless his personal attributes , he rejected the authority of the state to his dismal end and , for that , gained legendary status in Russia .
The Narodnaya Volya ( People ’s Freedom ) considered using its resources to free him rather than kill the Czar – an offer he rejected , saying the death of the Czar was more important .
( And , indeed , on March 13 , 1881 , Czar Alexander II was assassinated whilst riding through the snowy streets of St. Petersburg . )
Dostoyevsky used Nechayev as the inspiration for his novel , The Possessed .
Nechayev wrote quite a few pamphlets on revolutionary topics .
Probably the most famous and lasting is The Revolutionary Catechism .
The Duties of the Revolutionary toward Himself
1 . The revolutionary is a doomed man .
He has no personal interests , no business affairs , no emotions , no attachments , no property , and no name .
Everything in him is wholly absorbed in the single thought and the single passion for revolution .
2 . The revolutionary knows that in the very depths of his being , not only in words but also in deeds , he has broken all the bonds which tie him to the social order and the civilized world with all its laws , moralities , and customs , and with all its generally accepted conventions .
He is their implacable enemy , and if he continues to live with them it is only in order to destroy them more speedily .
3 . The revolutionary despises all doctrines and refuses to accept the mundane sciences , leaving them for future generations .
He knows only one science : the science of destruction .
For this reason , but only for this reason , he will study mechanics , physics , chemistry , and perhaps medicine .
But all day and all night he studies the vital science of human beings , their characteristics and circumstances , and all the phenomena of the present social order .
The object is perpetually the same : the surest and quickest way of destroying the whole filthy order .
4 . The revolutionary despises public opinion .
He despises and hates the existing social morality in all its manifestations .
For him , morality is everything which contributes to the triumph of the revolution .
Immoral and criminal is everything that stands in its way .
5 . The revolutionary is a dedicated man , merciless toward the State and toward the educated classes ; and he can expect no mercy from them .
Between him and them there exists , declared or concealed , a relentless and irreconcilable war to the death .
He must accustom himself to torture .
6. Tyrannical toward himself , he must be tyrannical toward others .
All the gentle and enervating sentiments of kinship , love , friendship , gratitude , and even honor , must be suppressed in him and give place to the cold and single - minded passion for revolution .
For him , there exists only one pleasure , one consolation , one reward , one satisfaction – the success of the revolution .
Night and day he must have but one thought , one aim – merciless destruction .
Striving cold - bloodedly and indefatigably toward this end , he must be prepared to destroy himself and to destroy with his own hands everything that stands in the path of the revolution .
7 . The nature of the true revolutionary excludes all sentimentality , romanticism , infatuation , and exaltation .
All private hatred and revenge must also be excluded .
Revolutionary passion , practiced at every moment of the day until it becomes a habit , is to be employed with cold calculation .
At all times , and in all places , the revolutionary must obey not his personal impulses , but only those which serve the cause of the revolution .
The Relations of the Revolutionary toward his Comrades
8 . The revolutionary can have no friendship or attachment , except for those who have proved by their actions that they , like him , are dedicated to revolution .
The degree of friendship , devotion and obligation toward such a comrade is determined solely by the degree of his usefulness to the cause of total revolutionary destruction .
9 . It is superfluous to speak of solidarity among revolutionaries .
The whole strength of revolutionary work lies in this .
Comrades who possess the same revolutionary passion and understanding should , as much as possible , deliberate all important matters together and come to unanimous conclusions .
When the plan is finally decided upon , then the revolutionary must rely solely on himself .
In carrying out acts of destruction , each one should act alone , never running to another for advice and assistance , except when these are necessary for the furtherance of the plan .
10 .
All revolutionaries should have under them second - or third - degree revolutionaries – i.e. , comrades who are not completely initiated .
These should be regarded as part of the common revolutionary capital placed at his disposal .
This capital should , of course , be spent as economically as possible in order to derive from it the greatest possible profit .
The real revolutionary should regard himself as capital consecrated to the triumph of the revolution ; however , he may not personally and alone dispose of that capital without the unanimous consent of the fully initiated comrades .
11 . When a comrade is in danger and the question arises whether he should be saved or not saved , the decision must not be arrived at on the basis of sentiment , but solely in the interests of the revolutionary cause .
Therefore , it is necessary to weigh carefully the usefulness of the comrade against the expenditure of revolutionary forces necessary to save him , and the decision must be made accordingly .
The Relations of the Revolutionary toward Society
12 . The new member , having given proof of his loyalty not by words but by deeds , can be received into the society only by the unanimous agreement of all the members .
13 .
The revolutionary enters the world of the State , of the privileged classes , of the so - called civilization , and he lives in this world only for the purpose of bringing about its speedy and total destruction .
He is not a revolutionary if he has any sympathy for this world .
He should not hesitate to destroy any position , any place , or any man in this world .
He must hate everyone and everything in it with an equal hatred .
All the worse for him if he has any relations with parents , friends , or lovers ; he is no longer a revolutionary if he is swayed by these relationships .
14 . Aiming at implacable revolution , the revolutionary may and frequently must live within society while pretending to be completely different from what he really is , for he must penetrate everywhere , into all the higher and middle - classes , into the houses of commerce , the churches , and the palaces of the aristocracy , and into the worlds of the bureaucracy and literature and the military , and also into the Third Division and the Winter Palace of the Czar .
15 .
This filthy social order can be split up into several categories .
The first category comprises those who must be condemned to death without delay .
Comrades should compile a list of those to be condemned according to the relative gravity of their crimes ; and the executions should be carried out according to the prepared order .
16 .
When a list of those who are condemned is made , and the order of execution is prepared , no private sense of outrage should be considered , nor is it necessary to pay attention to the hatred provoked by these people among the comrades or the people .
Hatred and the sense of outrage may even be useful insofar as they incite the masses to revolt .
It is necessary to be guided only by the relative usefulness of these executions for the sake of revolution .
Above all , those who are especially inimical to the revolutionary organization must be destroyed ; their violent and sudden deaths will produce the utmost panic in the government , depriving it of its will to action by removing the cleverest and most energetic supporters .
17 .
The second group comprises those who will be spared for the time being in order that , by a series of monstrous acts , they may drive the people into inevitable revolt .
18 . The third category consists of a great many brutes in high positions , distinguished neither by their cleverness nor their energy , while enjoying riches , influence , power , and high positions by virtue of their rank .
These must be exploited in every possible way ; they must be implicated and embroiled in our affairs , their dirty secrets must be ferreted out , and they must be transformed into slaves .
Their power , influence , and connections , their wealth and their energy , will form an inexhaustible treasure and a precious help in all our undertakings .
19 .
The fourth category comprises ambitious office - holders and liberals of various shades of opinion .
The revolutionary must pretend to collaborate with them , blindly following them , while at the same time , prying out their secrets until they are completely in his power .
They must be so compromised that there is no way out for them , and then they can be used to create disorder in the State .
20 .
The fifth category consists of those doctrinaires , conspirators , and revolutionists who cut a great figure on paper or in their cliques .
They must be constantly driven on to make compromising declarations : as a result , the majority of them will be destroyed , while a minority will become genuine revolutionaries .
21 . The sixth category is especially important : women .
They can be divided into three main groups .
First , those frivolous , thoughtless , and vapid women , whom we shall use as we use the third and fourth category of men .
Second , women who are ardent , capable , and devoted , but whom do not belong to us because they have not yet achieved a passionless and austere revolutionary understanding ; these must be used like the men of the fifth category .
Finally , there are the women who are completely on our side – i.e. , those who are wholly dedicated and who have accepted our program in its entirety .
We should regard these women as the most valuable or our treasures ; without their help , we would never succeed .
The Attitude of the Society toward the People
22 . The Society has no aim other than the complete liberation and happiness of the masses – i.e. , of the people who live by manual labor .
Convinced that their emancipation and the achievement of this happiness can only come about as a result of an all - destroying popular revolt , the Society will use all its resources and energy toward increasing and intensifying the evils and miseries of the people until at last their patience is exhausted and they are driven to a general uprising .
23 .
By a revolution , the Society does not mean an orderly revolt according to the classic western model – a revolt which always stops short of attacking the rights of property and the traditional social systems of so - called civilization and morality .
Until now , such a revolution has always limited itself to the overthrow of one political form in order to replace it by another , thereby attempting to bring about a so - called revolutionary state .
The only form of revolution beneficial to the people is one which destroys the entire State to the roots and exterminated all the state traditions , institutions , and classes in Russia .
24 . With this end in view , the Society therefore refuses to impose any new organization from above .
Any future organization will doubtless work its way through the movement and life of the people ; but this is a matter for future generations to decide .
Our task is terrible , total , universal , and merciless destruction .
25 .
Therefore , in drawing closer to the people , we must above all make common cause with those elements of the masses which , since the foundation of the state of Muscovy , have never ceased to protest , not only in words but in deeds , against everything directly or indirectly connected with the state : against the nobility , the bureaucracy , the clergy , the traders , and the parasitic kulaks .
We must unite with the adventurous tribes of brigands , who are the only genuine revolutionaries in Russia .
26 .
To weld the people into one single unconquerable and all - destructive force – this is our aim , our conspiracy , and our task .

IN the last 20 years or so , pad Thai has gone from being virtually unknown in this country to being a restaurant and takeout staple .
It ’s easy to see why : the tangy , crunchy , slightly sweet noodles are irresistible .
But it ’s difficult to understand why more people do n’t make it at home , since pad Thai is essentially a stir - fry ( in Thailand they refer to it as a Chinese noodle dish ) .
It requires little more than chopping and stirring , and comes together in less than a half - hour .
A couple of components might be unfamiliar to you .
The first are the noodles themselves : rice stick noodles , which are pale , translucent , flat and range from very thin to more than a quarter - inch wide .
Unlike semolina pasta , rice stick noodles do n’t need to be boiled ; instead , you soak them in hot water until they ’re tender .
Meanwhile , make a sauce from tamarind paste , easily found these days .
The paste , made from the pulp of the tamarind pod , is very sour , but more complex than citrus .
Fish sauce ( nam pla ) is another important ingredient ; made from fermented anchovies ( and much like the garum of ancient Rome ) , it has an unappealing smell and a fabulous taste .
Honey and rice vinegar round things out .
Other ingredients are pretty flexible : bean sprouts are usual and cabbage is nice , but other vegetables are perfectly acceptable .
As for protein , shrimp and tofu are the most common combination , but you could also use chicken , or just another egg .
Michigan State coach Tom Izzo says he still has n't decided whether he will leave the Spartans to coach the Cleveland Cavaliers .
Izzo told reporters late Thursday night that " it wo n't go on forever , I can tell you that . "
The coach had just arrived back in East Lansing , Mich. , after traveling to Cleveland on Thursday afternoon with his wife , daughter and son .
Izzo said : " I feel bad that I can't talk .
I feel good that I did what I had to do . "
Izzo is apparently closer to saying yes to the Cavaliers than previously thought , a source told ESPN.com 's Andy Katz on Thursday .
That source discussed Izzo 's future with a close confidant of Izzo 's who is coaching in the NBA .
The source told Katz that Izzo , who talked to his team earlier this week about his interest in the Cavaliers , is leaning toward taking the job if it is offered .
" Three weeks ago that was n't the case , but it has changed , '' the source said .
After flying to Cleveland in one of Cavs owner Dan Gilbert 's jets , Izzo spent several hours visiting with members of the front office and touring the team 's facilities on Thursday .
Izzo , who has been courted by pro teams in the past , is believed to be mulling a contract worth up to $ 6 million a season from the Cavaliers , who fired Mike Brown last month after they lost in the second round of the playoffs to Boston despite having the league 's best regular - season record for the second straight year .
It is not known if Izzo gave the Cavs a decision or a timetable for one .
New Cleveland general manager Chris Grant said the Cavaliers have spoken to a " number " of candidates , but did not divulge any names .
The team has inquired about Milwaukee assistant Kelvin Sampson .
Izzo landed at County Airport in Richmond Heights , Ohio .
His plane , which left East Lansing , Mich. , was diverted there because of the number of TV cameras at Burke Lakefront Airport , the person said .
Gilbert did arrive at Burke , which is a short drive from Quicken Loans Arena , the Cavs ' downtown home .
Mammoths trampled the undergrowth , giant elk stalked the land , and hyenas and sabre - toothed cats took no hostages .
This was normal for Norfolk 800,000 years ago , according to scientists who have found the earliest evidence of human settlement in Britain .
Excavations on a Norfolk beach near the village of Happisburgh have unearthed more than 70 flint tools that had been honed by the first - known prehistoric people to live in Britain .
The stone tools have been dated to between 1 million and 800,000 years old .
Scientists said the flint tools were probably used by these early Britons for cutting meat or piercing animal skins .
Until the discovery of the tools , there was little evidence to suggest that prehistoric humans of this period lived further north than the Alps and the Pyrenees .
No human fossils have yet been uncovered from the site so scientists do not yet know which species of prehistoric human lived there , but they believe the most likely candidate was homo antecessor , or " Pioneer Man " , who was living at about the same time in caves on the Iberian peninsula .
Other fossilised remains from the Norfolk excavations showed that the area was on the edge of a cool , northern " boreal " forest within walking distance of a nearby estuary where the ancient River Thames emptied into the North Sea , many miles further north than the position of the present Thames Estuary .
The land mass , which was still connected to mainland Europe , would have teemed with an array of plants and animals , from tiny voles to giant elk with ten - foot antlers .
" The flood plain would have been dominated by grass , supporting a diverse range of herbivores , such as mammoth , rhino and horses , " said Simon Parfitt of University College London , who was the lead author of the study published in the journal Nature .
" Predators would have included hyenas , sabre - toothed cats and , of course , humans . "
Fossil beetles and pollen suggest the summers were slightly warmer than today but the winters were considerably colder , similar to those of southern Scandinavia now .
This implies that these early Britons were likely to have used fire , clothed themselves in animal skins , and used food stores to see them through winter .
Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London , and director of the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain project , said that the discovery of man-made stone tools in the Happisburgh excavations suggested a much earlier occupation of Britain than previously supposed .
" These finds are by far the earliest known evidence of humans in Britain , dating at least 100,000 years earlier than previous discoveries , " he said .
" They have significant implications for our understanding of early human behaviour , adaptations and survival , as well as when and how our early forebears colonised Europe after their first departure from Africa . "
Whoever made the stone tools , they were not the direct ancestors of present - day Britons .
Professor Stringer said that there were at least nine separate colonisations of Britain over the past 1 million years with the eight previous colonisations dying out with each subsequent ice age .

The head of the Japanese delegation , Yasue Funayama ( R ) , waits on June 21 , 2010 for the opening of the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) meeting in Agadir .
The IWC is to debate catch quotas , which could replace a moratorium .
The 88 - nation body will debate the proposal , put forward by the IWC 's chairmen in an attempt to break a 24 - year deadlock that has nearly wrecked the global whaling regime .
AGADIR , Morocco  Japanese officials and environmentalists traded blame Wednesday as nations failed to reach a deal to curb whale hunts by Japan Norway and Iceland — countries that kill hundreds of whales every year .
The 88 nations of the International Whaling Commission held two days of intense closed - door talks on a proposal to ease the 25 - year - old ban on commercial whaling in exchange for smaller kills by the three countries that claim exemptions to the moratorium on hunting for profit .
About 1,500 animals are killed each year by Japan , Norway and Iceland .
Japan , which kills the majority of whales , insists its hunt is for scientific research — but more whale meat and whale products end up in Japanese restaurants than in laboratories .
A key sticking point appeared to be that the agency declared a whaling sanctuary in 1994 in the Southern Ocean south of Australia , but Japanese ships hunt freely there because the agency has no enforcement powers .
Australia has already launched a complaint against Japanese whaling at the International Court of Justice in The Hague , the U.N. 's highest court .
Acting IWC chairman Anthony Liverpool said in an open meeting Wednesday that " fundamental positions remained very much apart . "
" After nearly three years of discussions , it appears our discussions are at an impasse , " said chief U.S. delegate Monica Medina .
Japanese whaling commissioner Yasue Funayama said her country had offered major concessions to reach a compromise and blamed anti-whaling countries that refused to accept the killing of a single animal .
" We must rise above politics and engage in a broader perspective , " Funayama said .
Anti-whaling countries sought to end Japan 's hunting forays into a southern ocean whaling sanctuary , ban the international trade in whale meat and to set firm quotas for the whaling nations for the next 10 years .
The proposed deal would let Japan kill 400 whales in the southern sanctuary for the next five years , which many countries thought was too high and which Japan saw as a major concession .
Japan set a 2009 quota for itself to kill over 900 whales , but did not reach that figure due to harassment from anti-whaling groups Australia and a group of Latin American countries held firm on zero whaling in the Antarctic ocean , said a delegate from a non-whaling country .
He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media .
Iceland also refused to consider any deal restricting the international sale of whale products , he added .
Environmentalists blamed Japan for the breakdown .
" If Japan had agreed to a phase out in the southern ocean , there would have been a good chance " for a deal , said Wendy Elliott of WWF .
Other conservationists expressed relief that the 25 - year ban on whaling was not lifted .
" Had it been done here , this deal would have lived in infamy , " said Patrick Ramage , of the International Fund for Animal Welfare .
It was unclear if private discussions will continue until the meeting 's scheduled close on Friday .
Many delegations called for a one - year break in efforts .
Formal talks will center on issues like preventing collisions by whales and ships , the effects of climate change and a discussion on a planned Russian oil exploration in the seasonal feeding grounds of the endangered gray whale .
Some environmentalists have accused Japan of vote - buying , using development aid money and personal favors to swing small , poorer nations to its side in the whaling debate .
But the delegate from St. Kitts and Nevis , Daven Joseph , told the media and environment groups to stop such allegations .
" We have been accused of being surrogates .
That is not the case , " he said .
Liverpool , a diplomat from Antigua and Barbuda and its ambassador to Japan , has been quoted by a British paper as admitting that Japanese interests have paid hotel bills for him and says he sees nothing " odd about that . "
The whaling commission was created after World War II to conserve and manage whale stocks .
Tens of thousands of animals were killed each year until 1986 , when the IWC adopted the moratorium .

The Miracle of the Holy Fire in Jerusalem
by Niels Christian Hvidt
" On Holy Saturday believers gather in great crowds in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre .
For on this day fire comes down from Heaven and puts fire on lamps in the Church . "
Thus one reads in one of the many Easter itineraries to the Holy Land .
" The Miracle of the Holy Fire " by Christians from the Orthodox Churches is known as " The greatest of all Christian miracles " .
It takes place every single year , on the same time , in the same manner , and on the same spot .
No other miracle is known to occur so regularly and for such an extensive period of time ; one can read about it in sources as old as from the eighth Century AD .
The miracle happens in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem , to millions of believers the holiest place on earth .
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre itself is an enigmatic place .
Theologians , historians and archaeologists consider the church to contain both Golgatha , the little hill on which Jesus Christ was crucified , as well as the " new tomb " close to Golgatha that received his dead body , as one reads in the Gospels .
It is on this same spot that Christians believe he rose from the dead .
One can trace the miracle throughout the centuries in the many itineraries to the Holy Land .
The Russian abbot Daniel , in his itinerary , written in the years 1106 - 07 , in very detailed manners presents the " Miracle of the Holy Light " and the ceremonies that frame it .
He recalls how the Patriarch goes into the Sepulchre - chapel ( the Anastasis ) with two closed candles .
The Patriarch kneels in front of the stone on which Christ was laid after his death and says certain prayers , upon which the miracle occurs .
Light proceeds from the core of the stone a blue , indefinable light which after some time kindles closed oil lamps as well as the two candles of the Patriarch .
This light is " The Holy Fire " , and it spreads to all people present in the Church .
The ceremony surrounding " The Miracle of the Holy Fire " may be the oldest unbroken Christian ceremony in the world .
From the fourth century AD all the way up to our own time , sources recall the awe - awakening potent .
From these sources it becomes clear that the miracle has been celebrated on the same spot , on the same feast day , and in the same liturgical frames throughout all these centuries .
One can ask , if it would happen also in the year 1998 .
In order to find out , I travelled to Jerusalem to be present at the ceremony in which the Miracle of the Holy Fire occurs , and I can testify that it did not only happen in the ancient Church and throughout the Middle Ages but also on the 18th of April , 1998 .
The Greek - Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem , Diodorus I , is the man who every year enters the tomb to receive the Holy Fire .
He has been the Patriarch of Jerusalem since 1982 and thereby is the key - witness to the miracle .
Prior to the ceremony of this year the Patriarch received us in private audience , where I had the opportunity to speak with him about the miracle in order to know exactly what happens in the tomb and what the miracle means for him personally in his spiritual life .
Furthermore I was through his intervention admitted to the balconies in the dome of the Holy Sepulchre Church , from where I had a fine view over the masses that had gathered around the tomb in anticipation of the " Great Miracle of the Holy Fire " .
But what exactly happens in the Holy Sepulchre Church on Easter Saturday ?
Why does it have such an impact on the Orthodox Tradition ?
Why does it seem as if nobody has heard anything about the miracle in the Protestant and Catholic countries ?
One of the Most Famous Ceremonies in the Orthodox Church
The miracle occurs every year on the Orthodox Easter Saturday .
There are many types of Orthodox Christians : Syrian , Armenian , Russian and Greek Orthodox as well as Copts .
In the Holy Sepulchre Church alone there are 7 different Christian Denominations .
The Orthodox Easter - date is fixed according to the Julian Calendar , and not the usual Western European Gregorian calendar , which means that their Easter normally falls on a different date than the Protestant and Catholic Easter .
Since Constantine the Great built The Holy Sepulchre Church in the middle of the fourth century it has been destroyed many times .
The Crusaders constructed the Church that we see today .
Around Jesus tomb was erected a little chapel with two rooms , one little room in front of the tomb and the tomb itself , which holds no more than five people .
This chapel is the centre of the miraculous events , and being present at the celebration fully justifies the term " event " for on no other day of the year is the Holy Sepulchre Church so packed than on Easter Saturday .
If one wishes to enter it , one has to reckon with six hours of cueing .
Each year hundreds of people are not able to enter due to the crowds .
Pilgrims come from all over the world , the majority from Greece but in recent years increasing numbers from Russia and the former Eastern European Countries .
In order to be as close to the tomb as possible , pilgrims camp around the tomb - chapel , waiting from Holy Friday afternoon in anticipation of the wonder on Holy Saturday .
The miracle happens at 2:00 PM , but already around 11:00 AM the Church is a boiling pot .
Festival
From around 11:00 AM till 1:00 PM the Christian Arabs sing traditional songs with loud voices .
These songs date back to the Turkish occupation of Jerusalem in the 13th Century , a period in which the Christians were not allowed to sing their songs anywhere but in the Churches .
" We are the Christians , this we have been for centuries and this we shall be for ever and ever .
Amen ! " they sing at the top of their voices accompanied by the sound of drums .
The drum - players sit on the shoulders of others who ferociously dance around the Sepulchre Chapel .
But at 1:00 PM the songs fade out and after there is silence , a tense and loaded silence electrified by the anticipation of the great manifestation of the Power of God that all are about to witness .
At 1:00 PM a delegation of the local authorities elbows through the crowds .
Even though these officials are not Christian , they are part of the ceremonies .
In the times of the Turkish occupation of Palestine they were Moslem Turks ; today they are Israelis .
For centuries the presence of these officials has been an integrated part of the ceremony .
Their function is to represent the Romans in the time of Jesus .
The Gospels speak of Romans that went to seal the tomb of Jesus , so his disciples would not steal his body and claim he had risen .
In the same way the Israeli authorities on this Easter Saturday come and seal the tomb with wax .
Before they seal the door it is customary that they enter the tomb to check for any hidden source of fire , which could produce the miracle through fraud .
Just as the Romans were to guarantee that there was no manipulation after the death of Jesus , likewise the Israeli Local Authorities are to guarantee that there be no trickery in 1998 .
The Testimony of the Patriarch
When the tomb has been checked and sealed , the whole Church chants the Kyrie Eleison ( Lord have mercy ) .
At 1:45 PM the Patriarch enters the scene .
In the wake of a large procession he encircles the Tomb three times , whereupon he is stripped of his royal liturgical vestments , carrying only his white alba , a sign of humility in front of the great potent of God , to which he is about to be the key witness .
All the oil lamps have been blown out the preceding night , and now all remains of artificial light are extinguished , so that most of the Church is enveloped in darkness .
With two big candles the patriarch enters the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre first into the small room in front of the tomb and from there into the tomb itself .
It is not possible to follow the events inside the tomb , so I asked the patriarch of Jerusalem , Diodorus , about the center of the events .
" Your Beatitude , what happens when you enter the Holy Sepulchre ? "
" I enter the tomb and kneel in holy fear in front of the place where Christ lay after his death and where he rose again from the dead .
Praying in the Holy Sepulchre in itself is for me always a very holy moment in a very holy place .
It is from here that he rose again in glory , and it is from there that he spread his light to the world .
John the Evangelist writes in the first chapter of his gospel that Jesus is the light of the World .
Kneeling in front of the place where he rose from the dead , we are brought within the immediate closeness of his glorious resurrection .
Catholics and Protestants call this Church " The Church of the Holy Sepulchre " .
We call it " The Church of the Resurrection " .
The Resurrection of Christ for us Orthodox is the center of our faith .
In his resurrection Christ has gained the final victory over death , not just his own death but the death of all those who will stay close to him .
" I believe it to be no coincidence that the Holy Fire comes on exactly this spot .
In Matthew 28:3 , it says that when Christ rose from the dead , an angel came , dressed all in a fearful light .
I believe that the striking light that enveloped the angel at the Lord 's resurrection is the same light that appears miraculously every Easter Saturday .
Christ wants to remind us that his resurrection is a reality and not just a myth ; he really came to the world in order to give the necessary sacrifice through his death and resurrection so that man could be re-united with his creator .
Blue Light
" I find my way through the darkness towards the inner chamber in which I fall on my knees .
Here I say certain prayers that have been handed down to us through the centuries and , having said them , I wait .
Sometimes I may wait a few minutes , but normally the miracle happens immediately after I have said the prayers .
From the core of the very stone on which Jesus lay an indefinable light pours forth .
It usually has a blue tint , but the color may change and take many different hues .
It can not be described in human terms .
The light rises out of the stone as mist may rise out of a lake it almost looks as if the stone is covered by a moist cloud , but it is light .
This light each year behaves differently .
Sometimes it covers just the stone , while other times it gives light to the whole sepulchre , so that people who stand outside the tomb and look into it will see it filled with light .
The light does not burn I have never had my beard burnt in all the sixteen years I have been Patriarch in Jerusalem and have received the Holy Fire .
The light is of a different consistency than normal fire that burns in an oil lamp .
" At a certain point the light rises and forms a column in which the fire is of a different nature , so that I am able to light my candles from it .
When I thus have received the flame on my candles , I go out and give the fire first to the Armenian Patriarch and then to the Coptic .
Hereafter I give the flame to all people present in the Church . "
The Symbolic Meaning of the Miracle
" How do you yourself experience the miracle and what does it mean to your spiritual life ? "
" The miracle touches me just as deeply every single year .
Every time it is another step towards conversion for me .
For me personally it is of great comfort to consider Christs faithfulness towards us , which he displays by giving us the holy flame every year in spite of our human frailties and failures .
We experience many wonders in our Churches , and miracles are nothing strange to us .
It happens often that icons cry , when Heaven wants to display its closeness to us ; also we have saints , to whom God gives many spiritual gifts .
But none of these miracles have such a penetrating and symbolic meaning for us as the miracle of the Holy Fire .
The miracle is almost like a sacrament .
It makes the resurrection of Christ present to us as if he had died only a few years ago . "
While the patriarch is inside the chapel kneeling in front of the stone , there is darkness but far from silence outside .
One hears a rather loud mumbling , and the atmosphere is very tense .
When the Patriarch comes out with the two candles lit and shinning brightly in the darkness , a roar of jubilee resounds in the Church , comparable only to a goal at a soccer - match .
The Miracle Leads to Faith
The miracle is not confined to what actually happens inside the little tomb , where the Patriarch prays .
What may be even more significant , is that the blue light is reported to appear and be active outside the tomb .
Every year many believers claim that this miraculous light ignites candles , which they hold in their hands , of its own initiative .
All in the church wait with candles in the hope that they may ignite spontaneously .
Often closed oil lamps take fire by themselves before the eyes of the pilgrims .
The blue flame is seen to move in different places in the Church .
A number of signed testimonies by pilgrims , whose candles lit spontaneously , attest to the validity of these ignitions .
The person who experiences the miracle from a close distance by having the fire on the candle or seeing the blue light usually leaves Jerusalem changed , and for everyone having attended the ceremony , there is always a " before and after " the Miracle of the Holy Fire in Jerusalem .
Unknown in the West
One can ask the question why the Miracle of the Holy Fire is hardly known in Western Europe .
In the Protestant areas it may to a certain extent be explained by the fact that there is no real tradition for miracles ; people dont really know in which box to place the miracles , and they dont take up much space in newspapers .
But in the Catholic tradition there is vast interest for miracles .
Thus , why is it not more known ?
For this it only one explanation suffices : Church politics .
Only the Orthodox Churches attend the ceremony framing the miracle .
It only occurs on the orthodox Easter date and without the presence of any Catholic authorities .
By certain Orthodox this evidence proves the notion that the Orthodox Church is the only legitimate Church of Christ in the world , and this assertion obviously may cause certain apprehensions in Catholic circles .
The Question of the Authenticity of the Miracle
As with any other miracle there are people who believe it is fraud and nothing but a masterpiece of Orthodox propaganda .
They believe the Patriarch has a lighter inside of the tomb .
These critics , however , are confronted with a number of problems .
Matches and other means of ignition are recent inventions .
Only a few hundred years ago lighting a fire was an undertaking that lasted much longer than the few minutes during which the Patriarch is inside the tomb .
One then could perhaps say , he had an oil lamp burning inside , from which he kindled the candles , but the local authorities confirm to have checked the tomb and found no light inside it .
The biggest arguments against a fraud , however , are not the testimonies of the shifting patriarchs .
The biggest challenges confronting the critics are the thousands of independent testimonies by pilgrims whose candles were lit spontaneously in front of their eyes without any possible explanation .
According to our investigations , it has never been possible to film any of the candles or oillamps igniting by themselves .
However , I am in the possession of a video filmed by a young engineer from Bethlehem , Souhel Nabdiel .
Mr. Nabdiel has been present at the ceremony of the Holy Fire since his early childhood .
In 1996 he was asked to film the ceremony from the balcony of the dome of the Church .
Present with him on the balcony were a nun and four other believers .
The nun stood at the right hand of Nabdiel .
On the video one can see how he films down on the crowds .
At a certain point all lights are turned off it is time for the Patriarch to enter the tomb and take the Holy Fire .
While he is still inside the tomb one suddenly hears a scream of surprise and wonder originating from the nun standing next to Nabdiel .
The camera begins to shake , as one hears the excited voices of the other people present on the balcony .
The camera now turns to the right , whereby it is possible to contemplate the cause of the emotion .
A big candle , held in the hand of the Russian nun , takes fire in front of all people present before the patriarch comes out of the tomb .
With shaking hands she holds the candle while over and over making the sign of the Cross in awe of the potent she has witnessed .
This video appears to be the closest one gets to an actual filming of the miracle .
Miracles cannot be proved
The miracle is , as most miracles are , surrounded by unexplainable factors .
As Archbishop of Tiberias Alexios said when I met him in Jerusalem :
" The miracle has never been filmed and most probably never will be .
Miracles can not be proved .
Faith is required for a miracle to bear fruit in the life of a person and without this act of faith there is no miracle in the strict sense .
The true miracle in the Christian tradition has only one purpose : to extend the Grace of God in creation , and God cannot extend his Grace without the faith on behalf of his creatures .
Therefore there can be no miracle without faith . "

Most of us have been pulled over and issued a ticket for speeding or other moving violations at least once in our lives .
It ’s probably also fair to say that in many if not most cases ; we do n’t even bother to challenge the ticket because the patrolman says that his radar gun reading showed that you were driving over the speed limit .
There are other times , however less common , which we do n’t necessarily agree with the patrolman ’s assessment of the facts ( example : you failed to come to a complete stop ) .
According to our system , suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law ; the government has the burden to prove that an individual violated a law ( anything ranging from jaywalking to murder ) .
At least that ’s what I thought .
Jim Hickey for ABC
News writes :
The state ’s Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the trained eyeballs of police officers are enough to hand out speeding tickets .
A radar gun is unnecessary .
Some Ohio drivers were stunned .
One woman called it “ crazy , ” adding that “ just the radar gun itself is disputable . ”
This unidentified woman from the article is right to be skeptical of the technologies the police use .
I once received a ticket in the mail from one of those photo radar cameras .
According to the ticket , my wife was driving the family minivan by herself in the HOV lane .
There was one slight problem though : not only was my wife not driving alone but every single seat in the vehicle was occupied !
We knew this ticket was bogus because this particular stretch of highway is one we almost never drive and the one time we did take this particular stretch of highway according to the date it was taken was when my parents were in the vehicle * .
But even as these technologies are disputable , the notion of humans are prone to error is not …except for 5 of 6 judges on the Ohio Supreme Court .
The article continues :
In its ruling upholding that conviction , the Ohio Supreme Court said “ a police officer ’s unaided visual estimation of a vehicle ’s speed is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for speeding … if the officer is properly trained . ”
In this case , the court ruled , the office was properly trained and certified to eyeball speeding motorists .
The court added in its ruling that a radar gun “ is not necessary to support a conviction for speeding . ” [… ]
But one dissenting judge argued that the ruling creates too broad a standard for jurors who must evaluate police testimony .
He said the ruling “ eclipses the role of the fact - finder to reject such testimony ” which , by itself , may not be enough to support a conviction .
I share the dissenting judge ’s opinion but I fear that this ruling is even worse that what is stated in this article .
We may tend to think of Speeding Tickets as trivial matters but they really are not .
Speeding tickets often mean higher insurance premiums and points against an individual ’s license .
For those who drive for a living and are required to have a CDL , having too many speeding tickets can result in losing his or her livelihood .
Do you regularly get speeding tickets ?
If so , you are probably fed up of it .
One way you could help yourself out is by getting a radar detector .
These devices could be the answer to limiting your speeding tickets , so I suggest you read some radar detector reviews and see what you think .
It ’s got to be worth a try , right ?
In saying that a police officer ’s judgment that an individual is speeding is as good as radar gun gives the police virtually unchecked authority and opens the door for future abuse .
Radar guns , whether defective or not , are at the very least objective .
The same cannot be said for human judgment ( trained or not ) .
Ohio police can now pull over someone for no reason at all , lie about his or her rights , and threaten to write a speeding ticket if the motorist fails to ‘ cooperate . ’
Some motorists might think it wise to make audio and / or video recordings of any such interaction with the police to ensure such abuses are documented or prevented but as Radley Balko reports , this can have its own set of risks .**
The real ugly truth of the matter is that traffic citations are n’t really as much about safety as they are about revenue .
Most states , counties , and cities are seemingly having financial difficulties ; it ’s in the best interests of these entities to collect as much revenue as possible .
With this sort of perverse incentive in place , practically anyone who drives in Ohio can be found guilty of speeding – not beyond a reasonable doubt but merely beyond a reasonable guess .
However , setting speed limits is also great because it can lower the amount of accidents in an area .
Lowering the chance of a smash up as well as the stress of creating a Settlement for car accident in Sacramento .
* We disputed the ticket over the phone and the ticket was dismissed .
We did n’t even have to go to court .
** I ’m referring specifically to a Maryland motorcyclist , Anthony Graber whose home was raided after he posted a video of a police interaction he had on YouTube .
The police said that Graber violated Maryland ’s wiretapping law !?
If convicted , Graber could serve up to 5 years in prison .
Hopefully the Maryland courts are saner than the Ohio courts .
There should be absolutely no laws against recording police interactions .
Its not my intention to discourage recording the police ( quite the opposite ) but be sure you know what your rights are .
If the police say you are not allowed to record them in a public space , they are probably lying .
Scientists in Singapore and Taiwan have developed an organic molecule which can have three electrically - readable states , making a ternary rather than binary device possible .
Binary devices have two electrically readable states , corresponding to a one or zero .
Ternary devices have three : zero , one or two .
Consequently they could , if built and programmed , store or process more information than binary RAM or NAND .
The scientists built a prototype device which functioned as a plastic DRAM cell .
It was composed of a new synthesised organic azo compound sandwiched between aluminum and indium tin oxide ( ITO ) electrodes .
Azo compounds may have vivid yellow , orange and red colours , and are used in dyes .
According to a American Chemical Society journal abstract the proto cell was " based on a donor - functionalized polyimide ( TP6 F - PI ) , which exhibited the ability to write , read , erase , and refresh the electrical states .
The device had an ON / OFF current ratio up to 105 , promising minimal misreading error .
Both the on and off states were stable under a constant voltage stress of 1 V and survived up to 108 read cycles at 1 V . "
The azo compound exhibits a high , medium or low conductivity state depending on the voltage applied to it through the aluminium electrodes and these three states can be read out as 0 , 1 or 2 .
The abstract says : " Two electron pull groups and one electron push group are identified as the species responsible for electron flow . "
It 's very interesting science , but the entire binary computing infrastructure would have to alter to use it .
Do n't expect a ternary iPad in your lifetime .

The Secret Lives of Somerset Maugham
A Biography
Selina Hastings
Random House : 640 pp. , $ 35

The story of William Somerset Maugham , the stammering young boy who became a doctor and then the world ’s most famous writer since Dickens , has often been told , but in this new biography , “ The Secret Lives of Somerset Maugham , ” Selina Hastings draws upon previously unavailable material to create the fullest , most sympathetic portrait thus far .
Hastings , while making her partiality toward her subject clear enough , writes with wit and offers a wealth of new detail .
The achievement by the end ( and the book is pretty hefty ) is monumental , even if the starting point is familiar enough .
“ On the Riviera , as in London and New York , Maugham , always elegantly dressed , looked every inch the conventional English gentleman .
And yet conventional he was not , ” Hastings writes .
“ In Maugham ’s outwardly respectable life there was a great deal he was determined to keep hidden … "
Mostly , Hastings argues , this had to do with his sexuality .
Maugham , as he confessed later in his life , was “ 75 per cent queer . ”
Today , no problem ; but Maugham was born in 1874 and , as a young man , he witnessed the destruction of Oscar Wilde , whose plays he would later emulate with great success .
Because , as Hastings says , Maugham “ liked sex and liked lots of it , ” he needed secrecy and masks , at which he proved himself adept .
Inside , however fabulous his outward worldly success became , he felt himself a threatened outsider , and therefore was a natural spy .
He showed this skill when he acted for the British secret services during World War I in Switzerland and in Russia , which was then on the cusp of revolution .

“ According to the elaborate code with which he had been equipped , Kerensky was to be identified as ‘ Lane , ’ Lenin as ‘ Davis , ’ Trotsky as ‘ Cole , ’ ” Hastings notes , “ while the British government appeared under the guise of ‘ Eyre & Co . ’ ”
Maugham , a depressive who was capable of turning his cold eye upon himself , noted that he had no lyrical ability , no aptitude for metaphor and a distinct tendency toward cliché .
He almost exclusively wrote from life , from observation , and he traveled endlessly to gather experience .
His companion in the 1920s and 1930s , his professional heyday , was his great love , the American Gerald Haxton , a dissolute yet loyal chancer who wooed from strangers material that Maugham then used .
By the time he met Haxton , however , Maugham was already married to Syrie Wellcome , the daughter of the Irish philanthropist Sir Thomas Barnardo .
“ The basic problem was twofold : the couple had almost nothing in common , and Syrie had made the fatal mistake of falling in love with her husband , ” Hastings writes .
Syrie cajoled and trapped Maugham into marriage — and Hastings gives us the devious ins and outs as no previous biographer ever has .
But this does n’t quite let Maugham off the hook in the way Hastings argues .
He knew his own nature ; he knew too that marriage would provide convenient cover .
A daughter , Liza , was born , and thus Maugham placed at the center of his life a time bomb that would explode decades later .
Meanwhile , with Haxton , Maugham moved into the Villa Mauresque , his splendid home on the French Riviera , surrounded by his modern art and his 9 acres of garden , attended by 13 servants , and went on writing bestselling novels and short - story collections that were staple fodder for the producers of Hollywood ’s Golden Age .
Some 98 films were made from Maugham ’s material during his lifetime — “ Rain ” helped establish the career of Joan Crawford , while “ Of Human Bondage ” and “ The Letter ” provided Bette Davis with characters from which to shape her smart , ruthless screen persona .

A famous 1949 portrait by artist Graham Sutherland shows Maugham sitting in a straight - backed chair , arms crossed , wearing a velvet smoking jacket , his face lined and desiccated , surveying the world with a withering mouth and unblinking superciliousness .
He looks like a mandarin , superb , decadent , merciless — quite untouchable .
And at that time he was .
Then came the hubristic fall .
Haxton died and was replaced by another companion , Alan Searle .
To prolong his vigor , Maugham took frequent trips to Switzerland , where he was injected with sheep fetus cells .
Here was the sad farce of old age , but more serious damage was still to come .
Manipulated and betrayed by Searle ( “ a podgy Iago , ” writes Hastings ) , Maugham rewrote his will and tried to cut Liza out of it .
Lawsuits ensued , along with worldwide acrimony .
The time bomb went off at last .
Decades of wary plotting and carefully keeping the world at arm ’s length exploded .
As Gore Vidal has noted , Maugham built his own monument — and then blew it up .
He published “ Looking Back , ” a vicious , ill - advised memoir , and slid into Alzheimer ’s .
Nothing grates like hate , and by the time Maugham died soon thereafter , in 1965 at age 91 , the world had changed its view of the grandest of grand , old literary men .
The man who had known “ everyone , from Henry James to Winston Churchill , from Dorothy Parker to D.H. Lawrence ” came to his sad end , raving like King Lear .
Hastings ( unlike Ted Morgan in his 1980 hatchet job ) does n’t gloat over the decline , even while smacking the reader with its full horror .
She ’s also good on the happier era of Maugham ’s ascent , and she places due emphasis on the genesis of Maugham ’s masterpieces , the bildungsroman “ Of Human Bondage ” and “ Cakes and Ale , ” in which Maugham perpetrated an act of betrayal that would have shocked even James , and , as the critic Logan Pearsall Smith said , thrust in “ the red hot poker that killed Hugh Walpole . ”
Walpole , a minor English novelist , had been Maugham ’s friend , but that cut no ice .
Maugham was ruthless with himself and others when it came to writing .
Great stylist he was n’t , but his devotion to craft and mastery of narrative cunning were complete .
The best of his work lasts , and new generations of readers go on to discover it — even the deliriously daft “ The Razor ’s Edge , ” a story about the quest for ultimate meaning ( Maugham believed there was none ) , still has a romantic appeal .

Another great English writer , Christopher Isherwood , described Maugham as “ an old Gladstone bag , covered with labels .
God knows what ’s inside . ”
Hastings may not have unlocked all of Maugham ’s secrets , and she ca n’t always make us like him , but she offers the most intimate , persuasive glimpse inside the old bag thus far .

This article is about annual survey published by the Fraser Institute .
For other indices , see Indices of economic freedom
Economic Freedom of the World is an annual survey published by the libertarian Canadian think tank Fraser Institute .
[ 1 ]
The survey attempts to measure the degree of economic freedom in the world 's nations .
It has been used in peer - reviewed studies some of which have found a range of beneficial effects of more economic freedom . [ 2 ]
History [ edit ]
One of the earliest measures of economic freedom was developed by Freedom House , which has done extensive work on the measurement of political and cultural freedom .
This measure incorporated a range of indicators including freedom to establish a business and freedom of union organisation . [ 3 ]
Partly in response to dissatisfaction with the Freedom House index from advocates of a libertarian or market liberal viewpoint , Milton Friedman and Michael Walker of the Fraser Institute hosted a series of conferences on economic freedom .
Eventually this resulted in a report on worldwide economic freedom , Economic Freedom of the World .
Later the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal created another similar index , the Index of Economic Freedom . [ 4 ]
Method [ edit ]
The participants in the conferences reached a consensus that the cornerstones of economic freedom are : personal choice rather than collective choice , voluntary exchange coordinated by markets rather than allocation via the political process , freedom to enter and compete in markets , protection of persons and their property from aggression by others .
[ 5 ]
The 2005 report states " When the functions of the minimal state — protection of people and their property from the actions of aggressors , enforcement of contracts , and provision of the limited set of public goods like roads , flood control projects , and money of stable value — are performed well , but the government does little else , a country ’s rating on the EFW summary index will be high .
Correspondingly , as government expenditures increase and regulations expand , a country ’s rating will decline . " [ 5 ]
In practice , the index measures : size of government ( expenditures , taxes , and enterprises , legal structure ) , security of property rights , access to sound money , freedom to trade internationally , and regulation of credit , labor , and business .
[ 5 ]
The report uses 42 distinct variables , from for example the World Bank , to measure this .
Some examples : tax rates , degree of juridical independence , inflation rates , costs of importing , and regulated prices .
Each of the 5 areas above is given equal weight in the final score . [ 5 ]
Research [ edit ]
Economic Freedom of the World , and various other indicators .
The red bars shows nations with less economic freedom , the green bars those with more .
Charts showing economic freedom , as defined in , and various other indicators .
The red bars shows nations with less economic freedom , the green bars those with more .
Economic freedom has been shown to correlate strongly with higher average income per person , higher income of the poorest 10 % , higher life expectancy , higher literacy , lower infant mortality , higher access to water sources and less corruption .
The share of income in percent going to the poorest 10 % is the same for both more and less economically free countries . [ 6 ]
The people living in the top one - fifth of the most free countries enjoy an average income of $ 23,450 and a growth rate in the 1990s of 2.56 percent per year ; in contrast , the bottom one - fifth in the rankings had an average income of just $ 2,556 and a - 0.85 percent growth rate in the 1990s .
The poorest 10 percent of the population have an average income of just $ 728 in the least free countries compared with over $ 7,000 in the most free countries .
The life expectancy of people living in the most free nations is 20 years longer than for people in the least free countries . [ 7 ]
Higher economic freedom , as measured by both the Heritage and the Fraser indices , correlates strongly with higher self - reported happiness [ 8 ] and is significant in preventing wars .
Economic freedom is around 54 times more effective than democracy ( as measured by Democracy Score ) in diminishing violent conflict . [ 9 ]
Regarding environmental health , studies have found no or a positive effect .
More important may be the Kuznets curve .
Most environmental health indicators , such as water and air pollution show an inverted U - shape .
Meaning in the beginning of economic development , little weight is given to environmental concerns , raising pollution along with industrialization .
After a threshold , when basic physical needs are met and a middle class is established , interest in a clean environment rises , reversing the trend . [ 10 ]
Studies show that more economic freedom is the cause of beneficial effects and that Economic Freedom of the World was used for most of the research , partly because Index of Economic Freedom only goes back to 1995 and because it uses more subjective variables . [ 10 ]
Influence [ edit ]
Hundreds of peer - reviewed articles have used the index and it has been used in economic research , political science , and environmental research . [ 11 ]
The Economic Freedom of the World index has been more widely used than any other measure of economic freedom , because of its coverage of a longer time period . [ 12 ]
In 2016 the report was cited in 412 independent research journals . [ 13 ]
In 2016 and 2017 Free Malaysia Today and National Review quoted the report . [ 14 ]
Criticisms [ edit ]
The correlation between economic freedom and growth has been criticized by studies .
De Haan and Siermann find that the relationship is not robust . [ 15 ]
Heckelman and Stroup argue that the weighting procedure used in the construction of the index is arbitrary . [ 16 ]
They examine the components of the index individually and find that many — including a low top marginal tax rate — are negatively , rather than positively correlated with economic growth .
A frequent criticism is that China , and other developing nations , have high growth rates but relatively low economic freedom .
Developing nations can have higher growth rates than developed nations , as they have cheap labor and can import investment , technology and organizational skills from rich countries .
When examining the subcomponents of the index , any positive effect that a low level of taxes might have is more disputed than the importance of rule of law , lack of political corruption , low inflation , and functioning property rights .
Many northern European nations such as Iceland ( # 23 ) , Denmark ( #13 ) , Finland ( # 21 ) and Sweden ( #35 ) , have extensive welfare states , which are strongly opposed by advocates of laissez - faire .
It is argued these countries have less regulation than most others , and research using the Ease of Doing Business Index suggests that the effect of business regulations is more important than government consumption . [ 17 ]
The Global Competitiveness Report looks at several other factors that affect economic growth such as infrastructure , health , and education .
Although the World Bank does not believe that laissez - faire policies , if they allow large inequalities of wealth to develop , are an effective way to achieve this goal , it is a strong supporter of the importance of economic growth for reducing poverty .
It argues that an overview of many studies shows that : growth is fundamental for poverty reduction , and in principle growth as such does not seem to affect inequality , growth accompanied by a more egalitarian distribution of wealth is better than growth alone , high initial income inequality is a brake on poverty reduction , poverty itself is also likely to be a barrier for poverty reduction , and wealth inequality seems to predict lower future growth rates .

Twenty years ago , the Exxon Valdez supertanker spilled at least 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska ’s pristine Prince William Sound .
The consequences of the spill were epic and continue to this day , impacting the environment and the economy .
Instead of seeing it as just a pollution story , Riki Ott considers the Exxon Valdez disaster to be a fundamental threat to U.S. democracy .
Ott , a marine toxicologist and commercial salmon “ fisherma’am ” from Cordova , Alaska , opens her book on the disaster , “ Not One Drop , ” with the words of Albert Einstein : “ No problem can be solved from the same consciousness that created it . ”
The massive spill stretched 1,200 miles from the accident site , and covered 3,200 miles of shoreline and an incredible 10,000 square miles overall .
Early on March 24 , 1989 , Ott , who was on the board of the Cordova District Fishermen United , was airborne , surveying the scene : “ [ I ]t was a surreal scene .
It was just drop - dead gorgeous , March , sunrise , pink mountains glistening with the sunrise .
And all of a sudden we come on the scene , where there ’s this red deck of this oil tanker that ’s three football fields long ; flat , calm water , dark blue ; and there ’s this inky - black stain that ’s just stretching with the tide . ”
News of the spill went global , and people poured into Valdez , Alaska , to start the cleanup .
Sea life was devastated .
Ott says up to half a million sea birds died , along with 5,000 sea otters , 300 or so harp seals , and billions of young salmon , fish eggs and young juvenile fish .
The death of the fish eggs created a long - term but delayed impact on the herring and salmon fisheries in Prince William Sound .
By 1993 , the fisheries had collapsed .
Families lost their livelihoods after taking huge loans to buy boats and expensive fishing permits .
While the salmon fishery has improved , the herring have never come back .
This economic disruption is one basis of legal action against ExxonMobil , the biggest oil corporation in the world .
Complex litigation has dragged on for two decades , and ExxonMobil is winning .
There are 22,000 plaintiffs suing ExxonMobil .
A jury awarded the plaintiffs $ 5 billion in damages , equal to what was , at the time , a year ’s worth of Exxon profits .
This was cut by half by a U.S. appeals court , then finally lowered to just over $ 500 million by the Supreme Court .
During the 20 years of court battles , 6,000 of the original plaintiffs have died .
ExxonMobil , with its billions in annual profits and armies of lawyers , can tie up the Valdez case in the courts for decades , while the injured commercial fishers slowly die off .
The power of ExxonMobil to battle tens of thousands of citizens has pushed Ott to join a growing number of activists who want to put corporations back in their place by stripping them of their legal status as “ persons . ”
A 19th century U.S. Supreme Court decision gave corporations the same status as people , with access to the protections of the Bill of Rights .
Ironically , this comes from the 14th Amendment ’s “ equal protection clause , ” adopted to protect freed slaves from oppressive state laws after the Civil War .
Corporations were historically chartered by states to conduct their business .
States could revoke a corporation ’s charter if it broke the law or acted beyond its charter .
Corporations ’ “ free speech ” is interpreted to include making campaign contributions and lobbying Congress .
People who break laws can be locked up ; when a corporation breaks the law — even behaving criminally negligently , causing death — rarely are the consequences greater than a fine , which the corporation can write off on its taxes .
As Ott put it , “ If ‘ three strikes and you ’re out ’ laws can put a person in prison for life , why not a corporation ? ”
So - called tort reform in U.S. law is eroding an individual ’s ability to sue corporations and the ability for courts to assess damages that would actually deter corporate wrongdoing .
Ott and others have drafted a “ 28th Amendment ” to the Constitution that would strip corporations of their personhood , subjecting them to the same oversight that existed for the first 100 years of U.S. history .
With the global economic meltdown and welling public outrage over the excesses of executives at AIG as well as over other bailout beneficiaries , now just might be the time to expand public engagement over the imbalance of power between people and corporations that has undermined our democracy .

Last week , leaders of nations from both the G8 and G20 gathered in Ontario Canada , for meetings in in Huntsville and Toronto .
Canadian authorities planning for the event spent an estimated $ 1 billion , mostly for security .
Tens of thousands of protesters descended on Toronto , looking to have their voices heard on a broad range of issues , from indigenous rights to anti-capitalist ideals , to human and animal rights , and much more .
Many peaceful marches took place throughout the weekend , but on Saturday , a small group of " black bloc " anarchists became violent , smashing storefronts and burning several police vehicles .
Harsher tactics and more arrests by the 20,000 police officers deployed to Toronto soon followed , although many of those arrested were released from a temporary G20 detainment center soon after .

Update : StackVM is now called Browserling .
Hey everyone ,
I have awesome news !
I am doing a startup together with James Halliday !
I met James on FreeNode several years ago and it turned out that we had very similar ideas about doing great hacking .
So we teamed up as equal co-founders to do a startup .
We 're on different continents but we use IRC , GitHub and WeDoist to get stuff done !
Check out an early demo of our software :
StackVM brings virtual machines to the web .
Join #stackvm on FreeNode to discuss !
The startup we 're doing is called StackVM .
StackVM makes virtual machines much more accessible over the web , makes them easier to use , and makes them embeddable in webpages ( like putting a virtual machine in a blog post ) .
This is just the first step that we 're starting with .
Next we 're making networking between them very easy , just drag and drop to create any virtual network topology you want , with firewalls , switches , etc. ( fun for hacking competitions and learning networking ) .
Then we 're making what we call " vmcasts " - much like a screencasts , except the computation is recorded , meaning that at any point you can break into the playing vmcast and change the course of computation ( and return back to it later ) .
Our plan is to host the virtual machines and our awesome software for you , so that you do n't have to worry about anything .
We 'll make sure it all works !
At the moment we 're actually already at our third major iteration of the software .
Here are a few use cases :
Suppose you 're selling software and you want your users to try it before they buy it .
Perfect use of StackVM - put your software in the virtual machine and embed it on your products page .
The potential customers can try your software before they buy it right from your website !
Suppose you 're an application developer and have written a program that should work cross-platform .
You can easily rent 10 virtual machines with Linux , Windows , MacOS , and other operating systems and test your software .
Just drag and drop it into the virtual machines , and you can test your software !
Suppose you want to teach someone how to work in Perl in a series of blog posts ( like I do ) , you can embed the terminal with a vmcast in your blog post , and everyone can follow your tutorial , and also try out the examples interactively , in a real shell !
You can build a virtual honeypot network and have hackers break into it , then analyse how they did breakins .
Or , you can build a huge network and learn routing and networking concepts !
Suppose you want to share your work with a group of people .
You can easily do it in stackvm !
Just send the other people link to your VM and they can connect to it with any web browser .
They 'll be able to see what you 're doing , comment on your work , and if you allow fix your bugs ( think pair programming ! )
Hosting virtual machines requires a lot of infrastructure , so we plan to start collecting revenue as soon as possible with affordable paid user accounts .
We 're not going to do the common nonsense among startups of first building up the project for years and only then trying to figure out how to make it profitable .
We 're going to offer virtual machines together with an awesome interface and features to them as a monthly paid service from the day we launch .
We 're also going to have an open API to our software , so that you can build on top of it or customize it ( for example script virtual machines to do something specific ) .
We 're also testing out the idea of complete openness with this startup .
It 's going to be 100 % open - source and 100 % idea - open , meaning that anyone can read what we 're up to , and run our code if they want to run stackvm on their own .
So far we have shared all the code on github ( my stackvm repo , James 's stackvm repo ) and documented most of the ideas and experiments on stackvm github wiki .
We 're applying for YC funding later this year so that we can focus on hacking and not paperwork .
Now a little bit about the tech we use at StackVM .
I wo n't go into much details right now because many of the future posts will detail the tech at StackVM .
At the moment StackVM is in its 3rd major iteration already and is almost entirely built on node.js .
Since we 're doing everything open - source , we 've written a bunch of reusable node .js modules :
dnode - Simple asynchronous remote method invocation for node.js .
node - bufferlist - Abstraction of node.js 's buffers and monadic binary parsing .
node - rfb - Implements the client - side of the RFB protocol that VNC uses .
node - png - Produces PNG images from RGB or RGBA values .
node - jpeg - Produces JPEG images from RGB or RGBA values .
node - video - Records
Theora / Ogg videos from RGB values .
node - base64 - Encodes binary data to base64 to send across websockets and ajax .
node - jsmin - Minify JavaScript on the server side , before sending it to the browser .
node - bufferdiff - A module to compare two buffers quickly .
I 'll keep everyone updated on the progress and technical insight into our development .
If you 're not yet subscribed to my posts , please do it - catonmat rss feed .
Going to make this happen !
And if you want to talk about our software , come join #stackvm on FreeNode !

The mineral find suggests that liquid water once flooded the rocks
The Red Planet harbours rocks rich in carbonate minerals , suggesting there was more water there in the past than previously thought , say scientists .
Nasa 's Mars Exploration Rover Spirit detected the carbonate - rich rocks in the Columbia Hills of Gusev Crater .
This was in 2005 , but Martian dust had partially blinded one of the rover 's instruments , clouding the data .
The team described in Science journal how they calibrated the instrument to " remove the effects of the dust " .
The discovery helps scientists understand the early climate history of Mars and whether there could have been life on the planet .
Research scientist Steve Ruff from Arizona State University in the US , took part in the study .
" Small amounts of carbonate minerals have been detected on Mars before , " he explained .
" [ But this time ] we 're seeing a couple of large outcrops of rock poking through the soil of the Columbia Hills . "
Living conditions ?
Nasa scientist Richard Morris , from the Johnson Space Center in Houston , led the research .
He said that the rocks , which are about 25 % carbonate by weight , contain about 10 times more carbonate than had previously been detected in the planet 's rocks .
" This is a significant jump , " he told BBC News .
" And the amount is compelling evidence that there was some kind of water there . "
Dr Morris explained that the mineral probably came from carbonate - rich water , which interacted with the rock .
This could also point to early Mars being warmer than previously thought .
" It looks like Mars had a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere , so there was some kind of greenhouse effect , " said Dr Morris .
" The atmosphere now is very thin , - it could have blown into space or it could have interacted with water and is now present in the rocks . "
The carbonate is also evidence that the water was chemically neutral , which would have made conditions " more permissive " for life on early Mars .
While none of this is direct evidence of life on Mars , Dr Morris says the study is " just the beginning " of the science that will be possible with this data .
I am going to have to have a sit down with these athletes about letting these club promoters just using their image and name for any and every party they are throwing they get free access to .
We already have seen how this has caused Michael Vick some trouble and there have been many incidents where an athlete name has been attached to something they have absoutely nothing to do with , but when something goes down they are held responsible .
I can only hope that Ron Artest knows nothing about the “ F*** Lebron Party ” and this was just an idea of an overzealous party promoter .
I have never seen one individual go from generally liked to a pirah as quick as Lebron for basically nothing .
At least there was a reason ( if not a good one ) people turned on Tiger Woods .
People turned on Lebron for making a decision he was “ free ” to make .
It was if Lebron walked into their kitchen and took their cornbread or something .
Yeah he went about it a little over the top , but that did n’t stop everyone from watching and talking about it .
Lebron has paid my rent , cell phone and is real close to paying my car note just off the strength people reading our thoughts about The Summer of Lebron .
It is just strange to me .
He is just a NBA player , but the venom toward him now you would think he was the basketball version of BET .
* wait *
Anyway we will try to get confirmation if Artest is involved with this in anyway and report back .
If he is I hate to say it , but that was a very “ moist ” decision on his part .
* offtopic *
I like how it is a “ F*** Lebron Edition ” , but it is being promoted by “ UpScale Crowd Entertainment ”
I swear I am living in the Matrix sometimes .

The American people are hurting .
As a result of the greed , recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street , millions of Americans have lost their jobs , homes , life savings and their ability to get a higher education .
Today , some 22 percent of our children live in poverty , and millions more have become dependent on food stamps for their food .
Ad Policy
And while the Great Wall Street Recession has devastated the middle class , the truth is that working families have been experiencing a decline for decades .
During the Bush years alone , from 2000 - 2008 , median family income dropped by nearly $ 2,200 and millions lost their health insurance .
Today , because of stagnating wages and higher costs for basic necessities , the average two - wage - earner family has less disposable income than a one - wage - earner family did a generation ago .
The average American today is underpaid , overworked and stressed out as to what the future will bring for his or her children .
For many , the American dream has become a nightmare .
But , not everybody is hurting .
While the middle class disappears and poverty increases the wealthiest people in our country are not only doing extremely well , they are using their wealth and political power to protect and expand their very privileged status at the expense of everyone else .
This upper - crust of extremely wealthy families are hell - bent on destroying the democratic vision of a strong middle - class which has made the United States the envy of the world .
In its place they are determined to create an oligarchy in which a small number of families control the economic and political life of our country .
The 400 richest families in America , who saw their wealth increase by some $ 400 billion during the Bush years , have now accumulated $ 1.27 trillion in wealth .
Four hundred families !
During the last fifteen years , while these enormously rich people became much richer their effective tax rates were slashed almost in half .
While the highest - paid 400 Americans had an average income of $ 345 million in 2007 , as a result of Bush tax policy they now pay an effective tax rate of 16.6 percent , the lowest on record .
Last year , the top twenty - five hedge fund managers made a combined $ 25 billion but because of tax policy their lobbyists helped write , they pay a lower effective tax rate than many teachers , nurses and police officers .
As a result of tax havens in the Cayman Islands , Bermuda and elsewhere , the wealthy and large corporations are evading some $ 100 billion a year in U.S. taxes .
Warren Buffett , one of the richest people on earth , has often commented that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary .
But it ’s not just wealthy individuals who grotesquely manipulate the system for their benefit .
It ’s the multinational corporations they own and control .
In 2009 , Exxon Mobil , the most profitable corporation in history made $ 19 billion in profits and not only paid no federal income tax — they actually received a $ 156 million refund from the government .
In 2005 , one out of every four large corporations in the United States paid no federal income taxes while earning $ 1.1 trillion in revenue .
But , perhaps the most outrageous tax break given to multi-millionaires and billionaires happened this January when the estate tax , established in 1916 , was repealed for one year as a result of President Bush ’s 2001 tax legislation .
This tax applies only to the wealthiest three - tenths of 1 percent of our population .
This is what Teddy Roosevelt , a leading proponent of the estate tax , said in 1910 .
“ The absence of effective state , and , especially , national restraint upon unfair money - getting has tended to create a small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful men , whose chief object is to hold and increase their power .
The prime need is to change the conditions which enable these men to accumulate power which is not for the general welfare that they should hold or exercise . …
Therefore , I believe in a…graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes , properly safeguarded against evasion and increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate . ”
And that ’s what we ’ve had for the last ninety - five years — until 2010 .
Today , not content with huge tax breaks on their income ; not content with massive corporate tax loopholes ; not content with trade laws enabling them to outsource the jobs of millions of American workers to low - wage countries and not content with tax havens around the world , the ruling elite and their lobbyists are working feverishly to either eliminate the estate tax or substantially lower it .
If they are successful at wiping out the estate tax , as they came close to doing in 2006 with every Republican but two voting to do , it would increase the national debt by over $ 1 trillion during a ten - year period .
At a time when we already have a $ 13 trillion debt , enormous unmet needs and the highest level of wealth inequality in the industrialized world , it is simply obscene to provide more tax breaks to multi-millionaires and billionaires .
That is why I have introduced the Responsible Estate Tax Act ( S.3533 ) .
This legislation would raise $ 318 billion over the next decade by establishing a graduated inheritance tax on estates over $ 3.5 million retroactive to this year .
This bill ensures that the wealthiest 0.3 percent of Americans pays their fair share of estate taxes , while making sure that 99.7 percent of Americans never have to pay a dime when they lose a loved one .
It also makes certain that the overwhelming majority of family farmers and small businesses never have to pay an estate tax .
This legislation must be passed because , with a $ 13 trillion national debt and huge unmet needs , we cannot afford more tax breaks for millionaire and billionaire families .
But even more importantly , it must be passed because the United States must not become an oligarchy in which a handful of wealthy and powerful families control the destiny of our nation .
Too many people , from the inception of this country , have struggled and died to maintain our democratic vision .
We owe it to them and to our children to maintain it .
“ His feelings of betrayal personify a slave master mentality .
He sees LeBron as a runaway slave .
This is an owner employee relationship — between business partners — and LeBron honored his contract . ” Jesse Jackson on Cavaliers Owner Dan Gilbert .
Racism exists .
It should n’t be ignored and when it presents itself , it should be acknowledged .
We have come a long way in race relations , but we still have a long way to go .
I still get funny looks in certain stores , people still lock car doors when I was walk by , people still tell me I “ speak well ” as if that is unusual for a black man in our society , and those are only a few things that I deal with on a daily basis .
That is why when someone brings race into a situation we should n’t take it lightly , because it is a serious issue , and if it is being used in non-serious situations it devalues the argument when it really applies .
When Jesse Jackson uses terms like “ Slaves ” and “ Slave Master ” in regard to Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert , it is the slap in the face of those who struggled to make it possible for a black man to sign a $ 100 + million contract .
The facts are clear .
Dan Gilbert owns the Cleveland Cavaliers and LeBron James was his prized employee , and like many employees who excelled in what they do , LeBron was afforded certain privileges .
In return , he was paid handsomely and Gilbert reaped the benefits of that financially .
When LeBron ’s contract was up he decided to take his “ talents ” elsewhere , and Gilbert , realizing the money he was about to lose , lashed out angrily ( in creative font ) .
For seven years Gilbert gave his “ employee ” whatever he wanted and whatever his friends wanted .
He mistakenly thought those privileges bought him loyalty , but this is a “ business ” and there is no loyalty in business dealings .
Gilbert ’s reactions are much more like a lover scorned than a “ Slave Master . ”
Last time I checked , slaves did n’t have options .
Slaves were n’t allowed to become “ Free Agents . ”
Slaves did n’t get hourlong specials on ESPN .
Slaves did n’t make more money than some 3rd world countries .
Do you know what happened to “ Runaway Slaves ” if they got caught ?
Let me just say they had to worry about more than an angry letter , some Delonte West jokes , and being booed at Carmelo ’s wedding .
I understand Jackson is using the terms “ slave ” and “ slave master mentality ” as an analogy , but some words are not to be played with .
When Mel Gibson told his girlfriend she was dressed like she wanted to be raped by a “ pack of n*ggers , ” he was using an analogy , too .
Some words carry more power than others , so you need to be careful when you leisurely throw them around .
There is a big difference between a “ pack of n*ggers ” and a “ pack of thugs , ” and “ Slaves ” and “ Employees ” .
LeBron James is a basketball player .
To even compare him to a slave is ignorant , self serving , and blasphemous on Jesse Jackson ’s part .
As a person who was right in the middle of the Civil Rights Movement , to even interject himself in a discussion about NBA Free Agency is just attention whoring at the highest level .
This so - called “ slave ” had billionaire owners coming to his “ house ” to present their “ partnership offers . ”
The pitch to this so - called “ slave ” had more to do with business than basketball .
When this so - called “ slave ” was too busy to meet with the so - called “ slave masters ” of the NBA , he dismissed them and let them talk to his crew .
Billboards , videos , Powerpoints , lapdances … all were thrown at the feet of this so - called “ slave . ”
This so - called “ slave ” controlled and manipulated the entire free agent process like a King on his Throne , to the point that millions tuned in to an hourlong “ Decision ” that was produced worse than “ Cool as Ice . ”
So excuse me if I am not crying “ Tebow Tears ” or using pathetic analogies for attention like Jesse Jackson , because Dan Gilbert wrote a “ Single White Female ” letter ( no pun intended ) .
When we have people getting less time for killing unarmed black men than a black man shooting himself , I think Jesse ’s time and energy can be spent better .
As I said on Twitter , the only color Dan Gilbert is concerned with is “ Green , ” and by trying to make it a black and white issue it only takes our focus away from the real problems in the black community .
Problems that go far beyond a billionaire ’s lover ’s quarrel with his former millionaire employee .
If Slaves only had it so lucky .
Doctors like to think that they ’ll turn in colleagues who are doing a particularly bad job .
But it ’s not so straightforward when physicians are faced with such a colleague , according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
[ Catherine DesRoches et al. , http://bit.ly/dsLSZB]
Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital surveyed almost 2,000 physicians in a variety of fields around the country .
About two - thirds said that they should and would report an impaired or incompetent colleague .
Seventeen percent said they know of a physician who should be reported , and about 67 percent of that group did issue a complaint .
Minority physicians or docs in small practices were less likely to blow the whistle than hospital staff .
They thought it would do no good , someone else would deal with it , or that there would be retribution .
The researchers were particularly concerned that one third of all docs surveyed did n’t think their incompetent colleagues should be reported .
And that a third of physicians who actually saw someone perform poorly in fact did not say anything .
The study authors urge more education on the subject , and protection and privacy for whistleblowers .
All in keeping with the Hippocratic oath : first , do no harm .

It was , perhaps , an unintended consequence of the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that a children 's toy should get an image makeover .
Once the domain of Halloween hooligans plastering innocent mailboxes and car windshields , the sticky ribbons known by the trademarked name Silly String got a new reputation as a weapon for heroes confronting a serious kind of terror .
U.S. Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams , who defuse and dispose of explosives , have been using Silly String to find booby traps since 1997 in Bosnia , says G. J. , a Navy Master Explosive Ordnance Technician who most recently served in Afghanistan .
" By spraying it in front of your intended path in confined spaces , in the threshold of a doorway , or at the gate outside a compound , you can detect trip wires or other hazards , " he says .
In 2006 , Army mom Marcelle Shriver heard a similar story from her son and organized a massive donation of sprayable streamers for the troops , receiving extensive media coverage in return .
The hoopla was a boon for the company that makes Silly String .
Patented in the 1970s by Wham - O Manufacturing , the same outfit that brought the Hula Hoop to the masses , the rights to Silly String were later handed off to Car - Freshner , best known for its tree - shaped air fresheners , and Just For Kicks , Car -Freshner 's toy division , says Rob Oram , product marketing manager at the company .
The stringy stuff comes in an aerosol can that helps make streamers from the chemicals inside .
Wham - O's patent may not contain the current formula , which is a trade secret , but it certainly serves up the chemical principles inside the can .
Silly String , and many of the other half dozen or so spray streamer products sold in the U.S. , start out as a liquid containing a polymer resin , which provides the string 's molecular framework .
The original patent calls for polyisobutyl methacrylate or similar molecules , and a flame retardant such as hexabromobenzene to prevent the eventual dried - up string from catching fire .
A touch of pigment provides the color .
Spray streamers balance stickiness , or adhesiveness , with an ability to hold themselves together , or cohesiveness .
A few other parts of the original formula contribute to that balance .
Plasticizers such as dibutyl phthalate boost the polymer 's strength and cohesiveness while ensuring it is still sticky to the touch .
Silicone fluids such as dimethyl siloxane make the finished streamers easier to peel away from most targets .
A bit of solvent such as dichloromethane keeps everything as a one - phase mixture .
Mixed in with the other ingredients is a surfactant such as sorbitan trioleate , which gives spray streamers their light - as - air feeling by facilitating foam formation .
Foams are bubbly materials , and the bubbles get into the spray streamer liquid mixture through their aerosol can housing .
Surfactants adsorb at newly formed gas - liquid interfaces , where they lower surface tension and help to stabilize nascent bubbles , says Eric Dickinson , a food chemist with expertise in foams at the University of Leeds , in England .
All the ingredients mentioned so far make up only about two - thirds of what is found in today 's cans .
The rest is propellant .
" Propellant is needed for the same reason it 's required for shaving cream — to expel materials out of the nozzle to create the foamlike substance , " Oram says .
The patent recommends chlorofluorocarbon propellants such as CFC - 12 , which have since been banned in the U.S. and many other countries because of their ability to deplete the ozone layer .
Silly String brand streamers do n't contain ozone - depleting propellants ; in their place is a propellant that is both nonvolatile and nonflammable , Oram notes .
Liquid spray streamers take on their familiar stringy form when they 're propelled up a skinny tube and out of the aerosol can .
That process is eerily reminiscent of how another Halloween mainstay , the spider , works with polymers , says biomedical engineer David L. Kaplan of Tufts University .
Spiders turn a biopolymer solution into the sticky string we recognize as spider silk .
When a spider pulls the silk protein through a narrow duct — akin to the skinny tube in the aerosol can — the amino acid chains align , coaxing them into their new form , Kaplan says .
Kaplan and his coworkers have taken inspiration from both spiders and Silly String to develop a modified , extra -sticky version of spider silk that behaves like a spray streamer when extruded from a syringe .
" We want to use it for medical reasons , " particularly as an adhesive , Kaplan says .
Even though sprayable foaming polymers have found some serious applications , no one 's forgotten the silly spirit of the invention .
Army Sgt. Neil Gussman of Echo Company , 2nd Battalion , 104th Aviation , currently stationed in Iraq , can vouch for that .
" On our big , well - protected air base , we use Silly String as , well , Silly String .
People spray it on each other in the barracks , " he says .
Small businesses in California are being hit this year with double - digit hikes in health insurance costs that could hurt the state ’s economic recovery as companies curtail plans for hiring and expansion to pay their insurance bills .
Five major insurers in California ’s small - business market are raising rates 12 % to 23 % for firms with fewer than 50 employees , according to a survey by The Times .
Similar increases are being felt by many small businesses across the nation , including those in Texas , Ohio and Florida — mainly the result of escalating costs for medical care and pharmaceuticals , insurers say .
In California , some small businesses say they are stunned by their latest insurance bills .
Longtime customers of Blue Shield of California , for instance , are facing rate hikes as high as 76 % after the insurer lost money on a handful of plans .
“ We do n’t have that money , ” said Ann Terranova , a San Francisco financial planner who is dropping Blue Shield for herself and two employees after learning that their annual premium would jump to more than $ 19,000 a year from $ 11,000 .
Financial pressures are also squeezing Tessier Cabinet Co. , a 59 - year - old family business in Montclair .
Its president is reluctant to hire because of weak demand for his goods amid a 14 % rate hike from Kaiser Permanente .
“ I ’m ready to hang it up , ” Dan Tessier said .
Economists and small - business advocates worry that insurance costs — on top of taxes and rising wages —- will hamper the ability of small firms to expand and scare away new small companies .
Analysts point out that small businesses are responsible for creating most new jobs in California and are key to its economic recovery .
“ If healthcare costs and other costs go up , it ’s going to make it more difficult for small businesses to hire , and that lack of employment growth is going to be a drag on the economy , ” said Dennis Tootelian , director of the Center for Small Business at Cal State Sacramento .
“ Hiring is one of the most critical factors for getting the economy back on track . ”
Other experts believe higher costs could trigger an exodus of small firms .
“ If they have the option , they will probably think of doing business somewhere else , ” said Esmael Adibi , an economist at Chapman University in Orange .
Small firms nationwide are struggling with the problem as they worry about what the effect of the new national healthcare law .
It will impose billions of dollars in taxes on insurance companies and require mid-sized firms to provide insurance for workers or pay fines .
“ They are very concerned that their costs are n’t going to go down .
They ’re just going to go up , ” said Stephanie Cathcart , a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Independent Business in Washington .
“ They ’re going to be paying new taxes , new fees .
It ’s kind of a double whammy on them . ”
California insurers defend their rate hikes as sound and fair , saying they struggle to balance affordable rates with the need to remain competitive and turn a modest profit .
Blue Shield , for example , said hospital charges rose nearly 20 % last year , while physician costs and pharmaceutical fees increased almost as much .
Anthem Blue Cross also cited the cost of medical care in explaining its average rate hikes of 13 % this year .
“ We understand that one group that has been most hard hit by the economic downturn of the past few years is the state ’s more than 3 million small businesses , who we all rely on to be major contributors to our local economy , ” Anthem spokeswoman Peggy Hinz said .
“ We want to be competitive in the marketplace , but we also want to take care of our members , ” Hinz added .
“ We work each day to do both . ”
The high cost of insurance has become an urgent concern nationwide as businesses and individual policyholders struggle with fast - rising rates .
After a public uproar earlier this year , Anthem , California ’s largest for - profit insurer , canceled increases of as much as 39 % on individual policies .
As in the individual insurance market , small businesses have little leverage to negotiate for lower rates or more comprehensive benefits , often electing skimpier coverage to counter rising costs .
Overall premiums for small firms in California rose 180 % cumulatively over the last decade , according to the California Employer Health Benefits Survey .
Larger firms ’ rates increased 146 % .
Small businesses say 2010 is shaping up to be their most expensive year yet , leaving them with few good choices .
They say they can pass charges along to employees , reduce benefits , cancel insurance programs or raise the price of goods — an option few are willing to entertain because of competitive pressures .
“ They just do n’t have the profit margins to pay this cost , ” said insurance broker Scott Hauge , who heads Small Business California , an advocacy group .
“ It goes right to their bottom line .
It ’s a killer . ”
About half of the estimated 6 million Californians working in small businesses get insurance through their jobs .
Among the major insurers who serve the small - group market , Aetna and Blue Shield are each increasing premiums 18 % on average this year , although some Aetna customers who renew policies this summer will see increases of as much as 23 % , the company said .
Kaiser , the state ’s largest HMO , is raising rates 12 % on average .
Health Net Inc. said its customers would see “ low double - digit rate increases . ”
UnitedHealthcare declined to release its rates .
Not all the rising costs are related to inflation .
In some cases , insurers lost money because they priced plans too low and , as a result , are now introducing higher rates .
Blue Shield , for example , miscalculated the cost for three plans that pay all medical expenses once customers meet thresholds for out - of - pocket expenses .
The San Francisco insurer is now raising premiums as much as 76 % for some small businesses .
“ It turns out that people used a lot more medical care than we had anticipated , ” said Tom Epstein , Blue Shield ’s vice president of public affairs .
“ We need to increase the rates to cover the medical costs .
We ca n’t lose money on these products . ”
Many small firms say they feel a duty to provide health insurance , or see it as a necessary cost to attract qualified job candidates .
Either way , they predict that a continued rise in their healthcare bills will dampen their prospects for recovery .
“ Our margins will dwindle to nothing , ” said Bill Thomas , chief executive of U.S. Technical , an engineering firm in Fullerton .
“ It ’s the beginning of the end . ”

TRENTON
— More than 30 years ago , casino doors flung open in Atlantic City — a jubilant celebration of the first big gaming destination in the eastern United States .
Today , Gov. Chris Christie will tell New Jerseyans a special commission he appointed has found that crime , incompetent local government and ferocious competition leave him no choice but to take over the Atlantic City casino and entertainment district in order to save it .
And he really means takeover .
Almost all municipal powers , everything from policing to garbage pickup , would be run by the state .
But first , he will step to the 50 - yard line of the New Meadowlands Stadium , where he will say the state will not take the same gamble on its moribund horse racing industry .
The same commission that wants to save Atlantic City says the state should privatize horse racing and turn the once formidable New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority into a mere landlord .
Details of the commission ’s findings were first reported Wednesday by The Star - Ledger on NJ.com .
Reaction to the unprecedented plan was swift .
More coverage :
• Atlantic City officials , gamblers have mixed reactions on N.J. takeover of the casino district
• Christie 's proposal may lead to Meadowlands , Monmouth Park racetracks sale , closure

• N.J. gaming industry massive overhaul : Winners & Losers
• N.J. has a history of state takeovers of local governments , agencies
" It certainly is bold , and I give him marks for that , because we really need to do something , " said state Sen. Jeff Van Drew ( D - Cape May ) .
" We ca n’t just let Atlantic City die a slow death . "
But Sen. Raymond Lesniak ( D - Union ) was stunned , and said New Jersey was not adequately fighting back against competition from surrounding states .
" It ’s been nothing short of devastating , " he said .
" We have n’t done anything ... other than to circle the wagons and just allow the revenue base to Atlantic City to continually erode . "
A spokesman for the governor declined comment Wednesday , but a statement from his office Wednesday night said Christie will spell out a " blueprint for a strong sport and entertainment industry . "
Among the recommendations contained in the report , which was reviewed by the newspaper :
• The state would seek to transform Atlantic City into a convention and family friendly resort , including a major expansion of the boardwalk that would include amusement rides .
The entertainment areas would be placed under the control of a new state authority , essentially turning it into an independent city within a city .
• Money from the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority , now shared throughout the state , would stay in Atlantic City for projects and improvements there .
• The Meadowlands Racetrack could be sold for a token $ 1 , or turned into an off - track wagering facility without live horse racing .
• The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority would be all but disbanded , becoming simply a landlord for the facilities it now operates .
The Izod Center arena in the Meadowlands could be privatized or sold .
• The state would help re-finance the long - stalled Xanadu project in the Meadowlands , enabling a new developer to take control of the garish , high - visibility retail and entertainment complex alongside the New Jersey Turnpike that many consider an embarrassment .
Google ’s Android has seen an incredible rise in popularity since its first handset was launched less than two years ago .
Google has worked hard to earn that popularity , regularly releasing fantastic new improvements to the platform in the form of Donut , Eclaire , and now Froyo .
Unfortunately , many users of the Android ecosystem wo n’t see these improvements for years , if at all .
The reason ?
Manufacturers of Android handsets are building custom versions of the OS to add eye - candy and make the UI seem more attractive , at the expense of upgradeability .
HTC has its Sense UI and Motorola has MOTOBLUR .
Samsung and Sony have also thrown their hats into the “ heavily modified UI ” ring .
While these packages may serve to help differentiate from the competition , they are hammering the Android ecosystem by causing fragmentation ( and yes , I do think that ’s the right word ) .
But it is n’t all their fault .
One can certainly understand how , when competing against the likes of the iPhone , manufacturers would want to “ pretty up ” the Android experience .
So I ’ve got a few words for these OEMs , and Google as well .
Dear Google
I ’m really happy that you ’re ‘ laser focused ’ on the user experience for the next release .
Now that you ’ve got it humming at lightning speed with Froyo , it ’s time to add some polish .
Fantastic .
But making a better stock UI is n’t the only thing that needs to happen to prevent this fragmentation .
You should be doing everything you can to prevent version fragmentation because it ’s hurting developers and consumers .
When people with G1s see “ official Android Twitter client released ” but ca n’t download it , they ’ll get frustrated .
They do n’t know or care about the fact that the G1 ’s limited internal storage means that it ca n’t get the next upgrade , they only care that they ’re supposed to have an Android but they ca n’t get the software they want .
Here ’s my advice : take the feature lists of Sense and MOTOBLUR et al as a laundry list of areas where your API needs more robustness .
If the capabilities of Sense and MOTOBLUR were exposed at an application level , this problem would simply disappear .
You ’ve built your platform to be backwards - compatible ; if HTC wants to build a “ Sense UI ” app that changes the appearance of the UI and adds a bunch of widgets , and they want to make that only available on their handsets , more power to them .
When the next version of Android comes out , it ’ll all work seamlessly because they ’ve simply built an app , like any other developer .
So keep up the good work on Gingerbread , I ’m looking forward to the UI improvements .
But also make your UI reachable by applications , provide hooks into the very guts of Android so that manufacturers and developers alike can really “ make it their own ” without building a custom ROM .
Dear HTC / Motorola / Samsung / Etc .
Thank you for making Android handsets .
I ’m a huge supporter of the platform , and the level of competition and innovation on Android phones has been amazing .
Keep it up !
But you ’re doing yourselves a disservice by building these custom UIs that inhibit the Android version upgrade process .
Google has huge teams of people working to continuously upgrade the Android experience .
You get the fruits of this labor 100 % for free .
I understand that as a handset manufacturer the idea of upgradeable phones is n’t necessarily the most appealing : if people can upgrade the software on their phones , maybe they wo n’t want a new one in 2 years !
But trust me , you ’ve shown that you ’ll make the hardware good enough that people will want new phones .
Instead of locking down a handset to a specific Android version , create an unbeatable suite of applications that comes pre-loaded on your phone .
Work on top of , instead of within , the Android operating system .
Then you can leverage all of Google ’s work and all of your own work to provide customers with a great experience .
Work with Google to add pieces of API that will help you provide all of the value you want to provide ; I ’m sure Google would be happy to help as best it can .
Also , while I ’m at it , can one of you please create a 4.3 " handset running the stock Froyo UI sometime before November ?
I ’d love to get a big - screen phone when my contract ’s up , but I do n’t know that I can handle dealing with these custom UI jobs .
It ’s just not for me .
Unicorns and Rainbows
I think that Android is a very important project that came along at just the right time .
It has applications far beyond mobile handsets and we ’ll begin seeing Android in cars , tablets , and more in the very near future .
This will mean even more work will be poured into the Android ecosystem creating greater and greater benefits for everyone from consumers to handset manufacturers .
All that needs to happen to take advantage of those benefits is for Google to help handset manufacturers free themselves of the idea that they need to “ make it their own ” .
I ’m looking forward to the next 40 Android phones , and the 100 after that .
I truly think that Android is going to dominate the mobile market five years from now ( Apple will still have about the same piece of the pie , but Android will have displaced RIM and Microsoft entirely ) .
So keep up the good work , but how about we all just get along in the meantime .
After switching to a Mac recently , I decided to put my old laptop up for sale to help recoup a little of the Mac cost .

After letting Becca ( I can call her that cause we ’re tight ) know my PayPal email address , she immediately sent me the payment .
But , as I expected , this was a Nigerian scam .
The payment emailed looked very real , although the color scheme was a little off .
Just to be sure , I checked my PayPal account to make sure there really was n’t an extra $ 500 in it .
There was n’t .
My dreams of receiving a bonus $ 100 for my old laptop were crushed .

Stuff like this puts me on the side of the Nigerian scammers .
If people in the U.S. are n’t suspicious of free money , PayPal payments that look fake , the absence of a payment in their account , fake emails from PayPal ’s FBI department or just Nigerians in general , then they deserve to have their money taken from them .
If I had n’t noticed this was a scam already , then this email would have let me know .
I could n’t believe they ’d try to draw attention to themselves like this when a person otherwise might have gone ahead and mailed the laptop out .
I also got another email from Rebecca , accusing me of being a scammer .

I ’m sorry , but I ran out of toilet paper so I ended up using the
receipt to wipe my bottom .
You ’ll just have to trust me that I sent
it to you .
That ’s what Jesus would do .
Be more like Jesus .
At some point during this exchange , someone gave me the idea to mail them a fake laptop for my fake payment .
It seemed only fair .
I think it was Angela that came up with this , but it ’s been so long ( over a month ! ) that I do n’t remember .
Instead of doing it myself , I told my kids all about Nigerian scammers and asked if they would make me a fake laptop to mail to this guy .
Er , I mean girl , because I ’m sure she was n’t lying to me about that .
I cut out pieces of cardboard , using my real laptop to make them the right size .
Then Emily and Payton began drawing a laptop on the pieces .
Emily quickly got bored with it , but Payton finished it all up , even copying the vents and screw holes on the bottom .
The last picture shows the top of the closed cardboard laptop .
For hinges we used black electrical tape .
It was Payton ’s idea to make the screen show the Google homepage , but I had him write “ Nigerian scammers ” into the search box .
I shipped it the next morning at the cost of around $ 9.00 , which almost made me feel bad about all the extra money she sent me for shipping .
On the customs form , I put the value at $ 500 and the description said “ cardboard art . ”
I ’m not completely sure of this , but I think Nigerians have to pay a small percentage of the value to customs , so putting a high price on the customs form hopefully cost them a little money .
Although the post office promised me that it would arrive in about 10 days , I did n’t hear back from Becca until this morning .
As I was eating a bowl of Frosted Flakes , she begins messaging me .
9:25 AM : rebecca : you are stupid for what you did
9:26 AM : rebecca : you are crazy
9:27 AM : me : why do you think that ?
9:27 AM : rebecca : what did you ship to my boss
9:28 AM : me : a Dell laptop , just like you ordered
9:28 AM : rebecca : is that a laptop
9:28 AM : me : of course
9:29 AM : rebecca : ypou are crazy
9:30 AM : me : what are you talking about ?
did the laptop not work ?
9:32 AM : me : please tell me what ’s wrong with it
9:35 AM : rebecca : suck my divck
9:35 AM : me : what ’s a divck ?
10:08 AM : me : please do n’t be mad at me
10:18 AM : me : helllloooo ?
10:18 AM : me : talk to me rebecca !
Soon after that chat , she tried to voice chat with me on Google , but I could n’t do that since I was on the phone .
I ’ve tried talking to her a few more times , but she refuses to answer me now .
3:30 PM : me : sorry i ca n’t voice chat with you .
i do n’t have a microphone
3:32 PM : me : i really would like to work out any problems you might have with the laptop though
3:33 PM : me : maybe you could turn it on and i could help you troubleshoot from here
3:37 PM : me : let me know when you ’re there and we ’ll get started
3:48 PM : me : are you ready to troubleshoot yet , rebecca ?
So that ’s about it .
Tee hee !
Interesting that she said she has a boss .
Guess she ’s just a minion that does the scamming since she ’s so good with her people skills and it gets sent to the boss .
Kind of like a pimp / ho relationship .
I ’ll keep trying to chat with her and append anything else that happens to this post , but I doubt she ’ll say anything more to me .
2 years later update : Jesus , people , I know this scammer was from Nigeria because I SENT THE PACKAGE TO NIGERIA .
Quit accusing me of being racist and hating all Nigerians and teaching my kids to stereotype .
Glenn Greenwald was on “ The Dylan Ratigan Show ” at MSNBC discussing the Obama Administration ’s extension of the previous administration ’s extrajudicial assassination program to include citizens of the U.S. ( h/t : Scott Horton – 3:28 ) :
The Obama Administration has asserted the privilege to assassinate American citizens who the government believes to have joined anti-American organizations it labels as ‘ terrorist groups ’ .
The number of these Americans are in the dozens , the president ’s advisor at the Department of Homeland Security said last week in an interview with The Washington Times .
“ There are , in my mind , dozens of U.S. persons who are in different parts of the world , and they are very concerning to us , ” John Brennan , deputy national security adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism , said in the interview .
Eli Lake , who reported the interview , added :
The remarks came in response to questions about procedures used by the president to order lethal strikes on U.S. citizens who have joined al Qaeda or other terrorist groups .
On Feb. 3 , Dennis C. Blair , then director of national intelligence , said in congressional testimony that special permission must first be obtained by military or intelligence forces before what he termed “ direct action ” strikes against American citizens .
The Administration granted “ special permission ” in April — to assassinate Anwar al - Awlaki , a Yemen - based cleric from New Mexico .
“ The reasons for Awlaki ’s impending assassination are vague , to say the least , ” Jason Ditz wrote in April at AntiWar News . ”
Though officials have repeatedly accused Awlaki of being ‘ in al - Qa’ida , ’ he is not currently accused of any crimes and the only specific accusation against him is that he has criticized U.S. foreign policy , and that this has made it easier for al - Qa’ida to recruit . ”
Mr. Lake ’s report continued :
The main weapon in recent C.I.A. and U.S. military counterterrorism operations has been attacks with missile - equipped unmanned aerial vehicles in Afghanistan , Iraq , Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen .
The administration has said it has killed dozens or perhaps scores of terrorists with these strikes over the past several years .
That practice was criticized in a report earlier this month authored by Philip Alston , the independent U.N. investigator on extrajudicial killings , who said the practice may violate international humanitarian law .
The American Civil Liberties Union in a letter to Mr. Obama on April 28 warned that the current program to kill terrorists in foreign countries would create a precedent for other countries to kill suspected terrorists all over the world .
The American - born cleric and U.S. citizen who now resides in Yemen is thought to be high on the list of those targeted for killing by the United States .
Mr. Brennan would not comment on the details of lethal operations or the procedure for targeting Americans .
“ If a person is a U.S. citizen , and he is on the battlefield in Afghanistan or Iraq trying to attack our troops , he will face the full brunt of the U.S. military response , ” Mr. Brennan said .
“ If an American person or citizen is in a Yemen or in a Pakistan or in Somalia or another place , and they are trying to carry out attacks against U.S. interests , they also will face the full brunt of a U.S. response .
And it can take many forms . ”
Mr. Brennan added , “ To me , terrorists should not be able to hide behind their passports and their citizenship , and that includes U.S. citizens , whether they are overseas or whether they are here in the United States .
What we need to do is to apply the appropriate tool and the appropriate response . ”
Glenn Greenwald at Salon noted the red herring used by Mr. Brennan to manufacture consent for this draconian , authoritarian policy of the worst kind [ italics his ] :
That theory — the whole world is a battlefield , even the U.S. — was the core premise that spawned 8 years of Bush / Cheney radicalism , and it has been adopted in full by the Obama Administration ( indeed , it was that “ whole - world - is-a- battlefield ” theory which Elena Kagan explicitly endorsed during her confirmation hearing for Solicitor General ) .
Mr. Lake noted at the end of his article :
Mr. Brennan toward the end of the interview acknowledged that , despite some differences , there is considerable continuity between the counterterrorism policies of President Bush and President Obama .
Mr. Greenwald added that the greatest extension of the Bush Administration to the current regime is the “ due- process - free policy ” of ‘ criminal justice ’ — a policy that was widely criticized by the former administration for its execution of warrantless domestic surveillance on American citizens .
He added how this is being exported to Afghanistan :
There , the U.S. last year compiled a “ hit list ” of 50 Afghan citizens whose assassination it authorized on the alleged ground ( never charged or convicted ) that they were drug “ kingpins ” or funding the Talbian [ sic ] .
Afghan officials resisted this policy .
To which , Mr. Greenwald wrote :
In other words , Afghans — the people we ’re occupying in order to teach about Freedom and Democracy — are far more protective of due process and the rule of law for their own citizens than Americans are who meekly submit to Obama ’s identical policy of assassination for their fellow citizens .
It might make more sense for Afghanistan to invade and occupy the U.S. in order to spread the rule of law and constitutional values here .
What makes all this most remarkable is the level of screeching protests Democrats engaged in when Bush merely wanted to eavesdrop on and detain Americans without any judicial oversight or due process .
Remember all that ?
Click here and here for a quick refresher .
Yet here is Barack Obama doing far worse to them than that without any due process or judicial oversight — he ’s targeting them for assassination — and there is barely a peep of protest from the same Party that spent years depicting “ mere ” warrantless eavesdropping and due- process - free detention to be the acts of a savage , lawless tyrant .
In all honesty , the ‘ Team America ’ bunch ought to be up in arms about this as well .
If American exceptionalism is a valid concept , would n’t Americans have the greatest right to due process ?
Is n’t due process something inherently ‘ American ’ to those idiots ?
Or do they now have to admit that the concept of American exceptionalism is a silly superstition and that due process is a vital construct to defending the most fundamental rights of man — no matter what their passport says on the cover ?
When we can accept that rights belong to humans and are not bestowed by geographical dirt , the “ secret war ” of assassination run amok in 75 countries by the Obama Administration — compared to 60 at the beginning of 2009 left active by his predecessor — in Yemen , Somalia , Philippines , Colombia and elsewhere in Latin America , Africa , the Middle East and Central Asia , are absolutely wrong and ought not be tolerated by any person of any sort of virtue .

During the 1950s and 1960s , some otherwise freedom - loving governments waged secret wars against suspected homosexuals within their borders .
During those years , Canada ’s campaign to eliminate all homosexuals from the military , police , and the civil service was particularly broad and unforgiving , with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) compiling files on over 9,000 suspected homosexuals .
Reports indicate that the RCMP created Security Service subsection A - 3 in the 1950s , whose sole purpose was the identification and dismissal of every gay person in public service .
Perhaps the most disturbing element of their campaign was a government - owned device known only as the “ Fruit Machine . ”
It resembled a dentist ’s chair , but it also had various sensors , a camera to monitor the pupils , and a black box situated in front of the subject to display pictures .
Subjects were told that the machine was used for measuring stress , yet its purpose was something else entirely ; it was intended to identify whether the subject was gay .
A series of images would display on the monitor as the subject ’s pupils , perspiration level , and heart rate were monitored for involuntary “ erotic response . ”
Some images were mundane , while others were sexually explicitly photos of men and women .
If the machine detected erotic response to certain images , the subject was assumed to be a homosexual .
In Britain , the term “ fruit machine ” is another term for the slot machines used in gambling .
Given the questionable science and unreliability at work in Canada ’s sinister fruit machine , theirs had more in common with its British namesake than it did with any actual scientific measuring devices .
Yet the results of the fruit machine tests were used to fire thousands of people over the years .
The fruit machine was in use until the late 1960s when the government pulled all funding for the project .
However that did not mark the end of the efforts to remove homosexuals from government service , and the RCMP continued to compile dossiers on suspected gays for years .
A similar device called a plethysmograph , which connected directly to the subject ’s genitals , was used for similar purposes after the fruit machine was retired , but the Canadian government eventually put a halt to the RCMP ’s anti-homosexual activities .
Plethysmographs are still in use today in investigating suspected pedophiles , but their accuracy is highly controversial .

June 11 , 2010 -- Pentagon investigators are trying to determine the whereabouts of the Australian - born founder of the secretive website Wikileaks for fear that he may be about to publish a huge cache of classified State Department cables that , if made public , could do serious damage to national security , government officials tell The Daily Beast .
The officials acknowledge that even if they found the website founder , Julian Assange , it is not clear what they could do to block publication of the cables on Wikileaks , which is nominally based on a server in Sweden and bills itself as a champion of whistleblowers .
American officials said Pentagon investigators are convinced that Assange is in possession of at least some classified State Department cables leaked by a 22 - year - old Army intelligence specialist , Bradley Manning of Potomac , Maryland , who is now in custody in Kuwait .
And given the contents of the cables , the feds have good reason to be concerned .
As The Daily Beast reported June 8 , Manning , while posted in Iraq , apparently had special access to cables prepared by diplomats and State Department officials throughout the Middle East , regarding the workings of Arab governments and their leaders , according to an American diplomat .
The cables , which date back over several years , went out over interagency computer networks available to the Army and contained information related to American diplomatic and intelligence efforts in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq , the diplomat said .
American officials would not discuss the methods being used to find Assange , nor would they say if they had information to suggest where he is now .
" We 'd like to know where he is ; we 'd like his cooperation in this , " one U.S. official said of Assange .
Assange , who first gained notoriety as a computer hacker , is as secretive as his website and has no permanent home .
He was in the United States as recently as several weeks ago , when he gave press interviews to promote the website 's release of an explosive 2007 video of an American helicopter attack in Baghdad that left 12 people dead , including two employees of the news agency Reuters .
CLICK HERE TO READ THE FULL STORY AT THE DAILY BEAST
Wikileaks has not replied directly to email messages from The Daily Beast .
However , in cryptic messages he sent this week via Twitter , Wikileaks referred to an earlier Daily Beast article on the investigation of Manning and said that it " looks like we 're about to be attacked by everything the U.S. has . "
In an earlier post , the site said that allegations that " we have been sent 260,000 classified U.S. embassy cables are , as far as we can tell , incorrect . "
This morning , a new Wikileaks tweet went out : " Any signs of unacceptable behavior by the Pentagon or its agents towards this press will be viewed dimly . "
I have never been sexually harassed .
Walking down the street , I have never had a stranger say anything suggestive or complimentary about my appearance ( though one night last summer a homeless man in Midtown Manhattan did sneer “ Nice get - up ” as I passed by in yellow shorts and a bright blue polyester shirt with a huge collar ) .
So when I first tried Hey Baby , a new Web game that takes aim at catcalling and its practitioners , I thought it was not meant for me .
Developed by the New York artist and producer Suyin Looui , Hey Baby at first appears to be a self - consciously ridiculous revenge fantasy for women who have felt oppressed or threatened by sexual attention or commentary from men .
Think of “ Death Wish ” with a woman walking home from work in the role of Charles Bronson .
Yet over several hours my initial alienation and annoyance gave way to a swelling appreciation of Hey Baby , not as a game but as a provocative , important work of interactive art as social commentary .
The people who should really play Hey Baby are men , even if you have never said a word to a woman you did n’t know on the street .
The game , playable free at heybabygame.com , is quite simple .

Two people waited as lookouts at the Knollwood Gardens apartments while a 17 - year - old prostitute serviced a resident in his apartment , police allege .
Two 17 - year - old girls and two alleged clients have been arrested for engaging in prostitution , Middletown police say .
Also arrested was 20 - year - old Richard Burges , of Thousand Oaks Drive , who was charged with acting as the girls ’ pimp .
Here ’s the press release issued Tuesday morning :
On April 19 , 2010 police responded to a suspicious incident at the Knollwood Gardens Apartment complex located in Middletown .
Ptl. Adam Colfer responded to the apartment complex and located Richard Burges , age 20 , from Thousand Oaks Drive in Middletown , and a 17 year old female also from Middletown , in the parking lot .
The subjects advised the officer that they were waiting for a friend .
Ptl. Colfer cleared from the scene only to receive another call a short time later .
Police continued their investigation and determined that Burges and the female were actually waiting for another 17 year old Middletown female who was inside one of the apartments working as a prostitute .
Detectives Pete White and Kelly Godley then joined the investigation .
Over the next week detectives determined that Burges had negotiated a price , arranged for and transported the girl to the apartment in order to provide sex to one of its occupants .
Burges and the other 17 year old female were actually acting as look outs when the police had initially responded to the area .
The detectives continued their investigation and on April 26 , 2010 charged Sajeet Singh and a subject named Deepak , both from Knollwood Drive in Middletown , with two counts each of engaging in prostitution with a person under the age of 18 .
The two subjects are employees at the BP gas station in Middletown where they met Berges and arranged the deal .
Further investigation by the detectives resulted in both 17 year old females being charged as well .
One of the females was charged with Prostitution , Possession of Methadone and Possession of Zanax .
The other female was charged with Prostitution , Possession of Methadone , Possession of Zanax and Promoting Prostitution .
Detectives discovered that both females had engaged in prostitution at the apartment in recent weeks .
The one juvenile was additionally charged with Promoting Prostitution for assisting in the transportation of the other juvenile and then serving as a lookout while she engaged in prostitution .
Both subjects were released to their parents .
Burges was charged with Promoting Prostitution and was transported to the Monmouth County Correctional Facility in Freehold on a $ 5,000.00 with 10 % bail .
Police are asking anyone with further information to contact Detectives White or Godley at ( 732 ) 615-2120 .
The detectives were also assisted by Ptl. Michael Reuter and Sgt. Paul Bailey .

Q returns to the Enterprise , testing Commander Riker by giving him the power of the Q .
Contents show ]
Summary
Teaser
Having dropped Deanna Troi's shuttlecraft off at Starbase G - 6 , the USS Enterprise - D is fortunately close to the Sigma III solar system , when its Federation colony transmits an urgent call for medical help .
An accidental explosion has devastated a mining operation there .
There are 504 colonists at the site .
En route to the mining colony at warp 9.1 , the Enterprise is once again trapped in Q's force field grid .
Q appears as an Aldebaran serpent on the bridge of the Enterprise , and informs the bridge crew that the Q Continuum , after studying their recent contact with Humanity , are mostly impressed by them and wishes to discuss it .
Picard urgently asks to wait until they 've completed their mission , but Q demands he abandon it .
He then changes into a Starfleet admiral .
Act One
Picard again says that he will listen to Q's offer of the realization of their " impossible dreams , " but only following their rescue mission .
Q , however , disagrees , and turns himself towards Riker , asking what he finds of Q's offer .
Riker says that they do not have time for Q's " games , " which triggers Q's excitement .
He transports Riker , Data , La Forge , Yar , and Worf off the bridge to a class M planetoid , appearing before them in the uniform of a Napoleonic marshal .
Picard is left alone and unable to contact anyone in the ship .
Q colorfully engages them in a Napoleonic - era campaign tent , declaring that the point of his game will be to stay alive .
He promises a great future for Humankind if they win , but something " disastrous " if they lose .
Furthermore , the game will be completely unfair , brushing off fairness as a Human concept .
Yar protests , and Q transports her away into a " penalty box , " but , unbeknownst to the crew , she is really back on the Enterprise .
He says , that if anyone else violates the rules of the game , he will be put in the penalty box , displacing Tasha into nothingness .
Act Two
Back on the Enterprise , Picard paces around the bridge , powerless to do anything .
He laments that even the log entry system does n't work , as it feeds back and distorts his voice every time he tries to speak .
Just then , Yar re-appears on the bridge and explains her situation to Picard .
Being controlled by Q's whims has left her off - balance and she is so fed up that she is on the verge of tears .
Picard tries to comfort her , but she is ashamed of herself for even thinking about showing weakness , especially in front of Picard .
Picard reassures her that showing emotion is not a sign of weakness , and Yar hints at what their relationship could be if he were n't captain .
Suddenly , Q appears before Yar and Picard , apparently bored with the display the two officers have made , and says that Yar 's penalty is now over .
While seated in the captain 's chair , he makes a starlog entry for Picard , explaining that the real intent of his game is to test whether the ship 's first officer is worthy of the greatest gift the Q can offer .
They make a bet : Picard 's command against Q's keeping out of Humanity 's path forever .
Q then promptly tells Picard that he has already lost as Riker will be offered something impossible to refuse .
Picard then confronts Q in his ready room .
Q sits in his chair , reading one of Shakespeare 's works .
Picard asks why Q is demonstrating a " need " for Humans through this confrontation , instead of providing a simple , direct explanation , a statement of what he seeks .
Through Q's recitation , Picard understands that how Humans respond to a game tells him more about them .
Q proposes to continue and quote some Hamlet for him .
Picard refuses , and quotes him instead : " What a piece of work is man !
How noble in reason !
How infinite in faculty , in form , in moving , how express and admirable .
In action , how like an angel ; in apprehension , how like a god … " Q stands up in objection from his chair , and responds that surely Picard does n't see Humanity like that .
Picard answers that he sees Humanity as one day becoming like that , and perhaps that is what the Q fear .
Q , obviously irritated by Picard , throws the large Shakespeare book at him and then disappears .
Meanwhile , down on the planetoid , Riker , Data , and La Forge discuss the situation while Worf gathers reconnaissance .
Apparently , aliens dressed in 18th century French uniforms are heading their way , armed with ancient muskets .
Data explains that muskets are inferior to their phasers .
The muskets , however , turn out to have phaser power .
Q , appearing as Data before Riker , tells him that he now has the power of the Q , and is able to transport his crewmates back to the ship .
He does so , and is amazed .
Act Three
Back aboard Enterprise , all systems are again functioning , and the Q grid has disappeared .
There is no sign anything happened , and no others noticed anything .
Data , La Forge , and Worf appear back on the bridge , where Picard explains to them Q has shown some kind of interest in their first officer .
On the planetoid , Riker and Q discuss the powers Q has granted Riker .
Interestingly , the rank insignia that Q now carries on his uniform is that of a Starfleet commander , implying they are now equals .
Riker asks what Q wants from him .
Q replies that the Continuum has granted them a gift , beyond all other gifts .
He explains that , before Farpoint Station , they saw Humanity as savages only .
However , they discovered instead that Humans are unusual creatures , in their own limited ways .
He also states that since Humans are constantly evolving , they may eventually become stronger than the Q one day .
Riker rejects Q's powers , and Q disappears .
Suddenly , the bridge crew , including Picard but also Wesley Crusher , appear on the planetoid 's surface again , while they are approached by the soldier creatures Q created .
Now unarmed , only Riker 's powers can save the crew now .
Worf is stabbed by a bayonet from one of the animal soldiers , and after Crusher runs to his rescue , the acting ensign is killed as well .
Frustrated and angry , Riker uses his new - found powers to create a Q - style force field around the soldiers , and transports the crew back to the Enterprise , healing Worf and Crusher in the process .
Picard is stunned .
Act Four
The Enterprise , meanwhile , has arrived at the mining colony .
In Picard 's ready room , Riker guarantees Picard that he will be strong enough not to use the power of the Q .
An away team beams down to the mining colony , and they find a small group of people seriously injured .
They find a young child underneath some rocks .
Dr. Crusher says it is too late , and that the child has died .
Riker is faced with the dilemma of whether to bring the child back to life .
He says that he is prevented from doing so by a promise .
He shows his frustration to Picard on the Enterprise and surprisingly demands a meeting with the senior staff from him .
The senior staff , including Wesley , meets on the bridge .
Riker explains that even though he has been granted unusual powers , he is not a monster , that he is still the same William Riker they know .
Picard reminds him that he has already changed , for example , by not addressing him as captain .
Riker doubts that his decision not to save the child was right , comparing it to when he saved the Enterprise crew earlier , however , Picard reminds him that that was a fiction Q created .
He tries to convince Riker that the Q do not admire Humans , but that they have muddled Riker 's mind .
Then , Q appears as a medieval monk on the bridge .
Act Five
Picard furiously asks Q why he takes on so many guises , " Have you no identity of your own ? " Q retorts , " I forgive your blasphemy . "
Riker asks to give each of the senior staff something they 'd most like .
Dr. Crusher asks Wesley to leave with her .
Riker , however , knowing that his young friend wishes he was older , turns Wesley into an adult , aging him ten years in an instant .
He offers to make Data Human , but the android declines , saying that it will never feel real to him .
Data then quotes Shakespeare to drive his point home and says " this above all , to thine own self be true . "
Riker then walks to La Forge , granting him his vision .
After taking in the view of Quadra Sigma III ( and taking a long look at Tasha Yar 's " beautiful " face ) , La Forge also declines Riker 's gift , telling the commander that " the price is too high " and he does not like who he has to thank .
Riker then creates a Klingon female as a mate for Worf .
Worf , however , says that there is no place for the female in his life .
Wesley also asks Riker to make him young again .
It is n't until Q says " But it 's easier , boy !
Listen to Riker ! " that Riker realizes his mistake .
He admits he feels like a fool , and Picard comforts him by confirming that he should .
Picard then walks up to Q , pulls off his hood and tells him to uphold their wager .
Q stomps around the bridge , recalling no wager .
Picard replies that his fellow Q will remember that because he failed to turn Riker , he 'll promise to stay out of Humanity 's way forever .
Thunder sounds on the Enterprise bridge , and Q is abruptly called back to the Continuum , screaming for a second chance .
For the Enterprise crew , it is as if they had just returned from their rescue mission , like no time had passed in between .
Data asks the captain how the Q can handle space and time so well , while they handle interactions with Humans so badly .
Picard answers that they may one day learn that space and time are easier to handle than the Human equation .

Background information
Production history
Story and script
This episode represented Maurice Hurley 's first contribution to TNG .
Gene Roddenberry gave him the episode as a rewrite assignment .
However , Roddenberry was thereafter so disappointed with his work on the episode that he ignored Hurley whenever they passed each other in the hallway at Paramount , which was about four or five times a day .
( William Shatner Presents : Chaos on the Bridge ) Ultimately , the script was rewritten by Roddenberry to such an extent that Hurley requested the pseudonym " C. J. Holland " be used instead of his own name for the episode credits .
( Star Trek : The Next Generation Companion 2nd ed. , p. 42 )
Cast and characters
Marina Sirtis ( Deanna Troi ) does not appear in this episode .
This is her first non-appearance .
The revised final draft screenplay submitted only three days prior to filming featured Deanna Troi which suggests that Marina Sirtis ' sudden unavailability was the reason for her non-appearance .
Her lines were eventually cut from the episode or transferred to other characters ( mostly Tasha Yar ) and Picard 's log entry explaining her absence ( a trip home ) was written for the beginning of the teaser .
Costumes and sets
Q is wearing a French marshal uniform .
Many marshal uniform versions existed , so this version seems plausible .
His bicorne holds a tricolor cockade from the French Empire era ( blue in center , red in middle , and white outwards , a color order used until 1812 ) .
The musket - wielding aliens who attacked the crew of the Enterprise - D wear uniforms which seem a mixed version of an old British red coat and / or French royal army ( these nations shared the same colors , blue being predominant in France and red in the UK ) .
Furthermore , their uniforms even show a typical British crown on their hat .
However , Data states that " muskets are appropriate to the 1790 - 1800 French uniform . "

And the hits just keep on hitting for Motorola Android handset owners .
In a post on the Motorola Owners forum , Moto ’s Eurpean Marketing Director James King makes the following statement about the status of the Milestone getting Froyo in the near future :
Next European Milestone and 2.2 ( Froyo ) .
I have expressed over the last few days that the decision is pending .
The team here has been collating key pieces of information and views from this community in the last month and providing input to relevant teams in Motorola so they are aware .
I am pushing for that decision to be made as quickly as possible , and we can then all go from there .
Some others ask why the decisions on upgrades take so long , and why does implementation then take much longer still .
What I can say and have stated recently is that upgrades are not a walk in the park .
Sure there are short cuts that people can take , but when you have to integrate software to a specific hardware , then test it and integrate with third party applications , let alone any innovation from ourselves , plus then get approvals to make this all official and safe … its is a big undertaking that requires planning and resource and third party coordination to see this all through .
As I say , once we have decision , we will inform .
JK
So for those of you who bought the device because it was advertised as a “ Flash - ready ” device , it seems your wait is going to be an extended one .
From this statement , it does not even look like Motorola has even begun development on an upgrade package .
This statement highlights the need for Google to develop an outstanding UI with Gingerbread , so that handset makers wo n’t need to put non-vanilla Android on their units .
Updates to phones with Motoblur are delayed because of the issues stated above and along with that is the bottom line , upgrades cost the handset maker money , money on which they will not see a return .
For you Milestone owners , you have our sympathy , it seems like Motorola is making some missteps lately with their handsets , promising one thing but delivering another .
I hope that you do get your Froyo update in the near future .
More info as we get it .

NEW DELHI : The Indian rupee will soon have a unique symbol — a blend of the Devanagri ' Ra ' and Roman ' R ' — joining elite currencies like the US dollar , euro , British pound and Japanese yen in having a distinct identity .
The new symbol , designed by Bombay IIT post - graduate D Udaya Kumar , was approved by the cabinet today — reflecting that the Indian currency , backed by an over - trillion dollar economy , was finally making its presence felt on the international scene .
" It 's a big statement on the Indian currency ...
The symbol would lend a distinctive character and identity to the currency and further highlight the strength and global face of the Indian economy , " Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni told reporters after the cabinet meeting .
Though the symbol will not be printed or embossed on currency notes or coins , it would be included in the ' Unicode Standard ' and major scripts of the world to ensure that it is easily displayed and printed in the electronic and print media .
Among currencies with distinctive identities , only the pound sterling has its symbol printed on the notes .
Unicode is an international standard that allows text data to be interchanged globally without conflict .
After incorporation in the global and Indian codes , the symbol would be used by all individuals and entities within and outside the country .
The symbol will be adopted in a span of six months in the country , and within 18 to 24 months globally , Soni said , adding that it will feature on computer keyboards and softwares for worldwide use .
Soni said that the symbol , which reflects the Indian ethos and culture , would help distinguish the currency from the rupee or rupiah of other countries like Pakistan , Nepal , Sri Lanka and Indonesia .
Besides this , state governments would be asked to proactively promote the use of the new symbol , she added .
Kumar 's entry was chosen from 3,000 designs competing for the currency symbol .
He will get an award of Rs 2.5 lakh .
" It is a perfect blend of Indian and Roman letters — capital ' R ' and Devanagri ' Ra ' which represents rupaiah , to appeal to international and Indian audiences ...
My design is based on the tricolour , with two lines at the top and white space in between , " a visibly - happy Kumar said .
The jury , which had sent the five short - listed entries for the cabinet 's approval , was headed by a Reserve Bank Deputy Governor .

CHINA executes more of its own citizens than any other country , and more than all others in the world combined .
“ Thousands ” of Chinese were executed in 2009 according to Amnesty International 's annual study , which states that an exact number is impossible to determine because information on the death penalty is regarded as a state secret .
But this gruesome record may yet change .
The National People 's Congress is reported to be reducing the number of offences that are punishable by execution .
Among the crimes that currently carry the death penalty are bribing an official and stealing historical relics .
Demonstrators chant slogans as they welcome activists returning from Israel at the airport in Istanbul , Turkey , early Thursday .
(( Vadim Ghirda / Associated Press ) )
Thousands cheered the return of hundreds of activists who arrived by plane in Turkey and Greece early Thursday after being deported from Israel following Monday 's raid on a Gaza - bound aid flotilla .
Most of those returning were Turkish and were greeted at the airport by Turkey 's Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc and several Turkish lawmakers .
" They faced barbarism and oppression but returned with pride , " Arinc said .
A few thousand jubilant relatives and supporters , waving Palestinian and Turkish flags , burst into applause outside the airport , chanting " God is Great , " The Associated Press reported .
They later walked to the perimeters near the tarmac to see their loved ones .
Another crowd celebrated their return in downtown Istanbul .
Turkey 's prime minister has accused Israel of a " bloody massacre " and officials in Turkey have called for an international investigation of the raid .
Meanwhile , a Greek plane carrying 35 activists landed at a military airport near Athens as more than 100 relatives and supporters cheered and shouted pro-Palestinian slogans .
Seven planes had been used to deport 527 activists , Israeli Interior Ministry spokeswoman Sabine Haddad said .
Seven other activists remained in Israeli hospitals for treatment of wounds suffered during the Israeli raid , she said .
The Israeli Foreign Ministry said three activists from Ireland , Australia and Italy remained in detention over " documentation and other issues , " without elaborating .
At least nine people were killed when six ships trying to break the three - year blockade of Gaza were raided by Israeli commandos early Monday .
The bodies of the nine were on the first plane .
Others activists were from Arab countries , Europe and the United States .
Three Canadian activists were also deported .
Israel had said it will not prosecute dozens of activists detained in the raid , opting instead to deport them all immediately in an apparent effort to limit the diplomatic damage from the raid .
" Keeping them here would do more damage to the country 's vital interests than good , " Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein wrote in the order .
" We will never apologize for defending ourselves . "
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier , adding Israel regrets the loss of life , but added ,
At a news conference in Jerusalem on Wednesday , Netanyahu responded to international condemnation of the raid .
The raid prompted international criticism and fresh calls to lift the blockade of Gaza , although the details of what happened during the military raid are still not entirely clear .
Israeli soldiers had no choice but to respond with force and other countries of the world , under similar circumstances , would do the same , Netanyahu said .
" The way we exercise [ our right to defend ourselves ] under these conditions of duress , under the rocketing of our cities and under the impending killing of our soldiers , you know that we exercise it in a way that is commensurate with any leaders , " he said .
Netanyahu said he has spoken with world leaders about the issue .
" I say the same thing to the international community : What will you do ?
How would you stop thousands of rockets that are destined to attack your cities , your civilians , your children ?
How would your soldiers behave under similar circumstances ?
I think that in your hearts you all know the truth . "
Meanwhile , a Canadian citizen alleged he was detained and beaten during the raid .
While Netanyahu said his soldiers acted in self - defence after meeting violent resistance , Rifat Audeh , told CBC News the activists were unarmed civilians .
Rifat Audeh ( ( Submitted photo ) )
Israel has said the activists were armed with metal rods , knives , slingshots and two pistols snatched from the troops .
Israel has defended its military action and said the blockade is necessary for its security .
Audeh , who says he was aboard one of the ships , told CBC News that Israeli troops beat him when they boarded the ship and bound his hands .
" They beat me actually , the Israeli soldiers beat me on the ship , " said Audeh , who has been released and sent to Jordan .
" We were detained for an extensive period of time and were not allowed to go to the washrooms or anything like that , or sleep , " Audeh said .
" It 's been a rough 24 to 48 hours , let 's put it that way . "
Audeh is one of three Canadians who were detained during the raid , according to reports .
Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said at least 60 journalists were accompanying the humanitarian aid flotilla headed to Gaza .
The Paris - based media advocacy group said the journalists should not be confused with activists and urged Israeli authorities to release them — along with their equipment .
The group said Wednesday it knew of 16 journalists held at Beersheba detention centre , including some from major Western dailies The Sydney Morning Herald and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung .
On Tuesday , the United Nations Security Council issued a statement calling for a prompt and impartial inquiry into the raid .
The statement also said the current situation in Gaza was " not sustainable . "
Reports suggest pro-Palestinian activists plan on sending more ships to Gaza .
Image caption Critics of China say the cheap yuan is giving exporters an unfair advantage
China has indicated it will allow the yuan to rise against the dollar and other Western currencies .
The Chinese central bank announced it would make its exchange rate mechanism " more flexible " , but it gave no details about the timing or extent of changes .
The yuan has been effectively pegged to the dollar , drawing criticism that China was protecting its exporters .
US President Barack Obama and the head of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) welcomed China 's announcement .
The US had been particularly critical of Beijing , accusing it of keeping its currency artificially weak .
The yuan has been held at about 6.83 to the dollar since July 2008 .
The Central Bank said the proposed exchange rate reform had been made possible by the global recovery .
China 's decision to increase the flexibility of its exchange rate is a constructive step Barack Obama
But it appeared to rule out a major appreciation , saying there was " no basis for big fluctuations or changes " .
The BBC's Damien Grammaticas says the announcement may be seen as an attempt to preempt criticism of China 's currency policies at a summit of the G20 group of industrialised and developing countries next week in Canada , where Mr Obama will meet China 's President Hu Jintao .
IMF chief Dominique Strauss - Kahn said the Chinese move was " a very welcome development " .
Mr Obama said : " China 's decision to increase the flexibility of its exchange rate is a constructive step that can help safeguard the recovery and contribute to a more balanced global economy . "
Under pressure
The US and the IMF say the yuan is undervalued , which helps Chinese firms compete overseas and contributes to the large surplus in China 's international trade .
China has kept the currency from rising by selling yuan for dollars and has built up massive foreign exchange reserves as a result .
The way China invested those reserves is seen by many economists as a key factor in the recent international financial crisis .
In April , the US treasury delayed a report that could label China a currency manipulator , in what was seen as an attempt to give Beijing time to reform its currency without appearing to do so under pressure .
A number of members of the US Congress believe the low yuan is directly affecting their local economies .
Reponding to the announcement , Senator Charles Schumer - one of the main congressional critics of China - said : " Until there is more specific information about how quickly it will let its currency appreciate and by how much , we can have no good feeling that the Chinese will start playing by the rules . "

The government is planning to scrap the default retirement age in the UK from October 2011 .
Under the proposal , employers would not be allowed to dismiss staff because they had reached the age of 65 .
Activists , who have long campaigned against the rule , welcomed the proposal as a " victory " against ageism .
Currently , an employer can force an employee to retire at the age of 65 without paying any financial compensation .
The only obligation on an employer is to hold a meeting with the member of staff to discuss plans at least six months before their 65th birthday .
At the end of that meeting it is entirely at the discretion of the employer whether or not to terminate employment .

' Unresolved problems '
The government has launched a consultation process about scrapping the rule .
Under the plans , no forced retirement notices could be issued after 6 April 2011 - six months before the October change .
The CBI business group criticised the speed of the proposed changes saying it left firms " with many unresolved problems " .
The government 's timetable to scrap the default retirement age would give companies little time to prepare , it added .
However , Rachel Krys of the Employers Forum on Age was delighted , saying it was " really unfair " that people had been forced out of jobs because of their age .
" We have to stop these blunt discriminators , " she added .
The charity Age UK , which has led the campaign to end the default retirement age , also welcomed the government 's plan .
Last year it challenged the rule in the High Court , but was unsuccessful .

" Everybody stands to win from scrapping forced retirement .

" Public finances will receive a boost from more people paying taxes for longer . "
Economic benefit
Proposals to change the retirement law formed part of the government 's Coalition Agreement , and was included in both parties ' manifestos , but previously no deadline had been set .
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Engineering Employers Federation : " It will make it more difficult for workforce planning "
The government hopes the change will encourage people to work for longer , against a background of an ageing population .
That could ease the strain on public finances as more people continue to pay tax , while at the same time claiming the state pension .
Activists have argued it could inject billions of pounds extra into the economy .
But some employers are worried it will complicate the job of managing a workforce and add to overall costs .
Graeme Leach , director of policy at the Institute of Directors , said : " We greatly regret the government 's decision to abolish the default retirement age .
" We do not see how the removal of a mechanism that gives employers flexibility in managing their workforce is compatible with the government 's stated desire to boost enterprise and de-regulate the employment arena . "
The rules vary across Europe although , even where there is no default retirement age , figures from 2005 showed that people did not , on average , work beyond the age of 65 .

News : Q&A
Russell L. Ciochon and his team are in Indonesia investigating the geological source and age of one of the world 's biggest caches of Homo erectus .
Russell L. Ciochon , who heads the American team at the Ngandong site , with a gorilla skull .
Tom Jorgensen
In the early 1930s , 14 Homo erectus fossils and 25,000 vertebrate remains were unearthed near the muddy Solo River at Ngandong in Java , Indonesia , by a research team from the Netherlands .
Some 80 years later , this remains one of the world 's largest caches of this early human .
It could also be evidence of the species ' swansong .
A team has now returned to Ngandong , armed with the original Dutch survey documents , to answer some long - standing questions about the age of the fossils and the ancient sediment that they were buried in .
Nature talked to Russell L. Ciochon , a palaeoanthropologist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City , while his team was digging at Ngandong .
Why is this fieldwork so important ?
H. erectus from Ngandong potentially lived in the last part of the Ice Age at the same time that Homo sapiens inhabited other parts of the Old World , and Homo floresiensis ( the ' hobbit ' ) was still living in caves on the Indonesian island of Flores .
This was a very intriguing period in the saga of human evolution .
According to the Dutch team who discovered them , the H. erectus specimens were deposited by the Solo River .
The fact that the present river is so near to the deposits that contained the H. erectus specimens could indicate that the deposits and fossils are far younger than the oldest known H. sapiens in Africa , which would mean that the two species actually coexisted .
But attempts to date Ngandong over the past 30 years have proved inconclusive .
This is partly because we do n't know enough about the Ngandong geology and can't be sure that the dated samples from earlier excavations came from the discovery bed .
Our team is the first to focus on the geological context of the fossils1 .
This was possible because geoarchaeologist Frank Huffman from the University of Texas at Austin obtained the long - forgotten survey documents from the 1930s2 .
Indonesian team leader Yahdi Zaim ( left ) and Rob Scott excavate the bone bed .
O. Frank Huffman
What have you found at the site ?
During our expedition , we have recovered more than 800 fossils from a bone bed — a geological deposit with a dense collection of bones .
The excavations have provided our geological team , which includes Yan Rizal from the Institute of Technology Bandung and University of Iowa geoarchaeologist Art Bettis , with details on the site 's sediments that shed new light on how the bone bed was created .
We believe that the detailed analysis of the site 's geology and the circumstances of burial of the bone bed will provide the crucial information to evaluate the dating and other contentious issues surrounding the remains .
We found no stone artefacts at the site , but these are rare at most Javan H. erectus sites .
It is one of the unique features of the Java record that remains to be explained .
What can the fossils tell us about the daily lives of these late members of H. erectus ?
Although we do n't have direct evidence , we believe that H. erectus exploited the resources in the area , probably by hunting or scavenging .
Other clues about their lives can be found by looking at the non-human fossils , and what they can tell us about the ecology at the time .
Two members of our team , Yahdi Zaim from the Institute of Technology Bandung and Robert Scott of Rutgers University in New Jersey , specialize in such fossils and found that they are mostly made up of large bovids — ancestors of the Javan banteng and water buffalo — as well as deer , Stegodon ( an extinct elephant ) , rhinoceros , panther , crocodiles and turtles .
The large percentage of bovids and deer could indicate that H. erectus lived in an open woodland or grassland environment .
Also , on the basis of estimates from partial skeletons of H. erectus from other sites , we think that the Ngandong H. erectus was probably between 1.66 and 1.85 metres tall — similar to the average human height in the United States today .
The Solo River , which runs near the Homo erectus site .
O. Frank Huffman
What can the Ngandong excavation site tell us about the evolution and extinction of H. erectus ?
The 14 H. erectus fossils are thought to represent a late stage in the evolution of the species .
As a group , they have a significantly larger average brain size than that found in any other H. erectus fossils .
Palaeoanthropologists do n't like to use terms such as ' advanced ' to distinguish one fossil group from another , but that term would certainly apply to the Ngandong fossils .
After arriving on Java about 1.6 million years ago3 , H. erectus apparently lived in ' splendid isolation ' without competition from any other human species .
It is possible that when H. sapiens eventually reached Java , it could have competed with H. erectus for scarce island resources , leading to the extinction of the latter .
But it is more likely that some unique geological or climatic event resulted in the extinction of Javan H. erectus , as is the case with most species .
However , it does seem that the Ngandong group is the best evidence we have for the last occurrence of this species worldwide .
What has been the most exciting moment of the expedition so far ?
The first high point came after several excavation pits were opened .
We found boundaries of the original excavations not seen since the 1930s .
This revealed untouched bone beds fitting the parameters originally described by the Dutch team .
We are reliving the days of the discovery made nearly 80 years ago , and meeting present - day research objectives as we unearth the past .
What is a typical day at the site like ?
We 've been excavating for 24 days without a break .
The days blur together and we often lose track of time .
There is a routine to systematic palaeoanthropological excavation : opening an excavation pit , digging down to the bone bed , carefully mapping the strata as we proceed , exposing the fossils , assigning the fossil a number , charting its xyz coordinates , removing the fossil , and then sampling the strata for geological analysis and dating .

How does the Javan H. erectus compare with those from other sites in the world and where did it actually come from ?
We spend a lot of time discussing this question .
The earliest H. erectus fossils date to about 1.8 million years ago — appearing nearly simultaneously in both East Africa and at Dmanisi in the Republic of Georgia .
So H. erectus from Africa and Georgia represent critical comparisons for any Javan H. erectus .
It is thought that the species evolved in Africa and spread out of the continent to the Republic of Georgia and to Java over a very short timespan — perhaps less than 100,000 years .
However , the most primitive and smallest H. erectus fossils come from Dmanisi .
Anatomically , Dmanisi H. erectus shares features with both the African and Javan H. erectus , so it may actually be the centre of origin for the species .
If you compare Ngandong H. erectus with those from elsewhere , it is clear that the most derived population is from Ngandong .
Pixar studios has given us close to a dozen great full length feature films since 1995 , and with the release of ‘ Toy Story 3 ’ , let ’s take a look back and try to rate them from best to worst .
This is more difficult than you might think , because each and every one of these movies is great … but some do stand out above the rest .
1. ‘ Toy Story 3 ’ – Reason for number one status ?
Because this film just simply has everything you could ask for .
( Check out my review on our site ) Pixar seems to elevate itself with each release , and ‘ Toy Story 3 ’ is a true testament to that .
Rousing action sequences , heartfelt emotion , and incredibly detailed animation combine to form a nearly flawless film .
Rating :
2. ‘ Toy Story ’ –
When it debuted back in 1995 , the original ‘ Toy Story ’ made moviegoers marvel at just how good the animation was .
Not only that , containing a story that brought toys to life in this way somehow appealed to not only children , but adults as well .
Everyone could relate to this story and seeing classic toys in an adventure such as this was a visual feast for audiences .
Rating :
3. ‘ UP ’ – Last year when ‘ UP ’ debuted , it had a little less fan fare behind it than previous Pixar films .
There were no toys , no cute little fish , no monsters , no cars , and no superheroes .
But what it did have was ‘ heart ’ .
In my opinion , this is the most beautiful of all Pixar films .
The relationship formed by the old man and the young boy in this film is touching , and the characters they meet on their journey along the way give the film that little extra that makes it work well .
Rating :
Rating : 4 . ‘ Wall - E’ – Only a Pixar film can have no dialogue for the first 20 or so minutes and still manage to make you not able to take your eyes off of it .
The best thing about this neat little robot is the fact that despite everything being shut down around him , he still continues to do his job … what he was built to do .
Giving this little guy emotions just heightened the character , and his relationship with Eva is sweet .
The film has a great message as well , and this very well may be Pixar ’s most educational film to date .
Rating : 5 . ‘ The Incredibles ’ – Probably regarded as being the most action packed Pixar film , and the only real true ‘ superhero ’ flick of the Pixar family , ‘ The Incredibles ’ is really fun to watch .
Expertly written with great direction , the film soars during it ’s action sequences and equally impresses with its witty dialogue .
A lot of people feel this is the ultimate Pixar release and rank it at the top of the studios films thus far .
I only have one question … where is the sequel ??
This is a film that has so many sequel possibilities , so let ’s hope they get one going real soon .
Rating : 6 . ‘ Toy Story 2 ’ –
You may be asking why is this film inferior to parts 1 and 3 , and further down on my list ?
Well , it ’s not really because it is a sub - par film to those , but it ’s because there are just a couple of moments in ‘ Toy Story 2 ’ that I wanted something more .
That something was found in the third one .
The introduction of the characters in the first act was cool , and the great conclusion in the third act was near perfect .
The middle film manages to build on the relationship between Woody and Buzz and their ability to coexist with the two biggest egos in the room .
Pixar manages to build a nice bridge here .
In the end , it makes this trilogy one of the best out there .
7. ‘ Finding Nemo’ –
The beginning of this film reminded me of how I felt when I watched ‘ The Lion King ’ for the first time .
Although , not quite as emotional as the death of Mustafa in ‘ Lion ’ , when Nemo ’s family is pretty much taken out near the beginning of the film only brings more excitement to the journey that ’s to come .
Sea creatures are always pleasant for the kids to watch , and in this case … the adults too .
Rating :
8. ‘ Ratatouille ’ – Only Pixar can make a truly enchanted tale out of a story about a rat .
Not only are the adventures of Remy the rat interesting , but the film also manages to do very well with the chef factor .
The food , although animated , looks delicious and the supporting characters give the reality of what working in a French restaurant might actually be like .
This film surprised me more than any of the other movies on this list … much better than I initially thought it would be .
Rating :
9. ‘ Monsters Inc. ’ –
The film that defines one of the things that is truly important in life – laughter .
A single mission , to get the little child ( Boo ) , becomes quite the adventure as in the end , our heroes discover that laughter is much more powerful than screams of fear .
Billy Crystal and John Goodman are perfectly cast in their roles of Mike and Sully .
They are a great team and , besides Woody and Buzz , Pixar ’s coolest pairing .
Rating :
10 . ‘A Bug ’s Life ’ – Well , the title pretty much says it all .
Being the follow up to ‘ Toy Story ’ , ‘ Bug ’s Life ’ had a lot to live up to …and it delivered .
The film faced competition the year it came out , from ‘ Antz ’ , but ‘ Life ’ was the much better movie .
Once again , the writers delivered a story that related to the struggles of everyday life – only through the eyes of bugs .
I dig the fact that the grasshoppers are the bad guys here , as they just look like they should be .
Actually , if you think about it , the story here resembles ‘ The Magnificent Seven ’ … one of Hollywood ’s most acclaimed live action films .
Rating :
11 . ‘ Cars ’ –
One of these films had to end up in the last spot .
Not that I dislike ‘ Cars ’ , but to me it is the least entertaining of the Pixar releases .
What I do enjoy is the casting of Paul Newman and Owen Wilson , and the names of some of the characters ( cars ) .
Lightning McQueen is a great name for a race car !
The animation of the vehicles is phenomenal , and the extra scenes in the credits are hilarious .

So what do you think ?
I ’m sure your list is different than mine , so let me know what your top Pixar films are …I would love to see the comparison .
Keep checking our site for more ‘ best of ’ lists … coming soon .
( or , stop me if you 've heard this one before )
A good friend of mine first wore glasses in college .
He had n't realized that the world had been blurry for 20 years until his doctor demonstrated exactly how clear the world can be .
If you visit the optometrist and get fitted for corrective lenses , the doctor will put a viewfinder over your face and fiddle with dials , asking " Better or worse " .
Your task is to squint and squirm and try to read the optical equivalent of lorem ipsum until everything becomes clear and you no longer have to worry about your focal depth .
If you get it wrong , you 'll have slight headaches for a year until you correct things again .
If you get it right — well , that 's a matter of preference .
After all , no one can decide your own tolerance for clarity .
Some people believe that Perl has too many operators and they ask questions like why are there separate comparison operators for strings and numbers , for example .
Better or worse ?
$x eq $y $ x.to_str == $ y.to_str ( String ) $x == ( String ) $y
Granted , the underlying mechanism in a virtual machine might perform the same operations :
get_string % SREG ( 0 ) , $x get_string % SREG ( 1 ) , $y compare % SREG ( 0 ) , %SREG(1 )
... but people like me write lots of code so you do n't have to write code like that , or even know how that code works .
Suppose the optometrist knows all about Hindley - Milner , and over a second round of delicious beverages , he asks the programming language designer about typeclasses and inference :
$x == $y
Better or worse than the previous examples ?
Of course , your optometrist probably is n't even an amateur programming language designer , so it 's easy to counter the argument :
Does this operator compare container equivalence or value equivalence ?
If value equivalence , must the values be the same or equivalent ?
If container equivalence , how deep is the container equivalence ?
Must the inferred types be the same , or can they be contra / covariant ?
If deep container equivalence , how does this comparison interact with laziness or infinite data structures ?
If value equivalence , are coercions allowable between potentially comparable representations ?
What happens if someone overloads this comparison operator for one type or another ?
Better or worse ?
$ x == $y $ x.CONTAINER == $y.
CONTAINER $ x.VALUE == $ y.VALUE typeof $ x == typeof $y < contravariant_type > $x == < contravariant_type > $y LAZY ( $x == $y )
... and so on .
Over a third round of drinks , the programming language designer might get the optometrist to admit that the reason some languages have so many operators is because there are so many possible operations .
The question , as always , is " What 's the most clear to read and to understand ? "
So you ’ve built your website , researched the keywords to use for SEO purposes and have written what you think is great , engaging content .
But out of excitement or maybe even carelessness , you could be repeating your keywords a little too often .
Read your post again and look at the frequency of your keywords .
You may just be guilty of keyword stuffing !
This happens when one uses keywords , linking structures , tags and other means of optimization on one ’s site that has no relevance to the website ’s content or purpose .
As you may already know , this is definitely a no - no in SEO .
So what bad does this do and how can you prevent it ?
Keyword stuffing creates link spam .
Whenever you stuff your content with too many keywords , your site may be popping all over the place without any relevance to the keywords itself that appears on your site .
You might be flagged as a spam site , because keyword stuffing offenses are monitored by the search engines and can result to temporary or permanent exclusion of your site from its results .
Generally , most experts claim that a keyword density from 1 % to 3 % is best .
Solution : Utilize other venues of promotion .
There are many ways to promote and create traffic for your site .
You can network with your target market or other similar businesses on social networks by sharing your posts , bookmarking it on social bookmarking sites , participating professional forums that are relevant to your site ’s content or tweet about it !
Keyword stuffing results to content duplication .
Given that you can freely place the keywords throughout your posts , repeating the words over and over again is not only redundant and can turn your readers off – the chances of linking to the same content is also high , resulting in irrelevant and manipulated search results .
Solution : Strategically place keywords in your posts , and use them sparingly .
Consider replacing some of the occurrences of the keyword with synonyms to avoid keyword stuffing .
Remember , people want to get search engine results that are relevant to their query .
When you place your relevant keywords strategically and sparingly , you can create a wave of “ good karma ” , giving you quality link backs and recommendations from other sites !
If you ’re concerned about the number and quality of keywords you have in your posts , I hope you found this information valuable , and have enjoyed reading it .
I will be tackling more copywriting and SEO topics soon so stay tuned and thank you for dropping by !
To Your Success ,

A firestorm of accusations circled around recently saying that Cassandra , the elected - by - major - adopters emperor of the NoSQL movement , has no clothes .
It was said Twitter was dumping Cassandra ; Reddit outages were linked to Cassandra ; and even Facebook , Cassandra 's cradle of birth , was said to have abandoned Cassandra .
Shouts of NoSQL Fail !
were heard in the streets .
Much gloating followed .
Is the emperor really naked ?
Casually dressed maybe , but not naked .
( Note : after this point the article contains a flow chart that is NSFW .
Some people are very sensitive about cussing , so if that 's you , please go back , do n't read on .
Danger !
There are no nude pictures or anything , just some strong language .
But this is my most favorite flow chart of all time , so it 's worth it :-)
Is Twitter really abandoning Cassandra ?
Not according to Twitter , which came out with a post , Cassandra at Twitter Today , explaining that they are using Cassandra in production for geolocation and analytics .
Twitter , however , will not be using Cassandra to store tweets .
Why ?
Twitter ’s Ryan King says :
This is a change in strategy .
Instead we ’re going to continue to maintain our existing Mysql - based storage .
We believe that this is n’t the time to make large scale migration to a new technology .
Twitter is busy fighting other fires and they do n't have the time to retrofit something that is ( more or less ) working , namely their MySQL based tweet storage , with a completely new technology based on Cassandra .
This is the perfect opportunity to share a flow chart that I copied many years ago from a lone cubicle wall , deep in the heart of Dilbert - land .
This may be something like the thought process
Twitter went through in making their decision :
Flow Chart for Project Decision Making
I still get a laugh everytime I read it .
It 's so true .
Every company has these decisions to make when deciding where to put resources .
Should you build , buy , rebuild , expand , or hang on with your fingernails ?
The soul of an engineer says do it right and start over .
The best business decision might be quite different .
Joel Spolsky once declared rewriting working code from scratch as on of the things you should never ever do .
Remember Netscape ?
Many no longer do , but at one time they were the web .
From those heights they were brought low says Joel , because they made the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make :
They decided to rewrite the code from scratch .
Twitter may not want to make the same mistake .
Does this mean Cassandra and NoSQL suck ?
No , I think it 's just smart project planning .
It 's actually OK to have multiple platforms for different purposes .
Does Twitter work well enough though ?
Brad McCarty in Twitter implements more features ; ignores its broken platform , makes a good case that Twitter should shore up its infrastructure before moving on .
But the problems Twitter seems to be having are with facilities , not the core Tweet engine .
Until recently Twitter 's up - time has been pretty good .
So fix that , keep the Tweet storage engine going , event if it 's ugly , and start moving on with new competition crushing features .
Seem reasonable ?
Some of this is inevitable .
Cassandra has been cloistered inside the loving arms of Facebook and dedicated early adopters .
Only recently has Cassandra left home and had to enter a very complicated world where customers have a very wide variety of needs .
It will take a while for Cassandra to mature , for substantial new features to be added , for existing features to be rearchitected , and for people to figure out what Cassandra is really good at .
Until then there will problems .
And for developers switching to a new tool chain there will be pain as they will have to learn , relearn , and overcome a lot of obstacles .
This process will not be pretty .
So we will hear about problems with Cassandra and every other product out there .
That 's just what it means to be new .
Reddit seems to be in this zone .
Is Facebook really abandoning Cassandra ?
Nope .
Facebook still has a 150 node Cassandra cluster used for Inbox Search , which supports close to 500M users , over , 150TB of data , and is growing rapidly everyday .
Now , it would be interesting to see the rate of adoption of Cassandra into other groups .
When a new feature is being implemented is Cassandra being selected internally ?
Is it still being developed ?
We do n't know , but Facebook is still using Cassandra for a major feature .

Review embargoes are a very normal part of games journalism .
Companies will put restrictions on when publications are allowed to talk about games before they ’re released .
For previews this is done to control the dissemination of information .
For reviews it ’s to allow certain publications to have an exclusive , or more muckily , because they do n’t want negative reviews to appear too much in advance of the game ’s release .
It ’s potentially murky territory , but since it ’s their game , they get to choose the conditions in which they make them available to magazines and websites before commercial release .
It ’s not unusual for everyone to be told , “ Reviews of game X may be published at 5 pm on the 26th ” , and then you ’ll see all the sites have their reviews appear at once .
What ’s far more rare is a company attempting to control the publications of reviews after a game has been released .
Especially not ten days after .
This is what Realtime Worlds are astonishingly trying to enforce for APB .
The response to the closed beta has not been positive .
Once the NDA was lifted ( and in many cases well before ) many players have reported that the customisation is extraordinary , but the driving and shooting are both poor .
Which is an issue in a driving and shooting game .
I ’ve not played a single second of APB , and thus have no opinions on it either way , and am not in a position to break any form of NDA or embargo .
But the impression I ’ve picked up is negative .
RTW could perhaps have picked up a similar vibe .
In such circumstances you might expect a developer to embargo reviews until the moment of release .
The game goes live in the States on the 29th June , let ’s say at 9 am .
So reviews might normally all appear at 9 am on the 29th .
So as expected , on 4th June , an email accompanying the Key To The City event details from PR agency Indigo Pearl , working for RTW , explained that the beta code is reviewable , with an embargo for the 29th June .
Exactly as we ’d expected .
But then on the 10th June , two days before the Key To The City open beta began , the a correction was sent out .
We were informed that the Key To The City was in fact for previews only .
We were told that reviews can be “ finalised ” when we have the released version of the game , which we ’d get on 29th June .
And then they added that reviews are embargoed until 6th July .
This is extraordinary .
They are attempting to tell press that they cannot write a review of the game for a full week after the game is available for the public to buy .
It is , of course , impossible to enforce .
The public will be able to write anything they wish about the game anywhere they wish from the very first second it ’s available .
Of course .
Because to prevent this would , well , involve Realtime Worlds taking over the planet and beginning an international oppressive dictatorship .
And while they ’re certainly an ambitious developer , this is perhaps beyond their realm .
So of course the gaming press can equally write about a released game whenever they choose , and a company attempting to prevent this is ludicrous and unenforceable .
So what ’s the argument from their side ?
Well , we approached Indigo Pearl to ask for a comment from Realtime Worlds , and were promised one would be coming .
That was a week ago and we ’ve heard nothing .
So we can but suppose :
MMO developers are incredibly sensitive about the amount of time a game is played for before reviews are written .
It ’s becoming increasingly common for negative or even average review scores to be met by the developer / publisher going into the reviewer ’s account logs and publicising how much time they spent playing the game .
Now , this is arguably simply imposing accountability on the reviewer , and is a discussion for another time .
But in imposing a week ’s embargo on reviews , they may perhaps be attempting to ensure that no reviews of the fully released code go up before they think a fair opinion might reasonably have been formed .
It ’s reasonable for a developer to say that a review cannot be based on beta code , and to play in a beta you do agree to certain conditions .
Most developers , by open beta stage , agree that it is suitable to be reviewed from , since it ’s extremely unlikely it will be dramatically different from the boxed , released code that appears a couple of weeks later .
Open betas are more about stress - testing servers than fixing the game in time for release .
But there ’s no reason why RTW should n’t refuse this .
So perhaps in imposing their week late restriction they believe they ’re ensuring fair reviews of finished code .
Or perhaps they ’re trying to prevent reviews from appearing during the peak week for sales .
Which , if the game proves to be poor , would certainly be to their advantage .
If this is their reason , then they are attempting to silence criticism of their commercially released product , preventing consumers from receiving appropriate purchasing advice .
Whatever their reason is , they ’ve crossed a very obvious , very ridiculous line .
When anyone anywhere can post a review to their blog , a comments thread , or a site ’s reader reviews section , it ’s beyond daft to think that the site itself cannot .
Yes , it ’s impossible to entirely separate this argument from that of for how long an MMO should be played for before publishing a review .
But this is not a decision for publishers / developers to make .
And certainly not one they can enforce .
But it ’s one they ’re still trying to .
Today journalists received keys for the current open beta directly from Realtime Worlds , which were accompanied by this message :
“ Please note that there is no embargo for preview coverage and you will be able to post screenshots from the game to support this .
Before finalising reviews , we want you to experience the full , rich experience of APB as it is meant to be seen .
We want you to see wild customer customisations , player progression and clans making an impact on the living breathing city of San Paro .
This key code also therefore grants you , along with our pre-order customers , VIP early access before the official launch day .
June 26th in North America and June 28th in Europe .
The review embargo is Tuesday , 6th July at 8 am UK time . ”
It ’s now , incredibly , ten days after the game is available to the public before reviews are “ allowed ” to be published .

So , I just finished reading the first issue of The Thanos Imperative released last week .
First off , I would like say that I love Thanos .
He ’s one of my all - time favorite Marvel villains .
However , he ’s rarely seen , mostly because he ’s been dead for some time .
His Infinity Gauntlet storyline is a classic .
Another good read is the Infinity War which features Thanos heavily .
Anyways , last week I picked up The Thanos Imperative as I was excited to see him back in the pages of Marvel .
For the record , it took my awhile to track down this issue as my usual comic book store sold out of the issue .
I did manage to find it , and I must admit I ’ve have n’t followed or read the Guardians of the Galaxy stuff , however , I really enjoyed reading this first issue .
Drawn by Miguel Sepulveda and written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning , the Thanos Imperative was great .
I admit I do n’t know much of the back stories before this series , for example the Annihilation and War of Kings storylines , as I generally stay away from the cosmic universe of Marvel , however , this book was a confusing but enjoyable read .
If you can find it , buy it now and enjoy !
One question though … what ’s with the talking racoon ?

A poor 7 - year - old boy who risked everything to steal a cheap piece of jewelry for his mom on Mother 's Day was forced to make adorable amends once his parents realized the bauble was obtained unethically .
Rony Vardi , owner of the cute Catbird boutique in Williamsburg , tells us she was n't even aware that the locket , worth $ 15 , was missing until the li'l shoplifting prodigy approached her with this note , tears streaming down his face .
Vardi says one of her employees told the boy he did the right thing , but when asked if she planned to get the police involved , she laughed and said , " For sure .
We 're gonna hunt him down and make sure we really teach him a lesson . "
Which would be a shame — we can tell this kid 's got talent .
What he really needs is a mentor , so we 're putting him in touch with the mysterious Whole Foods shoplifter for an apprenticeship .

Es war zu befürchten , jetzt wird es Wirklichkeit : Durchsuchungen in Kinderzimmern wegen selbstgemachter „ Jugendpornografie “ .
Im Ostallgäu kam die Kemptener Polizei mit richterlicher Genehmigung bei 14 - bis 16 - jährigen Jungs nach Hause und stellte deren Wohnungen auf den Kopf .
Mutmaßliches Vergehen der Jugendlichen : Sie haben Nacktbilder eines 14 - jährigen Mädchens weitergegeben , berichtet die Allgäuer Zeitung .
Von Druck oder Zwang auf Seiten des Mädchens berichtet die Zeitung nichts .
Im Gegenteil , nach dem Bericht hat das Kind die Bilder selbst gemacht und von sich aus an die Jungs verschickt .
Die Formulierung „ Nacktbilder “ sollte stutzig machen .
Nacktbilder sind zunächst mal Nacktbilder und keine Pornografie .
Vielmehr handelt es sich nur dann um Pornografie , wenn sexuelle Handlungen abgebildet sind , was auf Nacktbildern ja normalerweise nicht der Fall ist .
Außerdem muss , um eine gängige Definition zu zitieren , die Darstellung selbst zum Ausdruck bringt , dass sie ausschließlich der Erregung eines sexuellen Reizes beim Betrachter dient .
Ob diese Voraussetzungen wirklich gegeben sind , wissen wir leider nicht .
Aber die Möglichkeit , dass hier der Pornografiebegriff grob verkannt wurde , liegt jedenfalls nicht fern .
Unabhängig davon stellt sich mal wieder die Frage nach der Verhältnismäßigkeit .
Mit der haben die Justizbehörden in der Region durchaus ihre Probleme , wie ich aus eigener Erfahrung weiß .
Ist es wirklich erforderlich , gegen pubertierende Jugendliche mit Hausdurchsuchungen vorzugehen ?
Hätte es nicht gereicht , die Jungs zur Vernehmung zu laden ?
Oder zunächst die Eltern anzusprechen ?
Die pure Demonstration staatlicher Macht in so einer Konstellation lässt mich persönlich frösteln .
The results of a Ponemon Institute survey ofÃ‚Â 591 IT professionals whose day - to - day duties revolve around securing the networks of major corporations and big government agencies were released in full today .
As LastWatchdog reported last week ,
The survey of IT pros revealed the extent to which CEOs , COOs and CFOs behave like ostriches , when it comes to grasping the scale and scope of cyberattacks against their respective organizations .
In this LastWatchdog guest post , Tim Belcher , CTO of digital forensics firm NetWitness , which sponsored the study , Ã‚Â reflects on the wider context .
By Tim Belcher
Cybercrime has finally crossed the line from a looming threat to a cost of doing business .
The now infamous Aurora attack on Google , Intel and other companies has underscored both the profitability of data theft and the acknowledgement by corporate America that , for now , the battle is being lost .
Recent SEC filings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from Google to Northrop Grumman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are now including shareholder risk language to protect corporations in an environment where cyber defense is an inexact science , and where online pillaging presents explosive growth opportunities with little upfront investment .
Another recent discovery , the Kneber botnet , is also a perfect representation of the state of the cyberstate .
A medium - sized instance of the well known ZeuS botnet , the operators behind Kneber slipped past what should have been more than adequate defenses within 2,500 companies .
They remained there undetected for more than 18 months , and in one month alone managed a massive take totaling 75 GB of sensitive data .
For all that was average about the malware involved in Kneber and similar operations , they represent a new layered , multifaceted approach methodology that is advanced .
Because a few experts can decipher the attacks after the fact , does not diminish the effectiveness of how these organizations operate .
A just - released study by the Ponemon Institute takes a first in depth look at what organizations are seeing and doing in terms of these advanced threats .
The group of nearly 600 IT and IT security leaders defined advanced threats , as Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ a methodology employed to evade an organizationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s present technical and process countermeasures which relies on a variety of attack techniques as opposed to one specific type .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
By that definition , the results highlight systemic failures in people , process and technology that are too stark to ignore .
Among the most prominent findings are :
Advanced threats are perceived as a major , growing problem .
83 % believed their organization has been a recent target of advanced threats Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with 41 % citing they are frequent targets .
70 % believe that the growing volume of these threats is making for a much more dangerous technology landscape
Detection of advanced threats is lowo 46 % took one month or longer to detect an advanced threato 45 % discovered them Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ by accidentÃ¢â‚¬Â 
Change is needed across the board
81 % felt that their leadership lacked awareness of the seriousness of advanced threats
Only 24 % agreed that prevention or quick detection of advanced threats is a top security priority in their organization
Only 32 % report that their security - enabling technologies are adequate .
Only 26 % report security personnel are adequate to deal with advanced threats .
When only 32 % of consumers feel they have an adequate solution , and only 26 % feel they have personnel that are adequate , then it is a safe leap to say the majority of Information Security leaders feel the current approach is failing .
After two decades of growing awareness and emphasis , we find ourselves outpaced by our adversaries , and ill equipped to protect our networks and information .
A common opinion among peers is that the heavy focus on compliance over the last few years has shifted focus away from response and protection , and provided a false sense of health .
Another thing that is becoming all too clear is that most organizations are simply not agile enough to adapt to changing threats .
Borne in the days of slow moving viruses , and Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ inconvenience attacksÃ¢â‚
¬
Â such as distributed denial of service ( DDOS ) and website defacements , security innovation has proceeded along a simple , response - stimulus mentality .
The goal has been to try and keep pace with attack development Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an approach that from the beginning has relied on temperance for acceptable losses and collateral damage .
An attack needed to take place before a defense could be mounted , and there was no allowance for the geometric increases in attack velocity and complexity .
Conversely , attackers have become more sophisticated , targeted , and better financed .
Criminal networks are smart enough to fly below the radar and use technology advances Ã¢â‚¬â€œ multilayer attacks , redundancy and both peer - to - peer and cloud computing concepts .
They also continue to prey on the weakest link Ã¢â‚¬â€œ human nature Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to circumvent even the best defenses .
Cases in point , Aurora reportedly breached defenses through a phishing attack via webmail , and Kneber used competing botnet technologies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Zeus and Waledac Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to provide Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ backupÃ¢â‚ ¬Â redundancy .
The anonymity , flexibility and complexity of the Internet favors aggression and severely challenges defenses .
Unfortunately , the combination of conventional wisdom , celebrity malware , fear - mongering , and marginal protection has perpetuated a security model that has long been rendered obsolete .
At the core of the issue is the value and vulnerability of human intelligence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ be it in expert analysis or collective awareness .
Apart from discussions of specific technologies , there are three critical areas that must be addressed if we even hope to achieve more level cyber defense footing :
Achieve a comprehensive understanding of our networks .
Without understanding what constitutes Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ normal , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â  we will have little chance of preventing threats as they change and morph at an ever increasing rate .
There must be an executive level commitment to mapping , understanding and addressing global business risk , not knee jerk threat protection .
We also need to deploy solutions that are more robust Ã¢â‚¬â€œ that offer the agility to respond to any threat on the horizon , the real - time awareness needed to detect and thwart new attacks in real time , and a more mature capability to quickly understand and address those threats that WILL get through .
We must work together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and share more information on attack vectors and threats .
Forget breach and incident reporting thresholds , and set sharing thresholds and requirements .
Our only viable chance at defending our networks and information relies on perspective .
The faster your organization learns of new threats , and the greater the detail it has , the more likely it will be to thwart those attacks .
Some may take from this the need to outsource to more expert professionals .
Please see the next bullet .
The time for comprehensive , or even significant outsourcing of security has past .
As outsourced vendors have become commoditized , so too have most of their offerings .
In todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s world , organizations need to acquire , train , recruit , and retain security talent .
Increasingly , the difference we see in success or failure falls squarely on talent .
Patch human vulnerabilities .
Every employee maintains the information keys to the kingdom .
The types of organized threats we are speaking of need only the smallest foothold .
The time has past where security can remain a mystery to the general population .
In the foreseeable future , employees will likely remain the way through the door for our adversaries , and therefore must contribute to the front line defenses .
Even a modicum of realistic , required training for all employees would significantly reduce risk .

The claims arose from an attack in January on Register.com by a group claiming to be the Iranian Cyber Army .
Baidu alleges the hackers had contacted Register claiming to be Baidu employees and were given access to their account .
This enabled them to change the server number that the address baidu.com normally takes users to .
Visitors to the Baidu site , China 's most popular search engine , were then redirected to a page displaying political messages .
" It 's like somebody going into the telephone book and changing your phone number , " said security expert Graham Cluley from Sophos .
Baidu says it lost millions of pounds as a result of the hack and filed seven complaints against Register .
Judge Denny Chin allowed two of them .
" I hold that Baidu has alleged sufficient facts in its complaint to give rise to a plausible claim of gross negligence or recklessness , " he said in his ruling .
The pre-trial is due to begin in New York next month .
" If you feel a company has caused you damage or cost you money one of the routes you can take is the legal route - but it does bring bad news back into headlines again which some companies would rather forget , " said Graham Cluley .
The hack itself could have had far more serious implications , he added .
" Rather than displaying propaganda ( the website ) could have installed malware or spyware .
Baidu in China is extremely popular - it could have infected a lot of computers . "
When I arrive at Rangapoli , in the Indian state of Orissa , the villagers tell me how they used to grow millet , beans and peas .
They harvested leaves , pineapple , jackfruit , mango , banana , chillies , ginger , turmeric , bamboo and roots from the forest .
Fresh water was plentiful .
But according to the villagers , the opening , in 2008 , of an aluminium refinery in neighbouring Lanjigarh by Vedanta Aluminium Limited ( VAL ) , a subsidiary of a British - based mining group , has brought misery , disease and impoverishment .
The refinery has created two red mud ponds the size of several football pitches near Rengopali into which bauxite ore is washed , along with chemicals , causing toxic fumes and polluted dust .
Lutni Majhi , a woman living in the village , tells me , " Now , not only is it hot during the day , it is hot at night , as the refinery is functioning at night .
Before , we had forest and trees around us , it was much cooler .
We 've never had this much heat , flies and mosquitoes . "
The water sources are exposed to dangerous contamination .
Global health and Safety regulations stipulate that a refinery should be at least 10 km from villages ; this one is situated in the midst of these hill dwellers ' natural habitat .
New diseases affecting people 's lungs and eyes are already widespread .
In a report prepared for India 's Ministry of Environment and Forests , site inspectors were told that 13 people in the area have died from TB in the past two years and 200 - 250 cattle and goats have perished .
I speak to a man who is dying from a respiratory illness resembling TB .
His wife is distraught : she will be left alone to fend for herself and their children .
Vedanta has received unconditional support from the state of Orissa to expand the refinery , and to start an open - pit bauxite mine in the Niyamgiri hills .
Now it has been given the green light from the Supreme Court of India it is waiting only on final clearance from the Ministry of Environments and Forests .
There are approximately 80 million tribal people in India , among them 15,000 Kondh , an indigenous tribe who have lived in Orissa for generations .
The Dongria ( " hill - dwelling " )
Kondh live in the lush forests of Niyamgiri mountain , a pristine ecosystem of great significance to conservationists .
The Kondh rely on the forest and streams to graze livestock , and gather food and medicines and vital drinking water .
They consider the mountain to be a living god , and claim that their spiritual , cultural and economic wellbeing are embedded deep within it .
The Dongria Kondh are considered an endangered Primitive Tribal Group and are recognised as " a people requiring particular protection " .
They used to own 400 acres of land .
Now they have only 60 acres .
Every day is a struggle to survive .
In 2002 , Vedanta approached the communities surrounding Lanjigarh , informing them that they were going to build a factory .
Vedanta had promised employment for everyone , assuring the Kondh that only one village would be displaced .
In 2003 , Vedanta forced the community of Kinari to vacate their village and coerced farmers into selling their land at far below its market value .
Hundreds of people have now been displaced .
The few who had titles to their land were promised 100,000 rupees ( £ 1,450 ) per acre ; those without titles were promised a one - off settlement of 50,000 rupees to give up all their rights .
Those giving up their homes were promised 1,000 rupees ( £ 14 ) .
It is believed that Vedanta now owns more than 3,000 acres of land , including forest .
Under Indian law , forest - dwelling communities have the right to land and other resources , but the government of Orissa failed to inform the Kondh of their rights , and Vedanta did not warn them of the potentially devastating impact of its project .
According to a UK report : " Vedanta failed to engage the Dongria Kondh in adequate and timely consultations about the construction of the mine …
Vedanta did not respect the rights and freedoms of the Dongria Kondh consistent with India 's commitments under various international human rights instruments , including the UN international covenant on civil and political rights … the convention on biological diversity and the UN declaration on the rights of indigenous people . "
Vedanta refutes these allegations .
At Bandhaguda , a village less than 200 m from the refinery , I am told a particularly disturbing story .
When Vedanta began to cut the forest to build the refinery , 400 men , women and children protested in front of the construction site .
The police arrested all the men , keeping them in jail for seven days .
When they were released they were told they had become outcasts and needed to go to Puri , to redeem themselves at the Lord Jagannath 's temple .
The state police were used alongside Vedanta staff to forcibly take the men to far - off Puri .
While they were there , the wall of the refinery was built .
The Kondh 's ancestral graveyard was destroyed and the area illegally enclosed in the Vedanta refinery compound .
On the second day of my visit , , organised by ActionAid , we make our way to another of the Dongria Kondh villages .
Tamaksila is a place of quiet mud huts with thatched roofs , holding mahua tree hay .
The only sounds are bird calls , the mooing of the indigenous cows and the flurry of poultry scattered by our vehicle .
Our hosts take us further down the path that passes through the village .
Suddenly , in front of us stands a large gathering of more than 100 members of the Dongria Kondh .
Many of them have come to meet us and share their concerns about the imminent threat to their sacred mountain and their way of life posed by the planned Vedanta bauxite mine .
I am moved by the beauty of the place , and as soon as we come up the hill the villagers announce our arrival with drum beats and a traditional welcoming ceremony .
Two young men with hand - made drums start singing a slow , rhythmic song about Niyamgiri .
A group of beautiful young girls join in singing with the boys , and dance arm - in-arm .
Their music is peaceful and rhythmic , the lyrics are poignant – they eulogise the mountain and list the gifts it has given them .
The song ends with the line , " We will not leave Niyamgiri " .
A group of smiling women surround me and put their arms around my waist , leading me to my assigned seat .
They give me a bouquet of scented flowers and welcome everyone by putting the traditional " tika " on our foreheads , made with the paste of turmeric and rice .
The women and girls are wearing their traditional colourful clothes , beaded jewellery , hairpins , ear - and nose rings , and head necklaces .
In contrast , the men wear plain dhotis .
Many have long hair tied into a knot in the nape of their necks .
Some are carrying axes on their shoulders and in their hands .
One can already see the influence of " development " in some of the young men wearing shirts and T - shirts .
We all sit in a circle : the men , women and children sit on the ground , but as soon as I ask questions they stand up and begin to tell me , with great urgency , their concerns and fears that Vedanta is going to destroy their mountain and their livelihoods .
Kuleska Patru , one of the leaders , says to me , " Without our mountain , our god , there is no life for us ; we will resist the forced expulsion till death .
Just as a fish cannot survive outside of water , the Kondh cannot survive without Niyamgiri . "
The message the Kondh ask me to take to the Indian government , the chief minister of Orissa , Vedanta and their shareholders is loud and clear : " No amount of financial reward or relocation packages can compensate for the loss of our livelihood and our sacred land " ; " Please tell Vedanta that the Kondh do not want the mine to be built . "
Their hope is that the government of India and the chief minister of Orissa , Naveen Patnaik , will respect their livelihood , their culture and their human rights and prevent Vedanta from causing the irreversible destruction of Niyamgiri mountain .
Having campaigned about these issues for nearly three decades , I speak from experience when I say that the Kondh 's battle to save their livelihoods illustrates the struggle for survival that tribal and indigenous peoples are facing throughout the world .
Vedanta 's modus operandi is not an isolated case .
Today , exploitation of indigenous peoples is no longer carried out by colonial adventurers but by businessmen , often representing mining , oil and gas or logging companies , whose policies are implemented in the name of progress .
India , desiring to join the developed world , is pursuing policies that use the same senseless tactics as the colonial powers of the past century .
According to the UN , companies have a responsibility to respect human rights wherever they do business .
It is deplorable that local people should have to implore and appeal to the better nature of shareholders and company executives to protect their human rights and homes .
Companies who violate this fundamental right need to be held accountable , and plans for an Environmental Court of Justice are under way .
In the 21st century , we need to redefine the meaning of " development " .
It must be sustainable .
Any project must take into account the needs and aspirations of the local communities and should benefit all sectors of society .
As Our Common Future ( the report published by the UN's Brundtland Commission ) states , development must " meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs " .
Measures of development need to be more holistic – instead of focusing on GDP , we need to take Human Development Indicators ( poverty , health , mortality , education ) into account .
There has been some success in our campaign to hold Vedanta to account .
In February , the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Church of England demonstrated their commitment to human rights by withdrawing investment from Vedanta .
Edinburgh - based investment management company Martin Currie has already sold its £ 2.3 m stake on ethical grounds .
In 2007 the Norway pension fund withdrew its investment of $ 15.6 m , based on the findings of its ethics committee , which stated : " Allegations levelled at Vedanta regarding environmental damage and complicity in human rights violations , including abuse and forced eviction of tribal people , are well founded . "
It is my hope that the Indian government , and particularly the government of Orissa , will do everything in its power to prevent Vedanta from endangering the survival of the Kondh .
It is not too late to force Vedanta to adhere to ethical codes of practice that respect human and environmental rights .
This may be our last chance to help the Kondh to prevent their way of life disappearing altogether .
At Vedanta 's AGM last year , I spoke to Sitaram Kulisika , who was representing the Kondh people at the meeting .
" Once they start mining , the mountain will be bulldozed and the rivers will dry up and our livelihood will be lost , " he said .
" We do n't know how to adapt and survive and our way of living is not available in the cities .
We will be extinct . " ■

Top 10 Tips For Making A Sex Tape - By Tommy Wiseau
Here 's Everything You Need To Know About Making A Sex Tape - According To Tommy Wiseau
Making your own sex tape seems simple enough , but before you get your partner and webcam and half - ass it , delve into the mind of movie genius , Tommy Wiseau .
His sex scenes in The Room have become a cult classic , and he was kind enough to share his bedroom advice with AskMen for the Top 10 : Tips For Making A Sex Tape - By Tommy Wiseau
Two runaway horses raced along a Fourth of July parade route in a small Mississippi River town in eastern Iowa , trampling children who were in the street picking up candy , killing one woman and injuring 24 people .
The horses bolted after one rubbed its head against the other , removing that horse 's bridle .
The horses and the wagon attached to them ran for six blocks , mowing down children and adults seated and standing along the streets watching the parade in Bellevue , a town of about 2300 people .
A 60 - year - old woman died in the accident and victims as young as two years old suffered injuries ranging from multiple fractures to collapsed lungs and bruises and abrasions .
Four were in critical condition , and five had severe injuries , according to a statement from the city 's police and fire departments .
" The mood is shock and disbelief , " Bellevue Mayor Virgil Murray said .
" We 've had this parade forever .
We 've had horses in the parade forever . "
The parade is a decades - long tradition in the town , Murray said , and often includes tractors and bands .
Sandie Crilly , 46 , of Willow Springs , Illinois , said she was collecting Tootsie Rolls from the street with her eight - year - old son , 12 - year - old niece and two - year - old granddaughter when the horses ran toward them about halfway through the parade .
Someone yelled to get out of the way , she said .
" I could see it was two horses , " Crilly said .
" I could see they were running at full speed and they were harnessed together and I knew we were going to most certainly get hit , and as soon as it happened , everybody was crying and screaming . "
Crilly , who was visiting her parents in Bellevue , said someone pulled her granddaughter to safety , but her niece was left with a broken left wrist and had her two front teeth knocked out .
Everyone else suffered bumps and bruises , she said .
Paramedics treated victims in a nearby art gallery , Crilly said , and a triage area was set up near the Mississippi River , where volunteers held up tarps to shield the paramedics and injured from the sun and heat .
Others brought the injured ice and water , she said .
" It was madness , " Crilly said .
" I mean we were in a triage .
The town really came together .
It was a huge community effort . "
Carol Dietzel , house supervisor at Mercy Medical Centre - Dubuque , said 10 patients were brought there , nine of them children .
One child in critical condition was flown to University of Iowa Hospital in Iowa City , she said .
Six children were treated and released .
Another child in critical condition was in surgery and was also expected to be transferred to University of Iowa Hospital , she said .
A third child and an adult , both in fair condition , were awaiting surgery at Mercy Medical Centre .
Dietzel said other patients were taken to Finley Hospital in Dubuque , Jackson County Hospital in Maquoketa and Medical Associates Acute Care clinic in Dubuque .
Two people taken to the clinic were treated and released .
Officials at Finley Hospital said a 70 - year - old woman in serious condition was flown to University of Iowa Hospital .
The mayor said word went out via text message and phones that doctors and nurses were needed to treat the injured .
He said all the injured were taken care of within an hour .
He said between 3000 and 4000 people attend the annual parade , many people coming in from rural areas and nearby towns .
" We 've never really had any tragedy , " Murray said .
" Usually our biggest nemesis is if it rains .
That 's what we 're always worried about . "
The Dubuque Telegraph Herald reported that the out - of - control horses jumping curbs , hitting signs and cars and trampling onlookers as they ran along the parade route .
They then hit a large street sign , flipping the buggy they were pulling and ejecting two people in it , the newspaper reported .
The animals eventually ran into a trailer hitched to a van .
Iowa Governor Chet Culver said in a statement that he was thinking and praying for the victims .
" I am especially saddened because the accident occurred during the events celebrating Independence Day , which is a day that should be filled with pride and joy for all Iowans and Americans , " Culver said .
I thought maybe the most interesting single thing about the new iPhone 4 was its display , not so much the 960 vertical dots but the 326DPI , in the cleverly - named Retina Display .
Which leads me to wonder , how much does this matter ?
300 · If you care about this subject , I recommend a quick trip to Wikipedia ’s List of displays by pixel density .
In the keynote , Steve claimed that there was some sort of a threshold around 300DPI having to do with the resolving capabilities of the human retina ( thus the name ) .
Indeed , three hundred is an interesting number ; the first wave of personal - computer printers which produced results that actually looked really good started at 300DPI .
Right now , per Wikipedia , there are exactly three devices in the world whose displays exceed it ; along with the iPhone , the Toshiba G900 and the Sony / Ericsson Experia X1 , both WinMo phones .
Also I can testify that my Nexus One , at 250DPI or so , is astoundingly sharp ; the first thing in years that ’s made me want to tune up the typography on my blog .
Take Me Higher ·
At the same time , I ’m not sure about the importance of that 300DPI elbow .
It ’s sure not there on paper ; today ’s commercial laser printers commonly run at 1200 or 2400DPI .
And high - end commercial pre-press products go way higher ; the devices in the Heidelberg Prosetter family range up to 3386DPI .
Given the nature of the Android ecosystem , I think we can be pretty sure that if it turns out that Apple bet right and the extra resolution is a good selling point , we ’ll be in an amusing arms race around DPI PDQ .
Do We Even Need It ?
· I hope so , because I sure love the look of these things , but I ’m not 100 % convinced .
I ’m typing this on a generic Dell 30 " 2560x1600 display offering a pathetic 101DPI , and for the stuff I do all day , it makes me very happy ; I ’d have a hard time sacrificing any of that real - estate ( 4,096,000 pixels ! ) for higher density .
For serious photo - work I use a 25 " NEC 2690 that I bought because it was good enough for James Duncan Davidson , and everything looks immensely better there than it does on the big Dell or my 113DPI MacBook , but that ’s not because of the 98DPI , it ’s because of the wonderful color .
I suspect that unless you ’re preparing high - quality print work , there ’s no appreciable benefit for a photographer , and perhaps some downside , in an ultra - high - res display .
Some other relatively low - res devices that seem beautiful to me : the iPad at 132DPI , and my nice 42 " 1080 p TV at home , at a laughable 52DPI .
I gotta say though that those high densities are a joyful experience on hand - held devices ; is it as simple as the fact that you hold them closer to your face ?
Is there a placebo effect at work ?
Economics ·
Do bear in mind that all these extra dots are not free .
I ’m fairly ignorant about the manufacturing trade - offs , i.e. how much extra it ’s costing Apple to put 614,400 dots on the iPhone 4 , as opposed to the the 3GS ’s 153,600 .
I tend to worry more about the software costs ; you have to manipulate 4 times as many pixels every time you double the DPI , and while we ’ve learned a lot of tricks over the years , and increasingly push the work down into display controllers , the computing cost is very far from zero .
Typography ·
Anyhow , the best way to make a good looking page on the screen , particularly now that browsers are getting smarter and more polished with their font - handling , is with good typography .
Okay here 's the short version .
I 'm still really not pleased with this ( those fingers could kill me ) but I 'm so farking sick of working on it that I 'm uploading it anyway .
I spent too long on it anyhow .
I think I started working on it like three months ago and just did like fifteen minute sessions on it for weeks .
But yay , Kakashi !

During any election , ask the average Australian what their preferences are , and they 'll probably say , " For the election to be over ! "
And everyone will laugh loudly , and then sigh heavily as we contemplate the futility of existence and the inevitability of death .
But this depressive laughter hides a crucial truth : preferences are the key to our whole system of government .
And yet recent surveys show that over 30 percent of Australians do n't understand how preference voting works , and over 80 percent find the subject far too boring to discuss .
So some education is in order if we are to fully realise what a blessing preferences are , and how we can make them work for us .
Preference voting is a democratic system designed to obviate the inadequacies of " first past the post " voting , by allowing the conscientious voter to not only mark down his or her favourite candidate , but to rank all candidates in their order of preference , in a process very similar to popular website ratemyrack.com , although with fewer meaningful consequences .
This has enormous advantages .
For one thing , it means that even if your preferred candidate does n't stand a chance , you can still officially ensure your vote goes to your second or third - favourite option and not your least favourite , thus securing a nice consolation prize .
So preference voting is a bit like the Olympics , where you might be disappointed that the Australian is out of contention , but will be satisfied as long as the South African loses .
Or motor racing , where you 're cheering for a particular driver , but really you'd be happy just with a fatal crash .
Unlike other systems , preference voting allows citizens to create that car crash .
Another advantage is that it empowers supporters of minor parties .
Unlike in other countries , where a vote for a minor party simply draws votes away from the major parties , in Australia our system ensures that if you are stupid and naïve enough to vote for some scummy little party whose chances of winning an election are roughly on par with the likelihood of its candidates washing their hair , your imbecility does not necessarily hinder the democratic process , as you can still give your preferences to a proper party that wears ties .
And so everybody is happy : the major party gets your vote , the minor party gets your attention , and you get a fleeting sense of having in some way contributed to the democratic process , which should clear up by the time you get home .
Under the preference voting system , a vote for a minor party is never wasted , because the minor party 's not going to get it anyway .
Naturally , as with any electoral system devised by earthbound men , there are flaws .
For example , the preferential system does not provide any easy answers for those situations where the voter hates every candidate on the ballot , which , let 's be honest , make up the vast majority of situations .
This could be easily remedied by replacing the system of numbered preferences with one of letters , where " H " stands for Hate , " HL " stands for Hate Less , " DKWHI " stands Do n't Know Who He Is , and " F " stands for Wilson Tuckey .
Unfortunately , this kind of electoral reform has been put on the backburner by our current regime , along with the proposal to allow ballots containing scrawled anatomical obscenities to be counted as legitimate votes .
But by far the more high - profile problem with preferential voting is that of " preference deals " between parties , an issue which the news media has seized upon in the first week of the election as a way of killing time while waiting for the next ex-Labor leader to have a seizure or for Tony Abbott to grow fur .
The problem is that Labor has done a preference deal with the Greens , raising fears of a government held hostage by Green agendas , like raising the mining tax rate or instituting a punitive tax on carbon or making everyone eat out of bins or something .
You know what the Greens are like .
And Labor has form on this issue .
Voters have still not forgotten 2004's three - cornered preference deal between the ALP , Family First and Satan , Prince of Darkness , which delivered Steve Fielding into the Senate despite his primary vote consisting entirely of members of his immediate family and a disoriented hen 's night party .
Labor has come to regret this preference deal over the years , as Fielding has proven to be less a valuable legislative ally than a sort of confusing avant - garde performance artist , pushing the boundaries of modern entertainment with his innovative mixture of fancy - dress and early - onset dementia .
Will they similarly regret getting into bed with the Greens ?
It 's hard to say , Bob Brown , of course , is far less entertaining than Fielding - in fact , for a left - wing gay environmentalist , he has been doing a remarkable impression of a moderately - sedated conveyancer for the last thirty years - but that does n't mean he could n't be just as dangerous .
This danger was eloquently pointed out by Senator Barnaby Joyce , who took some time out from his everyday duties of updating us on the state of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston 's relationship and promising not to have sex with Tony Abbott to warn that the Greens and Labor had formed an informal coalition which would usher in a nightmarish era of unrestrained leftism , where decent middle Australians would be laid waste by deranged emissions trading schemes and sinister gay marriages .
It 's always dangerous when a party sacrifices its integrity to become an extension of a larger party , simply to increase its own power and perceived relevance , warned Joyce , National Party Senate leader .
But the crux of the preferences issue is n't really about partisan politics ; there is a principle at stake .
Whether you support Green policies or would rather not be forced to live in mud huts and take heroin by a Communist dictatorship , the point is that the ability of political parties to do deals of this sort runs a serious risk of disenfranchising the ordinary voter , and right now we have little recourse .
Oh yes , pundits say , you could simply choose your own preferences , as is your right , rather than allow the parties to dictate to you , to relieve you of your democratic responsibilities in a grotesque masquerade of what our electoral system was originally conceived as .
You could simply take your little pencil and decide what order to number the boxes yourself .
Well , if a pundit ever says that to you , slap his stupid face for me .
Because maybe that 's how they do elections in Iran , or China , or … I do n't know , Angola or something .
It 's not how we do it here .
Because if there are two things utterly alien to the Australian psyche , they are wastefulness , and unnecessary work .
And if we were to pick our own numbers , thus rendering completely useless all those nicely - printed how - to - vote cards that the parties worked so hard on , and expending needless emotional and mental energy on the selection process , we'd be guilty of both .
The politicos went to the trouble of drawing up these cards ; what ingrates we'd be to ignore them .
There is democracy , and then there 's just plain rudeness .
Besides , are we really expected to number all the boxes on the Senate paper , which this year will feature over 1600 candidates and be printed on de-commissioned RAAF parachutes ?
Are we really supposed to stand in that little booth for half an hour , agonising over whether we prefer the Australian Falconers ' Party 's or Citizens United For Sexier Lollipop Ladies ' vision for the nation ?
Have those supposed " pundits " ever heard of RSI ?
Have they ever heard of apathy ?
No , once these preference deals are done , our preferential fate is sealed .
A vote for the Greens IS a vote for Labor .
A vote for Labor IS a vote for the Greens .
A vote for the Nationals IS a vote for people who smell a bit like wet sheep .
That 's democracy in the 21st century , and we all have to lie back and get used to the fact that these days , " preferences " simply means the inability to choose who you actually want , just another addition to the rich Australian political lexicon that gave us " Labor " , the " Liberals " , " Workchoices " and " The Honourable Peter Reith " .
So the lesson to learn here is that , when you 're alone in that booth on August 21 trying to decide which flavour of politics to bestow your favour on , just remember : nobody cares what you think ; do n't get any ideas .

Following the bushfire crisis that has engulfed Australia in recent months , the Rural Fire Service ( RFS ) of the state of New South Wales has said “ thank you ” in perhaps the biggest way possible .
An advert for the RFS has appeared on a 20 - metre high electronic billboard in the heart of New York City , the largest in North America .
The space in the world famous Times Square was donated to the RFS by US company Silvercast Media .
The animated advert opens with : “ Imagine fighting a bush fire higher than this billboard . ”
Darkened trees are then engulfed by huge flames , giving way to the message : “ Thank you to the brave Australian and US firefighters defending Australia .
And to the world for all your support . ”
Watch video of the enormous bushfire ‘ thank you ’ note , below :
Also see : Heartwarming images of Aussies saving our animals following the bushfires
“ We wanted to say a big ‘ thank you ’ to the incredible firefighters and community members who have done so much over the last few months , ” the RFS said on social media about the billboard .
“ It ’s been a mammoth effort from firefighters from all agencies , across all states and territories , and from the US , Canada and NZ .
“ And when we say a big thank you , we mean big .
“ Thanks to a very kind donation of ad space from Silvercast , we ’ve taken the message to a 70 foot high billboard in NYC ! ”
The advert itself was created by Australian ad agency , Wunderman Thompson .

Ron Paul went on CNN with Don Lemon on Sunday and actually defended Michael Steele for his bizarre comments attacking Obama for the war in Afghanistan :
LEMON : And before we misconstrue everything , you are coming out in support of the comment , right ?
REP .
RON PAUL ( R ) , TEXAS : Not in the entirety .
I come out in support of Chairman Steele because I think it was overkill .
He made a casual comment .
He was n't setting policy and all of a sudden people jump on him like we 're not allowed to have a discussion ?
As a matter of fact I did like what he said so I enjoyed the fact that we 're willing to have a discussion about the popularity of this war .
And truly it is Obama 's war , even though it was started during the last administration .
Obama said this is the good war .
He 's expanding the war .
The American people are n't with him .
The majority of the American people are tired of the ward and they 'd like to see it ended ; they 'd like to see our troops come home .
I mean this idea that as soon as somebody has a discussion , even if it 's not in the discussion , people are clamoring for him to resign ?
I do n't think that 's quite fair .
LEMON : Congressman , you have to let me get in on this because it seems like , you know -- I understand what you 're saying -- you want people to talk about the war .
But it seems like he was n't factually correct .
Very little of what he said , if anything , was correct factually in those comment .
And he came back himself --
PAUL : What I 'm saying --
LEMON : Hang on one second .
He came back himself and clarified them .
Why are you supporting him for a comment that he had to clarify ?
( CROSS TALKING )
PAUL : Well , he -- I did n't hear his clarification .
But if he clarified his statement because -- he was n't making a policy statement .
If he came back and said , I 'm not stating policy , that is not exactly my position --
STEELE : But he was n't telling the truth .
PAUL : Pardon me ?
STEELE : He was n't telling the truth .
PAUL : Well , I think you 're not telling the truth right now yourself .
LEMON : He said that this war -- he said that this war was started by -- or basically saying the war was started by the Obama administration .
No one even wanted --
PAUL : No , he did not say that .
LEMON : That no one wanted to go -- let me finish -- no one wanted to go into this war .
In fact , when we went into the war , most of the country supported it and it was started , again , under President Bush .
So most of what he said if not all of it was not factually correct .
PAUL : That 's right .
But he 's saying politically this is Obama 's war .
Even in the last campaign -- as a matter of fact , I thought Obama was more hawkish on this war than McCain was because he was calling for increasing troops in Afghanistan before the Republicans were .
So I think in many ways , at least politically , this is Obama 's war .
And it is a political issue .
The Republicans really suffered from the fact that the Iraq war continued for so long and hurt us at the polls .
So , I think that Republicans ought to have a right to at least say that maybe this war is n't going well and not blindly support every single thing that is being done .
And then all of a sudden , if an individual does -- you know , people accuse you , oh , you 're un- American , you 're unpatriotic .
You know , they pile on and then they pressure somebody like Steele -- like Chairman Steele that he has to back off .
He did n't have a policy statement .
He was merely making a casual statement .
And when he said , for over 1,000 years and even longer , nobody 's been successful in invading Afghanistan , he is telling the truth .
Time - asymmetry of Government : Terminal Stage Approaching
I gotta read Matt Ridley ’s new book , The Rational Optimist .
He ’s going to be on the Reason / TSI Cruise in January , and here ’s a snippet Arnold quoted from the book :
Empires , indeed governments generally , tend to be good things at first and bad things the longer they last .
First they improve society ’s ability to flourish by providing central services and removing impediments to trade and specialisation ; thus , even Genghis Khan ’s Pax Mongolica lubricated Asia ’s overland trade by exterminating brigands along the Silk Road … But … governments gradually employ more and more ambitious elites who capture a greater and greater share of the society ’s income by interfering more and more in people ’s lives as they give themselves more and more rules to enforce , until they kill the goose that lays the golden eggs .
There is a lesson for today .
This is exactly my view of history , the one you can find in Mancur Olson , or applied to the USA in Rauch ’s book “ Government ’s End ” .
The normal mode of government is to parasitically waste more and more of society ’s resources , until there is a phase shift ( collapse , revolution against government , revolution of colony against empire , etc ) [ 1 ] .
The US and Europe have , in my opinion , moved from the middle stage of this process towards the end stage .
They have only decades remaining in their current form .
If you want to personally influence the future , you should be watching this trend and asking yourself – what comes next ?
How can the transition be as painless as possible ?
The sad thing is , a lot of people are wasting a lot of time and resources on trying to cure this metastasized terminal cancer .
There do n’t seem to be that many people who are , like we at this blog ( and my professional work at TSI ) , working on figuring out the next stage .
I really wish there were more serious alternatives ( real options with real transition plans – not utopian hopes ) being proposed , and more resources behind all of them .
I ’m biased , but I do n’t think it ’s just that .
This is serious , folks .
Although …much less serious than past collapses .
I do n’t think there will be much starvation or bloodshed .
Paying attention to your own life and letting societal re-organization take care of itself is eminently reasonable , this time around .
I do n’t fault anyone for doing that .
But I do fault those who act without careful analysis , and so make poor use of their resources .
Ah well – took me many years to see the light .
Anyway , just wanted to make sure everyone knew that current socialist western democracies are in a slow collapse , in case you had n’t gotten the bulletin yet :) .
[ 1 ]
To be honest , I must admit that I ’ve only studied this phenomenon in the context of democracy , so while I am inclined to believe it is more generally true , that could just be my prejudices speaking .
Introducing “ Razor ” – a new view engine for ASP.
NET Saturday , July 3 , 2010
One of the things my team has been working on has been a new view engine option for ASP .
NET .
ASP .NET MVC has always supported the concept of “ view engines ” – which are the pluggable modules that implement different template syntax options .
The “ default ” view engine for ASP .
NET MVC today uses the same .aspx /.ascx /.master file templates as ASP .
NET Web Forms .
Other popular ASP.NET MVC view engines used today include Spark and NHaml .
The new view - engine option we ’ve been working on is optimized around HTML generation using a code - focused templating approach .
The codename for this new view engine is “ Razor ” , and we ’ll be shipping the first public beta of it shortly .
Design Goals
We had several design goals in mind as we prototyped and evaluated “ Razor ” :
Compact , Expressive , and Fluid : Razor minimizes the number of characters and keystrokes required in a file , and enables a fast , fluid coding workflow .
Unlike most template syntaxes , you do not need to interrupt your coding to explicitly denote server blocks within your HTML .
The parser is smart enough to infer this from your code .
This enables a really compact and expressive syntax which is clean , fast and fun to type .
Easy to Learn : Razor is easy to learn and enables you to quickly be productive with a minimum of concepts .
You use all your existing language and HTML skills .
Is not a new language :
We consciously chose not to create a new imperative language with Razor .
Instead we wanted to enable developers to use their existing C# / VB ( or other ) language skills with Razor , and deliver a template markup syntax that enables an awesome HTML construction workflow with your language of choice .
Works with any Text Editor : Razor does n’t require a specific tool and enables you to be productive in any plain old text editor ( notepad works great ) .
Has great Intellisense : While Razor has been designed to not require a specific tool or code editor , it will have awesome statement completion support within Visual Studio .
We ’ll be updating Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Web Developer 2010 to have full editor intellisense for it .
Unit Testable :
The new view engine implementation will support the ability to unit test views ( without requiring a controller or web - server , and can be hosted in any unit test project – no special app - domain required ) .
We ’ve spent the last few months building applications with it and doing lots of usability studies of it with a variety of volunteers ( including several groups of non -. NET web developers ) .
The feedback so far from people using it has been really great .
Choice and Flexibility
One of the best things about ASP .
NET is that most things in it are pluggable .
If you find something does n’t work the way you want it to , you can swap it out for something else .
The next release of ASP .
NET MVC will include a new “ Add -> View ” dialog that makes it easy for you to choose the syntax you want to use when you create a new view template file .
It will allow you to easily select any of of the available view engines you have installed on your machine – giving you the choice to use whichever view approach feels most natural to you :
Razor will be one of the view engine options we ship built - into ASP .
NET MVC .
All view helper methods and programming model features will be available with both Razor and the .ASPX view engine .
You ’ll also be able to mix and match view templates written using multiple view - engines within a single application or site .
For example , you could write some views using .aspx files , some with .cshtml or .vbhtml files ( the file - extensions for Razor files – C# and VB respectively ) , and some with Spark or NHaml .
You can also have a view template using one view - engine use a partial view template written in another .
You ’ll have full choice and flexibility .
Hello World Sample with Razor
Razor enables you to start with static HTML ( or any textual content ) and then make it dynamic by adding server code to it .
One of the core design goals behind Razor is to make this coding process fluid , and to enable you to quickly integrate server code into your HTML markup with a minimum of keystrokes .
To see a quick example of this let ’s create a simple “ hello world ” sample that outputs a message like so :
Building it with .
ASPX Code Nuggets
If we were to build the above “ hello world ” sample using ASP .
NET ’s existing .
ASPX markup syntax , we might write it using < %= %> blocks to indicate “ code nuggets ” within our HTML markup like so :
One observation to make about this “ hello world ” sample is that each code nugget block requires 5 characters ( < %= %> ) to denote the start and stop of the code sequence .
Some of these characters ( in particular the % key – which is center top on most keyboards ) are n’t the easiest to touch - type .
Building it with Razor Syntax
You denote the start of a code block with Razor using a @ character .
Unlike <% %> code nuggets , Razor does not require you to explicitly close the code - block :
The Razor parser has semantic knowledge of C# / VB code used within code - blocks – which is why we did n’t need to explicitly close the code blocks above .
Razor was able to identify the above statements as self - contained code blocks , and implicitly closed them for us .
Even in this trivial “ hello world ” example we ’ve managed to save ourselves 12 keystrokes over what we had to type before .
The @ character is also easier to reach on the keyboard than the % character which makes it faster and more fluid to type .
Loops and Nested HTML Sample
Let ’s look at another simple scenario where we want to list some products ( and the price of each product beside it ) :
Building it with .
ASPX Code Nuggets
If we were to implement this using ASP .
NET ’s existing .
ASPX markup syntax , we might write the below code to dynamically generate a < ul > list with < li > items for each product inside it :
Building it with Razor Syntax
Below is how to generate the equivalent output using Razor :
Notice above how we started a “ foreach ” loop using the @ symbol , and then contained a line of HTML content with code blocks within it .
Because the Razor parser understands the C# semantics in our code block , it was able to determine that the < li > content should be contained within the foreach and treated like content that should be looped .
It also recognized that the trailing } terminated the foreach statement .
Razor was also smart enough to identify the @p .
Name and @p .
Price statements within the < li > element as server code – and execute them each time through the loop .
Notice how Razor was smart enough to automatically close the @p .
Name and @p .
Price code blocks by inferring how the HTML and code is being used together .
The ability to code like this without having to add lots of open / close markers throughout your templates ends up making the whole coding process really fluid and fast .
If - Blocks and Multi-line Statements
Below are a few examples of other common scenarios :
If Statements
Like our foreach example above , you can embed content within if statements ( or any other C# or VB language construct ) , without having to be explicit about the code block ’s begin / end .
For example :
Multi-line Statements
You can denote multiple lines of code by wrapping it within a @{ code } block like so :
Notice above how variables can span multiple server code blocks – the “ message ” variable defined within the multi- line @{ } block , for example , is also being used within the @message code block .
This is conceptually the same as the <% %> and < %= %> syntax within .aspx markup files .
Multi-Token Statements
The @( ) syntax enables a code block to have multiple tokens .
For example , we could re-write the above code to concatenate a string and the number together within a @ ( code ) block :
Integrating Content and Code
The Razor parser has a lot of language smarts built - into it – enabling you to rely on it to do the heavily lifting , as opposed to you having to explicitly do it yourself .
Does it break with email addresses and other usages of @ in HTML ?
Razor ’s language parser is clever enough in most cases to infer whether a @ character within a template is being used for code or static content .
For example , below I ’m using a @ character as part of an email address :
When parsing a file , Razor examines the content on the right - hand side of any @ character and attempts to determine whether it is C# code ( if it is a CSHTML file ) or VB code ( if it is a VBHTML file ) or whether it is just static content .
The above code will output the following HTML ( where the email address is output as static content and the @DateTime .
Now is evaluated as code :
In cases where the content is valid as code as well ( and you want to treat it as content ) , you can explicitly escape out @ characters by typing @@ .
Identifying Nested Content
When nesting HTML content within an if / else , foreach or other block statement , you should look to wrap the inner content within an HTML or XML element to better identify that it is the beginning of a content block .
For example , below I ’ve wrapped a multi-line content block ( which includes a code - nugget ) with a < span > element :
This will render the below content to the client – note that it includes the < span > tag :
You can optionally wrap nested content with a < text > block for cases where you have content that you want to render to the client without a wrapping tag :
The above code will render the below content to the client – note that it does not include any wrapping tag :
HTML Encoding
By default content emitted using a @ block is automatically HTML encoded to better protect against XSS attack scenarios .
Layout / MasterPage Scenarios – The Basics
It is important to have a consistent look and feel across all of the pages within your web - site / application .
ASP .NET 2.0 introduced the concept of “ master pages ” which helps enable this when using .aspx based pages or templates .
Razor also supports this concept using “ layout pages ” – which allow you to define a common site template , and then inherit its look and feel across all the views / pages on your site .
Simple Layout Example
Below is a simple example of a layout page – which we ’ll save in a file called “ SiteLayout.cshtml ” .
It can contain any static HTML content we want to include in it , as well as dynamic server code .
We ’ll then add a call to the “ RenderBody ( ) ” helper method at the location in the template where we want to “ fill in ” specific body content for a requested URL :
We can then create a view template called “ Home.cshtml ” that contains only the content / code necessary to construct the specific body of a requested page , and which relies on the layout template for its outer content :
Notice above how we are explicitly setting the “ LayoutPage ” property in code within our Home.cshtml file .
This indicates that we want to use the SiteLayout.cshtml template as the layout for this view .
We could alternatively indicate the layout file we want to use within a ASP .
NET MVC Controller invoking Home.cshtml as a view template , or by configuring it as the default layout to use for our site ( in which case we can specify it in one file in our project and have all view templates pick it up automatically ) .
When we render Home.cshtml as a view - template , it will combine the content from the layout and sub-page and send the following content to the client :
Compact , Clean , Expressive Code
One of the things to notice in the code above is that the syntax for defining layouts and using them from views / pages is clean and minimal .
The code screen - shots above of the SiteLayout.cshtml and Home.cshtml files contain literally all of the content in the two .cshtml files – there is no extra configuration or additional tags , no < %@ Page % > prefix , nor any other markup or properties that need to be set .
We are trying to keep the code you write compact , easy and fluid .
We also want to enable anyone with a text editor to be able to open , edit and easily tweak / customize them .
No code generation or intellisense required .
Layout / MasterPage Scenarios – Adding Section Overrides
Layout pages optionally support the ability to define different “ sections ” within them that view templates based on the layout can then override and “ fill - in ” with custom content .
This enables you to easily override / fill - in discontinuous content regions within a layout page , and provides you with a lot of layout flexibility for your site .
For example , we could return to our SiteLayout.cshtml file and define two sections within our layout that the view templates within our site can optionally choose to fill - in .
We ’ll name these sections “ menu ” and “ footer ” – and indicate that they are optional ( and not required ) within our site by passing an optional=true parameter to the RenderSection ( ) helper call ( we are doing this using the new C# optional parameter syntax that I ’ve previously blogged about ) .
Because these two sections are marked as “ optional ” , I ’m not required to define them within my Home.cshtml file .
My site will continue to work fine if they are n’t there .
Let ’s go back into Home.cshtml , though , and define a custom Menu and Footer section for them .
The below screenshot contains all of the content in Home.cshtml – there is nothing else required in the file .
Note : I moved setting the LayoutPage to be a site wide setting – which is why it is no longer there .
Our custom “ menu ” and “ footer ” section overrides are being defined within named @section { } blocks within the file .
We chose not to require you to wrap the “ main / body ” content within a section and instead to just keep it inline ( which both saves keystrokes and enables you to easily add sections to your layout pages without having to go back through all your existing pages changing their syntax ) .
When we render Home.cshtml as a view - template again , it will now combine the content from the layout and sub-page , integrating the two new custom section overrides in it , and send down the following content to the client :
Encapsulation and Re - Use with HTML Helpers
We ’ve covered how to maintain a consistent site - wide look and feel using layout pages .
Let ’s now look at how we can also create re-usable “ HTML helpers ” that enable us to cleanly encapsulate HTML generation functionality into libraries that we can re-use across our site – or even across multiple different sites .
Code Based HTML Helpers
ASP .NET MVC today has the concept of “ HTML Helpers ” – which are methods that can be invoked within code - blocks , and which encapsulate generating HTML .
These are implemented using pure code today ( typically as extension methods ) .
All of the existing HTML extension methods built with ASP .
NET MVC ( both ones we ’ve built and ones built by others ) will work using the “ Razor ” view engine ( no code changes required ) :
Declarative HTML Helpers
Generating HTML output using a code - only class approach works – but is not ideal .
One of the features we are looking to enable with Razor is an easy way to create re-usable HTML helpers using a more declarative approach .
Our plan is to enable you to define reusable helpers using a @helper { } declarative syntax like below .
You ’ll be able to place .cshtml files that contain these helpers into a Views \Helpers directory and then re-use them from any view or page in your site ( no extra steps required ) :
Note above how our ProductListing ( ) helper is able to define arguments and parameters .
This enables you to pass any parameters you want to them ( and take full advantage of existing languages features like optional parameters , nullable types , generics , etc ) .
You ’ll also get debugging support for them within Visual Studio .
Note :
The @helper syntax wo n’t be in the first beta of Razor – but is something we hope will be enabled with the next drop .
Code - based helpers will work with the first beta .
Passing Inline Templates as Parameters
One other useful ( and extremely powerful ) feature we are enabling with Razor is the ability to pass “ inline template ” parameters to helper methods .
These “ inline templates ” can contain both HTML and code , and can be invoked on - demand by helper methods .
Below is an example of this feature in action using a “ Grid ” HTML Helper that renders a DataGrid to the client :
The Grid. Render ( ) method call above is C# .
We are using the new C# named parameter syntax to pass strongly - typed arguments to the Grid .
Render method - which means we get full statement completion / intellisense and compile - time checking for the above syntax .
The “ format ” parameter we are passing when defining columns is an “ inline template ” – which contains both custom html and code , and which we can use to customize the format of the data .
What is powerful about this is that the Grid helper can invoke our inline template as a delegate method , and invoke it as needed and as many times as it wants .
In the scenario above it will call it each time it renders a row in the grid – and pass in the “ item ” that our template can use to display the appropriate response .
This capability will enable much richer HTML helper methods to be developed .
You ’ll be able to implement them using both a code approach ( like the way you build extension methods today ) as well as using the declarative @helper {} approach .
Visual Studio Support
As I mentioned earlier , one of our goals with Razor is to minimize typing , and enable it to be easily edited with nothing more than a basic text editor ( notepad works great ) .
We ’ve kept the syntax clean , compact and simple to help enable that .
We have also designed Razor so that you get a rich code editing experience within Visual Studio .
We will provide full HTML , JavaScript and C# / VB code intellisense within Razor based files :
Notice above how we are providing intellisense for a Product object on the “ @p. ” code embedded within the < li > element inside a foreach loop .
Also notice how our \ Views folder within the Solution Explorer contains both .aspx and .cshtml view templates .
You can use multiple view engines within a single application – making it easy to choose whichever syntax feels best to you .
Summary
We think “ Razor ” provides a great new view - engine option that is streamlined for code - focused templating .
It a coding workflow that is fast , expressive and fun .
It ’s syntax is compact and reduces typing – while at the same time improving the overall readability of your markup and code .
It will be shipping as a built - in view engine with the next release of ASP .
NET MVC .
You can also drop standalone .cshtml /.vbhtml files into your application and run them as single - pages – which also enables you to take advantage of it within ASP .
NET Web Forms applications as well .
The feedback from developers who have been trying it out the last few months has been extremely positive .
We are going to be shipping the first public beta of it shortly , and are looking forward to your feedback on it .
Hope this helps ,
Scott

‘ Spider - Man ’ Director Sam Raimi Confirmed For ‘ Wizard Of Oz’ Reboot
Just recently we ran a story that had multiple big - name directors and the high - profile projects that their names were said to be possible candidates for .
Usually those never end up playing out , but it now appears that one of those names is officially the man for the job .
Deadline is reporting that Sam Raimi has officially come on board Oz : The Great and Powerful , the new movie from The Walt Disney Company that will offer an alternate perspective to the 1939 classic , The Wizard of Oz .
The movie will go back before the ’ 39 film and the films before that to L. Frank Baum ‘s wonderful original story .
It was at first thought that it would follow a traveling snake oil salesman who attempts to escape his life by way of hot air balloon and ends up in the magical lands of Oz , where he becomes that familiar wizard .
Now it sounds like instead , the man will be a circus wrangler who ’s swept away by a tornado .
Reports state that a rewrite of the script are planned , so who knows what the final script will hold .
The Raimi conformation held no indication as to whether or not Robert Downey Jr. would sign up to play the lead , though it does sound like he is still the top choice for it .
It looks like this will be the next project for Raimi after Sony decided to completely scrap the progress of Spider - Man 4 , which was well in - progress at the time , and start over from scratch .
The director was also hired to captain a movie based on the ultra - popular MMO game World of Warcraft , but that still looks to be a ways off , which this guy is not happy about at all .
The interim Kyrgyzstan government today went ahead with a constitutional referendum , just two weeks after an outbreak of ethnic violence in which at least 2,000 people , most of them ethnic Uzbeks , were killed and tens of thousands left homeless .
The country 's interim leader , Rosa Otunbayeva , urged Kyrgz citizens to take part in the ballot , designed to legitimise the temporary government and replace the country 's abuse - prone presidential system with a more European - style parliamentary democracy .
But international observers and human rights groups have questioned the timing of the referendum , which takes place against a backdrop of the worst ethnic violence in Central Asia for two decades .
They also warned that the vote could exacerbate divisions between the north and south of the country and hasten its break - up , or lead to civil war .
Voting in Osh , the city at the centre of the violence , Otunbayeva admitted Kyrgyzstan was " on the brink of great danger " .
She added : " The results of this referendum will show that the country is united and that the people are one .
It will stand strong on its own feet and move forward . "
In a TV address yesterday , Otunbayeva also said the ballot would enable Kyrgyzstan to make a clean break with the previous autocratic regime .
The current opposition - led government took power in April after violent street protests in the capital , Bishkek , forced the president , Kurmanbek Bakiyev , to flee .
Bakiyev is now in exile in Belarus .
He told the BBC : " So many people have died , there are hundreds of thousands of refugees , and in this situation they still want to have a referendum ?
It 's simply unjust .
What referendum ? "
But Otunbayeva said : " You should take part in the referendum to get rid of the Bakiyev constitution , which threatens the return of the mafia - clan pyramid of power . "
She added that Kyrgyzstan should not skip a " historical opportunity " to go down a " democratic route " free of bribery , pressure and cheating .
Voters are being asked whether they approve of a new constitution .
If it is adopted , parliamentary elections will be held every five years , with a largely ceremonial president elected for a six - year term .
Parliamentary elections are due to be held in October , with Otunbayeva , a former diplomat and ambassador in London , declaring she will stay in power until 2011 before stepping aside .
Riots erupted in Osh on 10 June , spreading to neighbouring Jalalabad .
An apparent dispute between Uzbek and Kyrgyz youths escalated into what Uzbeks said was genocide .
Survivors said Kyrgyz soldiers using armoured personnel carriers , and acting with the apparent complicity of the army , police and local administration , opened fire on men , women and children .
A civilian Kyrgyz mob then looted and burned Uzbek homes .
The UN estimates that the violence displaced 400,000 Uzbeks in the south of the country , with 75,000 fleeing across the nearby border into Uzbekistan .
Most have now returned and are staying in makeshift accommodation , but rights groups said the situation remained tense , with both groups having retreated into ethnic near - homogenous areas and fearful of further attacks .
Uzbeks have also complained of harassment from Kyrgyz security forces .
Fyodor Lukyanov , the editor in chief of Russia in Global Affairs , said : " I can't imagine how you can have a referendum in a situation of de facto civil war .
" The local authorities hope to legitimise themselves .
But if the southern part will not take part in the referendum it will effectively split the country .
I 'm afraid the dangers for Kyrgyzstan have just started . "
Russia and the US both have airbases in the north of the country , but have been reluctant to commit peacekeeping forces .
Human Rights Watch and the International Crisis Group last week called for an international stabilisation mission to Kyrgyzstan to provide security for refugees , prevent more violence and ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid .
" The government 's decision to proceed with the referendum and the return of thousands of refugees and internally displaced people to almost uninhabitable areas makes the situation even more volatile , " Human Rights Watch said , noting that many Uzbek refugees had no documents or ID .
The International Crisis Group said there was now a real risk of " large - scale ethnic violence " spreading across the multinational Ferghana valley , which is divided between Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan .

The 7 - page memo seen by the NYT and signed by CENTCOM commander Gen. David Petraeus authorizes US troops to engage in clandestine intelligence - gathering in the greater Middle East .
The article implies that the memo also authorizes more military teams to go into unconventional conflict situations in both unfriendly and friendly countries .
Critics worry that the order blurs the line between combat soldiers and spies and weakens the claim of all soldiers to humane treatment under the Geneva Conventions .
My own view is that the United States was founded as a government of laws , not men , and that the siren call of covert operations is steadily undermining the rule of law .
Blurring the line between military action and spying makes it impossible to talk about the covert missions , since they are typically classiified .
The same is true for predator drone strikes .
Military action such as launching drones should be carried out by the uniformed military , not by CIA operatives or , worse , contractors .
The former action would allow us to discuss the campaigns as free citizens of a republic .
As it is now , often civilian contractors are piloting drones long - distance and we cannot so much as get a straight answer out of the elected officials .
Where the US is striking at friendly countries , there should be a Status of Forces agreement to provide a legal framework for the actions .
And intelligence gathering should be carried out by the civilian such agencies .
The more you make elements of the military actually intelligence assets , the more likely it is that the lines between them will get strained .
That blurring could be bad for all troops .
There is already a tendency in the ME for locals to see all Americans as CIA , and giving troops a lot of covert missions will reinforce these views .
We still can be a country of laws , not men , ca n’t we ?
It is n’t too late ?
Wal - Mart slashes iPhone price to $ 97
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Wal - Mart , the world 's largest retailer , plans to slash the price of Apple 's 16GB 3GS iPhone to $ 97 beginning Tuesday .
Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) is widely expected to unveil a brand - new iPhone next month , and could be working with retailers to clear out its remaining inventory of the about - to - be- outdated model .
At the new price , customers will save $ 100 on Apple 's smart phone , which currently sells for $ 199 .
The deal requires that the phone be purchased with a two - year contract from AT&T , the iPhone 's exclusive service provider .
" It is our commitment to always lead on price , " Mehrdad Akbar , Wal - Mart 's ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) senior category director for wireless , in a prepared statement about the price change .
Apple sold 8.3 million iPhones last quarter , more than twice the amount sold during the same period a year ago .
Wal - Mart 's pre-Memorial
Day price whack comes as technology giants such as Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , Research in Motion ( RIM ) and Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ , Fortune 500 ) , which recently snapped up Palm , vie for top dog status in the smart phone market .
Industry analysts say that worldwide smart phone sales topped 54 million units in the first quarter , up nearly 49 % from a year ago .
At $ 97 , Wal - Mart 's price slightly undercuts the $ 99 price tag several analysts anticipated for the remaining iPhone 3GS stock .
When consumers get sight of a new iPhone model on the horizon , sales of the existing model typically falls off sharply .
In the furor surrounding last month 's theft of a new iPhone prototype , Apple filed legal documents claiming that leaked details of the new model would be " immensely damaging " to the company because " people that would have otherwise purchased a currently existing Apple product would wait for the next item to be released . "

BBC News iPhone and iPad app launches in the UK Published duration 23 July 2010
image caption Versions of the apps are already available worldwide
A BBC News app for the iPhone and iPad has been launched in the UK , the BBC has announced .
The free - to - download apps for Apple products were originally due to be made available in April 2010 .
The UK launch was delayed while the BBC Trust , the corporation 's governing body , assessed the proposals and their impact on the rest of the industry .
Apps for other devices such as Android phones will launch later in the year .
Similar apps for BBC Sport and iPlayer will also be coming soon .
The apps do not " represent a significant change to the BBC 's existing public services , " ruled the BBC Trust , meaning that further scrutiny was not required .
BBC Trustee Diane Coyle said that the body would continue to monitor the launch .
Many news organisations already offer apps that give people a quick and easy way to keep up with events .
Earlier in 2010 , the Newspaper Publishers Association ( NPA ) said it feared the corporation would " damage the nascent market " for apps by entering the market with a free product .
" The concern the newspaper industry has is that the survival of our big independent news organisations largely depends on them being able to make money from new platforms other than print , " said Dominic Ponsford , editor of Press Gazette .
" Mobile is a massive part of that and there is concern that the BBC could blow their fledgling apps out of the water by being such a dominant brand . "
However the apps market was a space that the BBC could not ignore either , he added .

The first FPS I ever remember playing was Wolfenstein on our families first computer .
To kind of date it , the computer was DOS based and the hard drive was 80 MB and we thought it was gigantic .
This game reminds me a lot of those first experiences with Wolfenstein .
Doom II was brought over to the Xbox Live Arcade without any fancy upgrades to the graphics and it plays beautifully .
If you are not familiar with the Doom title here is the summary given from its Xbox Live Arcade page mentioned above :
To save Earth , you must descend into the stygian depths of hell in DOOM II .
Battle nastier , deadlier demons and monsters with your trusty Super Shotgun .
Survive more mind - blowing explosions and take part in the bloodiest , fiercest , most awesome blastfest ever .
Recruit your friends and plow through nine all - new levels in the new episode , No Rest for the Living !
Play solo or multiplayer over Xbox LIVE with up to four players .
DOOM II includes split - screen co-op over Xbox LIVE , game clips , 5.1 Surround Sound , enhanced graphics , and HD display support .
• Legendary weapons :
Arm yourself with the legendary weapons from the original DOOM , as well as the Super Shotgun .
•
New enemies and levels : Experience DOOM like never before , with six new enemies and 32 new levels .
Play it alone or invite a friend to play in co-op mode via split screen or Xbox LIVE .
• Bonus chapter : Brave the never - before - seen bonus chapter , No Rest for the Living , an Xbox LIVE Arcade exclusive .
• Deathmatch : Jump into intense deathmatch action with up to four players via split screen or over Xbox LIVE .
• Avatar extras : Outfit your Avatar with the old - school DOOM II T - Shirt or the full - body DOOM Marine uniform .
You have two campaigns to choose from when you start .
There is really no story or plot as you go through the levels .
The point of the game is to find a baddie , kill it , find the various keys to open up areas inside the level , kill more baddies and eventually find the exit .
Rinse and repeat until your heart ’s content .
As you progress further in the game the enemies become bigger , and the levels become darker and more maze - like .
Many of the original FPS ’s were set up like this .
More like mazes than open gameplay .
They never get too bad and you always have access to a map by simply hitting the “ X ” button .
The controls are set up the similar to the way most FPS games are now .
The right trigger shoots , left trigger allows you to sprint , left joystick moves your character and the right joystick moves the direction of where you are looking .
The controls are very fluid and have no real hiccups other than the fact that you cannot look up or down and your character cannot jump .
You sometimes have to use the sprint trigger to go from platform to platform as a “ fake jump ” option .
You have to remember , the original game was designed before the mouse was in popular use , so the game was created with the arrow keys in mind for control .
If you are going to play this game looking for DOOM II with updated graphics , stop right here .
The original pixelated graphics are used and they look exactly the same , except in HD .
They did not do a graphic overhaul like they have done on a lot of the arcade titles .
The sound for this game is done in 5.1 surround sound and sounds great , but I think I am too used to the FPS games of today .
If I hear a sound behind me I expect to see something when I turn around .
There seemed to be some random noises every now and then in the game that created a sound that had no source , but sounded like it was behind you .
It is easy to get used to and ignore , but is something that will throw you off when you first start playing the game .
Overall the game is pretty good .
You just have to go in knowing that this is an older game being re-released .
The levels can get hard at times , but you will have plenty of weaponry to support you and you are able to save at any point in the game .
I went online , but only to check out how it was .
I did n’t spend a tremendous amount of time playing it .
There was some lag , but it was still playable .
I just did n’t understand how this game could have any lag when the more modern games that are doing a lot more do n’t have lag .
I do n’t know if I will play it again now that the review is done , but I do like knowing it is there if I just want to quickly go blast some demons .
When it comes down to my final recommendation , I would say try the demo and make your own decision on it .
The demo plays the exact same .
Possible recommendations :
Buy immediately
Rent to own ( Good , but try before buying , may not be for everyone )
Rent ( good game , but not long enough to be worthy of a purchase )
Wait and get a cheap used copy
Avoid at all costs
Final Recommendation : Rent to own

Well , it looks like Droid Incredible owners might soon be rewarded with more than a $ 25 gift card -- Droid Life is reporting that the phone is set to get an OTA update that will add some of the most oft - requested features .
That includes mobile hotspot functionality , 720 p video recording and , last but not least , the familiar Droid red eye boot animation that 's been curiously absent .
No word on a rollout date just yet , but Droid Life 's tipster has provided some pics , and a video of that boot sequence ( check it out after the break ) .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- BP PLC moved closer Monday to bringing to heel the Gulf of Mexico gusher that ranks as the worst spill in U.S. history , but officials acknowledged that more equipment is needed to process the huge flow of oil and natural gas coming from the ruptured well .
U.S. Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said BP BP , - 1.18 % ( BP ) is now capturing about 11,000 barrels of oil a day from a containment cap lowered onto the riser pipe late last week , but more oil continues to billow out into the water from unclosed vents on the cap , as well as from broken parts of the seal .
BP will bring in a second processing facility to handle the mix of oil , gas and seawater coming from the well , Allen said during a press conference at the White House .
" The second vessel is on its way , " Allen said .
President Barack Obama said the economic impact of the spill will be " substantial " and that oil will continue to leak " even if the containment effort is completely successful . "
Last month , a team of scientists led by the U.S. Geological Survey put the top end of the projected daily rate of flow at 25,000 barrels .
But when BP cut the riser pipe to prepare it for the containment cap last week , officials said the move would have the effect of undoing a crimp in the pipe and increase the flow by up to 20 % more .
Allen said the government 's flow rate technical group is now working on a revised estimate of the size of the spill in order to assess penalties that BP will have to pay .
The massive spill began after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers and triggering an environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
The rig sank two days later .
Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , said BP will likely be on the hook for " many billions " of dollars .
As Wall Street continued to crunch numbers on what the cost of the spill will be for BP investors , Goldman Sachs analysts took the figures spent by Exxon Corp. , now Exxon Mobil XOM , +0.14 % , in the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident , and adjusted them for inflation to come up with a figure of $ 40,000 per barrel spilled .
Analysts projected a total spill of 800,000 barrels and a cost of $ 36 billion to BP -- in line with earlier Wall Street estimates of up to $ 40 billion .
Allen said the government is now battling " hundreds of thousands " of patches of oil both at sea and that have washed up between Louisiana and Port St. Joe on Florida 's Gulf Coast .
Goldman downgrades BP
Meanwhile , BP said the spill has cost it more than $ 1.25 billion thus far , while the Coast Guard expects cleanup efforts to last for months .
BP decided Sunday to keep some of the four vents open on the cap over its leaking well a mile below the surface of the Gulf because it did n't have enough processing capacity to handle the mix of sea water and oil coming from the gusher , according to a New York Times report .
The Discoverer Enterprise drill ship at the site is equipped to handle up to 15,000 barrels a day .
On the investment front , Goldman Sachs analysts downgraded its rating on shares of BP to neutral from buy .
Analysts said Monday that it 's impossible to know the full costs of the spill at this point but that they may not fully materialize for a decade , subject to extensive legal wrangling .
BP could handle about $ 11 billion in cleanup costs before resorting to a dividend cut or a rights issue to stoke bolster its cash holdings , Goldman Sachs said .
About 27 % of BP 's global production comes from the U.S. , with the Gulf of Mexico along contributing 14 % of its total production , analysts noted .
" Beyond the cost of the spill and the potential pressure this could place on the dividend , we believe the spill will cause reputational damage , impacting BP 's ability to do business and compete as an operator in the Gulf of Mexico , in the U.S. and globally , Goldman Sachs said .
Separately , Goldman is leading efforts to fend off any potential takeover attempts for the U.K. oil major , according to a report in the Independent on Sunday .
Goldman , as BP 's regular advisor , is " rumored to be dusting off the company 's defense playbook , " the newspaper said .
Stricter measures will be introduced in Liverpool , Warrington , Hartlepool and Middlesbrough
It 's happening , somehow .
EA DICE has confirmed to PC Gamer that Battlefield : Bad Company 2's Onslaught mode is coming to PC .
The co-op focused joint , which is already being sold as DLC to console owners of the game , features four - player play similar to that of the game 's existing " Rush " mode .
In a nutshell , Onslaught is about you and three other dudes taking over control points in four specially retrofitted maps .
The reason DICE did n't immediately commit to taking Onslaught onto PC is because of the co-op .
The studio just did n't want to sacrifice its big 32 - man servers for this much tinier and more focused mode .
In a bit of irony , it was the one - upsmanship with Modern Warfare 2 that put DICE in this position to begin with , since peer - to - peer networking would have removed the wait for Onslaught entirely .
PC Gamer does n't have any information on how DICE is handling its server woes , but it 's probably safe to assume that the studio has figured out a way to get around them considering Onslaught is finally coming out and all .
Speaking of that , no word on price or release date .
We 've contacted EA to say " hey , what 's up " and ask about these details .

Last night Bill O’Reilly tried to take on Rachel Maddow criticism of Fox ’s Shirley Sherrod story by boasting about FNC ’s ratings .
Maddow responded tonight by taking him apart , “ You were trying to take the attention off me saying that your network Fox News continually crusades on flagrantly bogus stories designed to make White Americans fear Black Americans . ”
Here is the video and a partial transcript via MSNBC :

After playing a clip of Bill - O bragging about Fox News ’ ratings , Maddow said , “ Here Mr. O’Reilly has a point .
You and Fox get great ratings .
It is so awesome how great your ratings are .
Here ’s the score card from last night .
It is in TV ratings speak , but I think it will be clear enough .
Here ’s Mr. O’Reilly that 757 would be him at 8:00 , and that 245 would be me at 9:00 , different hour , but you know same point , and do n’t tell Susan ’s mom whose actually pretty sensitive about these kinds of things , but we ’re actually outrated by all kinds of shows .
“ Deadliest Catch , ” that ’s about fishing .
We get killed by a show called “ The Closer ” about which I know nothing about except it kills us in the ratings , and we get smaller ratings than WWE wrestling ….
Of course , all of those shows also kill Mr. O’Reilly ’s show in the ratings as well as everything else on Fox , as do Sponge Bob , reruns of NCIS , and Hannah Montana , Forever , which is totally understandable .
They are all more watched than The O’Reilly Factor which is totally irrelevant . ”
Maddow addressed O’Reilly ’s straw man directly , “ When you got all kicked your butt , and Madame on me , you really were n’t trying to tout your network ’s ratings .
You were trying to take the attention off me saying that your network Fox News continually crusades on flagrantly bogus stories designed to make White Americans fear Black Americans , which Fox News most certainly does for a political purpose , even if it upends the lives of individuals like Shirley Sherrod .
Even as it frays the fabric of the nation , and even as it makes the American Dream more of a dream and less of a promise . ”
She concluded , “ You can insult us all you want about television ratings and you ’ll be right that yours are bigger for now , and maybe forever .
You are the undisputed winner .
Even if nobody watches us except for my mom , my girlfriend , and people who forget to turn off the TV after Keith , you still would be wrong about the facts , your highness . ”
If you get into a discussion with any defender of Fox News undoubtedly at some point when they can no longer disputes the facts about FNC , they break out the ratings diversion .
Bill O’Reilly tried to do this to Rachel Maddow , and she not only called him on it , but she also dismantled the Fox News ratings straw man diversion .
Ms. Maddow was one hundred percent spot on .
Even O’Reilly ’s supposedly huge ratings get dwarfed by tween programming , reality television , and cartoons .
O’Reilly knew that he could not defend his network on the Sherrod , so he changed the subject as quickly as possible .
If Maddow seemed absolutely giddy to be mentioned by O’Reilly , she was .
Not because it will boost her ratings , but because her show is getting noticed , and having an impact .
Rachel Maddow is one of the rare people in television who are n’t about ratings .
As she pointed out , something matter more , like facts for instance .
Bill - O would be wise to leave Rachel Maddow alone .
She is too smart , and when he tries to take her on , he is in way , way , way , over his head .
BP Buys ' Oil ' Search Terms to Redirect Users to Official Company Website Oil company bought ' oil ' phrases on Google , Yahoo redirecting users to website .
VENICE , La. , June 5 , 2010  --
Be careful where you click , especially if you 're looking for news on the BP oil spill .
BP , the very company responsible for the oil spill that is already the worst in U.S. history , has purchased several phrases on search engines such as Google and Yahoo so that the first result that shows up directs information seekers to the company 's official website .
A simple Google search of " oil spill " turns up several thousand news results , but the first link , highlighted at the very top of the page , is from BP .
" Learn more about how BP is helping , " the link 's tagline reads .
A spokesman for the company confirmed to ABC News that it had , in fact , bought these search terms to make information on the spill more accessible to the public .
" We have bought search terms on search engines like Google to make it easier for people to find out more about our efforts in the Gulf and make it easier for people to find key links to information on filing claims , reporting oil on the beach and signing up to volunteer , " BP spokesman Toby Odone told ABC News .
But several search engine marketing experts are questioning BP 's intentions , suggesting that controlling what the public finds when they look online for oil spill information is just another way for the company to try and rebuild the company 's suffering public image .
According to Kevin Ryan , the CEO of California - based Motivity Marketing , research shows that most people can't tell the difference between a paid result pages , like the ones BP have , and actual news pages .
" If you look at it from BP 's perspective it's a brilliant move , " Ryan said .
" The other option BP had was to just not do this and let the news interpret what 's going on .
" But they 're getting so much bad press that directing traffic to their own site is a great PR strategy , " he said .
Terms related to the spill , from " oil spill " to " gulf disaster " to " BP , " have consistently remained in the list of most - searched terms on Google since the spill began in April .
" If they 're not buying that link that goes back to their message , they 're kind of leaving the universe to kind of decide for itself , " Ryan said .
" It 's actually pretty proactive for the brand . "
BP Paid Search Engine Companies Billions to Secure First Position on Searches
On Google , paid results are awarded to the highest bidder .
Scott Slatin , an analyst who runs search engine marketing company Rivington in New York , estimates the company is paying upwards of $ 10,000 per day to maintain the various search terms .
" They paid to lock themselves into the first position against the oil spill terms , essentially putting a positive message on top of the news , " Slatin said .
But for BP , who some have estimated will spend billions on cleanup from the spill , paying for these search terms is hardly significant .
" In the grand scheme of doing damage control in a negative situation like this , keyword costs are very marginal , " Ryan said .
Still , Ryan notes that no other companies that have gone through public relations nightmares , such as BP's , have thought to do anything similar .
Toyota Used Similar Strategy for Online After Faulty Breaks Disclosure
Toyota , for example , did not buy terms related to faulty brakes earlier this year .
Instead , when users search " Toyota breaks " car dealerships pop up as well as other news results .
In addition to purchasing the search terms , BP also released a television ad earlier this week featuring CEO Tony Hayward .
In it , Hayward stares directly into the camera and explicitly apologizes for the spill , saying , " BP has taken full responsibility for cleaning up the spill in the gulf . "
" I'm deeply sorry , " Hayward says .
Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal slammed BP for its PR efforts , saying in a statement , " Instead of BP shelling out $ 50 million on an ad campaign that promises to do good work in responding to this spill , BP should just focus on actually doing a good job and spend the $ 50 million on assistance to our people , our industries and our communities that are suffering as a result of this ongoing spill . "
But BP 's PR campaign does n't seem to be slowing .
They 've hired the help of a high - profile agency , the Brunswick Group , as well as Purple Strategies , led by political consultant Steve McMahon and Republican political consultant Alex Castellanos .
Questions Arise About BP Purchasing Search Words and Phrases
Despite the criticism , Kevin Ryan , the CEO of California - based Motivity Marketing , says that BP 's fierce PR campaign is smart .
" The search terms , everything , it 's probably not a bad idea for the company to do , " he said .
" Is it right ?
Is buying these terms ethical ?
That 's another question . "
The federal government is now $ 13 trillion in the red , the Treasury Department will announce Wednesday — marking the first time the government has sunk that far into debt .
Lawmakers and staffers on Capitol Hill have been awaiting the milestone with macabre fascination for more than a week , and its arrival is likely to complicate efforts for Democrats as they try to pass several emergency spending bills this month .
The department ’s website on Wednesday showed that the outstanding public debt hit $ 13.051 trillion as of Tuesday , leaping nearly $ 60 billion since Friday , the previous day for which figures were released .
The department always posts figures a day behind and skipped Monday because it was a federal holiday .
A down - to - the - penny tally of the debt will be released by the department Wednesday afternoon .
Several unofficial debt clocks showed the debt crossing the $ 13 trillion threshold a week ago , based on imprecise estimations , prompting several lawmakers to jump the gun in lamenting its implications for the country ’s fiscal future .
At $ 13 trillion , that works out to an obligation of more than $ 42,000 for every U.S. resident .
Earlier this year , Congress and President Obama raised the country ’s debt limit to $ 14.3 trillion , hoping it would to give the government enough room to spend through the end of this year .
The single biggest day for debt came on June 30 , 2009 , when the government added $ 186.9 billion in obligations .
The last days in fiscal quarters often see major debt increases .
Total public debt includes two pots of money .
One is normal government debt held in the hands of consumers , such as Treasury bills and bonds , while the other is intragovernmental holdings , or money that one part of the government borrows from another agency .
That includes money borrowed from the Social Security trust funds .

Geithner : Economic Crisis Caused By People " Living Beyond Their Means "
" And a lot of that is simply because again -- you know , this is a crisis in part because -- caused by the fact people were living beyond their means for a long period of time .
And so inevitably we were going to go through a very difficult transition as people save more , reduce their debt burdens , " Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner told Charlie Rose .
Greens Leader Bob Brown says he has written to Prime Minister Julia Gillard offering a solution to the impasse on the emissions trading scheme .
Senator Brown says if Labor is re-elected the Greens would help the Government pass a carbon tax through the Senate within three months of polling day .
Senator Brown says the Greens deal would hold off on setting targets for emissions cuts until there is a global agreement on climate change , but would place a $ 23 per tonne price on carbon .
Senator Brown says the plan is similar to the idea put forward by the Government 's former top adviser on climate change , Professor Ross Garnaut .
" But it does n't bring in , at the outset , a carbon trading scheme , " he said .
" It leaves that option open and it therefore does n't become prescriptive about targets , which have been a stumbling block in the past . "
Senator Brown says Ms Gillard should not wait to take action on climate change .
" She cited getting a carbon price in her first speech on Thursday as one of her priorities , and she knows , like all of us do , that quick action on climate change is wanted , " he said .
Ms Gillard says she agrees there needs to be a price on carbon , but says there needs to be a " deep and lasting community consensus " to do it .
She has said she will work to get a price on carbon .
" I believe in climate change .
I believe it 's caused by human activity and I believe we have an obligation to act , " she said .
Senator Brown says Ms Gillard could make a positive stand against climate change .
" I think Kevin Rudd with Penny Wong just simply failed to get together with the Greens and make the success that we could have had last year , " he said .
" They were not motivated to do so , the signs were clear all the way through that they did n't see the Greens as good options , they preferred to go to the Coalition . "

The last thread had a lot of outdated info in the op so here 's the new one .
This thread will give you the necessary information to install , mod , optimize and NOT gently caress UP your Oblivion game .
I 'll note which steps are essential , if you do n't want to get too deep into all this , general troubleshooting , as well as mentioning the current most popular mods .
Step 1 . Installing Oblivion .
Uninstall Oblivion cleanly before re-installing .
That means deleting the installation folder , the folder in ' My Games ' with the .ini , and using CCleaner 's registry cleaning tool ( or any registry cleaner ) to get rid of any remnants of the game .
Install Oblivion , Shivering Isles , then any DLC you have .
If you 're on Vista or Windows 7 install outside the program files directory to avoid UAC issues .
Install the official patches .
If you have the GOTY edition you do n't need the Oblivion patch , just the Shivering Isles one .
Test your game .
I mean it .
Run around and play for at least a half an hour to make sure your game is n't making GBS threads itself every 5 minutes .
You do n't need any of the official DLC if you do n't want them , however it is strongly recommended you get Shivering Isles .
Not only is it a fantastic expansion in its own right , it 's required for many of the better mods .
Go ahead , get it .
It 's cheap now .
Step 2 . Mod Utilities and essentials .
Install the unofficial patches .
The Oblivion one , the Shivering Isles one , then the DLC one .
Download and install Oblivion Script Extender ( OBSE ) .
It 's required for most of the better mods .
Download and install Oblivion Mod Manager ( OBMM ) and Wyre Bash .
These will be your mod installation programs , which make installing and uninstalling mods a breeze .
Download and install Better Oblivion Sorting Software ( BOSS ) .
This takes away the headache of setting up your load order and does it as if by magic !
Step 2.5 . Using OBMM and Wyre Bash .
These two programs do primarily the same thing by allowing you to easily install mods and set your load order .
However , they both have unique features that you will want to take advantage of to create a smoother , more stable game .
If you 're fully familiar with these programs then you can use them in whatever way is most comfortable .
If not , your mod adding procedure should be as follows .
Select ' create ' at the bottom of the OBMM screen .
Select ' add archive ' and select your zipped mod .
If it 's a folder ' add folder . '
If it 's a single file just use ' add file ' .
If you 're adding a mod that has multiple .esp files ( these are your standard mod plug ins ) and your downloaded mod does n't have an OMOD conversion data file / folder then you will have to read the provided readme and delete the files you do n't need .
Many of the bigger mods especially come with alternative plug ins and textures you can use and can't run them all together .
Most mods that require this will usually come with a conversion script though .
If they do n't you can search for one on TesNexus .
These scripts , when activating the OMOD , will give you the choice as to what parts to install .
Also , this is n't an issue for most mods but make sure ( by clicking data files at the bottom ) that all your mods are going to their right folders .
The files should start with meshes\ , textures\ , sound\ etc .
If they do n't then they wo n't show up in game .
This is n't an issue if it comes with an OMOD script .
Add any information you want ( author , version etc. ) and click Create OMOD at the bottom .
This process could take a little while based on the size of your mod .
It 's normal for OBMM to become unresponsive with some of the bigger installations , just leave it and let it do it 's thing .
It is recommended to add the name of your mod and the version , for the sake of updating your mods later .
Once finished the OMOD will appear on the right with a coloured box next to it .
Select it and hit ' activate ' at the bottom .
Your plug in files ( .esp ) and any master files the mod may have ( .esm ) will appear on the left in your load order box , and all the other files will go into the appropriate folders in Oblivion 's data directory .
Tick the boxes next to the .esp and .esm files on the left to activate them .
The coloured box is only a big deal if it 's red , which denotes a major conflict with another OMOD .
It will prompt you to overwrite files from another mod when activated .
Check the readme for any incompatibility issues .
Select utilities > archive invalidation on the right .
Select BSA redirection and auto -update on exit at the bottom .
This is needed for any mods that replace texture , meshes etc. so that Oblivion will load them , as opposed to the original files .
By selecting auto - update on exit this utility will run everytime you close OBMM so you only have to do this step once .
Run BOSS .
It will automatically sort your load order when you close OBMM .
Phew !
Now we 're done .
Just do that 200 more times and you 'll be ready to play !
At this point you can finish , having only used OBMM , but if you 're planning on adding a lot of mods then you really need to do this next set of steps in Wyre Bash .
Open Wyre Bash .
Right click the column header at the top and untick ' Lock Times ' so that Wyre Bash wo n't gently caress with the load order you created in OBMM .
Go to the Oblivion \Mopy \Extras folder and copy the Bashed Patch , 0 file into your Oblivion \Data folder .
Right click the Bashed Patch ( at the bottom of your load order ) and click ' Rebuild Patch ' .
A pop-up box will appear with loads of options on the left .
Click one and any mods that are ' tagged ' with that option will appear in the box on the right .
Tick the box next to your mod , and tick the box next to the option .
Hit OK and it will load all the information into the patch .
To determine which boxes to tick use BOSS .
After some of your mods it will have recommended bash tags to use .
These tags will be automatically added to your mods , so it 's just a case of ticking the boxes .
In your Wyre Bash load order some mods may have green text , as opposed to the standard black .
By using the merge patches option under Rebuild Patch we can merge these mods into the bashed patch and deactivate them in the load order , giving us room for more mods .
Before doing this make sure the mods with green text are deactivated , and then rebuild your patch .
Once done , and your bashed patch is activated , all the mods in green will have little plus signs , instead of ticks .
These mods will automatically be deactivated in OBMM too .
You 're done .
Make sure to rebuild the patch anytime you delete a mod than was used in the bashed patch , otherwise Oblivion will close when you run it .
The Bashed Patch feature of Wyre Bash will help increase stability in your load order , as well as allow all your mods to share and mix information , as opposed to overwriting each other .
Your load order denotes the order in which Oblivion loads mods , so if two mods change the same information the one loaded last will overwrite the data from the one loaded first .
This can be an issue when dealing with things like levelled lists ( the lists that distribute items to vendors , NPCs and loot found in the game ) and cosmetic mods , as well as any mods that add new items to the Oblivion world .
Thanks to the combined brilliance of BOSS and Wyre Bash we can combine this information so that your mods do n't eat each other .
For more information about Wyre Bash and what you can do with it go here .
Step 3 . Optional Utilities .
There are other things you can do to help optimize your set - up .
TES4 Edit is a utility that can view all your mods and look for conflicts which you can change yourself .
It also allows you to edit some aspects of mods , or the original game , you do n't like .
It comes with a large manual but is easy enough to use with a little practice and reading .
TES4
Gecko is a utility that allows you to merge together the .esps of mods .
Since Oblivion has a hard cap of 255 .esp and .esm files it can load in one game this can be helpful for adding more mods .
Many things can't be merged without issue though , so read up first .
Finally Python File Format Interface ( PYFFI ) is a new craze that allows you to optimize .nif files ( meshes ) to increase stability and even boost frame rates .
I 'm not entirely sure how it does it ( some kind of defragger that gets rid of unnecessary data ) but it 's very popular .
I wo n't bother writing up tutorials for these unless they 're highly demanded .
Certainly none of them are needed for a working , stable game .
Oh yeah , here are some mods too .
To make your game better and such .

One other point worth making on the Kentucky Senate race .
Kentucky remains very red , but the recent polling on a hypothetical match - up between Paul and Conway surprisingly shows Conway very much in this race .
The current TPM Poll Average gives Paul a 44.7 to 38.4 lead , but the two most recent polls , taken this month , give Paul only a 1 - point lead and 3 - point lead :
Hypothetical match - ups are tricky to poll .
Or I should say that there ’s a higher degree of volatility when you ’re asking voters to hypothesize .
So it ’ll be very interesting to see the new polling done after last night ’s results now that it ’s no longer a hypothetical match - up .
After three years of beta testing , Ragnarok Online II is being rebuilt from the ground up .
Gamers are used to hearing about games being delayed so that developers can put an extra layer of polish on things , but you do n't often hear about such a hold up because the polish is actually a complete revamping of the entire title .
Word 's come in that Gravity Interactive , the group behind hit MMOG Ragnarok Online , is scrapping the current version of Ragnarok Online II and is radically changing the project 's direction .
Originally titled Ragnarok Online II : The Gate of the World , the game now bears the new subtitle Legend of the Second .
This new version of the game will not only feature 3D graphics , but grown - up character designs , new races and a different leveling system than was used in the original MMOG .
Ragnarok Online II has been in development for quite some time , over three years at this point .
The game 's actually been in beta testing since May 2007 , so it 's especially surprising to hear about a development like this so late in the game .
The new version is expected to launch in a closed beta in Asia towards the end of August .
At the same time , it 's also a bit encouraging to see a company do something so drastic in order to provide a better game experience .
There 's a certain amount of irony to a game called Ragnarok being destroyed and then resurrected .
Perhaps it should be renamed Höðr or Baldrfor following this development .

Päivi Räsäsen mukaan kokoomus sinetöi päätöksellään irtautumisen vanhasta " koti , uskonto , isänmaa " - ideologiastaan .
- Varsinkin vanhemmat kokoomusäänestäjät ovat olleet sitkeässä harhaluulossa kokoomuksen arvopohjasta , kirjoittaa Räsänen kannanotossaan .
Uskonnonopetuksen poistaminen peruskoulusta ja toiselta asteelta johtaisi Räsäsen mukaan arvojen häviämiseen .
Hänen mukaansa opetuksen tehtävä on tukea koulun ja kodin yhteistä arvokasvatusta .
Räsänen ottaa kantaa myös kokoomuksen tavoitteeseen muuttaa avioliittolaki sukupuolineutraaliksi .
Hänen mukaansa perhekäsityksen muuttaminen koskemaan samaa sukupuolta olevia pareja merkitsee irtautumista myös kristillisistä juurista .
" Uskonnonopetus hidastaa maahanmuuttajien kotoutumista "
Vihreiden Husein Muhammedin mukaan uskonnonopetuksen muuttaminen yhteiseksi uskontotiedoksi on pitkässä juoksussa välttämätöntä .
- Kiitän kokoomusta rohkeasta aloitteesta .
Tämän pohjalta on hyvä rakentaa yhdessä tasa - arvoisempaa Suomea , Muhammed kirjoittaa .
Muhammedin mukaan lasten jakaminen ryhmiin uskonnon perusteella ei edistä maahanmuuttajien kotoutumista .
Hän toteaa , että jo nyt varsinkin pääkaupunkiseudulla on useita uskontoja ja uskontokuntiin kuulumattomien kasvava ryhmä .

It 's time to have a serious conversation about the American approach to home ownership and mortgages .
A system once celebrated for putting so many families into their own homes and for making mortgages so widely available has become , as one housing economist puts it , " a case study in failure . "
Beyond the complexities of securitization , the merits of home ownership tax breaks and the politics of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lurk two fundamental issues .
One , the U.S. has for decades overemphasized the virtues of home ownership .
Two , many Americans are addicted to a unique , and costly , strain of mortgage — a 30 - year fixed - rate loan that can be paid off at any time without penalty .
Becasue the distance that the electrical signals have to travel is small compared to a billion light years .
The signals which are from sight are electrical , i.e charges are accelerated through your nervous system to very hight speeds but it has to travel a short distance .
If your eyers where located lets say 5000 mies from your brain it would take much much longer for you to be aware of what you are looking at at a specific instant in time .
Light is fast but if the distancee is great greater and greater the time for it to arrive would be longer and longer
I ’m a gearhead .
I like the sound a V8 or V12 makes when I mash down my right foot and those pretty butterflies open up .
But I am not unaware of the external costs of my hobbies .
Which is why I found this research piece , titled Energy Subsidies Favor Fossil Fuels Over Renewables , rather interesting .
It turns out , according to this one analysis , that the vast majority of federal energy subsidies are for fossil fuels rather than to renewables or new alternative technologies : $ 72 billion vs $ 29 billion over the same period .
( These are direct subsidies , tax breaks , etc. , and do not include things like the military budget ) .
The question I have is given how wealthy Oil and natural gas firms are , why on earth are we subsidizing them at all ?
>
>
The vast majority of subsidy dollars to fossil fuels can be attributed to just a handful of tax breaks ,
Note : Almost half of the subsidies for renewables are attributable to corn - based ethanol .

In the coming days the Gillard government will launch its new climate policy .
Andrew Macintosh revisits some history on recent climate - related programs .
In the coming days , the Gillard government will launch its new climate policy .
With the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme ( CPRS ) shelved until at least 2013 , it is expected that a core piece of the short - term strategy will be additional money for research , development and demonstration ( RD&D ) .
Given this , it is worth revisiting some history on recent climate - related RD&D programs .
The two pillars of the Howard government ’s climate policy were the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program ( GGAP ) and the Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund ( LETDF ) .
Both programs were simple in structure : polluters were offered government grants to adopt or trial alternative technologies that lowered emissions .
From a theoretical perspective , these types of programs are an inefficient and inequitable way of reducing emissions .
Their popularity stems from the fact that they come at a low political cost — polluters seldom object to voluntary programs that involve the provision of subsidies .
At a practical level , where these programs come unstuck is that governments typically lack the expertise and information to effectively identify promising new technologies .
The program funding also has a tendency not to materialise .
Governments get kudos from announcing the spending then move onto other priorities .
Environment groups and others fail to follow - up on the programs , so the government then re-announces the spending under another banner ( and the cycle starts all over again ) .
Consistent with expectations , GGAP and LETDF suffered from chronic under-spending and under- performance .
GGAP was supposed to provide $ 400 million over the financial years 2000 / 01-03/04 to support projects that would generate substantial emissions reductions or sink enhancements .
In 2002 , several years into the program , the Australian government estimated that it would cut emissions by 11 MtCO2 - e/ yr by 2010 .
By the time GGAP was shut down , estimated abatement had fallen to 1 MtCO2 - e/ yr by 2020 .
The failure of GGAP was due to poor program design , substandard project selection and underspending .
At the end of the 2003 / 04 financial year , only $ 59 million of the promised $ 400 million had been spent .
Over the decade from 2000 /01-09/10 , total spending under GGAP in nominal terms was a mere $ 115 million .
The LETDF confronted similar problems .
It initially comprised $ 523 million over 16 years to accelerate the demonstration and commercialisation of new technologies .
$ 181 million of this funding was supposed to be spent in the program ’s first five years , from 2004/05-08/09 .
At the end of 2008 / 09 , total spending under the LETDF was $ 58 million , $ 123 million short of the program target .

The Rudd government ’s RD&D programs have fared no better than those of the Howard government .
Of the four main RD&D programs announced in the Rudd government ’s first Budget in May 2008 — the Renewable Energy Fund , Energy Innovation Fund , National Clean Coal Fund and Green Car Innovation Fund — three were dismantled or rebadged within 12 months .
The Renewable Energy Fund and Energy Innovation Fund were terminated and rolled into the Clean Energy Initiative in 2009 .
Likewise , the National Clean Coal Fund was transformed into the National Low Emissions Coal Initiative .
In the 2009 /10 Budget , the government announced it was creating Renewables Australia “ with an investment of $ 465 million … [ to ] bring renewable technologies to market at acceptable cost ” .
Within months , this had been renamed the Australian Centre for Renewable Energy , which would sit along side the Australian Solar Institute and Solar Flagships Program .
Continuing the trend from the Howard era , underspending has been a problem .
$ 41 million was allocated to the Energy Innovation Fund in the 2008/09 financial year but total spending under the program was only $ 6 million .
$ 144 million was allocated to the Solar Flagships Program in 2009 / 10 yet actual spending was $ 20 million .
The Budget allocation for the Australian Solar Institute in 2009 / 10 was $ 50 million , the bulk of which was supposed to be distributed as grants to solar projects .
However , the grants allocated by the organisation in 2009 / 10 totalled $ 10 million .
Generally , the coal RD&D programs have fared better than their renewable cousins .
Other than the National Clean Coal Fund — where spending was almost 30 % below budget in 2008/09 — expenditure under the main coal programs ( Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships Program , Carbon Capture and Storage Institute and National Low Emissions Coal Initiative ) has so far came in on or near budget .
The existence of the Renewable Energy Target means that most of the Rudd government ’s renewable energy RD&D programs will not reduce emissions — they merely change what technologies are used to meet the target .
However , the real object of most of the RD&D programs is not to reduce emissions in the short - to - medium - term ; it is to promote innovation and reduce the cost of alternative low - emission energy sources .
On this front , it is too early to cast final judgement on the outcomes .
Yet the patterns of expenditure and constant program changes raise doubts about their capacity to promote genuine innovation .
Moreover , in many cases , the programs have placed undue emphasis on reasonably mature technologies , thereby running the risk of creating distortions in the energy market and drawing resources away from truly emerging technologies and base - level research where there is a greater need for government investment .
Research Desk responds :
Is unemployment insurance stimulative ?
By Dylan Matthews
Patrick_M wants to know whether fellow commenter Kevin_Willis is right in stating :
" ... there is no evidence that indefinite extension of unemployment benefits has much of an economically stimulative effect , that I know of . "
I actually touched on this a couple of weeks ago , when I highlighted Mark Zandi of Moody 's comparison of the per - dollar impact of various stimulus policies .
Zandi used his econometric model to estimate the effect on GDP , per dollar , of different elements in the 2009 stimulus package .
Here 's his explanation of the methodology :
The first step divides the stimulus bill -- both its spending and tax cuts -- into various components .
The second step is to derive multipliers for each of these components , using historical data .
...
The multipliers are combined with the actual spending to date under the ARRA to derive the change in GDP from the stimulus bill , relative to no stimulus .
Finally , the historical relationship between GDP and employment is used to derive an estimate of the net impact of the stimulus on jobs .
With that process , Zandi estimated that each dollar spent on extending unemployment benefits generated $ 1.61 in economic growth .
Extending benefits had the third - greatest bang - for - the - buck of any component in the stimulus package , after increasing food stamps and subsidizing work - sharing , both temporary measures .
To quote Zandi , " No form of the fiscal stimulus has proved more effective during the past two years than emergency UI benefits . "
The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities looked at the impact on poverty of the extension and found that it saved a total of 800,000 people from falling below the poverty line .
So far , then , unemployment benefits have been very effective at stimulating the economy and reducing economic misery among affected families .
That said , there 's a second part to Kevin Willis 's question .
He asks not just about the extension of unemployment benefits , but the indefinite extension .
This is harder to judge , but let 's look at one counterargument raised by opponents of extending benefits .
It is sometimes said that extending benefits for too long causes workers to become less motivated to look for jobs , which keeps the unemployment rate high and hurts the economic recovery .
A paper from economists Rob Valletta and Katherine Kuang at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco suggests this effect is likely quite small .
To show this , they graphed average unemployment duration among both those who have lost their jobs ( who are eligible for unemployment benefits ) and those who have quit or just entered the job market ( who are not ) .
The differential between the two , then , can be said to be caused by extending unemployment benefits :
Valletta and Kuang explain :
As of the fourth quarter of 2009 , the expected duration of unemployment had risen about 18.7 weeks for job losers and about 17.1 weeks for leavers and entrants , using the years 2006 - 2007 as a baseline .
The differential increase of 1.6 weeks for job losers is the presumed impact of extended UI benefits on unemployment duration .
... The implied increase in the unemployment rate is quite small , slightly less than 0.4 percentage point , indicating that without UI extensions , the measured unemployment rate would have been 9.6 % in December 2009 rather than the observed 10.0 % .
Using the most recent estimate of the size of the labor force , a 0.4 oercent increase in the unemployment rate represents 614,964 people .
This is not a trivial number , but losing the stimulative effect of unemployment benefits would increase the unemployment rate as well , likely canceling out this effect .
This is not to mention the obvious point that 18.6 weeks of unemployment with benefits to help is a far better situation for families that 17.1 weeks with no assistance .
Extending benefits , then , appears to be the economically smart thing to do even given this objection .
A group called Public Safety First warns that " the pre-tax price of marijuana could substantially decline " and " consumption of marijuana would increase " if Californians vote to legalize the drug in November .
Well , yes , that 's sort of the idea .
Proposition 19 , a California ballot initiative that would legalize cultivation and possession of cannabis for personal use while authorizing local governments to allow commercial production and sale , would move marijuana into a legal , regulated market , transforming criminals into consumers .
Lower prices and increased use mean greater consumer satisfaction , something that should be welcomed rather than feared .
But Public Safety First , which is running the campaign against Prop. 19 , is all about fear .
Its website features photos of a doctor , a teacher , a judge , and a cop with joints dangling ridiculously from their mouths , suggesting prohibition is the only thing that prevents people from getting stoned at work .
It says " bus drivers , forklift operators , hospital technicians , crossing guards who might be stoned could be coming to your community . "
Yes , these people might be stoned , but that is true whether or not Prop. 19 passes .
And even if marijuana disappeared tomorrow , all of these people could come to work drunk .
Yet Public Safety
First is not campaigning for a return to alcohol prohibition , because it understands that workplace intoxication can be addressed through less sweeping measures that do not penalize responsible consumers for the sins of a reckless minority .
If we remove the terror - tinted lenses of Prop. 19's opponents , we start to see the benefits of treating marijuana more like alcohol .
A recent RAND Corporation study estimates that the retail price of legal marijuana would be less than one - fifth the black - market price .
Based on numbers in the RAND report , that translates into annual savings of $ 5 billion or so for current consumers — money that would be available for other uses .
Some of those savings would be sucked up by sales and excise taxes on newly legal marijuana .
The California Legislative Analyst's
Office recently projected that " state and local governments could eventually collect hundreds of millions of dollars annually in additional revenues " as a result of Prop. 19 .
Lower prices , greater convenience , and the elimination of legal risk can be expected to boost marijuana consumption .
RAND considers it plausible that the number of current users would double , to about 4 million , or 14 percent of California 's adult population .
These new users also would receive a big consumer benefit , enjoying a wide variety of cannabis products that are worth as much to them as they are willing to pay — on the order of $ 1 billion a year .
Continuing to look at this from a consumer 's perspective , we need to consider not just the law enforcement money saved by the state of California ( around $ 300 million a year , according to RAND ) but the arrest - related costs that pot smokers no longer have to bear .
About 75,000 people are arrested on marijuana charges in California each year , the vast majority for simple possession .
While they typically do not spend much time behind bars , they face legal expenses and the lifelong handicap of a criminal record , costs that may dwarf the money spent on enforcement .
Those costs fall disproportionately on black people .
A recent study by Queens College sociologist Harry Levine found that blacks in California 's 25 largest counties are two to four times as likely as whites to be busted for marijuana possession , even though survey data indicate they are no more likely to smoke pot .
The California NAACP cited these racially skewed numbers when it endorsed Prop. 19 .
Public Safety First , of course , does not care what happens to pot smokers , whom it depicts as public menaces .
But since research indicates that marijuana does not impair driving ability nearly as much as alcohol does , more pot smoking , if accompanied by less drinking , could actually improve public safety .
The legal availability of a less dangerous intoxicant would benefit the general public as well as consumers .

Physicists have long known that neutrinos are among the lightest and most evasive fundamental particles .
Now a survey of the galaxies is helping to narrow down the neutrino mass even further .
It seems that neutrinos are at best half as massive as previously estimated , according to an analysis appearing today in the journal Physical Review Letters .
The lower neutrino mass estimate is the result of a 3 - dimensional survey of more than 700,000 galaxies called MegaZ DR7 .
Although neutrinos are very light and interact with matter very rarely , they are so numerous that they can have a significant effect on the evolution of the material distribution in the universe .
The galactic distributions revealed in the MegaZ map appear consistent with a reduced upper limit of neutrino mass estimates .
There are restrictions on the information the map can provide , in part because there are three varieties of neutrinos ( electron , muon , and tau neutrinos ) , each of which likely have different masses .
As a result , MegaZ can only estimate the sum of the three neutrino masses .
The galactic distribution suggests that the combined mass the three neutrino varieties is less than 0.28 electron volts .
Although the survey does n't offer a lower limit of neutrino masses , it 's clear from the detection of neutrinos coming from our sun , as well as from laboratory experiments , that neutrinos have at least some mass .

A Viewpoint article by Julien Lesgourgues of CERN provides an overview of the neutrino mass estimates in the current edition of APS Physics ( physics.aps.org )

The family of a Wharton firefighter who died battling a massive egg farm blaze is fighting to keep his widow from receiving death benefits , arguing that the 37 - year - old had found out his bride of two years was born a man .
Thomas Araguz III separated from his wife after learning her history two months prior to being trapped in the fatal July 3 fire , according to attorney Chad Ellis , who is representing Araguz 's parents in the lawsuit .
" He was distraught .
It was extremely difficult and embarrassing for Tommy , " said Ellis , who added that there is no will for the estate , which will be substantial since the fire captain died in the line of duty .
Thomas Araguz learned during a custody dispute with his ex-wife last spring that 35 - year - old Nikki Araguz , whom he married in August 2008 , was allegedly born as Justin Graham Purdue .
Ellis said he was unsure when Nikki Araguz may have undergone a sex - change operation , but the lawsuit claims she changed her name in the mid-1990s to Nikki Paige Araguz .
Nikki Araguz has been court - ordered not to remove any property from their home , withdraw funds from any account or receive any death benefits , as part of the lawsuit filed last week in state district court by the firefighter 's mother , Simona Longoria .
Among the issues :
Who will be the administrator of the estate and whether Nikki Araguz was Thomas Araguz ' lawful wife .
The family wants all the death benefits to go to the two young sons that Araguz had with ex-wife Heather Delgado .
The lawsuit , slated for Friday in Wharton County District Court , leans on 1999 state case law prohibiting same - sex marriage and maintaining a person 's gender forever remains the same as it was at birth , Ellis said .
" We are not blazing new legal ground here , " Ellis said .
Nikki Araguz declined Sunday to discuss her gender history , and insisted that her husband knew everything about her personal life when they married in August 2008 .
She also said the couple was not separated .
" We had a completely honest marriage , a 100 percent loving , honest marriage , " she said .
" I am grieving the loss of my husband and best friend . "
She also would not discuss her birth name or whether she was connected to the criminal history of Justin Graham Purdue , which includes at least three theft convictions .
Nikki Araguz , a native of northwest Houston , ran an unsuccessful bid for Wharton mayor against a volunteer firefighter this past spring , drawing 30 percent of the vote .
She closed her magazine , Wharton County Living , immediately following her husband 's death .
Another issue at play :
Only a spouse may file a wrongful death suit , Ellis said .
The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives and the state fire marshal have said the fire — which required 150 firefighters from 31 departments — was caused by a light fixture .

A 60 - year - old man has completed a five - year car - free pub crawl after visiting every establishment listed in the Good Beer Guide .
Real ale fan Stuart Ashby of Shoreham , West Sussex , drank a pint in each of the 700 pubs named in the 1990 edition of the book , finishing at The Lamb in Yapton , the Daily Mail reports .
Ashby said : " When there is no public transport I hitch - hike .
I do n't think anything of it .
Enough people stop to get me from A to B and people are interested when they find out where I am going .
" I do a lot of walking , which stops me putting on more weight than I would otherwise .
If it needs doing then I 'll travel as far as I have to by whatever means to make it to a pub on the guide . "
He added : ' I 've had some wonderful times and some scary times .
I once travelled to a pub in South Bermondsey and the place was shut at 5 pm so I banged on the door for a bit only to be greeted by a very angry man and his shotgun .
" I left that one pretty quickly .
I did go back later , very discreetly , because I had to have a pint from there so I could cross it off my list . "
The most remote pub on his journey was an establishment off the coast of Devon on Lundy Island , requiring a four - hour ferry trip .

Microsoft 's creaking Internet Explorer 6 is more secure and popular than either Google 's Chrome or Opera US banking giant Chase has determined .
The bank 's therefore decided its online baking services will continue to support aging the IE 6 but drop support for Chrome and Opera .
IE 6 is nine years old and even Microsoft is now desperately speaking out against the browser , to get individuals and businesses to move on to IE 8 .
Micosoft 's Australian business unit recently equated using IE 6 to being as risky as drinking - or maybe , eating - a carton of nine - year - old milk as it lacked up - to - date cross - site scripting and anti-malware protection among other defenses .
Chase has said it will support later versions of Microsoft 's browser , such as IE 8 , that does offer greater protection .
Also making the cut are Mozilla 's Firefox 2.0 and higher and version 3.0 and higher of Apple 's Safari on the Mac - but not the PC .
The bank has " strongly recommended " people using Chrome or Opera upgrade to a version of IE , Firefox or Safari it supports .
The bank 's site cited security and popularity as behind its reason to dump Chrome - which has been growing fastest of all browser - and Opera .
Chase said in a story pick up here : " There are dozens of browsers in use today , but not all offer the minimum levels of security that we require while others may not perform well with our site .
The security of your accounts and private information is one of our highest priorities and some browsers , especially older versions , are simply higher security risks to use with our site . "
If a new browser grows in popularity , Chase will assess and test its security and performance to determine whether the bank should support its use .
Claiming one browser is more secure than another is a difficult task , as all are targets .
IE is probably the most widely attacked , followed by Firefox .
Interestingly , IE , Firefox and Safari were all felled during the annual Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest , and only Chrome was left unhacked .
Google 's browser has a very sophisticated sandbox design that makes it extremely hard to attack .
One possible factor behind the decision by Chase , the retail banking arm of JP Morgan Chase , is that it's in the middle of digesting the IT operations of Washington Mutual - the failed bank acquired in 2008 when the economy was heading south .
Chase could be looking for ways to curb its IT costs by focusing on just a handful of browsers on the app - development front .
JP Morgan Chase has already seen its customer satisfaction rating drop since the Washington Mutual deal and this wo n't help .
The decision blocks users accessing their accounts at their convenience on PCs using the Opera Desktop browser and mobile devices including the iPhone - now a quarter of US smartphones - using Opera Mini , in addition to blocking the fast growing segment of Chrome adopters .
Opera called the situation " disappointing " , while Google has not commented . ®

Ron Paul says he has n’t decided if he ’ll challenge President Obama for re-election in 2012 , but he does predict that Republicans will be more open than they were in 2008 to nominating a libertarian - minded candidate .
“ I think there ’s no doubt about it , ” Paul said in an interview with The Daily Caller .
This year , libertarian - Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate — like Paul ’s son Rand Paul in Kentucky and Sharron Angle in Nevada — have won Republican primaries with the help of the Tea Party support .
Noting the “ big libertarian influence in the Tea Party movement , ” Paul says libertarian beliefs are making their way into the lexicon of traditional Republicans .
“ I think even the issue of the Federal Reserve — that issue is almost mainstream , ” he said .
“ And I think things have shifted because of the financial crisis as well as the bogging down of our foreign policy .
So the American people are looking for some different answers . ”
Paul , whose anti-Iraq war views won him jeers at some Republican events in 2008 , says a libertarian - minded GOP candidate will be better received when Obama runs for re-election .
But he cautioned that he himself has not decided to run .
“ It ’s too early for me to talk much about that because I have n’t made a decision .
I have n’t ruled it out , but I ’m not on the verge of making a decision anytime soon , ” Paul said .
Asked to name other potential presidential candidates he could support , Paul replied , “ I guess the best one would be Johnson from New Mexico — Gary Johnson . ”
Johnson , an ultra- marathon runner who was governor from 1995 to 2003 and endorsed Paul in 2008 , is beloved by libertarians for his many vetoes and privatizations while in office , and for championing school choice and drug decriminalization .
David Boaz , the executive vice president of the libertarian Cato Institute , said that while he thinks the 2010 elections will sweep in some more libertarian - minded Republicans in Congress and the governor ’s mansions , he ’s less optimistic about such a candidate being nominated by Republicans in 2012 .
“ You ca n’t nominate just anybody , you have to nominate somebody , ” Boaz said .
“ And plausible libertarian - minded candidates are hard to find .
Ron Paul may make some noise , and may run , but House members do n’t get nominated for president .
Gary Johnson has a great libertarian record , but he does n’t yet have much national recognition . ”
Boaz did say that “ a governor with a good record , like Mitch Daniels or Chris Christie , might be a candidate who could attract support from conservatives , libertarians , and independents , ” if they could get around Romney .
While Paul is pro-life , some libertarians are not and hold liberal views on social issues .
Larry Sabato , professor of political science at the University of Virginia , said he ’s skeptical that someone who is not “ comprehensively conservative in both fiscal and social matters ” could be nominated as a Republican .
“ On the other hand , ” said Sabato , “ the Tea Party energy may be injecting some flexibility into the picture at the state level — at least in some states .
Taxing , spending and debt are so dominating the debate on the GOP side that less attention is being given to the candidates ’ social positions . ”
Paul argues that independents would be drawn to a libertarian - Republican candidate .
“ Not that I ’m pumping my own campaign because I do n’t have one , but I think somebody did a poll that showed that when it comes to independent voters and they put my name up against Obama ’s , I can beat him by 18 percent .
So I think the independents are much more open to fiscal responsibility and personal liberties and a different foreign policy , ” he said .
Tom Jensen , the director of Public Policy Polling , said Paul is more popular with independent voters than he is with Republican primary voters .
Jensen ’s most recent national 2012 poll of Republicans show Paul only bringing in 6 percent of the vote , behind other potential Republican candidates Mitt Romney , Mike Huckabee , Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich .
“ So if he really wants to make an imprint on the 2012 contest , it would be running as an independent rather than just going from state to state finishing fifth or sixth in Republican primaries , ” he said .
And then there ’s the media problem .
Shortly after his nomination as Republican candidate for the Senate in Kentucky , Rand Paul ’s libertarian beliefs seemed to offend many in the national media when he criticized the Civil Rights
Act for interfering with private businesses .
Democrats have used the episode to try to paint libertarians as extreme , or racist .
Angle , appearing to learn from Rand Paul ’s experience , has largely ignored the national press , fighting the narrative that her beliefs are extreme too .
So how can libertarians fight the media narrative that they are too far out of the mainstream ?
Turn the question back around , Paul said .
“ So I would say that ’s extreme ?
What ’s extreme about a balanced budget and smaller government and a foreign policy that makes a lot more sense than policing the world ?
So I think they are the ones who are the extremists , ” he said .
But not all media are dismissive to libertarianism , Paul noted , pointing out that judge Andrew Napolitano on Fox News “ now has a very libertarian TV show . ”
As for what it would take to get him to run in 2012 , Paul said it all depends on if the economy is still in shambles and troops are still bogged down in Afghanistan .
He said he hopes he ’s wrong , but thinks that will still be the case .
“ I suspect the economic crisis is going to get a lot worse , ” he said .
“ If it is , than the country becomes even more open to free - market alternatives .
And I think that is going to stir my interest . ”

I first heard of the Aghori while watching some special on cannibalism on the National Geographic channel .
They 're freaking weird and I just had to do a comic or two about them while the guys were in India .
They perform rituals involving some or all of the following : " meat eating , alcohol drinking , consumption of beverages and foods with opiates , hallucinogens and cannabis products as key ingredients , cannibalism , residing in cremation grounds , and Tantric sexual rituals . "
While not technically supernatural creatures , they do share some traits with George and I 'm sure he 'll fit right in with the monks .
This like a few other comics since I returned from the hiatus I took back in April is one that Bill had turned in .
He also thought the Aghori were f'd up and he wrote a two - parter about them ... we 'll see the second comic on Monday .
Web applications are susceptible to a wide range of Web app - specific security flaws .
Though Web developers are often aware of at least some of the common modes of attack , they are many and varied , and problems such as cross - site scripting continue to cause problems .
To help address this issue , Google has published a new microblogging application , Jarlsberg , that 's just chock full of bugs .
Along with Jarlsberg comes a series of exercises designed to teach people what the different flaws are , how to find them , and how to fix them .
The tutorials use both black - box techniques , where attackers treat the application as a black box with no knowledge of its source or internals , and white - box techniques , where attackers know everything about the system .
The exercises are informative and seem to be put together well .
They introduce the different kinds of flaws and show off the range of ways in which each flaw can be exploited .
With each flaw there are hints of where to look to figure out each problem , and a description of how to fix the problem .
Many of the fixes themselves have additional flaws , which the tutorial also identifies .
This reflects the unfortunate situation that many fixes that developers use are incomplete , and can themselves be circumvented .
The Jarlsberg code is offered under a Creative Commons license for use in other training exercises by computer scientists , software engineers , and developers .
This kind of training is immensely valuable , even for developers with an understanding of the issues — a lot of Web application attacks are quite nuanced , with each class of attack having multiple vectors .
In an ideal world , no one would even publish a Web application without having gone through these exercises — or training like them — first .
Busted by YouTube : Video seen by 2 m proves police officer who claimed cyclist ran into him was LYING
A former police officer faces jail after an internet video exposed his bid to prosecute a cycling protester for running into him as a lie .
Patrick Pogan claimed activist Christopher Long steered into him and knocked him down during a demonstration in New York .
But a YouTube video seen by two million people so far has exposed him as a liar .
[ caption ]
The video shows Pogan walking over to the cyclist and shoving him to the ground instead .
Mr Long was acquitted of assault charges and received a £ 40,000 payout from the city ’s police .
Now Pogan , who was a recent recruit at the time of the protest two years ago , has been forced to quit his job in disgrace and has been convicted of lying .
The 24 - year - old faces four years in jail when he is sentenced later today , although it is likely that he will be handed probation instead .
The case has highlighted the growing role of witness videos in law enforcement , and it spotlighted a history of conflict between the New York Police Department and a group of pro-cycling demonstrators .
Back in July 2008 , Pogan had been assigned to keep order and watch out for traffic violations as a bike protest called Critical Mass passed through Times Square .
Participants and police already had a rocky relationship after more than 260 cyclists were arrested during a similar event before the Republican National Convention in 2004 .
Pogan said he told Mr Long to stop to get ticketed for such infractions as taking his hands off his handlebars .
But the cyclist kept going , and he testified he never heard any instruction to stop .
Pogan initially reported that Mr Long steered into him and knocked him down .
But a tourist 's video showed the officer striding over to the cyclist and shoving him off his bike .
The video has now been watched by more than 2 million YouTube viewers .
Pogan testified that he was trying to protect himself and never meant to misrepresent what happened .
Mr Long , who was n't seriously hurt , was charged with attempted assault and other offences .
The charges were later dropped , and the city paid the real victim $ 65,000 to settle a lawsuit he filed .
Pogan resigned last year from the police force .
Defence lawyer Stuart London declined to say whether Pogan , whose father is a retired NYPD detective , planned to speak at his sentencing .
Now watch the video that caught the liar out ...
As any churchgoer who tuned in to watch the recent NBA finals contest between the Lakers and Celtics already knows , the term redemption is probably now heard more often in NBA sports broadcasts than in homilies .
A Google search under " redemption " and " NBA " generates approximately 2 million hits — more hits than " redemption " and " Christianity . "
The term can also be found in more than 2,600 stories on ESPN.com .
What does redemption mean in the world of professional basketball and sports more broadly ?
It involves making up for — or , ...

A Proclamation
The people of Afghanistan traditionally celebrate March 21 as the start of their new year .
For the friends of the Afghan people , the date has another meaning : it is an occasion to reaffirm publicly our long - standing support of the Afghan struggle for freedom .
That struggle seized the attention of the world in December 1979 when a massive Soviet force invaded , murdered one Marxist ruler , installed another , and attempted to crush a widespread resistance movement .
Despite a 7 - year reign of terror by over 115,000 Soviet troops , the Soviet attempt to subjugate the Afghans has failed .
The puppet Kabul regime remains weak and illegitimate .
The resistance movement has fought the Soviet army to a standstill .
And the Afghan people , whose support for the resistance is overwhelming , have continued to show an indomitable will to be free .
During the past year , the Afghan people have advanced their cause in a variety of ways .
On the political front , the resistance Alliance has grown more cohesive and more effective .
One major step in this direction occurred January 17 , when the seven Alliance leaders put forward their own comprehensive plan for a free Afghanistan .
The Alliance has also become the focal point for the distribution of social services and humanitarian resources inside the country , thereby helping to stem the outflow of refugees and laying the basis for reestablishing a free Afghanistan .
On the battlefield , the resistance has demonstrated growing strength .
Notable achievements include an increased ability to counter communist air power , the renewal of heavy military pressure on Kabul , the resurgence of resistance activity in the north , and the defeat of communist efforts to consolidate control over Kandahar and Herat , Afghanistan 's second and third largest cities .
The success of the resistance may well have prompted the Soviets to demonstrate a new interest in the political side of the conflict .
While we welcome statements that the Soviets wish to bring about a political settlement and to withdraw their troops , we shall continue to gauge their intentions by the only accurate measurement - their actions .
Thus far , Soviet proposals have lacked realism and substance .
They appear to be aimed at deceiving world opinion rather than at seeking peace and self - determination .
A cease - fire without reference to the withdrawal of Soviet troops is meaningless .
National reconciliation with a communist dominated government as its starting point and its foreordained result is a sham that the resistance , the refugees , and the people of Afghanistan will never accept .
Acts of war by the Soviet Union and its Afghan allies totally belie conciliatory intentions .
As peace talks began in Geneva last month , communist aircraft swept into Pakistani territory three times in as many days and bombed refugee camps and crowded bazaars , killing over 100 people and wounding 250 .
Around the same time , terror bombings inside Pakistan - notably a February 19 blast outside an Afghan refugee office and a nearby school - also started to increase .
These acts represent a crude attempt to dispirit the resistance and to intimidate Pakistan into abandoning its courageous and principled support of the Afghan people .
Such attempts have not worked before and will not work now .
Negotiations to bring this war to an end have been taking place in Geneva for over 5 years .
We support them .
The U.N. negotiator has announced that a timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet troops is the sole remaining obstacle to a settlement .
On this matter , we endorse Pakistan 's statements that such a timetable must be based solely on logistical criteria and be expressed in terms of months , a very few months , not years .
By presenting unrealistic timetables apparently designed to crush the resistance and achieve a military solution before the Red Army withdraws , the onus for continued fighting falls on the Soviets and their Afghan puppets .
The U.N. - sponsored talks are currently suspended .
Meanwhile , the Pakistanis have held firm on the key requisites , including Afghan self - determination .
As a result there are some faint indications that the Soviets may have begun to understand the need for a realistic political solution .
In these circumstances , it is important to maintain steadily increasing pressure on the Soviets .
It is essential that we and others continue to support Pakistan in the face of increasing cross - border attacks and sabotage attempts .
Most important , it is essential that we and others continue our support of the brave struggle by the Afghan resistance .
We must not let up until all Soviet troops depart and the Afghan people are free to determine their own future .
Nothing less will suffice .
I am proud of the strong support provided over the past 6 years by my Administration , by the Congress , and by the American people .
I am confident we shall continue to stand firm and not falter .
The Congress , by Senate Joint Resolution 63 , has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating March 21 , 1987 , as " Afghanistan Day . "
Now ,
Therefore , I , Ronald Reagan , President of the United States of America , do hereby proclaim March 21 , 1987 , as Afghanistan Day , and I urge the American people to participate in appropriate observances to reflect our support of the Afghan struggle for freedom .
In Witness Whereof , I have hereunto set my hand this 20th day of March , in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyseven , and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh .

Adventure games are filled with their fair share of sleuthing , so why do they often turn into a parody of MacGyver ?
Well , gameplay , of course .
Browsing the scenery for usable objects — whether they can be picked up or not , and whether they can be used by themselves or in conjunction with other objects — is the interactive cause - and - effect bit .
Considering how many adventure games revolve around solving mysteries , though , it ’s surprising that so few of them rely on the player ’s deductive skills .
Instead , the audience is often stuck doing all sorts of illogical things , especially on a micro level .
There ’s usually a clear goal , but getting there is a matter of figuring out the logistics , not the mystery .
Now relying on the player ’s deductive skills can be a big challenge .
It ’s not the most casual concept , it can be difficult to keep all the details of the “ big picture ” in one ’s head , and even small discrepancies between the player ’s conclusions and the designer ’s intentions can result in an impasse .
Still , it ’s not impossible .
The Ace Attorney series gets around many of these hurdles by staying extremely focused .
Whenever a new case begins , you can be pretty sure that your client is innocent and that you possess — or will eventually attain — the tools to prove it .
The protagonist ’s internal monologues are also a constant source of clues , and various other characters periodically chime in with advice .
Finally , you only have a limited number of inquiries to pursue , and choosing the right path usually boils down to picking the correct multiple - choice answer .
The games still contain traditional adventuring aspects such as examining crime scenes , but where the series really excels is the court room drama .
These segments are based on questioning witnesses , thoroughly investigating evidence , and interacting with the judge and the prosecution .
Since the games are very tongue - in - cheek , there ’s no real preparation involved — the player is thrown into the fire and learns as he goes .
Of course the lack of prep-work and the continuous stream of new witnesses and evidence is n’t exactly realistic , but it works gameplay - wise .
It speeds up the intro to the “ good parts , ” i.e. , the court room scenes , and compartmentalizes the player ’s tasks .
Witnesses run on a loop , and , until the correct course of action is discovered , the game does n’t progress .
Distinct audible cues accompany the player ’s choices , and once the proper selection is made , a new loop is initiated ( often accompanied by new evidence ) .
It ’s an approach that does n’t require the player to become immediately familiar with all the facets of the scenario , and it serves to ease him through the various segments that compose it .
Another adventure game that attempts to explicitly tie deductive work into its gameplay is Gabriel Knight 3 : Blood of the Sacred , Blood of the Damned .
The two main characters of GK3 have access to an in - game computer named SIDNEY that keeps track of suspects , fingerprints , memos , notes and maps .
The computer can also analyze various files and documents for patterns and hidden symbols , translate languages , and plot geometric shapes onto images — two central mechanics of its renowned Le Serpent Rouge puzzle .
SIDNEY works well , but its functionality is a little scattered .
The little computer acknowledges correct deductions , but these are fairly open - ended and rely on somewhat subjective interpretations of the designer ’s script .
Overall SIDNEY is still a good mechanism for gating the game , and it helps to alleviate the MacGyver syndrome .
One more interesting title to throw into the mix is Opera Omnia .
It ’s not an adventure game , but it relies on a single interface that ’s meant to reflect the player ’s deductions .
The concept is simple : connect a series of dots to prove a given hypothesis about population fluctuations .
The dots represent cities , and the connections are emigration routes .
The diagrams these two elements compose reside on a timeline , and connections can be made or unmade anywhere along the timeline ’s path .
Since the hypothesis is always stated before a level begins ( or at least they were in the stages I played ) , the actual gameplay feels a bit like struggling with office software ; you know what you want to do , you just have to figure out how to do it .
The concept itself is sound , though , as the interactive diagrams limit the player ’s choices while constantly providing feedback on his guesses .
Once the selected connections match the indicated criteria , a report can be submitted .
This provides a clear goal and prevents the player from making incorrect deductions .
Now , how can the lessons of the above three titles be utilized ?
Well , let ’s apply them to a typical premise of an adventure game : a homicide detective story with a unique interface , a multimedia bulletin board .
The bulletin board is scrollable / zoomable and houses all the notes and evidence of a case .
It ’s a single view of all the vital information required to solve the mystery , and , more importantly , it ’s the tool that represents the player ’s deductions .
Each piece on the board is manually pinned on and can be connected to any other pieces , with the board automatically refusing illogical connections , e.g. , a firearm found at the murder scene cannot be linked to the body if a forensics report — which is already connected to the victim — indicates that the cause of death was exsanguination due to numerous lacerations .
Forcing the player to manually manipulate the board is empowering and creates a sensation of gradually building a case .
Furthermore , a single big - picture view is easy to interact with , and it can also help the player visualize scenarios that he would n’t have otherwise considered .
Since cases naturally start off with just a couple of bulletin board items , the player is eased into the mystery .
The board itself serves as a gating mechanism , requiring proper connections to be made in order to unlock new inquiries , e.g. , once the mother ’s alibi was proven to be a lie , a search and / or arrest warrant could be procured .
The actual process of identifying the culprit(s ) follows a Clue like approach , i.e. , who , where and ( with ) what , with an additional when , why and how thrown in to complete the W5H approach .
These six categories are associated with each suspect , and they fill up as evidence is amassed and properly connected to the case .
An interesting side note to this is that not all the fields need to be completely filled in order to solve a crime .
For example , if someone was videotaped committing a murder in a crowded mall , it might not be necessary to figure out their motive in order to prove them guilty .
This could open up all sorts of possibilities for not only skipping certain parts of the mystery , but maybe even coming to an incorrect conclusion ( it ’s a risky concept , but could be really interesting for the story ) .
Loose ends could also carry over from one case to another , and unexpected events such as a key witness being murdered — effectively nullifying his testimony — would add variety to the goals and the pacing of the game .
Finally , all the pieces on the board should be context sensitive and utilize a hint - dispensing system .
This could come in the form of monologues from the player character , or advice from co-workers and other characters .
The bulletin board is a game - specific solution , but its tenets are portable and can be implemented in any number of ways .
They ’re also fairly easy to follow , and should make deductive work accessible for even the most casual gamers .
Up to one in two of the staff at the Department for Culture , Media and Sport are to be made redundant as part of the cuts programme submitted to the Treasury by the culture secretary , Jeremy Hunt .
Hunt has also proposed moving out of the well - appointed departmental headquarters in Cockspur Street , just off Trafalgar Square , with the remaining staff finding room in a different , existing departmental building .
In a move which will send a chill through the arts world , Hunt , who has proposed cuts of between 35 % and 50 % of all staff , believes he will not be able to win support for the coming deep cuts in arts and media budgets unless he leads by example .
All government departments have been told by the Treasury to offer cuts of between 25 % and 40 % of total budgets .
Some departments have failed to meet the Treasury deadline or are refusing to produce 40 % cuts , saying it is not realistic to do so , and therefore a waste of time .
Ministers who settle early with the Treasury have been told they can then sit on the star chamber set up to arbitrate on departments that refuse to settle until September or October .
The DCMS , even now still referred to in some circles as the " Ministry of fun " , has one of the smallest of Whitehall budgets at £ 2.1bn , compared to , for example , the defence budget of more than £ 36bn .
It also has one of the smallest workforces – 590 of the 468,700 civil servants employed by central government .
Arts organisations are bracing themselves for a torrid time because Hunt wants to keep publicly - subsidised free entry to national museums , on the basis that it improves tourism and the wider creative economy .
An initial trawl has also found little suggestion of waste or mismanagement in the preparation for the Olympics in 2012 .
This effectively leaves arts , media and heritage .
The DCMS has already asked the biggest arts organisations to provide models of how they would implement cuts of 25 - 30 % over four years , and what the effects would be .
Arts Council England , which receives £ 445 m to give out to 850 organisations around the country , has warned that it would have to stop funding for at least 200 organisations .
Arts Council England 's chief executive , Alan Davey , this month wrote to all its regularly funded organisations outlining the bleakness of the climate and asking them to at least be prepared by modelling for a 10 % reduction in funding for the next financial year .
But while arts leaders realise they cannot be immune to cuts , they are not prepared to go down without a fight .
Last week , aware that Hunt was seeking an early DCMS settlement , the leaders of some of the UK 's biggest arts organisations – such as the Tate , National Theatre and RSC – gathered in London where they warned that 25 % cuts would irreparably damage the arts .
They argue that only tiny amounts are spent on the arts in any event – just 0.07 % of the public purse – and for every pound invested at least £ 2 comes back into UK coffers .
The RSC's Vicky Heywood warned that drastic cuts would mean fewer productions , less travelling and higher ticket prices .
The government is hoping to plug funding cuts by encouraging more private philanthropy but it is a route fraught with problems , not least the danger of safer , more conservative programming .
Some of the UK's most generous private donors , including Sir John Riblat and Anthony D'Offay , have also written to ministers pointing out that they give as an addition to , not a substitute for , public spending .
The potential for a cuts programme to lead to the closure of a prominent theatre company is exercising minds in Whitehall .
Hunt , though , is determined that by setting an example through attacking staff and bureaucracy surplus in his own department he will be able to persuade arts groups , museums and galleries to focus on their administrative cost base rather than frontline services .
If enormous cuts are , as seems likely , announced in the October spending review , many in the arts world are lobbying for them to be phased in gradually .
The cuts that will be batted about within Whitehall will come on top of some £ 73 m of cuts already decided by the DCMS , including the cancellation of the £ 25 m
Stonehenge visitors centre ; the suspension of the £ 12 m libraries modernisation programme ; cancelling the £ 45 m contribution for a new BFI film centre ; and axing free swimming for the young and elderly .
Simplest RPG , in Python
This is a small text - based Role - Playing Game that I wrote while learning Python .
The game is the simplest RPG adventure I could think of , that maintains the essential traits of the classics .
The more I dive into Python the more I understand the work done to create a language that is easy by design .
I tried to apply some non-trivial functionalities such as :
Class inheritance ( Enemy and Player inherit from Character )
Function pointers ( Commands contains a dictionary of functions )
String manipulation ( creating output and parsing input )
I think that this game can be a clean example to understand how to apply these aspects in a Python program .
To play the game
Install Python ( installed by default in many Linux distributions , see http://www.python.org/download/ for other platforms )
Copy the following code into a file called ( for example ) rpg.py
In Linux , run “ python rpg.py ” from the command line in the directory of the rpg.py file .
In Windows , open the file with Python .
Enjoy !

You can justify this on military grounds , of course , though I wo n't ; I think collective punishment is never warranted , and sieges rarely , and certainly not in retaliation for rocket firings that killed , IIRC , one Arab , and the kidnapping of a single Israeli soldier .
And I certainly agree that Israel 's critics do not lavish enough attention on Egypt 's enforcement of the same blockade , though Egypt does let the leash slip every now and again .
But whether or not you agree with the policy , this was not particularly about keeping Hamas or other groups from getting weapons -- the " weapons cache " found aboard consisted of knives , slingshots , and wooden batons , which pose no threat to Israeli civilians even if they make it to Gaza .
This was about control .
And it backfired badly as the crack Israeli troops either opened fire on a poorly armed group of civilians , or , alternatively , moronically dropped one - by - one into a violent mob of poorly armed civilians and got their sidearms taken from them .
Either way , they did not get the overwhelming display of control that they were clearly seeking ; instead they got this graphic , which has been making the rounds in military and defense circles :
You cannot understand the Israeli - Palestinian conflict if you are determined to believe that every single thing one of the two sides does is the brilliant and imminently necessary exigency of an existential conflict , the brilliance undone only by the perfidy of a biased media that refuses to tell the true story .
People , especially large groups of them , are more complicated than that .
And both sides in this conflict are attempting to play a long game .
To my mind , at this point both of them are playing extraordinarily badly .
But that 's a blog post for a different day .
Use the Power of Subliminal Persuasion to Reshape your Body , Transform Your Mind , and Change Your Life into Anything You Desire !
Subliminals have such an irresistible influence on the human subconscious that in most countries their use in advertising messages is absolutely prohibited .
Traditionally , sub- audio messages have been concealed from the listener beneath on overmask of music or ocean waves to avoid detection .
But , numerous studies have shown that unmasked auditory messages are many times more effective , and work far more rapidly .
The MindWriter™ Series was the first to draw aside the veil of secrecy by offering a broad spectrum of subliminal audio presentations in the revolutionary new Zero - Masking™ format .
Unlike other subliminal programs , that mask their subliminal messages with ocean waves or music , you can turn up the volume of MindWriter ™ Subliminals and actually " hear " these sub-audible messages clearly .
This allows you to preview what your subconscious will be hearing and responding to .
Then , when you 're ready to use them , turn the volume down to just below audible level , and let the irresistible whispers reshape your subconscious mind in any way you desire .
Unlike conventional music - masked programs , you can listen to MindWriter™ Subliminal audio tracks anywhere - at home , at the office , in your car , boat , airplane , even while watching TV !
Best of all , there 's no need to set aside time to listen to MindWriter™ Subliminals .
It 's easy to let them work for you constantly , all day without disrupting your work or other activities , or even all night , without disturbing your sleep .
The latest version of The MindWriter Series , adds multiple tracks offering you the choice of several new variations in the subliminal presentations including the leading edge back - masked ( reverse ) format .
It ’s about time everyone in the games industry did what I tell them .
So starting today , here ’s the first of my Do And Do n’t guides .
Obey them , developers .
Live longer .
Do : let me flush the toilets and turn on the taps .
Scenery , in any game of any genre , should n’t be painted on the walls .
And so many games before have put in a nice toilet flushing noise .
Since all games do insist in including a toilet , as well they should , then all games should include the splishy sploshy noise of flushing it .
Do n’t : tell me that you ’re a game any more .
You want to capture something of Brechtian estrangement , break down that fourth wall with mallets and wrecking balls , because you think it ’s a fresh and original approach .
It ’s not .
It ’s been done a lot , and it ’s probably a sign that you ’re not confident enough in your own creation .
If you feel the urge to winkingly acknowledge to the player that they ’re playing a game , then you need to go back to work to create a more convincing world .
Do : feel free to let me quick save .
I know , I know , you ’re very proud of your checkpointing , but as it happens I do n’t really want to repeat any fight in the game seventeen times because of your difficulty spike .
And sure , you could consider it cheating , letting me blag my way through sections .
But I sort of bought your game , and arrogantly feel like I should now be able to enjoy it as I wish .
Perhaps that might be to opt out of quick save spamming .
But perhaps it will improve the experience if only you ’ll let me .
Do n’t : show me an unskippable animation when I die .
It does n’t matter how elaborate you make this , the maximum number of times I ’ll ever want to watch it is none .
And if your load times are horrible , this becomes infinitely more awful .
If you ’re only ever playing your game with God Mode on to test it , switch it off occasionally to see how the rest of us will suffer when we play .
YES !
I KNOW !
I DIED !
SHUT UP AND RELOAD !
JUST BLOODY RELOAD !
That is how the rest of us suffer when we play .
Do : let me carry more than two guns .
Just when did we all decide that we were n’t okay with that element of unrealism in gaming ?
Sure , it can be set in the retro- future on a spaceship made of time , but god forbid we holster an improbable number of weapons .
Especially if you ’ll then let me carry hundreds of bits of ammo for all the weapons anywhere .
Where am I storing those ?
In my magic trousers ?
And if so , why can’t I stick a pistol and a rocket launcher in there too ?
I want to stick a rocket launcher in my magic trousers !
Do n’t : leave diary entries by one person scattered over miles of corridors , buildings and countries .
That ’s not how a diary works .
A diary tends to be all in one place .
Most people , when journaling their lives , do n’t tend to scribble it out on the nearest scrap of paper and then leave it wherever they wrote it .
Because that would be utterly insane .
Do : feel free to hire a writer to work for your team from the start of development .
Many really are amazingly talented , and their skill with coding is extraordinary , but this does n’t always naturally lend itself toward crafting fine narrative .
It does , however , mean that we end up with characters called Dirk Bluntly , who say things like , “ This is the last time I ’m going to take any more of this ! ”
Which we do n’t want as much as people apparently believe .
Do n’t : do anything to us in a cutscene that we could easily prevent during the game proper .
It ’s extremely unlikely that the enemy is going to capture Tanker McTankerton by pointing a gun at him menacingly .
Because that ’s what everyone else did on the way there , and he blew them all up with his grenade launcher .
Which he likely would do here as well , if only you ’d flipping give us the controls back .
Do : however , let me do anything amazingly cool my character can do in a cutscene .
If the best I can do is jump the height of a brick , then that ’s what he ’s limited to in the scenes too .
If he can cartwheel up a wall , fire lasers out of his eyes , and turn into a spider , then I have to be able to do those things too .
In the game .
In real life would be good too .
Do n’t : have flying baddies in your game .
Sure , there may be examples of the odd few that have worked .
The rest have n’t .
It ’s so , so unpleasant .
Like a lovely walk in the woods ruined by the constant assault of gnats in your face .
Fun , people .
We want to have fun .
Not be constantly irritated .
Fun .

" Finding a player I really believe in .
That 's what gets me excited to this day .
I might have a little less patience these days if there 's a game I go to and there 's nobody I like .
But I still have that drive to find a good prospect , so I have no problem traveling or driving a long way to see a game .
If I find a player that I believe in , that gets me excited . "
-- Hakan Andersson
As the director of European scouting for the Detroit Red Wings , Hakan Andersson certainly racks up plenty of frequent - flyer miles .
He certainly made more than his share of flights to Russia this season in attempt to evaluate prospects sure to be in the cross hairs of NHL scouts and general managers at the NHL Entry Draft , June 25 - 26 , at Staples Center in Los Angeles .
"
It 's time consuming and it varies from year to year , but I enjoy it , " Andersson told NHL.com .
Especially when Andersson can unearth that diamond in the rough that has become commonplace for an organization that routinely has drafted in the later stages of each round .
" Finding a player I really believe in .
That 's what gets me excited to this day , " Andersson said .
" I might have a little less patience these days if there 's a game I go to and there 's nobody I like .
But I still have that drive to find a good prospect , so I have no problem traveling or driving a long way to see a game .
If I find a player that I believe in , that gets me excited .
" Believe it or not , Detroit 's 21st selection in the opening round this year is actually their highest pick since 2005 , when they plucked defenseman Jakub Kindl of the Kitchener Rangers at No. 19 .
Andersson appears to have this drafting stuff down to a science .
The native of Stockholm , Sweden , began scouting for the Wings in 1990 after being recommended to the position by Christer Rockstrom , who was leaving the Wings organization to work for the New York Rangers with Neil Smith at the time .
Over the years , his drafting acumen has been impeccable .
Andersson saw untapped potential in Tomas Holmstrom ( No. 257 in 1994 ) , Pavel Datsyuk ( No. 171 , ' 98 ) , Henrik Zetterberg ( No. 210 , ' 99 ) , Niklas Kronwall ( No. 29 , 2000 ) , Jiri Hudler ( No. 58 , ' 02 ) , Valtteri Filppula ( No. 95 , ' 02 ) , Jonathan Ericsson ( No. 291 , ' 02 ) and Johan Franzen ( No. 97 , ' 04 ) .
Talk about hitting the jackpot .
Pavel Datsyuk played in a far away place in Russia and there were n't many guys who saw him and , to be honest , the fact we drafted him in the later rounds shows that maybe I did n't even believe in him that much at the time , " Andersson admitted .
" If I would have known these players were this good , I would have pushed it and said , ' Let 's draft them higher . '
But I have to give a lot of credit to ( vice president / assistant general manager ) Jim Nill , ( director of amateur scouting ) Joe McDonnell and ( Wings GM ) Ken Holland for giving me the chance to make a pick in the late rounds .
" Andersson has no doubt done his homework on many , if not all , of the European standouts sure to mentioned throughout the opening few rounds of the Draft .
That said , projected Russian dynamos Vladimir Tarasenko Evgeny Kuznetsov and Kirill Kabanov and Sweden 's Calle Jarnkrok may very well all be on the board when the Wings are on the clock in either the first or second round .
Finland 's Mikael Granlund , the top-rated European according to NHL's Central Scouting , might be long gone by the time No. 21 rolls around , but time will tell .
While nothing will be said publicly , do n't think for a second Detroit 's scouting crew does n't have a strong belief on who'll be selected once their pick is up .
" It 's certainly not like there 's paper notes all over the place , " he said .
" I 've heard that some teams have meetings 10 - 12 hours a day prior to drafting .
But we settle things quicker than that .
I think part of that is the fact our scouting staff has been the same group for years .
The majority of us have been together for 10 years .
I find that if we 're discussing a European player , we 'll take a smaller discussion to the table with me , Vladdie ( Vladimir Havluj ) and either Jim ( Nill ) or Joe ( McDonnell ) .
The three or four of us will work that out and talk about the player .
I do know my mind is on the draft 24 hours a day when its coming up .
" Then , when Detroit is finally up , the process goes rather quickly .
" Jim Nill and Joe McDonnell make the decisions but just before our pick is coming up , they 'll say , ' Hakan , one more time now .
We 're looking at this guy .
What 's your gut feeling ? '
It 's nothing big or anything , but basically do I like him or not , " Andersson explained .
Still , there are times when an unsuspected move and pick is made , leaving scouts and GMs scratching their heads and scurrying for the next best possible choice for the organization .
Andersson vividly recalls the 2004 Draft at RBC Center in Raleigh , N.C. " Sometimes we go by a list that we put together , but I still remember the year we drafted Johan Franzen ( at No. 97 ) , " he said .
" The name higher on our list at the time was Alexander Edler .
But Vancouver made a trade when they realized we were likely going to take him and since they did n't have a third - round pick .
We knew Vancouver was interested in Alex , but we felt pretty safe since they did n't have a third - round pick .
" But then we heard the announcement that a trade was made and I said to Jim Nill , ' This is it , Vancouver is trading for a pick just before us and they 're going to take Alex . '
So we waited and Vancouver did it .
So Jim and I regrouped and said ' OK , what 's the next name ? '
That was Johan Franzen , so we took him .
" All in a day 's work for Andersson .
JOHANNESBURG 
When it comes to selecting just the right swear word to hurl at a referee , Wayne Rooney is a walking thesaurus .
In exchanges with officials , he mixes and matches with such flourish , he might be confused for Roget ’s bawdy cousin .
But if Rooney , a striker for England , lets fly a similar tirade on Saturday in his team ’s first World Cup game , against the United States in Rustenberg , it is likely to be his farewell speech .
George Carlin had his seven dirty words , and FIFA , soccer ’s international governing body , has its seven offenses .
Any one of them will get a player immediately ejected from a game .
Rooney might do well to read up on No. 6 : “ Using offensive , insulting or abusive language and / or gestures . ”
On Saturday , the job of enforcing these rules for the match between England and the United States will fall to a squad of Brazilian referees who will need to keep their ears pricked for words they might not have learned in school .
“ We have to learn what kind of words the players say , ” Altemir Hausmann , a referee ’s assistant , told Globo TV Sports in Brazil .
“ All players swear and we know we will hear a few . ”
Engineers will today begin testing a new sealing cap on BP 's gushing wellhead in the Gulf of Mexico as hopes rise of containing the oil spill during the looming hurricane season .
Work on installing the cap using robots a mile below the surface of the sea was successfully completed last night as efforts intensified to capture all the oil that has poured into the sea since the Deepwater Horizon explosion killed 11 people on 12 April .
Tests on the well 's internal pressure will take between six and 48 hours to establish whether the flow has been stopped or leaks remain elsewhere .
The developments may mark a turning point in efforts to stop the flow until more permanent measures , including the drilling of two relief wells , can be completed by the middle of next month .
BP said : " It is expected , though cannot be assured , that no oil will be released to the ocean for the duration of the test .
This will not , however , be an indication that flow from the wellbore has been permanently stopped . "
The company added that the sealing system had never before been deployed at such depths or under such conditions .
It replaces a previous cap , fitted last month , which managed to contain only about half the escaping oil .
Estimates put this as between 35,000 - 60,000 barrels a day .
It is hoped the new cap will be able to siphon the entire flow for collection on the surface .
Former US coastguard Admiral Thad Allen , who is overseeing the US government response operation , said measurements during the test would " provide valuable information about the condition of the well below the sea level and help determine whether or not it is possible to shut the well for a period of time , such as during a hurricane or bad weather , between now and when the relief wells are complete " .
He said the tests could continue for more than two days if necessary , adding that " the government will halt the test if the risks of doing further damage to the surrounding formation are significant " .
The new cap - and - seal stack is larger than the previous one and is bolted over the top of the wellhead rather than clamped loosely over it .
Allen said it was possible the new cap could be used to shut down the wellhead again temporarily " for a period of time , such as during a hurricane or bad weather " .
Doug Suttles , BP 's chief operating officer of exploration and production , suggested the cap might be used to keep the well closed for a longer stretch .
" Depending on the results , we 'll either continue to contain the flow while we wait on the relief well or potentially be able to close the flow in , " he said .
The news comes as BP revealed the cost of clearing up the environmental and economic disaster in the Gulf and on its damaged shoreline had reached $ 3,5bn ( £ 2.33bn ) and amid a growing public row over Barack Obama 's efforts to stop new drilling projects in the Gulf .
The White House has outlined a more limited ban following anger at attempts to implement a six - month moratorium .
A federal court in Louisiana struck down the proposals , ruling that they were too broad .
Yesterday , the first of two relief wells , begun on 2 May , was about 190 ft ( 58 m ) from intersecting the blown - out well 13,000 ft beneath the seabed , Suttles said .
The relief well could reach its target by the end of this month , keeping it on schedule to actually kill the leak by mid-August .
If the relief wells fail , BP could install a new permanent oil - capture system by late August or early September , Kent Wells , senior vice - president of exploration and production , told Obama 's commission investigating the spill .
The Israel Defense Forces will provide the ethics bureau of the Israeli Medical Association with all the details of secret experimental anthrax vaccine trials it carried out on over 800 soldiers since 1999 .
A committee will be established to probe whether the trials adhered to World Medical Association ethical requirements relating to human clinical trials as set out in the Helsinki Declaration .
The IMA probe will comprise specialists in infectious diseases , and members of the Israeli delegation to the Helsinki committee which devised the international standards for clinical trials on humans .
Chairman of the IMA Ethics Bureau , Professor Avinoam Reches , said on Sunday that the probe 's findings will be made public .
The Israel Medical Corps requested that the IMA investigate the experiments after Channel 2 television 's current affairs program , Uvda , revealed earlier this month that dozens of participants still suffered unexplained medical symptoms .
Following the expose , the Defense Ministry and former IDF chief medical officer issued statements saying the experiment had been carried out because Iraq was expected to use spores of the deadly anthrax bacteria to attack Israel .
Israel did not possess sufficient quantities of the vaccine to field such an attack , and was therefore compelled to produce the vaccine rather than importing it .
Years after the receiving the experimental Israeli vaccine , soldiers continued to suffer unexplained skin tumors , severe lung infections , serious migraine headaches , bronchitis and even epilepsy symptoms .
However , the IDF did not take responsibility for their ongoing treatment at civilian medical centers , and they were not allowed to discuss the experiment under any circumstances despite its likely connection to their continuing health problems .
One of the soldiers who took part in the experiment told Uvda " They said that one group would receive the American vaccine , and the other group would receive the experimental Israel vaccine . "
" They specifically explained to us that the vaccine is not dangerous and that we were not being injected with the actual virus , not even the dead virus .
Instead , they said they would inject us with the altered DNA of the virus .
They said it was very advanced , " added the soldier .
The Ethics Bureau investigation committee will hear testimonies from Israel Medical Corps staff responsible for carrying out the secret experiments , as well as from soldiers who received the vaccine .
Israeli non-profit group Physicians for Human Rights has requested the soldiers ' testimonies as well , in order to pressure the authorities to create an independent probe commission into the medical practices of the IDF and Defense Ministry .
MEDICAL professionals helped the CIA perfect legal but harsh interrogation methods for terror suspects during the George W. Bush administration , according to a new report .
So -called " enhanced " questioning methods such as waterboarding were monitored and varied by medics in order to produce maximum effect while remaining within the limits established by government lawyers , according to the report released by Physicians for Human Rights .
The report described " Waterboarding 2.0 " in which doctors apparently recommended adding saline to the water used to simulate drowning so as to reduce the risk of suspects falling into a coma induced by hyperhydration .
Health professionals allegedly also had a hand in monitoring sleep deprivation of up to 180 hours and experimentation on how to increase a subject 's " susceptibility to severe pain " .
" Any health professional who violates their ethical codes by employing their professional expertise to calibrate and study the infliction of harm disgraces the health profession and makes a mockery of the practice of medicine , " lead writer of the report Dr Scott Allen said .
The group calls on US President Barack Obama to initiate a federal investigation into the claims and prosecute those responsible .
It also asks Congress to amend legislation passed in 2006 that allows a " more permissive definition of the crime of illegal experimentation on detainees " .
" The CIA appears to have broken all accepted legal and ethical standards put in place since the Second World War to protect prisoners from being the subjects of experimentation , " said Frank Donaghue , PHR's Chief Executive Officer .
" Not only are these alleged acts gross violations of human rights law , they are a grave affront to America 's core values . "

The Vatican 's decision to declare the attempted ordination of women a " grave crime " has been fiercely condemned by women 's church groups in the UK .
Pat Brown , of the group Catholic Women 's Ordination , said she was deeply shocked and called the change to Church law " a slap in the face to women " .
She said of the Pope : " He is not doing himself any favours . "
The Vatican says ordaining women is " grave " as is sex abuse , but denied it was equating the two .
The Pope was " talking about paedophiles and talking about women wanting to be priests as a crime against the faith .
I cannot understand that language , " said Ms Brown .
The Catholic Church teaches that as Jesus Christ chose only men as his apostles , women cannot legally become priests .
But Catholic Women 's Ordination says that argument " does not ring true " as women , in particular Mary Magdalene , were among Christ 's closest followers .
When he comes to Britain , there will be people who are deeply offended Pat Brown , Catholic Women 's Ordination
Sally Barnes , of the Anglican pro-women bishops ' group Women and the Church , took the unusual step of speaking out about another denomination 's issues , to lend support to women in the Roman Catholic Church .
" We are aware that there are a large number of women not just in England but across the world who have a vocation to the priesthood .
There are equally a large number who support them - men and women , " she said .
Irish singer Sinead O'Connor caused controversy in 1999 when she became a priest at a ceremony staged by the breakaway Latin Tridentine church in Lourdes .
Pope Benedict XVI is due to visit Britain , at the invitation of the Queen , later this year .
But there are now fears the Vatican 's position on women priests may heighten tensions , as the Church continues to struggle with the scandal surrounding child abuse at the hands of Catholic clergy .
" When he comes to Britain , there will be people who are deeply offended .
I feel offended by it as a woman , " said Pat Brown .
On his four - day trip in September , the Pope will visit London , Edinburgh , Glasgow and Birmingham - in the latter he will attend a Mass to beatify Cardinal John Henry Newman .
His will be the first official state visit by a Pontiff to the UK and the first papal visit since John Paul II 's trip in 1982 .
Demonstrations are expected but Catholic Women 's Ordination - which works within the Church to encourage debate about making it more inclusive - stressed it would not be among them .
' Vulnerable people '
The new Vatican document was released on Thursday , just days after the Church of England 's General Synod voted in favour of legislation to consecrate women bishops .
The new measures are expected to be interpreted as a pointed message to Anglicans .
The BBC contacted the Church of England for a reaction , but it said it never commented on the proclamations of other churches .
In the document , the attempted ordination of a woman is listed as a " grave crime " to be handled by the Vatican 's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , just as sex abuse is .
Vatican sex crimes prosecutor Monsignor Charles Scicluna said that including the two issues in the same document was not equating them , but was done to codify the most serious canonical crimes which the Roman Catholic Church handles .
" They are grave , but on different levels , " he said on Thursday .
The Catholic Bishops ' Conference , a permanent assembly of Catholic bishops in England and Wales , said it welcomed the publication of the document .
" Among several revisions to the original text of the 2001 Motu proprio Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela , the norms clearly demonstrate the Church 's concern for the safeguarding of children and all vulnerable people , " a Bishops ' Conference spokesman said .
- video encodings still in process -
crazy footage from the LA riots , a reporter tries to confront some of the looters who obviously dont care , and then some footage of the Korean business owenrs packing heat trying to defend their livelihoods from looters .
Sometime after midnight , from an observation post at a small base in Paktya Province , American soldiers watched the battle begin .
Tracer rounds streamed into the January sky , followed by the fire trails of rocket - propelled grenades .
It was days before the new moon , and no light fell in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan but what leaked down from the stars .
Holed up in the valley below , the Afghan police fired wildly , desperately , as though trying to fight back the darkness itself .
The Americans radioed the police .
The police did n’t answer .
An artillery crew fired illumination rounds , flares attached to parachutes , trying to locate enemy positions .
None was re­vealed .
Finally , the Ameri­cans sent a convoy of soldiers speeding into the valley to support or save their allies or at least se­cure the dead .
When the soldiers ar­rived , the policemen were hang­­ing out .
“ What ’s up , dudes ? ” the police said .
“ What the fuck happened ? ” asked the soldiers .
“ We were attacked by about 50 fighters .
But everything is cool now . ”
The Americans looked around .
They saw no evidence of an attack , no bodies , no bullet holes in the walls .
Only darkness like the bottom of the sea .
After a while they returned to their base , a place called Wilderness , and sank back into their beds , puzzled and perhaps a bit envious .
Somehow the artillery fire had n’t woken me , and neither had the grind of armored trucks racing out and returning .
I learned of the action the next morning from soldiers in the chow hall .
They had been laughing .
In the base operations center I asked a sergeant about the attack .
“ It was probably the Hash Monster , ” he said .
“ The what ? ”
“ You ’ve never heard of the Hash Monster ? ”
He spit brown tobacco juice into a plastic bottle .
“ Sometimes it comes out at night .
But it ’s tricky — you can only see it when you ’re hiiiiiigh . ”
Strange stories I ’d encountered during a month and a half in Afghanistan suddenly made sense .
Stories Americans told with a wink , of police stations mysteriously exploding and battles fought by lionhearted Afghan soldiers against unseen hordes .
Of ammunition boxes emptied , red - hot gun barrels , miraculous escapes .
Of a formless , elusive enemy who left nothing behind but the soil - sweet scent of pot .
“ Does the monster come often ? ”
“ Well , now . ”
The sergeant grinned .
“ There are some things the army does n’t want me to talk about . ”
The American soldiers stationed at Combat Outpost Wilderness were nearing the end of their yearlong tour .
A few months previously , their job had changed from combat - ­oriented missions , including hunting Taliban and other anti-Afghan fighters , to training Afghan security forces .
Mostly the Americans worked with the Afghan National Army , the ANA ; occasionally they worked with the police .
It was a chaotic , dangerous , sometimes absurd task , and by the time I visited them , early this year , the Americans were generally interested in two things : going home , and not leaving a mess for the unit that would follow them .
De­parting Afghanistan would inevitably occur .
Like the movement of tides , tired units would be replaced with fresh ones .
The second part , about the mess , would be hard .
Wilderness was a ramble of shipping contain­ers and plywood shacks wedged into a small ravine in what is called the K - G Pass .
Through the pass , which follows a river named Shabak Kheylo , runs the only road connecting the city of Khost to the east , in the province of the same name , to the city of Gardez in the west , the capital of Paktya .
It is a strategically important route , and a large road - improvement project was under way in the pass when I traveled there .
In the late 1980s , the Soviet Army fought their last major battles in the K - G , trying to break a muja­hideen siege of Khost City .
The landscape had not changed since the Soviet war .
Ancient villages of mud and stone , luminous emptiness .
Old shell craters , like holes in a memory .
Some of the mujahideen who had fought the Russians now fought the Americans .
One of them was Jalaluddin Haqqani , founder of the so - called Haqqani Network , an insurgent group once heavily subsidized by the United States but now allied with the Taliban .
His home village lay only a few kilometers from Wilderness ; American soldiers regularly spoke with his relatives .
Haqqani , elderly now , remains one of the country ’s most wanted men .
Some believe he introduced the tactic of suicide bombing to Afghanistan .
In the spring of 2009 , soldiers from Wilderness built a small patrol base in a remote mountain pass even closer to Haq­qani ’s village .
Insurgents had fired dozens of mortars at Wilderness from the spot , and the Americans wanted to clear the area .
They blew up stubborn trees with plastic explosives , dug crude bunkers into the mud , and , wrapped in heavy , stinking shells of body armor , carved a road into the rock with picks and shovels .
They named the base Devoe , after a dead comrade .
Then , on a moonless night , a group of 50 or more fighters — probably Haqqani ’s — attacked the outpost and almost overran it .
Thirteen American defenders held them off .
Nearly 20 insurgents were killed in the assault .
Their forces in the K - G Pass seemed crippled by the losses , at least temporarily , and their commanders apparently realized they were outmatched by the Americans .
So they shifted focus , planting more IEDs along the roads , but also boosting attacks on the far more vulnerable Afghan army and police .
It made the Americans ’ job easier in some respects , more difficult in others , because their mission shifted as well , to training the Afghans .
In many ways it became a hated task , the Hash Monster only one of the problems .
But training was crucial to the vision U.S. leaders had chosen to pursue — an Afghanistan kept peaceful and stable by its own security forces .
On some level , the soldiers knew their success or failure would determine the nature of whatever came after the war .
On a cold , overcast morning , I joined the First Platoon , Charlie Troop , a unit of the 40th Cavalry , as it headed from Wilderness to the Devoe site .
Weeks earlier , the soldiers had torn up the base and pulled out ; commanders thought they would n’t be able to resupply it in winter , when heavy snow shut the roads .
But the snow was late , and the Americans planned to survey the site one last time before their replacements arrived .
They expected to find that the Taliban had crept in and seeded the place with small “ toe - popper ” bombs or even large mines .
“ If it is n’t booby - trapped , ” one soldier said , “ the Taliban are complete pussies . ”
We drove out into the dust of the Shabak Valley ; ice crusted like sugar in the riverbank shadows .
In the distance , blue - shawled women dragged children toward a ribbon of moving water .
The mission was also designed to train ANA soldiers .
Sergeant First Class Brent Koegler , the American platoon leader , told me the ANA would practice moving together as a unit , working on basic infantry skills .
Later they would enter a nearby village to mix with civilians , fish for bits of intelligence .
Show the Afghan face of the war effort .
Koegler expected it to be difficult — not because of toe - poppers but because the Afghans had shown little soldiering ability so far and almost no desire to interact with their own people .
The ANA was dysfunctional — tainted in part by old Soviet practices , Koegler said , which kept soldiers from acting or thinking independently .
Lower - ranking commanders often refused to do anything without exact guidelines and permission from their superiors .
Enlisted soldiers — who often receive only a few months of training — were less likely to act ; sometimes they would n’t even obey their commanders .
From the American point of view , it did n’t help that many ANA soldiers were illiterate , that they decorated their weapons with shiny beads or that some believed wearing black eyeliner helped them see in the dark .
A few days before the mission , I ’d watched Koegler and Staff Sergeant Gerry Balboni plan with Afghan soldiers , who smelled of smoke and had n’t bathed for days .
The Americans warned the Afghans that they might run into a group of Taliban fighters .
A young ANA lieutenant seemed reluctant .
He kept saying , through a translator , “ First you must check with my commander . ”
Koegler replied that it had already been done .
The lieutenant nervously scanned their faces .
He came from a well - to - do family , and his military training was thin .
Koegler and Balboni suspected his family purchased his position in the ANA .
The lieutenant repeated his demand for higher approval .
Balboni smiled tiredly .
He turned to me .
“ You see that ? ” he asked quietly .
“ He ’s terrified . ”
“ It ’s just bizarre , ” Balboni continued .
“ We ’ll plan shit out for weeks , train on it , and then it ’ll fall apart for no fucking reason .
It . Is. Amazing . ”
Koegler , finished with the ANA men , joined us .
“ Some of these guys are absolutely ridiculous , ” he said .
“ But some of them are good .
They ’re into it .
And they think this war is winnable . ”
He sighed .
“ Basically , we ’re trying to get these guys as squared away as possible so the next unit has something to work with .
I think this war ’s winnable too .
It ’ll just take , you know , more than a few minutes . ”
Balboni was not so sure .
He grinned and rocked on his heels and nodded toward the lieutenant .
The future of the Afghan military stood motionless above a map - strewn table , staring into space as though he had just received very bad news .
“ All I can say is you shoulda seen ’em when we first got ’em , ” Balboni said .
One of the greatest moments of danger I felt in Afghanistan was at a lonely Afghan outpost perched on a knob above the K - G Pass road .
The outpost resembled a rotten trailer park — a crumbling building , a few shipping containers .
A bored machine gunner in a burrow of sandbags .
Cones of canine and human excrement formed a kind of biohazard perimeter in the weeds .
The Afghan commander , who ’d been told in advance that American soldiers were coming to meet him , had not bothered to show up .
A young Afghan soldier was trying to demonstrate to a group of Americans how his rifle , an M - 16 donated by the U.S. government , would n’t fire .
The soldier swung the rifle around wildly and shook it .
Americans ducked as the muzzle floated past them .
I ducked , too .
Afghans were notorious for accidentally shooting each other and themselves , blowing off toes , worse .
An American took the soldier ’s rifle and examined it .
Dirt clogged the weapon .
“ It wo n’t shoot because you never clean it , ” he said .
The Afghan shrugged .
“ We do n’t have stuff to clean . ”
“ Of course you do n’t , ” the American said under his breath .
It was not the first time , or the last , that an Afghan pointed his rifle at me , not really meaning harm .
But for some reason the episode enraged me .
I had a strange citizen ’s epiphany , an unsettling moment of nationalism .
I suddenly saw the tax dollars , the reputation of my country , the lives of soldiers and close friends , all spinning down into this great , brown Charybdis .
As we loaded into trucks for the return to Wilderness , even the Americans ’ interpreter , an Afghan from Kabul , was fuming .
He threw his arms up .
“ They are all uneducated , ” he said .
“ They do n’t care .
Piss me off , man . ”
His name was Qais .
He was one of the better interpreters .
“ They all high on hashish , ” he said .
“ They gonna do something stupid , kill some civilian .
This is the national army , man !
My God . ”
“ They ’re high right now ? ”
“ Yeah , man !
They all . ”
He sat back and wrapped his face in a scarf .
He could smell the Hash Monster approaching .
In the early winter of 1987 , mujahideen fighters in K - G Pass sat waiting for a Russian attack .
The Afghans were calm , even confident .
The war had been going badly for the Soviets .
At the time , money and arms poured across the border from Pakistan , and foreign allies were committed to the mujahideen cause .
Inshallah , the Rus­­sians would die or depart .
But God ’s will was impossible to know , and if by His inscrutable plans the Russians were made to linger , the muja­hideen were prepared for that too .
So , as the Soviets massed for what would be their last large - scale offensive of the war , the Afghans waited in their bunkers and dugouts , quietly hidden , imagining glorious ambushes .
A Soviet plane signaled the start of the siege as it flew in and released a swarm of paratroopers .
Perhaps it was beautiful .
All those parachutes , their slow descent .
Such easy targets .
Surely the mission would fail — the mujahideen had dug in well , and they emerged to open fire .
But as the paratroops thudded to the ground , a genius worthy of the Greeks at Troy was revealed : the paratroopers were dummies , fakes .
A reconnaissance aircraft , close on the tail of the troop plane , recorded the mujahideen positions while they shot at the decoys .
Soviet jets and artillery then pounded the mountainsides for hours .
Eventually the Afghans were forced to retreat .
The dummy drop was later called a strategic “ masterstroke , ” and it drove the Soviets to a brief victory .
But their will had finally broken ; the long war had ground them down .
Within a few months , the Russians left Afghanistan , and the mujahideen , commanded by Jalaluddin Haqqani , reclaimed the mountains .
The dummies fell not far from Wilderness .
One evening I stood in the beige hills , in the straw light of January , listening to Balboni and Koegler describe it .
Large black birds floated above us .
Americans always spoke of the episode in tones of awe and amusement .
While we talked I wondered what it looked like that day to the Afghans , before the ruse was known , the bodies drifting like seed pods , absorbing bullets and shrapnel without reaction .
“ Those bastards did some pretty cool shit , ” Balboni said .
He and Koegler had come from a meeting with ANA officers .
They were tired and covered in dust .
Their uniforms , their rifles , their eyelashes .
“ The Russians , man , they did n’t care ! ” Balboni said .
“ They were like ‘ fuck it ! ’ ”
He paused , gave an approving nod .
Then he joked that there was only one difference between the Russian dummies and those he worked with every day .
“ Ours might run away , ” he said .
In Afghanistan every soldier or Marine , every civilian , possesses some small piece of the truth .
Journalists pull these pieces together into stories , but it is impossible to collect them all .
We generally believe , or hope , that others at higher levels and with grander titles have gathered more and see a larger collage of reality .
Several soldiers told me that the Afghan army was improving , that it was one of the few success stories .
I believed them ; I had even visited a shrine of their optimism .
At a large base at one end of the K - G pass , the commander of the area , Lt. Colonel Robert Campbell , had built a joint operations center where American and Afghan soldiers sat side by side at rows of elevated desks .
Information from the battle zone poured in , appearing on computer screens and a wall of display monitors .
In this room of plywood and electricity , Americans trained their Afghan counterparts in something like real time , sharing everything , working intimately .
Campbell said it was the only place of its kind in Afghanistan .
Tracking troop movements and supplies , the soldiers watched video from unmanned drones .
They prepared daily briefs for the commanding Afghan general who was already nominally in charge .
Compared to other Afghan headquarters I had seen , this was the bridge of the Starship Enterprise .
No one was even spitting on the floor .
Outside , on cool mornings , Afghan soldiers assembled smartly for classes .
Policemen flailed at jumping jacks down the road in their own training area .
The place was impressive ; it was a beginning .
But the same qualities that won praise for the command center seemed to condemn everything around it .
The war had begun in 2001 ; the American withdrawal would commence in 2011 .
If this site truly provided one of the most progressive military classrooms , what did it mean that the Americans had built only one in a decade , and just before they planned to start packing up ?
Campbell was intelligent and ambitious , but his tour was ending too .
He also told me he had been forced to confront the Afghan commanding general about corruption — a general who would remain after Campbell ’s departure .
The shrine stood alone .
In the countryside , in most of Afghanistan , there were no computers , little electricity .
Classes were what the Americans could teach when the Afghans would listen .
Out there , the Taliban or the Haqqani Network needed only small acts of violence to keep civilians afraid and uncooperative .
It was to these places that immature armed men , the rawest soldiers , were being deployed and told that the future of the nation was in their hands .
The ubiquitous 40 - and 60 - watt incandescent light bulbs are supposed to be in their last few years of existence ; a phase - out of incandescents mandated by the federal government begins next year with the 100 - watt model and works its way down to the smaller bulbs in 2014 .
Osram Sylvania
Bulb manufacturers are working on a variety of replacements , including halogens , which , like incandescents , make light by letting current flow through a filament .
Others will be replaced by compact fluorescents .
But in August , Osram Sylvania will introduce another lamp it hopes will take a share of the market , using light - emitting diodes , or LEDs .
LED lamps are already showing up in Christmas decorations , flashlights , traffic signals and the occasional street lamp .
Another marketing target is the thousands of freezer cases and refrigerator cabinets at supermarkets and convenience stores .
The ones with glass fronts keep the lights on even when the doors are closed .
Most use fluorescents , and every watt they consume becomes heat that must be removed by the cooling system .
A lower - wattage LED would mean less work for the whole system .
Some LED ’s have been produced as downlights for use in recessed ceiling fixtures .
Osram Sylvania ’s entry mimics the bulb shape of the standard incandescent , at least in its upper half ; the lower half is a series of arches meant to dissipate heat .
The device ( which the lighting industry calls a lamp , not a bulb ) uses 12 watts , 80 percent less electricity than the standard 60 - watt incandescent , and emits nearly as much light .
( Watts are a unit of power ; light is measured in lumens . )
It ’s supposed to last 25,000 hours , which is about three years of continuous use , or about 11 years if used for six hours a day .
The company has not announced the price , but LED ’s meant to replace 40 - watt bulbs are expected to be in the $ 20 range .
Rick Leaman , the chief executive of Osram Sylvania , would like some help selling them .
He said the company had surveyed its customers and determined that , two years after Congress voted for the coming phase - out , 74 percent of the public is oblivious to it .
“ We have n’t moved the needle in awareness , ’’ Mr. Leaman said .
And when lamps start to disappear from store shelves , “ there will be a big backlash , ’’ he said .
He suggested that the government should wage a publicity campaign .
Otherwise , he predicted , the reaction will be , “ Why are you taking my incandescent ? ”
An NBA executive says the Chicago Bulls have emerged as a favorite in the free agency sweepstakes for LeBron James , along with Chris Bosh , The New York Times reported on Sunday .
The executive said he had gleaned from his discussions with other league executives that James is leaning toward joining the Bulls , along with Bosh , his teammate on the United States ' gold medal - winning 2008 Olympic team .
The Times reported the executive did not want to be named because he was discussing a player who was not yet a free agent .
" I think it 's a done deal , " the executive said , according to the report .
James ' friend and business partner Maverick Carter told ESPN
The Magazine 's Chris Broussard that James will have would - be suitors visit him in his native Ohio , rather than embark upon a barnstorming tour of cities hoping to land the two - time MVP .
Free agency officially starts at 12:01 a.m. ET on Thursday .

Die U4 fuhr gar nicht mehr , bei der U3 gingen die Türen nicht auf
Auch am Donnerstag litten die Fahrgäste noch unter dem Teilausfall der U4 .
Die U - Bahnlinie fuhr schon seit Mittwochabend nicht zwischen der Station Karlsplatz und der Station Meidling .
Grund : eine beschädigte Stromschiene im Bereich der Station Längenfeldgasse .
Laut Answer Lang , Sprecher der Wiener Linien , dürfte die Hitze schuld an dem Gebrechen sein .
100.000 Passagiere und Touristen irrten gestern auf der Suche nach dem Schienenersatzverkehr umher .
Die Wiener Linien bemühten sich zwar mit Extra -Personal und Mineralwasserflaschen , den Schaden zu minimieren .
Doch der Schienenersatzverkehr funktionierte nicht problemlos .
So mussten sich Wiener und Touristen zunächst an der Bus-Station am Karlsplatz anstellen .
Um 9.40 Uhr bildete sich eine 150 - Personen - Warteschlange .
„ Ich muss beruflich nach Unter St. Veit .
Der Ausfall ist sehr ärgerlich “ , so die Wienerin Doris Z. ( 31 ) .
Die Touristen stöhnten ebenfalls : „ Unglaublich , zunächst die schlechte Beschilderung in der Station , dann noch das lange Warten auf den Bus . “
Info -Tafeln auf Englisch suchte man vergeblich .
20 Minuten später fuhr dann endlich ein Bus vor .
Dort machten die Fahrgäste angesichts der fehlenden Klimaanlage ihrem Ärger weiter Luft : „ Eine echte Sauna hier “ , beschwerte sich Peter O. aus Deutschland .
An der Endhaltestelle Meidlinger Hauptstraße stiegen die Passagiere völlig durchgeschwitzt aus dem knallvollen Bus .
Fahrgäste minutenlang in Zug der U3 eingeschlossen
Die Reparaturen zogen sich am Donnerstag bis in die Abendstunden .
Unterdessen gab es auch bei der U3 eine Störung .
Die Türen ließen sich nicht mehr öffnen , die Passagiere mussten die Notentriegelung verwenden .
I got a sweet hand painted box from my secret santa today .
The box is great , the reddit alien is painted really well !
Inside the box was an assortment of goodies including : Bacon Soap , Bacon toothpicks , Noise Putty , ' Grow - a - monkey ' kit , a magnetic ribbon for my car , and some killer foam dinosaurs .
Not only did I receive a plethora of gifts my secret santa ALSO bought me a year 's subscription to PC Gamer .
I would have loved either gift , but the subscription and this box together is really quite a amazing !
Hats off to your generosity .
This is an epic gift which will have me walking around banana faced for quite sometime :)
It was super awesome to receive a custom gift !
I will treasure this box until my dieing days , and then I will have my ashes laid to rest inside it .
Thank you Grime !
( my photo came out blurry , ill post a better one tonight )
JavaScript Syntax Highlighter
This is a JavaScript syntax highlighter experiment .
You can enter JavaScript code into the textarea ( down below ) and you will be able to view the code with syntax highlighting .
It first builds a token list then sends that to a function to output the data .
The tokeniser is designed to be as accurate as possible , for example the code ++ will be read as one operator token ( increment ) , while +- will be read as two operator tokens ( plus then minus ) .
Although this is not strictly required for a syntax highlighter , it is implemented so that I may later extend this code to allow crushing / beautifying and / or actual parsing and executing .
This level of accuracy does actually have benefits to syntax highlighting however , as tokens such as { and } can be coloured differently depending on whether they are block level indicators or object literals .
Every open source Syntax highlighter that I have tried fails on at least some valid JS .
Common pitfalls include :
Failure to recognise numbers that start with a period , eg : .01
Failure to recognise that the second period in the following is an operator , and not part of the number : 0.1.method ( ) ; // yes this is valid JS
Failure to handle multiline strings
Interpreting the following as containing a regular expression : 1/2/3 ;
Ending regular expression tokens prematurely , eg : /reg [ / ]exp / ; /[/*regexp*/]/;
Recognising some edge case ' divide ' operators as regular expression opening tags , eg : /regexp /
/ notRegexp/g ;
In this example the first line does not have a semicolon , so the first / on the next line immediately becomes a division operation , with notRegexp and g as variables .
I know of only one bug in my implementation : if an object literal is placed in the false branch of a tertiary statement then it is highlighted as a block level token ( though most other libraries do n't distinguish between these ) .
Fixed !
Christian Krebbs writes in to inform of another bug , a regular expression following a variable declaration ( without an assignment or semicolon ) is interpreted as a division .
This one is going to be particularly difficult to fix .
If you find another code sequence that fails to highlight correctly please contact me .

WASHINGTON , DC–According to a report released Tuesday by the Pentagon , Communists rank last on a list of 238 threats to national security .
" Communists may now safely be ignored , " Secretary of Defense William Cohen said .
" The Red Menace has been surpassed by militia groups , religious extremists , ecoterrorists , cybercriminals , Hollywood producers , and angry drivers . "
Other groups deemed more threatening than Communists include rap-metal bands ( #96 ) , escaped zoo animals ( #202 ) , and Belgians ( #237 ) .

Newly released e-mails from the Clinton Library paint Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan as a brash and often creative political operative .
As a lawyer and political adviser in the Clinton White House , Kagan often opined on touchy topics , including guns , race and Hillary Clinton ’s official policy role as first lady .
In a 1996 e-mail to fellow adviser Dennis Burke , now a U.S. Attorney in Arizona , Kagan suggested ways to amend RICO laws to apply to so - called gun offenses .
“ [ I ] do n’t know if amending [ RICO ] to include gun offenses would be smart or stupid as a matter of politics — or as a matter of policy — but it definitely is an option , ” Kagan wrote .
Short for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act , RICO was originally enacted in the 1970s to combat organized crime .
President Clinton ’s 1999 crime bill incorporated Kagan ’s recommendation .
A fax from March 8 , 1999 containing talking points and a description of Clinton ’s proposal claimed the legislation “ [ a ] dds a number of firearms offenses as predicates under the RICO statute . ”
“ Strongly opposed by Senate Republicans and the NRA , ” the document noted .
Kagan did n’t shy away from contentious internal matters either , going so far as to question Hillary Clinton ’s policy role as first lady .
In response to a January 13 , 1998 , e-mail requesting feedback on a speech that Hillary Clinton was scheduled to give on race at Gaucher College in Baltimore , Kagan pulled no punches .
“ I ’m generally not in favor of the FLOTUS announcing policy unless it ’s in one of her areas ( e.g. , child care ) , ” Kagan wrote .
Not even reporters were spared from the ire of Kagan and her colleagues .
Jonathan Chait , a reporter at the New Republic , requested comment from Kagan on President Clinton ’s “ new domestic policy agenda . ”
Kagan forwarded the e-mail to her then - boss Bruce Reed , now the executive director of President Obama ’s deficit commission , saying , “ [ Chait ] made it sound as if the article will be very positive ( but of course they all do , do n’t they ) . ”
“ I ’ll talk to him , ” Reed wrote back .
“ He occasionally writes for the American Prospect , so he ’s another big - spender we ’ve revived from the dead . ”
Monica Bellucci : Scary And Sexy
The beautiful Monica Bellucci has certainly had an intriguing career .
The Italian actress and model has been in romantic films ( Malena and the beautifully tragic Remember Me , My Love ) , fantasy and action flicks ( The Brothers Grimm , Shoot ‘ Em Up , two of the Matrix movies ) and controversial pictures ( Passion Of The Christ and Irreversible ) throughout her 20 - year movie career .
Now she ’s taking a turn into family fantasy with a small but significant part as Veronica , the spiritually possessed , magically imprisoned , long - lost of the sorcerer Balthazar , in the big budget Disney movie The Sorcerer ’s Apprentice , which opens nationwide tomorrow .
When I spoke with her during a Fandango set visit last year , she said she did this latest Jon Turteltaub film “ to have the chance to play good and bad and a double personality , and also to make a movie that my child can watch . ”
Mission accomplished .
Here ’s the rest of the press chat that ADD was in on .
You do a lot of films overseas and then a big Hollywood movie or two .
Do you like working that way , that you can cherry pick what you do over here ?
It ’s so strange because I never said I ’m going to go to America and live there , and stay in New York and stay in Los Angeles .
I live in Rome and Paris and sometimes London .
It ’s really incredible that once in awhile American directors think about me because I ’m not part of the system at all .
I like to work that way actually because I like my quality of life in Europe and once in awhile to be here and involved with this energy .
But that energy is so overwhelming for me .
I ’m so European and kind of lazy .
The Italian film industry is a little different .
I think it ’s smaller .
It ’s so incredible because it ’s so great to have the chance to work in Italy and then go to Paris and work with French directors and come here once in a while and have the chance to be in big movies or small movies .
I did the last Rebecca Miller movie [ The Private Lives Of Pippa Lee ] , and it ’s a small movie .
It ’s great to just do things with different directors ; small parts and big parts .
What ’s it like shooting in New York with all these passersby and distractions ?
To be here you have people waiting for you outside and asking for autographs and pictures .
I prefer to work in the studio , I have to say .
It ’s more protected , so I prefer it , but it ’s going to be fine [ here ] .
You do n’t get that in Rome ?
Oh yeah , Rome is terrible .
I ’m Italian .
That ’s why I live in three places .
I ’m all over and anywhere , but this year is going to change because my baby is going to be five and have to school .
Right now she ’s in different schools .
She ’s speak different languages — Italian , French and a bit of English .
I have to decide where I am going to be for real .

Were you and your daughter fans of the original “ Sorcerer ’s Apprentice ” sequence in Fantasia ?
Yes .
I love those kind of movies .
We all love Walt Disney , of course .
For a European it ’s great to be in a movie like that .
How do you spend your down time here ?
It ’s so hard to work during the night [ on this movie ] because I am a lazy girl and love to sleep .
It ’s hard for me to shoot at night .
I ’m taking a lot of vitamin C .
It ’s not very easy , but I have to make the effort .
I ’m a sorceress , and a sorceress works during the night .
Can you tell us about working with Nicolas Cage ?
I ’m happy to work with him because I respect him as an actor , and he is a very nice person .
I respect him as a person because he is very sweet and very open .
I played a few scenes with Alfred Molina , who ’s a great actor with a great sense of humor .
I love working with Jon Turteltaub because he gives me the freedom to search for different things , a different way to act , and I like that .
At the same time , he knows what he wants .
is there anything that surprised you about Nic Cage ?
No , actually , because from the films you already have an idea [ of him ] , and there is something very human about him .
When I met him , I felt the same thing .
Nicotine patches and gum are common -- and often ineffective -- ways of fighting cigarette cravings , as most smokers have discovered .
Now a new study from Tel Aviv University shows why they 're ineffective , and may provide the basis for more successful psychologically - based smoking cessation programs .
In the new study published in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology , Dr. Reuven Dar of Tel Aviv University 's Department of Psychology found that the intensity of cravings for cigarettes had more to do with the psychosocial element of smoking than with the physiological effects of nicotine as an addictive chemical .
" These findings might not be popular with advocates of the nicotine addiction theory , because they undermine the physiological role of nicotine and emphasize mind over matter when it comes to smoking , " Dr. Dar says .
He hopes this research will help clinicians and health authorities develop more successful smoking cessation programs than those utilizing expensive nicotine patches or gum .
Up in the air
Dr. Dar and his colleagues ' conclusions are based on two landmark studies .
In the most recent study , he and his colleagues monitored the smoking behavior and craving levels of in - flight attendants , both women and men , who worked at the Israeli airline El Al .
Each participant was monitored during two flights -- a long flight of 10 to 13 hours in duration , from Tel Aviv to New York , for example ; and a two - hop shorter trip from Israel to Europe and back , each leg lasting three to five hours .
Using a questionnaire , he sampled craving levels of the attendants throughout the duration of their flights .
Dr. Dar and his colleagues found that the duration of the flight had no significant impact on craving levels , which were similar for short and long flights .
Moreover , craving levels at the end of each short flight were much higher those at the end of the long flight , demonstrating that cravings increased in anticipation of the flight landing , whatever the flight 's total duration .
He concluded that the craving effect is produced by psychological cues rather than by the physiological effects of nicotine deprivation .
No smoking on the Sabbath
In an earlier 2005 study , Dr. Dar examined smokers who were religious Jews , forbidden by their religion to smoke on the Sabbath .
He asked them about their smoking cravings on three separate days : the Sabbath , a regular weekday , and a weekday on which they 'd been asked to abstain .
Participants were interviewed at the end of each day about their craving levels during that day .
What Dr. Dar found is that cravings were very low on the morning of the Sabbath , when the smoker knew he would not be able to smoke for at least 10 hours .
Craving levels gradually increased at the end of the Sabbath , when participants anticipated the first post - Sabbath cigarette .
Craving levels on the weekday on which these people smoked as much as they wanted were just as high as on the day they abstained , showing that craving has little to do with nicotine deprivation .
Dr. Dar 's studies conclude that nicotine is not addictive as physiological addictions are usually defined .
While nicotine does have a physiological role in increasing cognitive abilities such as attention and memory , it 's not an addictive substance like heroin , which creates true systemic and biologically - based withdrawal symptoms in the body of the user , he says .
Dr. Dar believes that people who smoke do so for short - term benefits like oral gratification , sensory pleasure and social camaraderie .
Once the habit is established , people continue to smoke in response to cues and in situations that become associated with smoking .
Dr. Dar believes that understanding smoking as a habit , not an addiction , will facilitate treatment .
Smoking cessation techniques should emphasize the psychological and behavioral aspects of the habit and not the biological aspects , he suggests .

Snow Creature — Treefolk (*/*)
Trample
Abominable Treefolk 's power and toughness are each equal to the number of snow permanents you control .
When Abominable Treefolk enters the battlefield , tap target creature an opponent controls .
That creature does n't untap during its controller 's next untap step .
At a holiday cookout this past weekend , my friend asked me if I ’d like some ceviche .
I looked at the pile of fresh shrimp and responded “ I ’m actually trying to cut down on my seafood consumption . ”
Lame , I know , but the seafood that I ’m most fond of are n’t exactly the most sustainable options .
Shrimp can be problematic .
US farmed shrimp is preferable to foreign , but one still has to be careful .
According to Seafood Watch , the US actually only produces less than 1 % of the shrimp eaten by Americans ( maybe less soon considering the Gulf oil disaster ? ) .
Shrimp farms can possess the same problems as fish farms .
Wild fish is needed to feed the shrimp .
The vast majority of shrimp farms release polluted effluent into the environment .
But wild caught shrimp comes with its own problem , bycatch .
Bycatch refers to the animals caught in fishing equipment along with the intended catch .
Bycatch is thrown back overboard , dead or dying .
With shrimp , bycatch includes seahorses and sea turtles .
Ouch .
I ’ll pass on the ceviche .
But more than shrimp , I like albacore tuna .
I have yet to see canned tuna that is MSC certified .
I have no idea if my tuna is longline - caught .
Longline - caught tuna is more mature and contains more mercury than tuna caught by trolling or tuna that is pole caught .
Bycatch is also a problem with tuna , and can include sea turtles , seabirds and sharks .
That seems like a lot of carnage for my tuna salad , I have to admit .
Worse ( much worse ) than albacore though , is bluefin .
Management of bluefin fishing has proved completely ineffective worldwide .
Bycatch is again a problem and is unregulated .
The bluefin tuna industry is actually contributing to the decline of endangered animals caught along with the tuna — which is itself an endangered species .
The word “ overfished ” does n’t begin to describe bluefin ; Seafood Watch reports that the Atlantic population of bluefin has declined by nearly 90 % since the 1970s .
At present , Mitsubishi is being accused of hoarding thousands of tons of bluefin and freezing it .
When the stock crashes , as it is expected to , imagine the profits to Mitsubishi .
Until very recently , you could buy bluefin tuna - flavored Whiskas cat food .
Yes , really .
Where is the disconnect ?
Endangered animals in your pet food ?
I ’d like to echo a question posed by Greenpeace :
You would n’t eat a tiger , so why would you eat an endangered bluefin tuna ?
So I ’ve been considering a new challenge .
First there was vegan month , then cake week ( s ) ( boy , those were tough ) and now , perhaps , there should be a month without seafood .
While my month of veganism gave me a huge appreciation of how difficult it can be to not eat animal products when you like the way they taste ( yes , I have heard tell of some people who do n’t like the way meat tastes ) , it did n’t ultimately change my diet .
I try to limit my animal foods to ones that were produced humanely and sustainably , but I did that prior to giving veganism a try .
And sometimes I really want that burger , regardless of whether or not it was made with free - range beef .
A diet free of animal products just could n’t stick with me .
But a diet without seafood ?

7.9 million jobs lost - many forever
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The recession killed off 7.9 million jobs .
It 's increasingly likely that many will never come back .
The government jobs report issued Friday shows that businesses have slowed their pace of hiring to a relative trickle .

" The job losses during the Great Recession were so off the chart , that even though we 've gained about 600,000 private sector jobs back , we 've got nearly 8 million jobs to go , " said Lakshman Achuthan , managing director of Economic Cycle Research Institute .
Excluding temporary Census workers , the economy has added fewer than 100,000 jobs a month this year -- a much faster and stronger jobs recovery than occurred following the last two recessions in 2001 and 1991 .
But even if that pace of hiring were to double immediately , it would take until 2013 to recapture the lost jobs .
And the labor market very likely does n't have years before it gets hit with the shock of the inevitable next economic downturn .
" It 's virtually certain that the next recession will come before the job market has healed from the last recession , " said Achuthan .
( Read ' Stimulus : The big bang is over ' )
More frequent recessions : Despite signs of slowing economic growth , Achuthan is not predicting that the U.S. economy is about to fall into another downturn later this year .
But a combination of a slower growth and greater volatility is a prescription for as many as three recessions over the upcoming decade , he said .
" We 've entered a era where the United States will see more frequent recessions than anyone is used to , " Achuthan said .
One of the big problems is that many of workers who have lost jobs were in industries that are not likely to recover their former strength .
" We 've got the wrong people in the wrong place with the wrong skills , " said John Silvia , chief economist with Wells Fargo Securities .
He said construction workers in California or Florida and auto workers in Michigan will have to relocate and retrain to find new jobs .
" As many as half the people who lost their jobs will have to find something else to do , " said Silvia .
Home building lost nearly 1 million jobs since the start of 2008 , while the auto industry shed 300,000 manufacturing jobs due to plant closings .
The finance and real estate sectors lost more than 500,000 jobs .
" Those are the areas with the biggest bubbles , and so it 's not a surprise that those are the areas with some of the biggest job losses , " said Scot Melland , CEO of Dice Holdings , a provider of specialized career web sites .
" Many of the jobs we lost are never coming back . "
More new workers :
And recapturing the lost jobs fixes only part of the problem .
The nation 's working - age population grows by about 150,000 people a month .
So the hole is deeper than it looks .
It would take the creation of 10.6 million jobs immediately for the same percentage of the population to be working as was the case three years ago .
Of course , it will take time to create jobs .
If it takes three years , more than 3.5 million additional jobs will be needed because of continued population growth .
The unemployment rate is currently 9.5 % .
A return to the 4.4 % rate it was the summer before the recession started in 2007 is out of reach .
In fact , the Federal Reserve , in its latest forecast , predicts that unemployment will stay around 7 % or above through 2012 , and in the 5 % to 5.3 % range in the long - run .

The hangings took place on the last day of August 1941 , on the town square of Wierzbnik , in what had once been central Poland .
Two years had passed since the joint German - Soviet invasion that had destroyed the Polish state ; ten weeks before , the Germans had betrayed their ally and invaded the Soviet Union .
Wierzbnik , home to Poles and Jews , lay within the General Government , a colony that the Germans had made from parts of their Polish conquests .
As Poles left church that Sunday morning , they saw before them a gallows .
The German police had selected sixteen or seventeen Poles — men , women , and at least one child .
Then they ordered a Jewish execution crew , brought from the ghetto that morning , to carry out the hangings .
The Poles were forced to stand on stools ; then the Jews placed nooses around their necks and kicked the stools away .
The bodies were left to dangle .

Demonstrative killing of civilians was one of several German methods designed to stifle Polish resistance .
The Germans had murdered educated Poles : tens of thousands in late 1939 , thousands more in early 1940 .
Since June 1940 , the Germans had been sending suspect Poles to Auschwitz and other camps .
Polish society was to be reduced to an undifferentiated mass of passive workers .
German policy toward Jews was different , though the nature of the difference was not yet clear .
Jewish elites had been preserved ; some of them as members of the Judenrat ( Jewish council ) or as policemen directing the local affairs of Jews in a way that suited Germans .
Although fatality rates in some ghettos were high , Jews in summer 1941 had little idea that they had been gathered into ghettos in preparation for a “ Final Solution . ”
The Germans had first planned to deport the Jews to a reservation in eastern Poland , or to the island of Madagascar , or to Siberian wastelands .
As these schemes proved impracticable , the Jews remained in the ghettos .
It was in that final week of August 1941 that the German “ Final Solution ” was taking on its final form : mass murder .
Two days before the hangings at Wierzbnik , the Germans had completed their first truly large - scale murder of Jews , shooting some 23,600 people at Kamianets - Podil ’s ’kyi in occupied Soviet Ukraine .
“ I knew I hanged the right people , ” one of the Jewish hangmen in Wierzbnik recalled more than fifty years later .
He thought that those who were executed belonged to the Polish …

Over 30 people were hit by the spray .
No one was seriously injured , however , some of the victims were children .
Helsinki police officer Kari Aaltio said that the attack seemed to be meticulously planned .
“ First the perpetrators released smoke over the parade .
Then they went around the block and attacked parade participants with the spray .
At least two types of gases were used .
The perpetrators were dressed in black . ”
Police are still looking for several other perpetrators .
The suspects come from outside of Helsinki and are Finns .
Police are trying to determine if they belong to a larger group .
The men will be kept in custody until at least Tuesday .
An estimated 2,500 people took part in the parade which celebrates gay and lesbian culture .

U.S. Treasury tax breaks have helped West Bank settlers to receive $ 200 million in tax - free funding from American donors , according to a report published in the United States on Tuesday .
Differences in U.S. and Israeli law means it is easier to fund illegal outposts through donations from New York than from Jerusalem , according to an investigation by the New York Times .
Open gallery view The West Bank settlement of Ariel , with 20,000 inhabitants , is not on the list of settlement blocs Israel would never forfeit in a two - state deal .

An examination of public records in the United States and Israel pinpointed at least 40 American groups that have raised over $ 200 million in tax - deductible gifts for Jewish settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem over the past decade .
The findings could embarrass U.S. President Barack Obama , an outspoken opponent of Israel 's settlement policies who is expected to use a Tuesday meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to push for a continued freeze on Jewish building in the West Bank .
According to the Times report , lenient American tax regulations allow funds to flow to settlement outposts that are illegal under Israel law – as opposed to larger settlement blocks that receive money from the Israeli government .
The result is that it is easier to fund outposts from the United States than from Israel , which over a decade ago outlawed tax breaks for contributions to groups devoted exclusively to settlement - building in the West Bank .
U.S. tax law applies to all nonprofit groups and there are Palestinian organizations that also benefit from U.S. donations , as does the Free Gaza movement , whose controversial aid flotilla was stormed by Israeli commandos a month ago .
Nine activists were killed in the raid .
But the flow of cash to settler groups is particularly awkward for the Obama administration as it mediates renewed peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians .
Washington has refused to allow Israel to spend American government aid on settlements and some U.S. officials fear the consequences of being seen to fund them indirectly .
" Its a problem , one unnamed senior State Department official was quoted as saying , adding , Its unhelpful to the efforts that were trying to make .
Daniel Kurtzer , the U.S. ambassador to Israel from 2001 to 2005 , said the issue was an unspoken source of embarrassment for American diplomats .
It drove us crazy , Kurtzer told the Times .
But it was a thing you didnt talk about in polite company .
He added that while the private donations could not sustain the settler enterprise on their own , a couple of hundred million dollars makes a huge difference , and if carefully focused , creates a new reality on the ground .
Israeli military commanders are also angry that U.S. funds are going to extremists groups whose leaders have urged resistance to any attempt to evict them .
I am not happy about it , a senior military commander in the West Bank .
As Finland moves to make open WiFi networks legal , France is moving — decisively — in the opposite direction .
France 's " three strikes and you 're off the Internet " anti-P2P HADOPI law comes with a provision requiring people to install security software on their machines , and it makes users responsible for everything done through their Internet connections .
With fines and a government - run Internet blacklist as penalties , les Internautes have good reason to comply , but the requirement may prove to be a new cash cow for ISPs and security firms .
If , that is , they can secure their own security tools .
Download control
French journalist Astrid Girardeau brought a strange story to our attention .
French ISP
Orange last week rolled out a new security tool for subscribers to accompany its firewall , anti-virus , and anti-spam offerings : " contrôle du téléchargement . "
This " download control " offering provides " protection against illegal downloading , " mainly by interfering with any P2P apps running on the local machine .
For € 2 , the ( Windows - only ) software can be installed on three machines .
What does it do ?
How does it work ?
The details are n't clear , but a French blogger who goes by " Bluetouff " used Wireshark to sniff the program 's traffic .
The Java - based control software turned out to be anything but self - contained ; it routinely communicated with a server , sending data in the clear , and the server even hosted a publicly accessible webpage showing the IP addresses that had connected to it .
To make matters worse , this page provided a link to an administration portal ; the username / password combo was set to " admin/admin . "
According to Bluetouff , a malicious user might have been able to modify the servlet to distribute malware .
Orange appears to have resolved the problem over the weekend , but it reminds us just how many problems HADOPI could create .
With Internet access spreading to all corners of society , huge numbers of unsophisticated computer users will suddenly be responsible for securing their own Internet connections and liable for what happens over them .
When even the security vendors have wide - open insecurities , is this a reasonable approach ?
Certainly , it could become a good sideline for ISPs , who stand to make plenty of extra cash by offering anti-P2P security subscriptions to their users .
But it leaves many questions unanswered — among them , how is one to secure a visitor 's Internet use with this software - based approach ?
Will out - of - town guests and friends really have to install ( and prove they have installed ) security software before their hosts hand over the network password ?
We suspect it wo n't be long before the solutions migrate upstream .
ISPs who once found themselves in trouble for using deep packet inspection to mess with P2P traffic could soon charge users for exactly this " service " in the name of HADOPI - ordered security .
We already had the opportunity to sit down and tinker with a slew of Pixel Qi - based prototype devices here in Taipei , but one in particular managed to catch our eye in a rather surprising location .
Innoversal , a new company here in Taiwan just looking to change the world , found itself hosting a striking 10.1 - inch device that grabbed our heartstrings and would n't let go .
The highlight of the starlet was the expansive 3 Qi capacitive touchpanel , with a 1,024 x 600 resolution and the ability to save battery life by flipping the backlight off when in broad daylight .
The current build was relying on a trio of ambient light sensors to determine whether or not the backlight would be on , but we begged and pleaded for the company to implement a dedicated on / off toggle switch along the border before shipping it out .
Speaking of which , Innoversal will most likely ship the product under its own branding here in Taiwan , but it 's certainly open to selling the design to other major manufacturers who may wish to slap their own logo on there .
If all goes well , we could see it first take off this September ( globally ) , with a 16GB + 3G / WiFi model retailing for between $ 530 and $ 550 .
So , what 's that get you ?
Besides the best power - saving mobile display this world has ever seen ( seriously , the crispness and viewing angles were extraordinary ) , you 'll also get a 1.66 GHz Atom N450 processor , an integrated SSD ( 16GB , 32GB and 64GB capacities will be available ) , an SDHC card slot , 8 megapixel camera , 3.5 m m headphone jack , a SIM card slot ( for 3G data ) , USB 2.0 connectivity , 802.11b/g/n WiFi , Bluetooth 2.0+EDR and a 6 - cell ( 5,300 mAh ) battery to boot .
We were told that the device will support Windows 7 , Android , Ubuntu and Chrome OS , with the former two being on display at the show .
The working mockup that was on display was sufficiently lightweight and sturdy , and we'd be fibbing to ourselves if we said we were n't giddy about the prospect of holding a finalized unit before Old Man Winter comes to visit .
Hop on past the break for a video overview ... or else .
Captain Phil Harris died on Tuesday ’s episode of Discovery ’s “ Deadliest Catch . ”
Phil , the captain of the Bering Sea crab boat Cornelia Marie , suffered a stroke while unloading in port in February .
The cameras were rolling as his sons Jake and Josh saw him for the last time at an Anchorage hospital .
There was some sense of closure for both :
Jake left his dad proud by flying off to Seattle to enter a rehab program , and Josh kissed his father ’s head , assured him he ’d been a great dad , and promised to bring back a lucky gold chain when he returned to the hospital later in the day .
But Phil suffered another stroke after the boys left , off - camera , and died soon after .
It was a heart - wrenching episode , especially since Phil had been making so much progress in his recovery from the initial stroke .
The sight of some of the toughest guys you ’ll ever see on TV breaking down in tears was pretty much the most achingly real thing you ’ll ever see on “ reality ” TV .
The hospital scenes were uncomfortably voyeuristic at times , eavesdropping on intensely private moments , but the footage never failed to be absolutely gripping .
I thought Discovery handled the whole situation really well .
Phil wanted the cameras rolling up until the end , and they managed to capture some beautiful final moments of his life .
The episode was respectful , understated and not at all maudlin .
It seemed to hit all the right notes , and considering Discovery was sailing in uncharted waters — this was the first reality show to have one of its subjects die mid-season — the network should be applauded for its sensitive , professional treatment of a very delicate subject .
A whole lot of Kleenexes were used up around the country Tuesday night .
The episode was the third - highest - rated show in Discovery ’s 25 - year history .
So what ’d you think ?
Do you approve of how Phil ’s death was handled ?
Were you amazed to see Josh grow up almost overnight ?
And did you tune in for “ After the Catch ” ?
( That was a nice epilogue , almost like a good , boozy Irish wake . )
This season has been emotionally draining to watch , with the personal tragedies , mental meltdowns and frustrating fishing .
But it ’s also been the series ’ best .
Here ’s the final seven minutes from Tuesday :
( Visited 1 times , 1 visits today )
With baseball in full swing , we ca n’t help but veg out to some classic baseball flicks .
One of the greatest is Field of Dreams .
Although Kevin Costner is the lead , it ’s still damn good .
While many of us remember the voice in the field saying “ If you build it , he will come , ” one of the best scenes is when Archibald “ Moonlight ” Graham has the chance to finally play ball with some of the greatest players ever .
But , life does n’t always have those happy endings .
Here ’s seven athletes whose careers ended before they began .
7. Maurice Clarett
Maurice Clarett is the epitome of what not to do when switching from college to the pros .
As a running back for Ohio State , he was a pivotal part in the Buckeyes national championship against the Miami Hurricanes .
Clarett realized after his freshman year that he could have a future in the NFL .
Instead of waiting for the mandatory NFL rule that a player must be out of high school for at least three years , he challenged the rule and attempted to enter the draft .
His plan backfired and he was barred from entering the 2004 NFL draft .
After sitting out for a year , Clarett was taken by the Denver Broncos in the 2005 draft .
He was released by the Broncos on August 28 , 2005 , following a weak training camp , signing a four year contract and problems with the coaching staff .
No other team signed him after his release .
He never played a single down in the league .
And turned to crime , which landed him in the big joint .
Maybe if Clarett played another year in college he would be in the NFL today .
If you ’re ever curious as to what he ’s up to , check out his blog from the pen .
6. Jay Burson
Jay Burson scored 2,958 points while in high school from 1981 - 1985 , a record in Ohio until 2007 .
Burson stayed in state when heading off to college .
He played for Ohio State from 1986 - 1989 .
Unfortunately , his college career ended when he broke his neck during the NCAA tournament .
He made a comeback when he signed a contract with the Houston Rockets , but after only four preseason games , his NBA days were behind him .
Jay still managed to play some basketball in the Continental Basketball Association with the Columbus Horizon , but never had the chance to enjoy a career in the NBA .
He now spends his days as a motivational speaker and helping kids on and off the court .
5. Earl “ The Goat ” Manigault
Kareem Abdul - Jabbar called Earl Manigault the greatest basketball he had ever seen .
So , why did n’t he ever make it to the NBA ?
It seems that Earl surrounded himself with a bad group of people .
Despite sitting a record 57 point game for New York City junior high schools , he began smoking weed and was kicked out of school .
After finishing private school in North Carolina , he completed only one year of college .
The Goat perfected street basketball , playing against some NBA greats like Kareem and Earl Monroe .
But , he never made it the pros himself .
He developed a heroin addiction , which resulted in him serving several jail terms in the 70’s .
He eventually cleaned himself up and worked with kids to help them prevent the mistakes he made .
Manigault died of congestive heart failure in 1998 , just two years after HBO released a TV movie about his life .
4. Hank Gathers
In high school , Hank Gathers took his school to the Philadelphia City Championship .
He was recruited by the University of Southern California , but left after the 1985 - 86 season .
He transferred to Loyola Marymount , where he became the second player in NCAA Division I history to lead in scoring and rebounding during the 1988 - 89 season .
It was discovered that Gathers had an abnormal heartbeat , but refused to take his meds because it altered his game .
On March 4 , 1990 , he collapsed during a game .
He soon stopped breathing and was pronounced dead on arrival when he was brought to the hospital .
3. Travis Roy
Here ’s a kid that played hockey his entire life .
After getting a scholarship to Boston University to play the game he loved , the future certainly looked bright for Travis Roy .
Then tragedy .
Eleven seconds into his first shift for BU , Roy went head first into the boards .
He ended up cracking his fourth and fifth vertebra , which resulted in him becoming a quadriplegic .
It was such an unfortunate event that the school renamed their arena after him .
Roy is also the only BU player to have have his number retired at the school .
Since that day on October 20 , 1995 , Roy has written his autobiography and has set up a foundation for spinal cord research .
2. Ernie Davis
Ernie Davis was the first African - American to win the Heisman while at Syracuse University .
In the 1962 NFL draft , he was the first overall pick by the Washington Redskins .
He the first African American to ever be taken first .
His rights were traded to the Cleveland Browns , where he would have been running the ball with the great Jim Brown .
But , the awesome possibilities never happened .
Davis was diagnosed with leukemia during the 1962 College All - Star Game .
The only time he got to suit up for the Browns was during a pre-season , when he got to run out onto the field .
Davis passed away on May 18 , 1963 at the young age of 23 .
Following his death , the Browns retired his number 45 .
He was also inducted into the College Hall of Fame in 1979 .
In 2008 , a major motion picture biography about him , The Express , was released .
1. Len Bias
Len Bias was an All American basketball player while at the University of Maryland .
And , NBA scouts were noticing .
Some even compared his skills to that of Michael Jordan .
The Boston Celtics , who were the defending champs , picked Bias second overall in the 1986 draft .
His potential was so great the he apparently inked a $ 3 million contract with Reebok .
Bias returned to campus after meeting with the Celtics on June 18 .
At some point , Bias got his hands on some coke .
In the wee hours of the morning of June 19 , he went into a cardiac arrhythmia as a result of a cocaine overdose .
All attempts to revive the future star ’s life failed and he was pronounced dead at 8:55 a.m .
The University of Maryland , Boston , and all sports fans were shocked at the untimely death .
Shirley Sherrod , the USDA official forced to resign after Andrew Breitbart posted a video of her giving a speech to the NAACP , is telling her story to the Atlanta Journal - Constitution — and Breitbart has , once again , railroaded an innocent person with an edited and highly misleading video : Resigned USDA official says racial story misconstrued .
In a phone interview from her home in Albany early Tuesday morning , Shirley Sherrod told the Atlanta - Journal Constitution that the video posted online Monday by biggovernment.com and reported on by foxnews.com and the AJC completely misconstrued the message she was trying to convey .
Sherrod , 62 , insisted her statements in the video were not racist .
“ For Fox to take a spin on this like they have done , and know it ’s not the truth … it ’s very upsetting , ” she said .
In the video Sherrod , who is black , admits to the crowd at the NAACP banquet she did n’t do everything she could to help a white farmer whom she said was condescending when he came to her for aid .
“ What he did n’t know while he was taking all that time trying to show me he was superior to me was , I was trying to decide just how much help I was going to give him , ” Sherrod said in the video recorded March 27 in Douglas in southeast Georgia .
“ I was struggling with the fact that so many black people had lost their farmland , and here I was faced with having to help a white person save their land .
So I did n’t give him the full force of what I could do .
I did enough . ”
But Tuesday morning , Sherrod said what online viewers were n’t told in reports posted throughout the day Monday was that the tale she told at the banquet happened 24 years ago — before she got the USDA job — when she worked with the Georgia field office for the Federation of Southern Cooperative / Land Assistance Fund .
Sherrod said the short video clip excluded the breadth of the story about how she eventually worked with the man over a two - year period to help ward off foreclosure of his farm , and how she eventually became friends with him and his wife .
“ And I went on to work with many more white farmers , ” she said .
“ The story helped me realize that race is not the issue , it ’s about the people who have and the people who do n’t .
When I speak to groups , I try to speak about getting beyond the issue of race . ”
Andrew Breitbart : the heir to Joseph McCarthy , destroying people ’s reputations and jobs based on deliberately distorted allegations , while the rest of the right wing blogs cheer .
Disgusting .
This is what has become of the right wing blogosphere — it ’s now a debased tool that serves only to circulate partisan conspiracy theories and hit pieces .
UPDATE at 7/20/10 8:33:55 am :
Note that LGF reader “ teh mantis ” posted a comment last night at around 6:00 pm that made exactly these points about Breitbart ’s deceptive video , in this post .
UPDATE at 7/20/10 9:00:01 am :
It ’s disturbing that the USDA immediately caved in to cover their asses , and got Sherrod to resign without even hearing her side of the story ; but also expected .
That ’s what government bureaucrats do .
And they did n’t want the USDA to become the next ACORN .
But it ’s even more disturbing that the NAACP also immediately caved in and denounced this woman , in a misguided attempt to be “ fair . ”
The NAACP is supposed to defend people like this .
They were played by a con man , and an innocent person paid the price .
UPDATE at 7/20/10 9:21:38 am :
CNN has a report on this disgusting incident now , with statements from the wife of the farmer to whom Sherrod referred in Breitbart ’s dishonest video — she says that Sherrod saved their farm : Ex-worker : USDA ‘ was n’t interested in hearing the truth ’
A Georgia woman who said she believes her husband is the white farmer referenced in the clip told CNN on Tuesday that Sherrod was helpful to her family and that the couple never felt she was being racist while trying to assist them in avoiding foreclosure .
“ She treated us really good and got us all we could , ” said Eloise Spooner of Iron City , Georgia .
Spooner said she remembered that Sherrod helped find an attorney to help her husband , Roger .
She said she does n’t believe Sherrod is being treated fairly .
Here ’s the interview with Sherrod :
Python 2.x , latitudinarian approach = 227 183 chars
import sys , re t=re.split('\ W+', sys.stdin.read( ).lower ( ) ) r=sorted ( ( - t.count ( w ) , w ) for w in set ( t ) if w not in ' andithetoforinis ' ) [ : 22 ] for l,w in r:print ( 78 - len ( r [ 0 ] [ 1 ] ) ) * l/r[ 0 ] [ 0 ] *'=', w
Allowing for freedom in the implementation , I constructed a string concatenation that contains all the words requested for exclusion ( the , and , of , to , a , i , it , in , or , is ) - plus it also excludes the two infamous " words " s and t from the example - and I threw in for free the exclusion for an , for , he .
I tried all concatenations of those words against corpus of the words from Alice , King James ' Bible and the Jargon file to see if there are any words that will be mis-excluded by the string .
And that is how I ended with two exclusion strings : itheandtoforinis and andithetoforinis .

Rant
Regarding words to ignore , one would think those would be taken from list of the most used words in English .
That list depends on the text corpus used .
Per one of the most popular lists ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English, http://www.english-for-students.com/Frequently-Used-Words.html, http://www.sporcle.com/games/common_english_words.php), top 10 words are : the be ( am / are / is / was / were ) to of and a in that have I
The top 10 words from the Alice in Wonderland text are the and to a of it she i you said
The top 10 words from the Jargon File ( v4.4.7 ) are the a of to and in is that or for
So question is why or was included in the problem 's ignore list , where it 's ~30th in popularity when the word that ( 8th most used ) is not .
etc , etc .
Hence I believe the ignore list should be provided dynamically ( or could be omitted ) .
Alternative idea would be simply to skip the top 10 words from the result - which actually would shorten the solution ( elementary - have to show only the 11th to 32nd entries ) .
Python 2.x , punctilious approach = 277 243 chars
The chart drawn in the above code is simplified ( using only one character for the bars ) .
If one wants to reproduce exactly the chart from the problem description ( which was not required ) , this code will do it :
import sys , re t=re.split('\ W+', sys.stdin.read( ).lower ( ) ) r=sorted ( ( - t.count ( w ) , w ) for w in set(t) - set(sys.argv ) ) [ : 22 ] h=min( 9*l /( 77 - len(w ) ) for l,w in r) print ' ' , 9 * r [ 0 ] [ 0 ] / h*'_ ' for l,w in r:print ' | '+9*l/h*'_'+ ' |', w
I take an issue with the somewhat random choice of the 10 words to exclude the , and , of , to , a , i , it , in , or , is so those are to be passed as command line parameters , like so :
python WordFrequencyChart.py the and of to a i it in or is <" Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland.txt "
This is 213 chars + 30 if we account for the " original " ignore list passed on command line = 243
PS .
The second code also does " adjustment " for the lengths of all top words , so none of them will overflow in degenerate case .
Competition in Canada ’s wireless network took another twist this morning with the launch of Rogers ’ flanker brand dubbed Chatr and a confirmation that Mobilicity intends to make good on its threat to take the wireless giant to court .
“ It is clear this brand was designed to solely go after the new entrants and drive them out of the market , ” said Stewart Lyons , chief operating officer , Mobilicity .
Lyons said Mobilicity lawyers are preparing to launch legal proceedings against Rogers and intend to file a complaint to Canada ’s Competition Tribunal .
Launched Wednesday , Chatr offers unlimited talk for $ 35 and unlimited talk and text for $ 45 within Toronto , Vancouver , Calgary , Edmonton , Ottawa and eventually Montreal .
“ This is directly positioned at customers looking for the cost certainty that you get with an unlimited plan , but with Chatr you get it with a network you can trust so you get fewer dropped calls than the other new entrants , ” said Garrick Tiplady , senior vice president , Chatr .
Tiplady did not identify a target demographic for Chatr .
When asked about additional offerings , like a data plan , Tiplady said at this point they are focused only on unlimited talk and text .
“ Obviously as consumer needs change we will continue to look at where we need to be , ” he said .
“ We believe in this market . ”
Mobilicity maintains that Chatr too closely resembles the low - cost , urban - focused offerings from new entrants , including Public Mobile and WIND Mobile , and Rogers is violating a section of the Competition
Act that prohibits the introduction of temporary offerings designed to reduce or lessen competition .
Lyons said they are also exploring “ various regulatory avenues ” with Industry Canada and the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) .
Alan Middleton , a marketing professor at York University ’s Schulich School of Business , said based strictly on what should be free market principles Mobilicity should n’t have a case .
“ What giants do is try to maximize the different markets they compete in , ” said Middleton .
“ This is not predatory , unfair stuff where they are picking on the little guy . ”
Wireless carriers should be able compete on their own merits , said Chris Diceman , senior vice president , communications and media , DBRS Ltd. , bond - rating agency .
“ I do n’t think any one player should have exclusive rights for a certain kind of strategy ; it is a competitive market , ” he said , adding the timing of the launch ties into the push for low - cost offerings for the back - to - school market .
“ What Rogers is doing is focusing on market segmentation and really trying to drive growth in the market going forward , ” as they help to take penetration rates up from current levels , he said .
The Chatr launch produced a bit of a celebratory spectacle from WIND executives .
“ We welcome it , we expected the market to heat up and I think what we are seeing is the most competitive market in the last ten years , ” said chief executive officer Ken Campbell , who spent part of the day at an event where customers were sold $ 1 hotdogs near a Rogers store at Yonge - Dundas Square .
The pair also promoted a $ 150 porting credit , or financial incentive , for switching to WIND .
Campbell said Chatr is a bit of an “ experiment ” given the increasing focus on smartphones and said WIND ’s focus on affordable unlimited data plans puts them in a strong position to compete .
“ They will , of course , adapt their propositions over time and we will adapt , ” Campbell said .
In an emailed statement , Alek Krstajic , CEO of Public Mobile , also welcomed competition , but said Rogers runs the risk of failing some of its customers by trying to manage three brands .
He also encouraged all Rogers customers to call and ask for Chatr rates .
“ Public Mobile has a very specific demographic .
We have low costs due to the price we paid for our spectrum and we pass those savings on to our customers , ” Krstajic said .
Almost one in five girls say they have been pregnant at least once by the age of 18 , according to a Government survey published today .
Just under half ( 46 per cent ) decided to keep their baby , while more than a third ( 36 per cent ) , had an abortion , the figures show .
The statistics are part of wider research on the experiences of 18 - year - olds in England , published by the Department for Education today .
The responses of thousands of 18 - year - olds questioned for the Youth Cohort Study and the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England were analysed .
The findings show that of the 18 - year - old girls questioned about pregnancy , 18 per cent had been pregnant at least once .
Of these , almost eight in 10 ( 79 per cent ) had been expecting a baby on just one occasion , nearly one in five ( 18 per cent ) had been pregnant twice , and 3 per cent had been pregnant at least three times .
The survey concluded there was a " noticeable trend " between the young women who fell pregnant by 18 , and their GCSE results .
A third ( 33 per cent ) of those who gained between one and four GCSEs at grades D - G had been pregnant at least once by the time they were 18 , compared to just 6 per cent of those who scored eight or more GCSEs at Grades A *- C .
Teenage girls who were eligible for Free School Meals - a measure of poverty - at age 16 , or who had parents who left school at 16 , were also more likely to get pregnant by the age of 18 , the figures showed .
According to figures published by the Office for National Statistics , there were 25.3 births for every 1,000 women under 20 , in 2009 .
Girls aged 15 to 19 accounted for 39,020 abortions carried out in England and Wales in 2009 .
The figures show that 18 per cent of girls who said they were sexually active had been pregnant by the age of 18 .

Ã¢ÂÂYou my date ?
Ã¢ÂÂ  she asked , coughing with the utmost gentility into her armpit .
Ã¢ÂÂI sure am , beautiful .
WhatÃ¢Â Âs your name ?
Ã¢ÂÂ  I slid a platter of Rancho Poppers from the booth - bench , and motioned for her to sit .
Ã¢ÂÂIÃ¢Â Âm Twilight , Ã¢ÂÂ  she answered .
Ã¢ÂÂAre you that vampire movie IÃ ¢Â  Âve heard so much about ?
Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂWhat ?
Ã¢ÂÂ
She seemed dumbfounded ; couldnÃ¢Â  Ât even answer a simple question .
Probably had a learning disability .
Ã¢ÂÂI heard you got terrible reviews , Ã¢ÂÂ  I continued , folding a quesadilla into another quesadilla and struggling to force my mouth around it .
Ã¢ÂÂ Listen , can we just do this ?
I got another job in two hours across town .
Ã¢ÂÂ  I reluctantly obliged , and we made our way outside .
She didnÃ ¢Â Ât quite know what to make of my Chariot Skates , and muttered something quite rude about the kind of man that tries to pick up whores on Training Rollerblades , but after taking only a handful of intense beatings and two major accidents , we safely made it the three blocks back to my apartment .
" A hero , Twilight .
That 's what kind of man . "
Even though I had politely asked Doug to leave for the night by repeatedly spitting in his face until he ran for the chemical eyewash , he was still there when we walked in the door .
I gave him the evil eye and the double finger , and escorted Twilight to my room .
Ã¢ÂÂNow , this is going to sound odd , Ã¢ÂÂ 
I cautioned her , Ã¢Â Â but IÃ¢Â Âm doing a little experiment hereÃ¢ÂÂ¦Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂHoney , you can Ã¢ÂÂexperimentÃ¢Â
Â  all you want , but after the game of dickhead roller - derby you just lost to the world out there , youÃ ¢ Â  Âve only got about 45 minutes left .
I 'd get a move on .
Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂCool , Ã¢ÂÂ  I replied , slipping into the bathroom .
Ã¢ÂÂI 'll admit : I was worried this was going to weird you out a little bitÃ¢Â Â ¦Ã¢ÂÂ  Ã¢ÂÂThereÃ¢Â
Âs nothing you got that I havenÃ¢Â  Ât seen twice today , baby , Ã¢ÂÂ  she yelled from the other room .
Though I appreciated the professionalism of that statement , she did n't do a very good job following through on it when I wheeled back into the room with my giraffe - skate legs and over - sized leather jacket .

Fans of Grave Encounters are well aware that Grave Encounters 2 ( review ) is now making its way onto the festival circuit and into their homes via VOD .
Recently the creators of the series , The Vicious Brothers , spoke with Dread Central about Grave Encounters 2 and more .
Individually known as Stuart Ortiz and Collin Minihan , the guys preferred all their answers be attributed to The Vicious Brothers as a whole to illustrate their one - mindedness about their work .
And it ’s work they have big hopes for .
“ We wanted Grave Encounters 2 to be our Aliens to Alien .
A lot of people say the sequel is a better film , ” The Vicious Brothers said .
“ We think the sequel that we ’ve come up with is twice everything we delivered in the first film . ”
With the success of the first movie , The Vicious Brothers jumped at the chance to make a sequel .
However , initially the idea of another film was n’t even on the radar .
“ We really did n’t have an idea .
The first movie actually had an extended ending that we ended up cutting because the runtime was so long , ” The Vicious Brothers said .
“ Going into the second movie , we were n’t even sure if we were going to do a sequel at all , but then the original was so successful for Tribeca that they started talking to us about it .
Our main concern was that if we were going to do a sequel , we did n’t just rehash the first movie .
We think horror films especially tend to be kind of notorious for having really shitty sequels .
We only wanted to do it if we could actually do something where we really liked the idea and thought it was worth doing . ”
And after some brainstorming sessions , The Vicious Brothers began to focus in on what they wanted from the sequel .
“ We thought it would be really cool to do something meta , ” The Vicious Brothers said .
“ I know The Blair Witch 2 tried it , and obviously that movie gets a lot of flack and did n’t live up to the first one ’s expectations .
And it ’s a similar situation with the Human Centipede 2 .
So we really wanted to be the first found footage movie that takes a sequel in a really meta direction but does it in a way that ’s satisfying to the audience , and we think we made a better film than the first one . ”
And anyone who ’s seen the original Grave Encounters knows a sequel would have to at least reference main character Lance Preston , played by Sean Rogerson .
The Vicious Brothers did better than that .
They brought Rogerson back for the second film as Lance Preston , but in an entirely new light .
“ Sean Rogerson is fantastic , ” The Vicious Brothers said .
“ We ca n’t say enough good things about him .
He ’s got such energy on set and he ’s so gung - ho and willing to do whatever .
For example , we did n’t even have the financing closed yet for Grave Encounters 2 ; it looked like it was going to come together , but it was n’t finalized yet .
And we knew everyone was going to want us to have this movie ready for Halloween , and it was kind of getting to be crunch time and we were like , ‘ Listen , Sean , we want you to start losing weight , but we ca n’t guarantee that the movie is going to be made yet . ’
And he was just like , ‘ All right , fuck it .
I trust you guys .
It ’s probably going to happen . ’
And he just started starving himself .
I think a lot of actors would have been like , ‘ Where ’s my contract before I start doing something like that ? ' ”

Continuing on Rogerson and his character , The Vicious Brothers said , “ We knew right away that we wanted to bring him back .
No matter what , we were going to bring him back .
Sean was excited about it because the new role took his character in such a different direction .
Even though he ’s playing the same character , he might as well be someone completely different because the building has really changed his personality over the course of the time that he ’s been stuck in there .
He ’s been driven mad , and it was really awesome to see him become the madman on set and carry the energy . ”
After writing the sequel , The Vicious Brothers made the decision to turn over the directorial reins .
“ It came down to a practical thing , really , ” The Vicious Brothers said .
“ At the time the movie was about to go into pre-production , we were finishing up this proof of concept trailer , a pretty elaborate little trailer that we made that ’s sort of like a short film in its own right .
We ’re using it to try to get investors for our next project that we ’re hoping to get going at the beginning of next year .
But it was still being edited , and there ’s a lot of 3D work , so there was still a lot of work we had to put into the trailer .
And we did n’t want to take on the full responsibility of the directorial side of Grave Encounters 2 because we did n’t want to compromise .
We wanted to be able to give enough attention to both . ”
The director they chose , John Poliquin , made his feature film directorial debut with Grave Encounters 2 .
“ He ’s a friend of ours that we ’ve known for several years , ” The Vicious Brothers said .
“ He ’s a pretty prolific music video director here in Canada .
He does crazy work ; he does shit that I do n’t even known how he does it all the time .
He ’s a mad scientist genius kind of guy .
So right off the bat we were like , ‘ Maybe this would be up JT ’s alley . ’
And we had one meeting with him where we just had some beers and kind of talked generally about the project , and it was obvious within 20 minutes that he totally got the material and would be a good fit . ”
But even though they are n’t in the director ’s chair , The Vicious Brothers left their mark on the making of Grave Encounters 2 .
“ We were still very involved in the film , ” The Vicious Brothers said .
“ We were there for a lot of the shoot , and we actually co-edited the movie .
We had two editing stations at the hospital location so on day two , when the footage from day one was available and ready to go , you ’d start editing it so by the time the movie was done , we had 35 to 40 minutes of it already cut . ”
They continued , “ This franchise is kind of our baby so we definitely have a vested interest in making it turn out good . ”
And to think all this success started from a leaked YouTube trailer .
“ It was crazy , ” The Vicious Brothers said .
“ With the first movie it was such a long process of getting the thing made and getting a US distributor .
We cut the trailer for the first film before we signed the deal with Tribeca .
We were writing another project at the time and letting the chips just fall wherever they may with Grave , and then we were like , ‘ You know what ?
Screw it .
Let ’s just leak the trailer to YouTube and see what happens . ’
It was crazy .
It just took off .
We think that helped with its success internationally and in other markets as well just because people noticed the demand for it at that point , and it was really a testament to YouTube being the reason we ’re sitting here talking about a sequel right now .
That was exciting , and we just really wanted to make something fresh with this new one . ”
Which leads to the obligatory question of where does the Grave Encounters series go from here ?
“ It all depends on how Tribeca does with it , ” The Vicious Brothers said .
“ We ’re sure if they do well , they ’d be interested in continuing the franchise , and we feel like if the people want another sequel , then absolutely .
We ’ve already talked around some ideas and landed on something that might be fun .
So we ’ll have to wait and see how this goes over .
It ’d be nice to do a solid trilogy .
And with a third movie , even if we do n’t direct it , we ’ll be actively involved . ”
The Vicious Brothers are currently turning their attention to another horrific topic , alien abduction .
In describing their newest project , they said , “ It ’s a sci - fi , horror movie , alien abduction thing very much inspired by the film Fire in the Sky , which we are huge fans of .
That movie has that scene , the abduction scene … it ’s still to this day the scariest thing we ’ve ever seen having to do with alien abduction , and we ’d like a chance to make our own version of that .
It ’s called The Visitors , and we ’re hoping to get that going at the beginning of next year . ”
So fans will have to wait on that one , but Grave Encounters 2 is here now !
The film hit iTunes on Monday , October 1 , and nationwide video - on - demand on Tuesday , October 2 .
It opens in six cities ( New York , Baltimore , Phoenix , Denver , San Diego and Columbus ) on October 12 .
Check out the official Grave Encounters 2 website for all the info on the releases .
The film will be having its Canadian premiere at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival .
You can get up - to - the - minute info on the official Grave Encounters Facebook page and the official Grave Encounters 2 Facebook page .
The Vicious Brothers also want fans to know that they are very active on Twitter and encourage anyone who wants to correspond with the duo to hit them up at @VICIOUSBROS .
“ We do n’t have moderators , ” The Vicious Brothers said .
“ It ’s just us so if people want to give us a shout or ask a question , they can do that . ”

Get haunted in the comments section below .
I ’ve seen a peculiar meme surfacing here and there lately — the assertion that people like me are exaggerating how bad our current difficulties are , that things were actually worse in the 70s and 80s .
I wonder where that ’s coming from — and I really do ; it has the feel of one of those things being disseminated on talk radio or something , and I think I hear a faint chant of Jimmy Carter !
Jimmy Carter ! in the background .
Whatever .
The truth is that this really is the big one .
Catherine Rampell recently updated the recession comparison chart , showing declines in employment .
Here ’s the percentage decline in employment in recessions since 1970 :
We ’re really number one , by that standard .
But was n’t the unemployment rate higher in the past ?
Well , in 1982 , although not in the 1970s , it was briefly a bit higher than the peak this cycle :
But back then the “ full employment ” level of unemployment was higher , so the increase was n’t as large ; more important , most of the unemployment was short - term , nothing like the deeply corrosive long - term unemployment we ’re facing now :
So these really are the worst of times .
Daily Telegraph Advertises Cannabis Website
Imagine my surprise today when on the ( traditionally conservative ) Daily Telegraph website I found an absolutely huge banner for Weed World – a website aimed at , well , weed users .
.
.
Looks like they are not really policing who can advertise on their website with Google Adense .
Either that or they are taking a pro legalization stance now , which seems a little unlikely although though the liberal democrats , ( who are now part of the UK coalition government ) believe that all drugs should be decriminalized .
Such mixed messages ..
Anyway – this was visible on a computer in Spain – whether the Telegraph are advertising ‘ Weed World ’ in the UK I am not yet sure .
Maybe David Cameron likes a smoke after all ?
* Garage Storage Solution *
By : Tluweyen
2 February 2010
If you are like my family , we are constantly short on space in our house .
Rather than buy a huge McMansion , we bought what we could afford and ended up with a ranch house with about 2000 square feet .
While this is big compared to previous generations , it seems ours has more “ stuff ” .
We have been working at cleaning out junk and freeing up space but we are still coming up short and everything seems cluttered .
This seems even more so with our acquisition of more and more preparedness materials .
In order to help alleviate the constant storage issue , I decided it was time to build overhead garage storage .
I wanted a place where I could store items while I work on securing “ tickets ” for my family .
I also want those items all together and easily accessible .
My preference is to have some boxes which would easily load and stack on my 5 ’ x8 ’ utility trailer and be strong enough to hang from the ceiling .
After searching around at various stores , including WalMart and Target , I found exactly what I was looking for at Lowes .
These totes are just under 30 inches long with allows me to place two rows in the trailer and hang them in rows of two on the ceiling .
They are made to hold 400 pounds , not that I will ever put that much in them , but I know they are solid .
This helps though when stacking them .
I can comfortable stack two to three without worrying about the bottom tote having its sides bow out .
They also have a solid lip around the top for hanging them like I wanted to do .
Finally the tops have small holes on the edges where they can be secured with zip ties to ensure they stay shut .
For what I did here are the materials needed .
12 of the above totes $ 11.67 each ( Lowes )
4 – 1x4x10 boards $ 2.91 each ( Lowes )
4 – 2x4x10 $ 3.69 each ( 84 Lumber )
16 – 3/8x8 lag screws $ 1.89 each ( 84 Lumber )
16 – 3/8 washers $ 1.04 per bag needed 4 bags ( Lowes )
40 – 4 ” deck screws $ 8.99 for one box ( Lowes )
Total cost $ 209.95
Lowes did not have 1x4x10 but they had 1x4x8 .
I thought about purchasing the 8 foot lengths but thought I would end up with waste and end up spending more in the end .
I went to 84 Lumber and they had the 10 foot lengths .
I also purchased the lag screws at Lowes at $ 3.00 each , but when I went to 84 Lumber they were $ 1.89 there so I purchased them again and returned the ones I bought at Lowes .
The first step is to cut the 1x4s and 2x4s in half .
This provided enough room to support two totes with an inch to spare .
Once all the boards are cut , I stood the 2x4x5s on the 2 ” side and put gorilla glue on the up side .
Then I laid a 1x4x5 on top of the board and secured the ends with clamps .
I then started putting the deck screws into the boards from the 1x4x5 into the 2x4x5 .
I spaced the screws 1 ’ apart .
Repeat this for all of them .
I ended up with 8 of the combined boards .
* In my first attempt I left the boards uncut in their 10 ’ lengths .
I found this unwieldy and difficult to cut with my miter saw .
The next step is to prepare the ceiling of the garage .
The joists in my garage were 24 ” apart .
Rather than measure out everything before hand and end up missing or messing up something , I started with one side and moved from there once I had the first boards secured .
To make find the center of the joist I measured to where I thought it should be and marked it .
I then took a small hammer and penny nails to find the exact center .
I did this where I wanted to start and then I repeated this step well past where I thought where the boards would hang .
I then had my wife help me put a chalk line on the ceiling to help me keep the boards straight .
To put the boards up , I measured where the boards would cross the joists .
Each board crossed the joist 3 times .
I placed them so they would cross near the ends and again in the middle .
I drilled a pilot hole into the joist with a 1 / 4 ” bit .
I measured several times and made sure the holes I drilled into the boards lined up exactly .
I marked the boards with a marker and drilled a hole into the boards with a 3/8 ” bit .
I then put washers on the lag screws and pushed them through the holes in the board and put them up to the ceiling to ensure they lined up .
Measuring multiple times helps to prevent mistakes here .
I put a few of these up by myself , but it is much easier to have some help here .
I secured one end into the joist enough where it could hold itself for a minute and then climbed my second ladder to secure the second side .
Getting the lag screws into the ceiling took some work at first .
The head of the lag screw was 9/16 .
My 9/16 socket had a small ratchet and I could not get leverage .
I took a 3 ’ piece of pipe and added it to the handle and things when much easier from there .
After putting the first one up I needed to make sure I had room to slide the tote between the boards .
I measured along the chalk line 21 ” from the boards I just secured to the ceiling .
This helped keep the spacing right and kept me from drifting .
I then measured 21 ” from the second lag screw and marked .
This mark was usually off a little and I had to measure to find the joist .
Again , lots of measuring helps keep everything straight .
Once the measuring is done I repeated drilling and securing the boards to the ceiling .
After every time I added new boards I put an empty tote up there to make sure I had the proper spacing .
These boards are pretty secure into the joists .
I have some of the boxes up in the ceiling now holding about 45 pounds each .
To test them , I hung off of them with all of my 220 pounds and they did not budge .
I am not that “ handy ” but I like to try to do stuff around the house and think through the problems .
In the end I am very happy with how the project turned out .
The total time I spent was about 5 hours .
If I had consistent help , I think I could have cut it down to 2 - 3 hours .
A lot of my time was lost climbing up and down my two ladders making sure I measured right .
Over the next few weeks as I fill everything I will put labels on the bottom and side of the totes to tell me what is in the boxes .

Last month was the hottest June ever recorded worldwide and the fourth consecutive month that the combined global land and sea temperature records have been broken , according to the US government 's climate data centre .
The figures released last night by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) suggest that 2010 is now on course to be the warmest year since records began in 1880 .
The trend to a warmer world is now incontrovertible .
According to NOAA , June was the 304th consecutive month with a combined global land and surface temperature above the 20th - century average .
The last month with below - average temperatures was February 1985 .
Each of the 10 warmest average global temperatures recorded since 1880 have occurred in the last 15 years with the previous warmest first half of a year in 1998 .
Temperature anomalies included Spain , which experienced its coolest June temperature since 1997 , and Guizhou in southern China , which had its coolest June on record .
According to Beijing Climate Centre , Inner Mongolia , Heilongjiang , and Jilin experienced their warmest June since their records began in 1951 .
Scientists expressed surprise that the June land surface temperature exceeded the previous record by 0.11C ( 0.20 F ) .
" This large difference over land contributed strongly to the overall global land and ocean temperature anomaly , " said John Leslie , a spokesman for NOAA .
Separate satellite data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado shows that the extent of sea ice in the Arctic was at its lowest for any June since satellite records started in 1979 .
The icy skin over the Arctic Ocean grows each winter and shrinks in summer , reaching its annual low point in September .
The monthly average for June 2010 was 10.87 km sq .
The ice was declining an average of 88,000 sq km per day in June .
In a further possible sign of a warming world , the Jakobshavn Isbrae glacier , one of the largest in Greenland , lost a 2.7 - square mile chunk of ice and retreated one mile between 6 - 7 July – one of the largest single losses to a glacier ever recorded .
The glacier , a tongue of the Greenland ice sheet , has retreated six miles since 2000 and more than 27 miles since 1850 .
It is believed to be the single largest contributor to sea level rise in the northern hemisphere .
Greenland 's ice sheet , a vast body of ancient ice covering 1.7 m sq km , is melting today more rapidly than only a few decades ago .
Since 2000 , the ice sheet is calculated to have lost about 1,500 cubic kilometres of water– enough to raise global sea levels by 5 mm .
If the entire ice sheet melted , the world 's oceans would rise by over six metres .
Glaciologists expressed surprise at the speed of the break - up of the glacier : " This is unusual because it occurs on the heels of a warm winter that saw no sea ice form in the surrounding bay ... it lends credence to the theory that warming of the oceans is responsible for the ice loss observed throughout Greenland and Antarctica , " said Nasa scientist Thomas Wagner .
" These are clear signs of a rapidly warming world and exactly what the climate models have predicted .
Thankfully , there is a way out of it if we can get greenhouse gas emissions under control , " said Ben Stewart of Greenpeace .

Full - featured , built - in profilers like JConsole and VisualVM sometimes cost more than they 're worth in performance overhead — particularly in systems running on production hardware .
So , in this second article focusing on Java performance monitoring , I 'll introduce five command - line profiling tools that enable developers to focus on just one aspect of a running Java process .
The JDK includes many command - line utilities that can be used to monitor and manage Java application performance .
Although most of them are labeled " experimental " and therefore technically unsupported , they 're still useful .
Some might even be seed material for special - purpose tools that could be built using JVMTI or JDI ( see Related topics ) .
1. jps ( sun.tools.jps )
About this series
So you think you know about Java programming ?
The fact is , most developers scratch the surface of the Java platform , learning just enough to get the job done .
In this series , Ted Neward digs beneath the core functionality of the Java platform to uncover little - known facts that could help you solve even the stickiest programming challenges .
Many command - line tools require that you identify the Java process that you want to monitor .
This is n't so different from similar tools that monitor native - operating - system processes and also require a process identifier to work .
The " VMID " identifier is not always the same as the native operating system process identifier ( " pid " ) , which is why we need the JDK 's jps utility .
Using jps within a Java process
As with most of the tools shipped with the JDK , and all of the tools mentioned in this article , the jps executable is actually a thin wrapper around the Java class or set of classes that carry out the vast majority of the work .
Under Windows® , the tools are .exe files that use the JNI Invocation API to call directly to the class in question ; under UNIX® , most of the tools are symbolic links to a shell script that kicks off a generic Java launcher with the right class name specified .
If you want to use jps 's ( or any other tool 's ) functionality from within a Java process — such as an Ant script — it 's relatively easy to just call main ( ) on the class that is the " main " class for each tool .
For easy reference , that class name appears in parentheses after each tool 's name .
jps — whose name reflects the ps utility found on most UNIX systems — tells us the JVMID of a running Java application .
As its name implies , jps returns the VMIDs for all discoverable Java processes running on a given machine .
If jps does n't discover a process , it does n't mean that the Java process can't be attached or spelunked .
It just means that it is n't advertising itself as available .
If the Java process can be found , jps will list the command - line used to launch it .
This way of differentiating between Java processes is important because , as far as the operating system is concerned , all Java programs are " java . "
For most purposes , the VMID is the important number to note .
Getting started with profilers
The easiest way to get started with profiling utilities is to use a demo program like the SwingSet2 demo found at demo / jfc / SwingSet2 .
Doing this avoids potential hangups with processes running as background / daemon processes .
Once you 're familiar with the tool and its overhead , you can try it on your actual programs .
After you load up your demo app , run jps and note the returned vmid .
For best effect , launch the Java program with the - Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote property set .
If you do n't use this setting , some data gathered by some of the tools below will be unavailable .
2. jstat ( sun.tools.jstat )
The jstat utility can be used to gather a variety of different statistics .
jstat statistics are sorted into " options " that are specified at the command - line as the first parameter .
You can view the list of options available by running jstat with the command - options .
Some options are shown in Listing 1 :
Listing 1 . jstat options
- class - compiler - gc - gccapacity - gccause - gcnew - gcnewcapacity - gcold - gcoldcapacity - gcpermcapacity - gcutil - printcompilation
The utility 's JDK documentation ( see Related topics ) will tell you what each of the options in Listing 1 returns , but the majority of them are used to gather performance information about the garbage collector , or just parts of it .
The - class option reveals loaded and unloaded classes ( making it a great utility for detecting ClassLoader leaks within the app server or your code ) , and both - compiler and - printcompilation display information about the Hotspot JIT compiler .
By default , jstat will display the information at the moment you check it .
If you want snapshots taken at regular intervals , specify the intervals in milliseconds following the - options command .
jstat will continuously display snapshots of the monitored process 's information .
If you want jstat to take a specific number of snapshots before terminating , specify that number after the interval / period value .
If 5756 were the VMID for a running SwingSet2 process started a few minutes ago , then the following command would tell jstat to produce a gc snapshot dump every 250 milliseconds for 10 iterations , then quit :
jstat - gc 5756 250 10
Note that Sun ( now Oracle ) reserved the right to change the output of the various options , or even the options themselves , without warning .
That 's the downside of using unsupported utilities .
See the Javadocs for complete details about each of the columns in the jstat output .
3. jstack ( sun.tools.jstack )
Knowing what 's happening inside of a Java process vis-a - vis the executing threads is a common diagnostic challenge .
For example , when an application has suddenly stopped processing , it 's obvious that some kind of starvation has been reached , but it is n't obvious just by looking at the code where the starvation has occurred , or why .
jstack is a utility that returns a complete dump of the various threads running in an app , which you can then use to pinpoint the problem .
Running jstack with the VMID of the desired process will generate a stack dump .
In this regard , jstack works the same as pressing Ctrl - Break within the console window in which a Java program is running , or calling Thread.getAllStackTraces ( ) or Thread.dumpStack( ) on each of the Thread objects in the VM .
A jstack call also dumps information about non-Java threads running within the VM , which are n't always available as Thread objects .
jstack 's -l parameter offers up a slightly longer dump that includes more detailed information about the locks held by each of the Java threads , and can thus be invaluable in finding ( and squashing ! ) deadlock or scalability bugs .
4. jmap ( sun.tools.jmap )
Sometimes , the problem you 're dealing with is an object leak , such as an ArrayList ( which could hold thousands of objects ) that just is n't getting released when it should .
Another problem that is more general would be an expanding heap that never seems to shrink , despite active garbage collection .
When you 're trying to locate an object leak , it 's incredibly helpful to take a picture of the heap at a given moment in time , and then look through what 's there .
jmap provides the first part of that functionality by taking a snapshot picture of the heap .
You can then analyze the heap data using the jhat utility described in the next section .
Using jmap is straightforward , like all the other utilities described here .
Simply point jmap at the VMID of the Java process you want to snapshot , and give it some parameters to describe the resulting file produced .
The options you 'll pass to jmap consist of the name of the file to dump to and whether to use a text file or binary file .
A binary file is the most useful option , but only when combined with some kind of indexing tool — manually slogging through several megabytes of text filled with hexadecimal values is not the best way to spend your day .
For a more casual glance at the Java heap , jmap also supports a - histo option .
- histo produces a text histogram of the objects currently strongly referenced in the heap , sorted by the total number of bytes consumed by that particular type .
It also gives the total number of instances of that particular type , which allows for some primitive calculations and guesses about relative cost per instance .
Unfortunately , jmap does n't have a period - and - max - count option like jstat does , but it 's relatively easy to put calls to jmap ( or to jmap . main ( ) ) into a loop in either a shell script or other class to take snapshots periodically .
( In fact , this would be a good extension to add to jmap , either as a source patch to the OpenJDK itself or as an extension to another utility . )
5. jhat ( com.sun.tools.hat.Main )
Once you 've dumped the heap into a binary file , you can use jhat to analyze the binary heap dump file .
jhat creates an HTTP / HTML server that can be surfed in a browser , giving an object - by - object view of the heap , frozen in time .
While it could be amusing to walk through the heap , object reference by object reference , you 're probably better served by doing some kind of automated analysis of the whole mess .
Fortunately , jhat supports an OQL syntax for doing that analysis .
For example , running an OQL query for all String s with more than 100 characters would look like this :
select s from java.lang .
String s where s.count >= 100
The results are displayed as links to the objects , which then display the complete contents of that object , the field references to other objects as additional links that can be dereferenced .
OQL queries can also invoke methods on the objects themselves , use regular expressions as part of the query , and use built - in query tools .
One query tool , the referrers ( ) function , displays all the referrers that refer to an object of a given type .
Here 's the query to find all the referrers to File objects :
select referrers (f ) from java.io .
File f
You can find the full syntax of OQL and its features under the " OQL Help " page inside the jhat browser environment .
Combining jhat with OQL is a powerful way to do a targeted investigation of a misbehaving heap .
Conclusion
The JDK 's profiling extensions can be very useful when you need to get a closer look at what 's going on inside a Java process .
All of the tools introduced in this article can be used by themselves from the command line .
They also can be powerfully combined with JConsole or VisualVM .
Whereas JConsole and VisualVM provide an overarching view of the Java virtual machine , specifically focused tools like jstat and jmap let you fine - tune your investigation .
Although these tools are still commonly used , Java 7 introduced JCMD , a single utility that handles many of things that the other utilities do .
You can use it to identify Java processes IDs ( similar to jps ) , obtain heap dumps ( like jmap ) , make thread dumps ( as does jstack ) , and generate garbage collection statistics ( just like jstat ) .

Last week we reported on a Wall Street Journal article that tagged the development cost of StarCraft II at more than $ 100 million .
According to Blizzard , it was a case of right price , wrong game .

How much did StarCraft cost to make ?
Blizzard has n't said , nor is it planning to any time soon .
What Blizzard will tell us however , is that the $ 100 million figure that appeared in the Wall Street Journal is not correct .
Apparently the WSJ got its games mixed up .
The $ 100 million - plus figure in the article referred to the development and upkeep of World of Warcraft , its massively - multiplayer online game .
The numbers are based off figures we reported on two years ago .

The Wall Street Journal has printed a retraction , and our original post on the subject has been updated as well .
Ben Bernanke ’s dollar crisis went into a wider mode yesterday as the greenback was shockingly upstaged by the euro and yen , both of which can lay claim to the world title as the currency favored by central banks as their reserve currency .
Over the last three months , banks put 63 percent of their new cash into euros and yen — not the greenbacks — a nearly complete reversal of the dollar ’s onetime dominance for reserves , according to Barclays Capital .
The dollar ’s share of new cash in the central banks was down to 37 percent — compared with two - thirds a decade ago .
Currently , dollars account for about 62 percent of the currency reserve at central banks — the lowest on record , said the International Monetary Fund .
Bernanke could go down in economic history as the man who killed the greenback on the operating table .
After printing up trillions of new dollars and new bonds to stimulate the US economy , the Federal Reserve chief is now boxed into a corner battling two separate monsters that could devour the economy — ravenous inflation on one hand , and a perilous recession on the other .
“ He ’s in a crisis worse than the meltdown ever was , ” said Peter Schiff , president of Euro Pacific Capital .
“ I fear that he could be the Fed chairman who brought down the whole thing . ”
Investors and central banks are snubbing dollars because the greenback is kept too weak by zero interest rates and a flood of greenbacks in the global economy .
They grumble that they ’ve loaned the US record amounts to cover its mounting debt , but are getting paid back by a currency that ’s worth 10 percent less in the past three months alone .
In a decade , it ’s down nearly one - third .
Yesterday , the dollar had a mixed performance , falling slightly against the British pound to $ 1.5801 from $ 1.5846 Friday , but rising against the euro to $ 1.4779 from $ 1.4709 and against the yen to 89.85 yen from 89.78 .
Economists believe the market rebellion against the dollar will spread until Bernanke starts raising interest rates from around zero to the high single digits , and pulls back the flood of currency spewed from US printing presses .
“ That ’s a cure , but it ’s also going to stifle any US economic growth , ” said Schiff .
“ The economy is addicted to the cheap interest and liquidity . ”
Economists warn that a jump in rates will clobber stocks and cripple the already stalled housing market .
“ Bernanke ’s other choice is to keep rates at zero , print even more money and sell more debt , but we ’ll see triple - digit inflation that could collapse the economy as we know it .
“ The stimulus is what ’s toxic — we ’re poisoning ourselves and the global economy with it . ”

The ‘ S ’ in HTTPS stands for ‘ secure ’ and the security is provided by SSL / TLS .
SSL / TLS is a standard network protocol which is implemented in every browser and web server to provide confidentiality and integrity for HTTPS traffic .
If there 's one point that we want to communicate to the world , it 's that SSL / TLS is not computationally expensive any more .
Ten years ago it might have been true , but it 's just not the case any more .
You too can afford to enable HTTPS for your users .
In January this year ( 2010 ) , Gmail switched to using HTTPS for everything by default .
Previously it had been introduced as an option , but now all of our users use HTTPS to secure their email between their browsers and Google , all the time .
In order to do this we had to deploy no additional machines and no special hardware .
On our production frontend machines , SSL / TLS accounts for less than 1 % of the CPU load , less than 10 KB of memory per connection and less than 2 % of network overhead .
Many people believe that SSL takes a lot of CPU time and we hope the above numbers ( public for the first time ) will help to dispel that .
If you stop reading now you only need to remember one thing : SSL / TLS is not computationally expensive any more .
The first part of this text contains hints for SSL / TLS performance and then the second half deals with things that Google is doing to address the latency that SSL / TLS adds .
Basic configuration
Modern hardware can perform 1500 handshakes / second / core .
That 's assuming that the handshakes involve a 1024 - bit RSA private operation ( make sure to use 64 - bit software ) .
If your site needs high security then you might want larger public key sizes or ephemeral Diffie - Hellman , but then you 're not the HTTP - only site that this presentation is aimed at .
But pick your certificate size carefully .
It 's also important to pick your preferred ciphersuites .
Most large sites ( Google included ) will try to pick RC4 because it 's very fast and , as a stream cipher , does n't require padding .
Recent Intel chips ( Westmere ) contain AES instructions which can make AES the better choice , but remember that there 's no point using AES - 256 with a 1024 - bit public key .
Also keep in mind that ephemeral Diffie - Hellman ( EDH or DHE ) ciphersuites will handshake at about half the speed of pure RSA ciphersuites .
However , with a pure RSA ciphersuite , an attacker can record traffic , crack ( or steal ) your private key at will and decrypt the traffic retrospectively , so consider your needs .
OpenSSL tends to allocate about 50 KB of memory for each connection .
We have patched OpenSSL to reduce this to about 5KB and the Tor project have independently written a similar patch that is now upstream .
( Check for SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS in OpenSSL 1.0.0a . ) .
Keeping memory usage down is vitally important when dealing with many connections .
Resumption
There are two types of SSL / TLS handshake : a full handshake and an abbreviated handshake .
The full handshake takes two round trips ( in addition to the round trip from the TCP handshake ) :
The abbreviated handshake occurs when the connection can resume a previous session .
This can only occur if the client has the previous session information cached .
Since the session information contains key material , it 's never cached on disk so the attempted client resume rate , seen by Google , is only 50 % .
Older clients also require that the server cache the session information .
Since these old clients have n't gone away yet , it 's vitally important to setup a shared session cache if you have multiple frontend machines .
The server - side miss rate at Google is less than 10 % .
An abbreviated handshake saves the server performing an RSA operation , but those are cheap anyway .
More importantly , it saves a round - trip time :
Addressing round trips is a major focus of our SSL / TLS work at Google ( see below ) .
Certificates
We 've already mentioned that you probably do n't want to use 4096 - bit certificates without a very good reason , but there are other certificate issues which can cause a major slowdown .
Firstly , most certificates from CAs require an intermediate certificate to be presented by the server .
Rather than have the root certificate sign the end certificates directly , the root signs the intermediate and the intermediate signs the end certificate .
Sometimes there are several intermediate certificates .
If you forget to include an intermediate certificate then things will probably still work .
The end certificate will contain the URL of the intermediate certificate and , if the intermediate certificate is missing , the browser will fetch it .
This is obviously very slow ( a DNS lookup , TCP connection and HTTP request blocking the handshake to your site ) .
Unfortunately there 's a constant pressure on browsers to work around issues and , because of this , many sites which are missing certificates will never notice because the site still functions .
So make sure to include all your certificates ( in the correct order ) !
There 's a second certificate issue that can increase latency : the certificate chain can be too large .
A TCP connection will only send so much data before waiting to hear from the other side .
It slowly ramps this amount up over time , but a new TCP connection will only send ( typically ) three packets .
This is called the initial congestion window ( initcwnd ) .
If your certificates are large enough , they can overflow the initcwnd and cause an additional round trip as the server waits for the client to ACK the packets :
For example , www.bankofamerica.com sends four certificates : 1624 bytes , 1488 bytes , 1226 bytes and 576 bytes .
That will overflow the initcwnd , but it 's not clear what they could do about that if their CA really requires that many intermediate certificates .
On the other hand , edgecastcdn.net has a single certificate that 's 4093 bytes long , containing 107 hostnames !
Packets and records
SSL / TLS packages the bytes of the application protocol ( HTTP in our case ) into records .
Each record has a signature and a header .
Records are packed into packets and each packet has headers .
The overhead of a record is typically 25 to 40 bytes ( based on common ciphersuites ) and the overhead of a packet is around 52 bytes .
So it 's vitally important not to send lots of small packets with small records in them .
I do n't want to be seen to be picking on Bank Of America , it 's honestly just the first site that I tried , but looking at their packets in Wireshark , we see many small records , often sent in a single packet .
A quick sample of the record sizes : 638 bytes , 1363 , 15628 , 69 , 182 , 34 , 18 , … This is often caused because OpenSSL will build a record from each call to SSL_write and the kernel , with Nagle disabled , will send out packets to minimise latency .
This can be fixed with a couple of tricks : buffer in front of OpenSSL and do n't make SSL_write calls with small amounts of data if you have more coming .
Also , if code limitations mean that you are building small records in some cases , then use TCP_CORK to pack several of them into a packet .
But do n't make the records too large either !
See the 15 KB record that https://www.bankofamerica.com sent ?
None of that data can be parsed by the browser until the whole record has been received .
As the congestion window opens up , those large records tend to span several windows and so there 's an extra round trip of delay before the browser gets any of that data .
Since the browser is pre-parsing the HTML for subresources , it 'll delay discovery and cause more knock - on effects .
So how large should records be ?
There 's always going to be some uncertainty in that number because the size of the TCP header depends on the OS and the number of SACK blocks that need to be sent .
In the ideal case , each packet is full and contains exactly one record .
Start with a value of 1415 bytes for a non-padded ciphersuite ( like RC4 ) , or 1403 bytes for an AES based ciphersuite and look at the packets which result from that .
OCSP and CRLs
OCSP and CRLs are both methods of dealing with certificate revocation : what to do when you lose control of your private key .
The certificates themselves contain the details of how to check if they have been revoked .
OCSP is a protocol for asking the issuing authority “ What 's the status of this certificate ? ” and a CRL is a list of certificates which have been revoked by the issuing authority .
Both are fetched over HTTP and a certificate can specify an OCSP URL , a CRL URL , or both .
But certificate authorities will typically use at least OCSP .
Firefox 2 and IE on Windows XP wo n't block an SSL / TLS handshake for either revocation method .
IE on Vista will block for OCSP , as will Firefox 3 .
Since there can be several OCSP requests resulting from a handshake ( one for each certificate ) , and because OCSP responders can be slow , this can result in hundreds of milliseconds of additional latency for the first connection .
I do n't have really good data yet , but hopefully soon .
The answer to this is OCSP stapling : the SSL / TLS server includes the OCSP response in the handshake .
OCSP responses are public and typically last for a week , so the server can do the work of fetching them and reuse the response for many connections .
The latest alpha of Apache supports this ( httpd 2.3.6 - alpha ) .
Google is currently rolling out support .
However , OCSP stapling has several issues .
Firstly , the protocol only allows the server to staple one response into the handshake : so if you have more than one certificate in the chain the client will probably end up doing an OCSP check anyway .
Secondly , an OCSP response is about 1 K of data .
Remember the issue with overflowing the initcwnd with large certificates ?
Well the OCSP response is included in the same part of the handshake , so it puts even more pressure on certificate sizes .
Google 's SSL / TLS work
Google is working on a number of fronts here .
I 'll deal with them in order of deployment and complexity .
Firstly we have False Start .
All you really need to know is that it reduces the number of round trips for a full handshake from two to one .
Thus , there 's no longer any latency advantage to resuming .
It 's a client - side change which should be live in Chrome 8 and is already in some builds of Android Froyo .
Secondly , Chrome will soon have OCSP preloading .
This involves predicting the certificates that a server will use based on past experience and starting the OCSP lookups concurrently with the DNS resolution and TCP connection .
Slightly more complex , but deployed , is Next Protocol Negotiation .
This pushes negotiation of the application level protocol down into the TLS handshake .
It 's how we trigger the use of SPDY .
It 's live on the Google frontend servers and in Chrome ( 6 ) .
Lastly , and most complex , is Snap Start .
This reduces the round trip times to zero for both types of handshakes .
It 's a client and server side change and it assumes that the client has the server 's certificate cached and has up - to - date OCSP information .
However , since the certificate and OCSP responses are public information , we can cache them on disk for long periods of time .
Conclusion
I hope that was helpful .
We want to make the web faster and more secure and this sort of communication helps keep the world abreast of what we 're doing .
Also , do n't forget that we recently deployed encrypted web search on https://encrypted.google.com.

Do Americans hate football ?
Not regular football , of course .
Not football as in first and ten , going long , late hits , special teams , pneumatic cheerleaders in abbreviated costumes , serial brain concussions — the game that every American loves , apart from a few , uh , soreheads .
Not that one .
The other one .
The one whose basic principle of play is the kicking of a ball by a foot .
The one that the rest of the world calls “ football , ” except when it ’s called ( for example ) futbal , futball , fútbol , futebol , fotball , fótbolti , fußball , or ( as in Finland ) jalkapallo , which translates literally as “ football . ”
That one .

The question arises now — as it has arisen periodically for eight decades — on account of the World Cup , the quadrennial global tournament of the sport that goes here by the name of soccer .
“ Soccer , ” by the way , is not some Yankee neologism but a word of impeccably British origin .
It owes its coinage to a domestic rival , rugby , whose proponents were fighting a losing battle over the football brand around the time that we were preoccupied with a more sanguinary civil war .
Rugby ’s nickname was ( and is ) rugger , and its players are called ruggers — a bit of upper - class twittery , as in “ champers , ” for champagne , or “ preggers , ” for enceinte .
“ Soccer ” is rugger ’s equivalent in Oxbridge - speak .
The “ soc ” part is short for “ assoc , ” which is short for “ association , ” as in “ association football , ” the rules of which were codified in 1863 by the all - powerful Football Association , or FA — the FA being to the U.K. what the NFL , the NBA , and MLB are to the U.S.
But where were we ?
Ah , yes .
Do Americans hate it ?
Soccer , that is ?
Here ’s one plausible answer : we do n’t .
The non-haters include the nearly twenty million of us who stayed indoors on a balmy Saturday afternoon to watch Ghana join England , Slovenia , and Algeria on this year ’s list of countries beaten or tied by the United States in the World Cup .
We were disappointed — Ghana won , 2 - 1 , sending our team home from South Africa .
Still , 19.4 million , the number registered by the Nielsen ratings service , is a lot of people .
It ’s not just more people than had ever watched a soccer game on American television before .
It ’s also more people than , on average , watched last year ’s World Series games , which had the advantage of being broadcast live in prime time .
It ’s millions more than watched the Kentucky Derby or the final round of the Masters golf tournament or the Daytona 500 , the jewel in NASCAR ’s crown .
And we do n’t just watch .
We do .
An estimated five million grownups play soccer in these United States on a regular basis .
Kids are mad for it , especially little ones .
More American children play it , informally and in organized leagues , than any other team sport .

Soccer may be an import , as is our entire nonaboriginal population , but it ’s well on its way to becoming as American as pizza , tacos , and French fries .
( And motherhood : Sarah Palin notwithstanding , “ soccer moms ” — a term introduced to the political world in 1996 , by a Republican consultant — are the proverbial key demographic . )
Of course , soccer has its challenges here , many of them owing to its relative newness in the arena of American commerce .
The enthusiasm of toddlers and post - toddlers is all very well , but , if that were enough to do the trick , Nike would have a division devoted to dodgeball .
Compared with its established rivals , big - time soccer is ill suited to televisual exploitation .
The game ’s continuous , almost uninterrupted flow of action denies it a steady supply of intervals for the advertising of beer and the fetching of same from the refrigerator .
The expedient of selling space on the players ’ bodies — plastering their uniforms with corporate logos from neck to navel — is less than fully satisfactory .
Also , the soccer pitch is vaster than the gridiron or the diamond , and the choreography of the game demands the widest of angles .
On TV , the players are tiny — a problem for those as yet unequipped with enormous high - def flat screens .
Do Americans hate soccer ?
Well , some of us dislike it immoderately — not so much the game itself as what it is taken to represent .
This spring , anti-soccer grumbling on the political right spiked as sharply as the sale of those great big TVs .
Back in 1986 , Jack Kemp , the former Buffalo Bills quarterback turned Republican congressman , took the House floor to oppose a resolution supporting America ’s ( ultimately successful ) bid to host the 1994 World Cup .
Our football , he declared , embodies “ democratic capitalism ” ; their football is “ European socialist . ”
Kemp , though , was kidding ; he was sending himself up .
Today ’s conservative soccer scolds are not so good - natured .
Their complaints are variations on the theme of un-Americanness .
“ I hate it so much , probably because the rest of the world likes it so much , ” Glenn Beck , the Fox News star , proclaimed .
( Also , “ Barack Obama ’s policies are the World Cup . ” )
What really bugs “ silly leftist critics , ” the Washington Times editorialized , is that “ the most popular sports in America — football , baseball , and basketball — originated here in the Land of the Free . ”
At the Web site of the American Enterprise Institute , the Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen , formerly a speechwriter for George W. Bush , wrote , “ Soccer is a socialist sport . ”
Also , “ Soccer is collectivist . ”
Also , “ Perhaps in the age of President Obama , soccer will finally catch on in America .
But I suspect that socializing Americans ’ taste in sports may be a tougher task than socializing our healthcare system . ”
And then there ’s G. Gordon Liddy .
Soccer , Liddy informed his radio listeners ,
comes from Latin America , and first we have to get into this term , the Hispanics .
That would indicate Spanish language , and yes , these people in Latin America speak Spanish .
That is because conquistadores who came over from Spain — you know , tall Caucasians , not very many of them — conquered the Indians , and the Indians adopted the language of their conquerors .
But what we call Hispanics now really are South American Indians .
And this game , I think , originated with the South American Indians , and instead of a ball they used to use the head , the decapitated head , of an enemy warrior .
Liddy ’s guest , a conservative “ media critic ” named Dan Gainor , responded cautiously ( “ soccer is such a basic game , you can probably trace its origins back a couple of different ways ” ) , while allowing that “ the whole Hispanic issue ” is among the reasons “ the left ” is “ pushing it in schools around the country . ”
Do we hate soccer ?
That depends on who we think “ we ” are .
One of the things that Franklin Foer ’s charming book “ How Soccer Explains the World ” explains is how soccer , along with its globalizing , unifying effects , provides plenty of opportunities for expressions of nationalism , which need not be illiberal , and for tribalism , which almost always is .
The soccerphobia of the right is tribalism masquerading as nationalism .
One in four of those twenty million viewers of the U.S. - Ghana match was watching it on Univision , America ’s leading Spanish - language network .
The three others were — well , who knows .
Liberals , probably , or worse .
Enough .
A yellow card is in order here , maybe a red one .
Soccer may never be “ America ’s game ” ( though it ’s already one of them ) , but America is game for soccer .
We ’re the Land of the Free , are n’t we ?
Ca n’t we be the land of the free kick , too ?
How tiny we really are
Do you know how tiny we actually are ?
Our mind ca n’t really process the word “ 12 billion light year ” .
Watch this short clip to get a glance of how tiny we really are in this universe .
Earth is like a dot compared to other stars in this galaxy .
Our planet is just a dust in the wind .
Two hurricanes in a month , petrol prices at $ 3 a gallon , a current account deficit of enormous proportions , a housing market that defies gravity : little wonder that the mood in the United States is a little edgy .
The International Monetary Fund made it clear last week that it saw the world 's largest economy as an accident waiting to happen .
The US could not continue to live beyond its means indefinitely , and there were only two ways to deal with the unsustainable imbalances in the global economy : the nice way or the nasty way .
The nice way , according to simulations by IMF staff , would involve a gradual slowdown in the pace of consumption in the US , accompanied by slightly higher real interest rates and a modest 15 % devaluation in the dollar over a few years .
The US current account would decline from 6 % of GDP to 3.5 % of GDP by 2010 and to 3 % over the long run .
The other main component of the soft - landing scenario would see a 15 % appreciation of currencies in the developing countries of Asia - China , for the most part - which would result in their current account surpluses shrinking to 2 % of GDP .
The nasty way involves a much sharper contraction in US activity .
Under this scenario , the overseas investors who have been funding the American trade deficit by buying US assets decide they have had enough .
The result is a large and sudden devaluation of the dollar , which adds to inflationary pressure and forces the Federal Reserve to raise short - term interest rates aggressively .
Protectionist pressures mount and this , together with the big appreciation of China 's currency , leads to much slower growth .
With both the world 's two big growth engines - the US and China - faltering , Europe and Japan also suffer .
Financial markets suffer hefty losses , adding to the gloom .
The IMF does not know how this will pan out - nor , to be honest , does anybody else .
On the plus side , it points to the fact that the past year has seen some progress on the agenda it has proposed for each key part of the global economy : the US budget deficit has been reduced , the Chinese have taken the first steps towards a more flexible exchange rate regime , the Japanese and the Europeans have committed themselves to structural reforms of their economies .
On the negative side , however , there has been no evidence thus far that the moves have been accompanied by an improvement in the global imbalances .
On the contrary , they appear to have got worse .
The communique issued by the G7 at the weekend aptly summed up the mood of uncertainty .
Although the global economy has continued to expand and the outlook was " positive for further growth " , it stressed that higher energy prices , growing global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures " have increased the risks to the outlook " .
Inflation
Oil prices are a real concern , despite relief that Hurricane Rita caused less damage than feared .
Prices have now remained higher for longer than policymakers expected , and the futures markets suggest they are going to stay high .
Demand is expected to remain strong and it will take years for investment in new fields and refineries to increase supply .
The inflationary impact of dearer energy is already becoming evident , with consumer confidence dented by falling disposable incomes and policymakers fretting about the effects on inflation .
Central banks will only take a relaxed view of higher oil prices when they can be really confident that activity will not be impaired .
Some analysts believe that it will not be long before the economy is affected .
Janet Henry of HSBC said that if petrol prices stayed at pre-hurricane levels , American consumers would spend an extra 1 % of disposable income just on fuel in the final quarter of 2005 , compared with the fourth quarter of 2004 .
She said : " The current bout of high oil could finally spell the end of the US consumer - leveraged expansion and a near - term end to the Fed tightening . "
It has certainly been the consumer that has kept the US afloat over the past few years .
As the IMF put it : " Fiscal and monetary policies in the United States became sharply expansionary - both absolutely and relative to other countries - thus sustaining domestic demand . "
America 's spending habit has been fed by exports from the rest of the world , with China playing an increasingly important role .
The forces of globalisation have given both sides of the transaction what they want : the US has been able to suck in low - cost goods while the developing countries of Asia have been able to enjoy export - led growth .
In the process , they have built up a huge stock of US assets , while the US has increased its stock of liabilities .
" Looking forward , the global imbalances are clearly unsustainable in the long term .
If the US external current account balance excluding investment income remained at its current level of more than 5 % of GDP , there would be an unbounded accumulation of external liabilities , " the IMF said .
It noted that so far the US had experienced little difficulty in financing imbalances but that there was no guarantee that this benign state of affairs would persist .
It is right to be wary .
On any reasonable assessment , a central part of any unwinding of the global imbalances will be a considerable devaluation of the dollar , which would leave those holding US assets nursing substantial losses .
Vacuum
To trigger a crisis , holders of US assets do n't necessarily need to sell them ; all they need to do is to stop buying more .
To be sure , the US can be allowed to continue along its current path , with the cooperation of the central banks of China , Japan and other Asian countries , but this would mean an even bigger adjustment in exchange rates when the day of reckoning finally arrived , and an even bigger haircut for those awash with US assets .
Apart from the dire consequences for the global economy that would result from a disorderly unwinding of the imbalances , there are two additional causes for concern .
One is that while the IMF has analysed the dilemma with aplomb , neither it nor any other body involved in global economic governance seems to have the clout to do anything about preventing a meltdown .
There is a vacuum that needs to be filled and urgently .
The second concern is this : underlying the policy recommendations of just about every global analyst is the belief that the rest of the world needs to emulate the economic model of the US .
The calls for structural reform in Japan and Europe stem from the belief that the Americans and the other " Anglo - Saxon " economies have the sort of flexibility that breeds success .
Yet that hardly squares with the IMF 's notion that the US economy could be going down the pan at any moment .
As Mark Weisbrot of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research , a Washington - based thinktank , points out , nor does it square with the long - term needs of sustainability .
Europe 's energy consumption per head is half that of the US : Weisbrot says the idea that the Europeans should work longer so that they can buy more things is dangerous and he 's right .
Perhaps the Germans were a lot smarter than they 've been given credit for in their scepticism about the need for neo-liberal structural reform .
Russia left out in the cold
All sorts of rumours were swirling around in Washington at the weekend when it was announced that Gordon Brown was to chair yet another meeting of the G7 in London in December .
One theory was that it was to give political impetus to the world trade talks in Hong Kong , which start two days later .
Another was that it was a special send - off to Alan Greenspan , who retires from the US Federal Reserve in January .
The neatest explanation , however , was that the G7 wanted to shaft Russia .
At the moment , Russia 's political clout means it is a member of the G8 , which last met at Gleneagles in July , but it is not deemed an important enough economy to join the finance ministers and central bank governors of the US , Britain , Germany , France , Italy , Canada and Japan at G7 meetings .
For the first time next year Russia will hold the presidency of the G8 .
Since meetings of the G7 are by tradition held in the country that is hosting the G8 , the Russians thought this was a chance to get into the rich man 's club by the back door .
But instead of holding the next meeting in February , the G7 has cunningly brought it forward to December in the UK , making it possible to leave the Russians out in the cold .
In reality that 's a sensible decision .
There is a strong case for membership of the G7 to be expanded , but China and India have a stronger case than Russia .
