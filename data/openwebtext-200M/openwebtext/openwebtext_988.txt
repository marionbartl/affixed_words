On Wednesday , a bipartisan panel led by four former Senate majority leaders  Howard Baker , Tom Daschle , Bob Dole and George Mitchell  will release a solid proposal for health care reform .
Among other things , it would call on the federal government to do more research on which treatments actually work .
An “ independent health care council ” would also be established , charged with helping the government avoid unnecessary health costs .
The Obama administration supports a similar approach .
And connecting the dots is easy enough .
Armed with better information , Medicare could pay more for effective treatments  and no longer pay quite so much for health care that does n’t make people healthier .
Mr. Baker , Mr. Daschle , Mr. Dole and Mr. Mitchell : I accuse you of rationing .

There are three main ways that the health care system already imposes rationing on us .
The first is the most counterintuitive , because it does n’t involve denying medical care .
It involves denying just about everything else .
The rapid rise in medical costs has put many employers in a tough spot .
They have had to pay much higher insurance premiums , which have increased their labor costs .
To make up for these increases , many have given meager pay raises .
This tradeoff is often explicit during contract negotiations between a company and a labor union .
For nonunionized workers , the tradeoff tends to be invisible .
It happens behind closed doors in the human resources department .
But it still happens .
Research by Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra of Harvard has found that , on average , a 10 percent increase in health premiums leads to a 2.3 percent decline in inflation - adjusted pay .
Victor Fuchs , a Stanford economist , and Ezekiel Emanuel , an oncologist now in the Obama administration , published an article in The Journal of the American Medical Association last year that nicely captured the tradeoff .
When health costs have grown fastest over the last two decades , they wrote , wages have grown slowest , and vice versa .
So when middle - class families complain about being stretched thin , they ’re really complaining about rationing .
Our expensive , inefficient health care system is eating up money that could otherwise pay for a mortgage , a car , a vacation or college tuition .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Global spending on military armaments and services hit a record in 2008 , driven by the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and helped by sharp increases in Chinese and Russian defense budgets .
For 2008 , countries around the world spent $ 1.5 trillion on weapons , vehicles and intelligence and reconnaissance services , according to a Monday report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , or Sipri .
The amount represented a 4 % increase from 2007 .
The year " saw increasing threats to security , stability and peace in nearly every corner of the globe , " the Swedish group said in a statement .
" The effects of the global financial crisis will be likely to exacerbate these challenges as governments and nongovernmental organizations struggle to respond effectively . "
The United States accounted for about 58 % of the global increase between 1999 and 2008 , with spending up about $ 219 billion in constant 2005 prices over the period , Sipri said .
At a far distance followed China and Russia , with absolute increases of $ 42 billion and $ 24 billion , respectively .
It 's an environment that 's been benefiting U.S. and European military contractors alike , particularly those that supply manned and unmanned aircraft , armored vehicles and surveillance and support services .
At the top of the heap was Boeing Co. BA , +3.19 % , with more than $ 30 billion in sales for 2007 , the latest year available .
Following was U.K. - based BAE Systems ( BA ) , Lockheed Martin Corp.
LMT , - 0.37 % , Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC , - 1.51 % and General Dynamics Corp. GD , +0.98 %
The same five companies have appeared at the top of Sipri's Top 100 list since 2002 .
With the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , sales of armored vehicles have soared , particularly for mine resistant ambush - protected vehicles , or MRAPs , that help protect soldiers against roadside bombs .
Demand for MRAPs helped Navistar International Corp. NAV , +1.53 % and Force Protection Inc. FRPT , +2.00 % increase their relative annual sales the most , and provided boosts to BAE Systems and General Dynamics , according to Sam Perlo - Freeman , head of Sipri 's military - expenditure project .
But higher armored - vehicle sales could be a short - term trend as the war in Iraq winds down .
More long term is demand for high - tech electronic and communication services , including intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance support , as well as network security , Perlo - Freeman said .
Northrop Grumman and L - 3 Communications Holdings Inc. LLL , - 0.41 % already have a strong presence in such services , while Boeing has been trying to aggressively break into the business , he commented in an interview .
U.S. leads global defense spending
The U.S. Defense Department led a surge in global military spending over the last decade , climbing to $ 607 billion in 2008 -- more than seven times the military budget of China and greater than the combined budgets of the next 14 ranking nations , according to Sipri .
China and Russia nearly tripled their military spending over the past decade as they jostle for regional influence and greater international status , said Sipri's Perlo - Freeman .
The United States accounted for about 42 % of military sales in 2008 , far outdistancing second - place China at $ 85 billion and Russia at $ 59 billion , the group said .
China and Russia accounted for just 5.8 % and 4 % of world sales , respectively .
As a percentage of a country 's gross domestic product , Saudi Arabia outranks every other government on spending .
The Mideast nation 's 2008 military budget -- which also included money for public order and safety -- represented about 9 % of its GDP at $ 38.2 billion .
In total , military spending accounted for 2.4 % of the world 's GDP in 2008 with significant increases in spending for all regions , save Western and Central Europe .
" Western and Central Europe does n't face direct military threats , while most countries , except for the U.K. , have little appetite for military adventures overseas , " Perlo - Freeman said .
" There are concerns of terrorism , but they do n't see military force as the best way to deal with it . "
Germany 's military budget fell 11 % between 1999 and 2008 to $ 46.8 billion , giving it the world 's sixth - largest budget .
Italy 's budget remained virtually flat over the same time period at $ 40.6 billion .
Germany spent 3.2 % of its GDP , while Italy devoted 2.8 % of its GDP to such spending .
The Taoiseach has said that he expects the second referendum on the Lisbon Treaty will be held in early October .
Brian Cowen was speaking at the conclusion of a two - day EU summit , which has agreed to legally binding guarantees on the application of the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland .
The summit also agreed to an Irish request that the guarantees also be incorporated as a protocol to the EU treaties .
' There will be a protocol to give a legal value to the guarantees ...
It is stressed that this does not modify in any way the content of the treaty for the other 26 , ' French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters .
Mr Cowen said that the guarantees ensured Irish control over tax rates , military neutrality and the Irish Constitution 's provisions on social and family law , including the right to life .
He said these guarantees , and the declaration on workers ' rights , and the decision taken last December that every country will keep its own commissioner , enables him to go back to the Government next week and recommend the holding of a second referendum on the Lisbon Treaty .
Speaking on RTÉ's News At One , Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin said the legislation to enable the referendum to take place will go before the Dáil before it adjourns for the summer recess early next month .
The Taoiseach said the agreement today would come as a great disappointment to No campaigners as they confirm that many of the arguments used against the treaty last year were bogus .
Mr Cowen added that the guarantees had clearly and decisively dealt with the concerns of the Irish people , and he was grateful to the other member states for that .
He described the deal as ' the best possible legal guarantee we can obtain for our people as they ( protocols ) are of full legal effect ' .
No campaigners label deal a ' smokescreen '
Opponents of the Lisbon Treaty have dismissed the agreement as a ' smokescreen ' that does not fundamentally alter the treaty .
Patricia McKenna of the People 's Movement said the declarations were not as legally binding as the treaty .
Padraig Mannion of the Peace and Neutrality Alliance predicted that once people focused on the issues , they would again reject the treaty .
Last night at the summit , European Commission President José Manuel Barroso won the unanimous backing of EU leaders for a second five - year term in office .
However , the former Portuguese prime minister still requires the approval of the European Parliament .
The leaders also agreed that a new pan-EU body to monitor risk in the union 's financial system should choose its own chairman , rather than have one imposed by the European Central Bank .

Muni floats plan to pull hundreds of S.F. stops SAN FRANCISCO
Muni bus Muni bus Photo : Paul Chinn , The Chronicle Photo : Paul Chinn , The Chronicle Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Muni floats plan to pull hundreds of S.F. stops 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Hundreds of bus and street car stops could be eliminated in San Francisco under a proposal unveiled Wednesday by Municipal Railway officials to speed transit travel .
" This will be controversial , " said Muni chief Nathaniel Ford .
It also would be one of the cheapest ways to improve Muni 's on - time performance , which hit a record - high 74.5 percent in the latest reporting period that covered the first three months of the year but still fell far short of the 85 percent on - time performance mark mandated by city voters 10 years ago .
Buses on the most heavily used routes , among them the 14 - Mission , 30 - Stockton , 38 - Geary and the 1 - California , now spend about 20 percent of their running time at stops picking up and dropping off passengers , officials report .
More time is wasted pulling buses in and out of stops in traffic .
Muni has more than 4,000 stops citywide , sometimes two on the same block .
" Changing our bus - stop spacing will have a significant impact in terms of speeding up service and making us more efficient and cost - effective , " Ford said .
The proposal is the next step in Muni 's efforts to overhaul the transit system .
Plans already are under way to steer more service to the most popular lines .
Spacing stops further apart - in some cases every four blocks - may make a lot of sense on paper but will be a hard sell to Muni regulars reluctant to give up the convenience .
Christie Martinez , 39 , who commutes on the 14 - Mission between Bernal Heights and her retail job downtown , said one of the main reasons she takes Muni is because it 's handy .
" If the plan is to make it better without adding to the hassle , then I 'm all for it .
But do n't make it harder . "
Muni already has a policy for transit - stop spacing , based on how hilly an area is .
Bus stops on streets with grades at 10 degrees or less should be 800 to 1,000 feet apart ; grades greater than 10 degrees should be 300 to 600 feet apart .
Above - ground rail stops should be separated by 1,000 to 1,200 feet .
However , those guidelines are adhered to in less than 18 percent of the cases .
Under the proposed guidelines , bus stops should be 900 to 1,400 feet apart in relatively flat areas and 500 feet apart in hilly areas .
Above - ground rail stops should be placed every 1,000 to 1,500 feet .
The typical block length in the northeast neighborhoods , such as Chinatown and North Beach , are 480 feet running east - west and 340 feet north - south .
In the western Sunset and Richmond neighborhoods , they 're 310 feet east - west and 680 feet north - south .
As Muni proceeds with plans to remove stops , flexibility will be paramount , said Cameron Beach , who serves on the Municipal Transportation Agency governing board .
" There are a lot of reasons , not the least of which are the differing lengths of blocks , the fact that we 're a city with lots of hills and we have a lot of transit riders used to a lot of transit coverage , " he said .
Agency staff said that when crafting the plan they will take into account not just the steepness of hills , but also a stop 's proximity to a hospital , school , senior center and transfer points .
Muni does n't expect to have a detailed proposal available for public review until October .
No changes would be made until sometime next year after ample outreach , Ford said .

It is expected that the winter Olympic Games in Sochi in 2014 will be clean and « green » .
Its organizers have committed themselves to the proper disposal of waste , economic usage of water and electricity , the observance of cleanliness and careful attitude to the environment in general .
The United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) signed a Memorandum of Understanding .
It is aimed at protecting the environment during the preparations for the Olympics and its implementation with the Russian National Committee for the Olympic Games .
Under this Memorandum , UNEP will provide technical support for Russia in its efforts to organize « environmentally friendly » Olympics .
At the signing ceremony the representative of UNEP Teodore Aubin stated that he hoped that the new arrangements would be a sort of guarantee that during preparation and holding of competitions measures will be taken to protect nature in Sochi and the whole Krasnodar region as well .
Organizers of the Olympic Games in Sochi plan to invest 1.75 billion dollars in projects on energy saving and renewable energy .
So they want to offset the greenhouse gas emissions from energy use , air travel and other modes of transport .
Other environmental initiatives include the development of « green belt » around town and reforestation in the Sochi National Park .
UNEP recalled that in 2008 Russia on the advice of international experts decided to postpone a number of Olympic facilities .
In particular , it was decided to find alternative places for the sledge , bobsled track , Olympic Village and the water intake , which were previously planned to be built on the outskirts of the fragile natural Caucasus Reserve .
Then , in 2008 , Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin proposed to build « disputed objects » in other places at the meeting on the problems of compliance with environmental requirements in preparation for the Olympic Games in 2014 , saying that if their construction violated the environmental system , it could not be restored .
« In determining priorities – money or ecology – we choose ecology .
If the balance of nature is broken , it can lead to a situation that would be impossible to correct for any money » , – said Vladimir Putin .
The head of the UN Environment Program Achim Steiner welcomed the Russian Government ’s commitment to environmental sustainability in preparation for the Olympic Games in Sochi .
He called the decision of Russia an important step towards the « green » Olympics - 2014 .
Theodore Aubin stressed that the obligations , enshrined in the new memorandum , would not remain only on paper , because the organizing committee « Sochi - 2014 » joined UNEP « plant billion trees » project on the day of the signing .
Gay Pride
Keeping the odd hours I do , I just walked through the area where Toronto ’s Gay Pride celebrations will take place .
At about 4 am the crowd was divided into celebrators still up from last night , with a few bars still open , and workers setting up the tents , portable toilets and stages for the weekends celebrations .
Lesbians , gays and straights mingled on the streets , which had been blocked off already by bored police officers , and judging from the couples holding hands or kissing , there were a lot of straights celebrating with their gay friends and neighbours .
Still , the sweetest couple I saw , caressing each other and kissing slowly and playfully , were gay , which is as it should be .
And there were a couple of drag queens too , which is also as it should be , because at Stonewall it was the queens who first started ripping up paving stones ; the queens who first said “ enough ! ”
Archeologists digging in the dirt and black ooze under Mexico City 's most important public square have been tantalized for decades by the possibility of a great treasure and likely burial place of one of the last Aztec rulers .
" They keep finding astonishing things as they inch their way along , " says David Carrasco , a Harvard University historian who 's worked with Mexican archeologists at the Templo Mayor .
But the great find – a royal tomb – has eluded scientists .
The city of Tenochtitlan , the Aztec capital that lies beneath the modern Mexico City , was founded on an island in the middle of a saltwater lake .
A high water table makes progress difficult .
" When you dig a pit or a trench , you find very quickly the water level and cannot continue if you do n't have a powerful pumping system , " says Leonardo Lopez , the archeologist heading the excavation .
Since he uncovered a carved monolith of the ferocious earth deity Tlaltecuhtli in 2006 , there has been intense speculation , based on historical writings and their own discoveries , that the four - metre - by - 3.5 - metre stone covers a royal tomb .
The stone monolith is inscribed with dates and language associated with Ahuitzotl , a king who died in 1502 .
Radar indicates " anomalies " under the monolith , which could be funerary spaces .
Though archeological finds in Mexico City date back to 1790 , no one has ever found the burial site of an Aztec king .
" Everyone wants us to dig faster , " says Lopez , " and this is the only thing we can not do .
" You can only excavate once an archeological site .
We are not treasure hunters but scientists , and we have a professional responsibility to record the slightest artifact in the best way . "
Still , they have uncovered the kinds of treasures that excite public interest , including a canine figure , possibly a dog , with turquoise earplugs , jade necklace and a golden bell around its feet .
A collection of 14 hammered gold ornaments – rare finds in large caches – never before on public display will be part of an exhibit on Moctezuma II opening in September at London 's British Museum .
" This monolith is one of the great Aztec deities , " says Carrasco .
" Imagine what she meant to them , and they buried it .
( Today ) in the middle of the old city , the national cathedral , the presidential palace , the supreme court are nearby – all this great symbolism , on this spot , the centre of Mexico since pre-Columbian times . "
Archeologists anticipate discovering a storehouse that will help them understand Mexica ( as the Aztec people are known ) funerary practices as well as the economic and political power in the years leading up to 1519 , when Spanish conquerors razed the Templo Mayor pyramid complex .
" We expect to find the cremated remains of one or more kings , servants , dwarfs , albinos , musicians sacrificed during the funerals , a rich offering of jewels , " says Lopez , who has worked on the excavation since 1978 .
On one side of the monolith , Lopez found an entrance .
" Digging deeper we have detected several plaster seals blocking the way , meaning that the place below is not looted . "
The ornamental dog may represent the dog the Mexica believed help the dead arrive at the underworld , he says .

While records refer to Ahuitzotl and two other kings buried at Templo Mayor , says Lopez , there 's no likelihood the remains of Moctezuma II , the last great Aztec kings , will be found .
" Moctezuma II died in a very difficult moment and his body was not the object of a royal funeral .
A source says this his body was cremated inside a burned temple and that immediately after a group of followers drank his ashes . "
TEHRAN , June 19 ( Reuters ) - Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei defended Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Friday as the rightful winner of Iran 's presidential election and called for an end to the biggest street protests in Iranian history .
Here are some highlights from Khamenei 's address .
" I am urging them to end street protests , otherwise they will be responsible for its consequences , and consequences of any chaos .
" The result of the election comes out of the ballot box , not from the street . "
" If there is any bloodshed , leaders of the protests will be held directly responsible . "
" Differences of opinion do exist between officials which is natural .
But it does not mean there is a rift in the system .
" Ever since the last presidential election there existed differences of opinion between ( President Mahmoud ) Ahmadinejad and ( former president Akbar Hashemi ) Rafsanjani .
" Of course my outlook is closer to that of Ahmadinejad in domestic and foreign policy . "
" The enemies ( of Iran ) are targeting the Islamic establishment 's legitimacy by questioning the election and its authenticity before and after ( the vote ) . "
" After street protests , some foreign powers ... started to interfere in Iran 's state matters by questioning the result of the vote .
They do not know the Iranian nation .
I strongly condemn such interference .
" American officials remarks about human rights and limitations on people are not acceptable because they have no idea about human rights after what they have done in Afghanistan and Iran and other parts of the world .
We do not need advice over human rights from them . "
" It 's a wrong impression that by using street protests as a pressure tool , they can compel officials to accept their illegal demands .
This would be the start of a dictatorship . "
" Iran 's laws do not allow vote - rigging ...
With these laws , how could it be possible to have such vote - rigging . "

Drug deals are made around him .
A man screams at his girlfriend .
The stench of the place is overwhelming .
Kenneth Chancey , 17 , is a homeless honors student who hopes to eventually attend Harvard University .
Chancey keeps his head down and tries to tune it out .
" It 's kind of horrible , " he says , as he escorts his 14 - year - old sister , Stephanie , through it all .
But Chancey is on another journey too , one that not many of his friends know about .
An honors student and star football player , he hopes to go from being homeless to becoming a Harvard grad .
" I would love to be able to say that I graduated from Harvard University with a Ph.D. in medicine and be able to share my story , " he says .
" I have to dream because obviously my reality is horrible . "

It 's a tough existence .
But one better than when he was in sixth grade , when he says he lived in a van with his mother and stepfather .
His mom did drugs in front of him and , he says , his stepfather would hit him .
His father , Gordon Costello , says he 's proud of his son for emerging as a leader , despite everything that 's been thrown at him .
" It 's a real learning experience , because he never wants to see himself in this position .
So I think it benefits him in a great way , " Costello says .
" It 's not necessarily the lesson I would have wanted to give to him ... [ but ] I am proud of him . "
He adds that it took a lot of getting used to a shelter .
" They hated it , " he says .
" But they somehow managed to adjust and we just decided to make the best of it . "
Alma Flores , one of his teachers , says Chancey has a dynamic personality that attracts students to him .
" He 's good in athletics .
He 's good in academics .
He 's good at getting people to get involved , " Flores says .
Chancey does n't hold back .
He showed students a PowerPoint presentation of his life and told them they should strive to do great things --
" If I can do it and I 'm in this [ situation ] , then you can do it , " he says .
He 's in the process of applying to Harvard .
He hopes to eventually become a doctor .
He knows he can't afford its $ 50,000 - plus - a - year tuition , but he 's not going to let that keep him from dreaming .
" I know that I 'm better than Skid Row .
I know that I can accomplish something , " he says .
If he has children one day , he says , he hopes it 's a lesson to pass on to them .
" I would love to tell my kids that I graduated from the top school -- that ... if I can do it , you can do it . "

There is an epidemic of bankruptcies : Circuit City , Sharper Image , Goody's , Gottschalk's , Comp USA , Levitz Furniture , Chrysler , GM .
Not to mention all the local businesses that do n't make the news when they close up shop .
And the rash of corporate bustouts is far from over according to consulting firm Bain & Company , who predicts nearly 100 large ( $ 100 million or more in assets ) corporate bankruptcies by next year .
We 're in a period of severe losses — a cluster of errors , as Murray Rothbard described it — with thirty - seven banks having failed already this year , and many more to come .
But as gruesome as the economic news sounds , Rothbard explained that this is the recovery .
The liquidation of unsound businesses , the " idle capacity " of the malinvested plant , and the " frictional " unemployment of original factors that must suddenly and en masse shift to lower stages of production — these are the chief hallmarks of the depression stage .
Many would like the boom to continue " where the inflationary gains are visible and the losses hidden and obscure , " Rothbard wrote .
" This boom euphoria is heightened by the capital consumption that inflation promotes through illusory accounting profits . "
But the boom is where the trouble happens — when resources are directed into malinvestments and distortions occur — and trouble we 've had this past decade with a Capital T .
The M - 2 money supply increased 53 % since year 2001 , while at the same time total bank loans doubled and bank real - estate loans increased over 150 % .
The mistakes of bad entrepreneurs have been hidden , employment was directed to wasteful and unneeded occupations , unsound projects were built and business risk was ignored .
" The boom produces impoverishment , " wrote Ludwig von Mises in Human Action .
But still more disastrous are the moral ravages .
It makes people despondent and dispirited .
The more optimistic they were under the illusory prosperity of the boom , the greater is their despair and their feeling of frustration .
The individual is always ready to ascribe his good luck to his own efficiency and to take it as a well - deserved reward for his talent , application and probity .
But reverses of fortune he always charges to other people , and most of all to the absurdity of social and political institutions .
He does not blame the authorities for having fostered the boom .
He reviles them for the inevitable collapse .
Many bankers continue to contend that their banks are sound , protesting that they did n't make any subprime loans like those big Wall Street banks .
But the cluster of errors does n't contain itself to one asset .
Houses do n't suddenly appear .
First , land is purchased .
Then that land must be entitled — permission from local government must be obtained to build what the owner wants on the property .
This is a lengthy process than can in the best case take months and in the worst cases take decades .
Infrastructure improvements are then made and finally houses can be constructed .
So , low interest rates spur consumers and investors to buy houses — in some cases creating housing shortages and exploding prices , which , in turn , cause developers to buy land and begin the lengthy development process just described .
After money supply increases by way of credit expansion , businesses malinvest by " overinvesting in higher - stage and durable production processes , " Rothbard explained in Man , Economy and State .
Real - estate developers by and large use debt financing every step of the way from when they buy the land to when they start construction .
In the past , banks traditionally shied away from making land loans .
But as the market overheated , more and more banks got in the land - loan business .
Land lending is inherently risky because land does n't produce income and gaining government approvals in a timely manner is often problematic : land is many months from being converted to a use that is salable to the typical consumer .
Lending for the construction is the least risky , but still the homes must be sold to pay off the loan .
Guaranty Bank of Austin recently demolished 16 new and partially built homes in Victorville , California .
The cost of finishing the development exceeded what they could sell the homes for despite four of the homes already being complete .
In early 2008 , these homes were selling for $ 280,000 to $ 350,000 in the bedroom community 50 miles from LA .
The Victorville demolition is one of the most dramatic ends to a bad bet made during the housing boom , but abandoned developments have become an all - too - common sight in California .
Nearly 250 residential developments totaling 9,389 homes have been halted across the state , according to one research firm .
And the residential meltdown is nowhere close to being over .
There is reportedly a million - house overhang in the market nationwide .
But misguided attempts by government are keeping home prices from correcting to affordable levels .
" If an investor could purchase a home and rent it out for close to breakeven , " real - estate broker Mike Morgan writes in Barron 's , " we might be getting close to the bottom .
But we are nowhere close to that level in most critical markets . "
Morgan points to a California program that offers a $ 10,000 tax credit for buyers of new homes .
Thus , encouraging the building of redundant houses , at the same time homes are being bulldozed in Victorville .
The annual sales pace is 300,000 homes , yet 500,000 new homes are being started that will just add to a bloated inventory .
" All of this government intervention will only spawn new malinvestments and later depressions . "
What Morgan calls the back half of the residential - real - estate hurricane will destroy bank balance sheets .
" Our experience with banks ' selling REOs is they realize about 50 % — 75 % of what they initially think they will get , " explains Morgan .
But the current crisis does n't end with residential real estate .
Commercial - real - estate developers follow roof tops .
When they see homes being built , they forecast that those homeowners will need places to shop and places to work — so the residential - construction boom inevitably leads to a commercial - property boom : office and industrial buildings as well as shopping centers .
All those new homeowners will need to buy everything from groceries to garden hoses .
Plus , new title company , mortgage loan , construction , and other real - estate - dependent jobs are created , meaning more office and industrial space will be required .
And lenders were there to embrace their developer customers ' dreams and supply the credit .
Commercial mortgages and construction loans exploded in the boom years .
" Tiny cap rates , feckless lending and willful ignorance were par for the course in those years when the market could hardly seem to walk a straight line , " writes Grant 's Interest Rate Observer .
But with the finding of new tenants difficult and the rash of bankruptcies of current renters , commercial - property values are plunging .
The Moody 's / REAL Commercial Property Price Index has fallen over 21 percent since it peaked in October 2007 .
And the folks at Deutsche Bank see price declines of 35 to 45 percent and maybe more in commercial property , due to the large number of loans coming due between now and 2012 that will not be able to be refinanced .
Not only are loan delinquency rates up and rents down , but the go - go years of aggressive loan underwriting are gone .
The interest - only , high - loan - to - value - ratio loans that drove capitalization ( cap ) rates to the five percent range are history .
Property buyers who are required to put more money down will offer significantly less for the same net operating income to achieve the required return on investment .
" Volume [ of real - estate transactions ] in the Americas has fallen hardest with the first quarter 2009 sales down 84 % year - over - year and 56 % from the fourth quarter of 2008 , " according to REAL Capital Analytics .
This spells further trouble for the small community banks that make up just 28 % of the banking industry 's total assets but are responsible for about 60 % of the nation 's commercial - real - estate lending .
So while many bankers contend their institutions are sound , bank attorney Gerald Blanchard told US Banker , " Across the U.S. right now there are still a fair number of community and regional banks with significant problems . "
" There are banks in the sunbelt and other areas sitting on developed lots — lots that have been bulldozed , wired , and paved but not built on — worth 15 to 20 cents on the dollar , " Blanchard says .
" Those institutions with heavy investments are suffering big losses and big hits to capital .
So yes , we will continue to see failures . "
Blanchard went on to say that newer banks will not be lending to builders and depending on brokered deposits to grow their banks , as they did in the boom .
A contraction of credit and liquidation of assets is exactly what would complete this recovery .
Failing real - estate prices , business failures , and high unemployment signal that the economy is desperately trying to heal but the Fed is fighting valiantly to re-inflate , increasing its balance sheet 140 % just to generate a 14 % increase in the M - 1 money supply .
The folks at Grant 's estimate the federal response to the current downturn to be 12 greater than that to the Great Depression , which prolonged that recovery for a decade .
However , all of this government intervention will only spawn new malinvestments and later depressions .
" It should be clear that any governmental interference with the depression process can only prolong it , " explained Rothbard " thus making things worse from almost everyone 's point of view . "
Further delay of the readjustments will only lengthen the depression , postponing complete recovery indefinitely .
" The larger the scope of malinvestment and error in the boom , " predicted Rothbard , " the greater and longer the task of readjustment in the depression . "
Government intervention on all levels guarantees that this will be a very long , bumpy recovery .

Obesity cuts the chances of getting pregnant Obese women who lose even a small amount of weight may boost their chances of getting pregnant , a study suggests .
Researchers carried out a three - month study of 40 obese women who were not ovulating .
They found a 5 % loss in body weight was linked with a 19 % increase in blood flow to the womb .
Improved circulation can help trigger the egg release from the ovaries and may help an embryo implant in the womb .
However , the researchers from the University of Sheffield said more work was needed to determine how the finding translates to actual pregnancy rates .
IVF on the NHS is restricted to those with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 30 or under and the British Fertility Society recommends a cut off of 35 because of the risks to both mother and baby .
Women in the study , most of whom had polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , were around 29 years old on average and had a body mass index of almost 40 , delegates at the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology ( ESHRE ) heard .
They were prescribed weight loss drugs orlistat or metformin and managed to lose 5 % of their body weight in 12 weeks .
Previous work by the team had shown small amounts of weight loss were related to a 30 - 40 % chance of ovulation returning in these patients .
But this is the first study looking at how blood flow is involved .
The researchers said that the increased blood flow acted as a " switch " to kick start the ovary .
Levels of the male hormone testosterone - high concentrations of which are found in PCOS patients - also fell as blood flow improved , which would also boost a woman 's chances of conceiving naturally .
The findings also raise the possibility for looking into whether a drug that improves the flow of blood to the womb could help women get pregnant .
Women with PCOS , which is one of the most common causes of infertility , tend to put on weight because of their condition and struggle more than other women to lose it through diet and exercise .
' Modest target ' Professor Bill Ledger , from the University of Sheffield , said asking women to lose 5 - 10 % was a " modest target " .
" The message for women with PCOS is do n't think you have to lose half your body weight .
" This could also encourage moderately overweight women to lose 5 - 10 % . "
Dr Daghni Rajasingam , spokeswoman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said the findings were interesting but the key was whether the improved blood flow ended up with a successful pregnancy .
She stressed that infertility was just one of problems which obese women who wanted a child faced .
Even if they succeeded in getting pregnant , their risk of complications was much higher , and their chances of getting to full term lower .
She said : " Being as close as possible to your ideal body weight would be a good thing for all aspects of pregnancy . "

A transparent thin film barrier used to protect flat panel TVs from moisture could become the basis for flexible solar panels that would be installed on roofs like shingles .
The flexible rooftop solar panels - called building - integrated photovoltaics , or BIPVs - could replace today 's boxy solar panels that are made with rigid glass or silicon and mounted on thick metal frames .
The flexible solar shingles would be less expensive to install than current panels and made to last 25 years .
" There 's a lot of wasted space on rooftops that could actually be used to generate power , " said Mark Gross , a senior scientist at the Department of Energy 's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory .
" Flexible solar panels could easily become integrated into the architecture of commercial buildings and homes .
Solar panels have had limited success because they 've been difficult and expensive to install . "
Researchers at PNNL will create these flexible panels by adapting a film encapsulation process currently used to coat flat panel displays that use organic light - emitting diodes , or OLEDs .
The work is made possible by a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement recently penned between Vitex Systems and Battelle , which operates PNNL for the federal government .
PNNL researchers developed the thin film technology in the 1990s .
At the time , the lab 's team investigated 15 possible applications , including solar power .
Vitex licensed the technology from Battelle in 2000 and focused its initial efforts on developing the ultra - barrier films for flat - panel displays .
Now PNNL and Vitex are taking a hard second look at solar power .
The encapsulation process and the ultra - barrier film - called Barix™ Encapsulation and Barix™ Barrier Film , respectively - are already proven and effective moisture barriers .
But researchers need to find a way to apply the technology to solar panels that are made with copper indium gallium selenide , called CIGS , or cadmium telluride , called CdTe .
Under the agreement , researchers will create low - cost flexible barrier films and evaluate substrate materials for solar panels , which are also called photovoltaics , or PVs .
Both the film and substrate must be able to survive harsh ultraviolet rays and natural elements like rain and hail for 25 years .
The agreement also calls for researchers to develop a manufacturing process for the flexible panels that can be readily adapted to large - scale production .
If successful , this process will reduce solar panel manufacturing costs to less than $ 1 per watt of power , which would be competitive with the 10 cents per kilowatt - hour that a utility would charge .
" Vitex is proud to continue its long , successful relationship with PNNL , " said Martin Rosenblum , Vitex 's vice president of operations and engineering .
" Vitex is excited to further its Barix ™ technology 's proven barrier performance for photovoltaics toward mass manufacturing .
Together , we look forward to creating a product that will help alleviate America 's dependence on foreign oil and increase America 's access to an abundant renewable energy source - the sun . "
Battelle , which is the majority shareholder of Vitex , is optimistic that this research agreement will contribute to a new way of generating solar power .
Battelle recently increased its investment in Vitex for new state - of - the - art thin film encapsulation equipment and expanded its intellectual property portfolio .
" We 're confident that Vitex will be uniquely positioned to help meet the demand for flexible solar panels , OLED displays and lighting that should rise along with the economy , " said Martin Inglis , Battelle 's chief financial officer .
PNNL 's research efforts will be paid for with up to $ 350,000 from the DOE 's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technology Commercialization Fund .
Last year , DOE announced that up to $ 1.5 million from the fund would be available to PNNL for projects that help commercialize technologies that reduce energy use or tap renewable energy sources .
Because the fund requires commercial partners to match funding , Vitex will provide up to $ 350,900 of in - kind labor , equipment and materials for this project .
Environmentalists do n’t dispute that many if not all of the environmental problems — from climate change to species loss to overzealous resource extraction — are either caused or exacerbated by population growth .
“ Trends such as the loss of half of the planet ’s forests , the depletion of most of its major fisheries , and the alteration of its atmosphere and climate are closely related to the fact that human population expanded from mere millions in prehistoric times to over six billion today , ” says Robert Engelman of Population Action International .
Although the global rate of human population growth peaked around 1963 , the number of people living on Earth — and sharing finite resources like water and food — has grown by more than two - thirds since then , topping out at over seven and a half billion today , and human population is expected to exceed nine billion by 2050 .
With more people coming , how is this going to affect the environment further ?
Population Growth Causes Multiple Environmental Problems
According to Population Connection , population growth since 1950 is behind the clearing of 80 percent of rainforests , the loss of tens of thousands of plant and wildlife species , an increase in greenhouse gas emissions of some 400 percent , and the development or commercialization of as much as half of the Earth ’s surface land .
The group fears that in the coming decades half of the world ’s population will be exposed to " water - stress " or “ water - scarce ” conditions , which are expected to “ intensify difficulties in meeting ... consumption levels , and wreak devastating effects on our delicately balanced ecosystems . ”
In less developed countries , lack of access to birth control , as well as cultural traditions that encourage women to stay home and have babies , lead to rapid population growth .
The result is ever - increasing numbers of poor people across Africa , the Middle East , Southeast Asia , and elsewhere who suffer from malnourishment , lack of clean water , overcrowding , inadequate shelter , and AIDS and other diseases .
And while population numbers in most developed nations are leveling off or diminishing today , high levels of consumption make for a huge drain on resources .
Americans , for instance , who represent only four percent of the world population , consume 25 percent of all resources .
Industrialized countries also contribute far more to climate change , ozone depletion , and overfishing than developing countries .
And as more and more residents of developing countries get access to Western media , or immigrate to the United States , they want to emulate the consumption - heavy lifestyles they see on their televisions and read about on the Internet .
How Changing U.S. Policy Could Offset Environmental Harm Worldwide
Given the overlap of population growth and environmental problems , many would like to see a change in U.S. policy on global family planning .
In 2001 , President George W. Bush instituted what some call the “ global gag rule , ” whereby foreign organizations that provide or endorse abortions were denied U.S. funding support .
Environmentalists considered that stance to be shortsighted because support for family planning is the most effective way to check population growth and relieve pressure on the planet ’s environment , and as a result , the global gag rule was rescinded in 2009 by President Obama but put back in place by Donald Trump in 2017 .
If only the United States would lead by example by cutting down on consuming , reducing deforestation practices , and relying more on renewable resources in our policies and practices , perhaps the rest of the world would follow suit — or , in some cases , lead the way and the U.S. follow — to ensure a better future for the planet .

Frozen deposits of energy - rich clathrates could make the Siberian permafrost the new Gulf ( Image : Steven Kazlowski / Science Faction / Corbis )
Burning methane trapped in ice could answer the world ’s energy problems ( Image : Blickwinkel / Alamy )
DEEP in the Arctic Circle , in the Messoyakha gas field of western Siberia , lies a mystery .
Back in 1970 , Russian engineers began pumping natural gas from beneath the permafrost and piping it east across the tundra to the Norilsk metal smelter , the biggest industrial enterprise in the Arctic .
By the late 70s , they were on the brink of winding down the operation .
According to their surveys , they had sapped nearly all the methane from the deposit .
But despite their estimates , the gas just kept on coming .
The field continues to power Norilsk today .
Where is this methane coming from ?
The Soviet geologists initially thought it was leaking from another deposit hidden beneath the first .
But their experiments revealed the opposite – the mystery methane is seeping into the well from the icy permafrost above .
If unintentionally , what they had achieved was the first , and so far only , successful exploitation of methane clathrate .
Made of molecules of methane trapped within ice crystals , this stuff looks like dirty ice and has the consistency of sorbet .
Touch it with a lit match , though , and it bursts into flames .
Clathrates are rapidly gaining favour as an answer to the energy crisis .
Burning methane emits only half as much carbon dioxide as burning coal , and many countries are seeing clathrates as a quick and easy way of reducing carbon emissions .
Others question whether that is wise , and are worried that extracting clathrates at all could have …

net have devised some sort of box puzzle that they thought you 'd enjoy .
Let me clear this up right now :
They are incorrect in this thinking .
I have stared at this blasted thing all morning and I can't make heads or tails of it .
This is the problem with today 's youth , if you ask me .
Spending all their time devising clever boxy word puzzles instead of doing something constructive , like pushups , or jumping on a live grenade , or sitting in a foxhole cradling a man in your arms and watching the blood run out of him and the life drain from his eyes , or sit-ups .
At any rate , here 's the puzzle .
There are only twenty - odd letters in the alphabet , so presumably it 's just trial and error picking which ones go where .
When you 're finished , why not celebrate with some pushups ?

Recently on The Factor Bill O’Reilly made the false claim that only Anderson Cooper of CNN covered the story of the murder of Army recruiter William Long .
Today , on CNN Rick Sanchez absolutely blasted O’Reilly by showing clips of all the reports CNN did of the story .
Sanchez ripped O’Reilly a new one .
Check out the video .
Here is the video of O’Reilly ’s claim :
Here is the video of Rick Sanchez Blasting O’Reilly on CNN :

Sanchez said , “ Let ’s add this up together now .
We led with the story when it broke .
We led with it again the next day .
We analyzed the terrorism angle with experts , and called former FBI agents to take us through it , and as a network we covered the story umpteen times throughout the days , throughout all hours of the days , but Bill O’Reilly says he only saw it once , and since he only saw it once , well then , that must be the truth .
It does n’t matter what really happened .
It does n’t matter what the record shows , all that matters is what Bill thinks he saw . ”
That was an ass kicking by Rick Sanchez .
Unlike Olbermann , who mocks and rants against O’Reilly , Sanchez spent almost five minutes and used video evidence to prove that O’Reilly was lying .
Sanchez is correct .
Reality does n’t matter to O’Reilly .
He lives in his own little world , where he invents the truth .
His claim that the networks ignored the military recruiter shooting was a bogus attempt to distance himself from his rants against Dr. George Tiller .
Good for Sanchez , for using facts to separate truth from reality .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama 's speech to the Muslim world on Thursday faced mixed reaction abroad -- and a very clear directive at home from Republicans and conservatives : The United States cannot ruin its relationship with Israel .
President Obama delivered a major speech to the Muslim world Thursday in Cairo , Egypt .
Speaking in Cairo , Egypt , the president took on the heated and controversial Palestinian - Israeli conflict by reaffirming that the U.S. favors a two - state solution and urging compromise between " two peoples with legitimate aspirations . "
The United States , he said , " does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements . "
Those Jewish settlements are spread throughout the Palestinian - controlled West Bank .
Israel maintains the settlements are needed , while Palestinians say they are an obstacle to the peace process .
Calling America's " strong bond " with Israel " unbreakable , " he said , " It is based upon cultural and historical ties and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied . "
Watch Obama discuss Israel »
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , speaking to the Knesset Foreign Affairs Committee on Monday , said that a freeze of settlement activity is not reasonable .
Read about reaction in the Middle East
In his speech Thursday , Obama noted the aspirations and grievances of both sides and cautioned , " But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other , then we will be blind to the truth . "
He exhorted Palestinians that " resistance through violence and killing is wrong and it does not succeed . "
House Minority Leader John Boehner blasted Obama 's approach to the Israeli - Palestinian question .
" He seemed to ... place equal blame on the Israelis and the Palestinians .
I have concerns about this , " the Ohio Republican said .
" The Israelis have the right to defend themselves . "
Boehner 's Republican colleague , Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana , added that " there was a sense in here of a moral equivalency between those who are driving for a Palestinian state and the state of Israel . "
Pence said the president should not be asking Israel to make another concession , but instead , " call on the Palestinians and their supporters across the Arab world to begin to see real concessions within the Palestinian movement .
... a real effort to defang Hamas , to disarm terrorists . "
Obama said that the controversial Hamas movement -- which controls Gaza , near Egypt , and has significant support among Palestinians -- must end violence and recognize past agreements .
Marc Thiessen , a former Bush administration speechwriter , noted that Obama " announced a major shift in U.S. policy in the Holy Land . "
" In 2002 , President Bush declared in his Rose Garden address that America would only engage ' Palestinian leaders not compromised by terror , ' " Thiessen wrote on National Review Online .
" In Cairo today , Obama reversed this policy ...
This is naïve and dangerous . "
Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ed Rollins said Obama may have further soured relations with Israel .
Watch more of Obama 's speech in Egypt »
" I think the key thing here that he has to worry about is that he clearly drew the line and set some standards that the Israelis may not go along with , " he said .
But another concern on the radar came this week from former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- an often - talked - about 2012 GOP presidential candidate .
Romney said that Obama needs to stop using foreign soil to apologize for U.S. relations , in what he calls a " tour of apology . "
Romney took aim at Obama 's plans to trim the missile defense budget a " grave miscalculation " that puts the nation at risk in the face of urgent threats like Iran and North Korea 's nuclear ambitions .
Obama reiterated Thursday his desire to move forward with Iran on many issues , but said when it comes to nuclear weapons , " we have reached a decisive point . "
" This is not simply about America 's interests .
It is about preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that could lead this region and the world down a hugely dangerous path , " he said .
Any nation , including Iran , " should have the right to access peaceful nuclear power if it complies with its responsibilities under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , " the president added .
Other Republican opponents , meanwhile , decry Obama for seemingly apologizing for U.S. foreign policy in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Speaking to a mostly Muslim crowd , Obama said the United States entered Afghanistan by " necessity " and not " choice , " he countered the stances of some who " question or justify the events of 9/11 . "
He addressed the conflict in Iraq , calling it , unlike Afghanistan , " a war of choice that provoked strong differences in my country and around the world . "
" Although I believe that the Iraqi people are ultimately better off without the tyranny of Saddam Hussein , I also believe that events in Iraq have reminded America of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible , " he said .
Thiessen was sharply critical of Obama on that point .
" He made no mention of democracy in discussing Afghanistan .
He made no mention of democracy in discussing Iraq .
He made no mention of the advance of freedom in the Middle East that has taken place in recent years , or any commitment to continue it , " he wrote .
" Indeed , he said Iraq was a ' war of choice ' but then said a moment later that Iraq is better off without Saddam Hussein .
Well , was it a good choice then ? " he said .
Then came the contentious issue of closing the Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , detention facility .
Speaking about prohibiting torture and the closing of Gitmo , Obama talked about working on " concrete actions to change course " and correct abuses in the war on terror .
" Just as America can never tolerate violence by extremists , we must never alter our principles .
9/11 was an enormous trauma to our country .
The fear and anger that it provoked was understandable , but in some cases , it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals , " he said .
But that 's one point of contention for Boehner -- along with Republicans and even some Democrats -- who do not want detainees on U.S. soil , and demand a clear plan going forward .
" When it comes to Guantanamo Bay , he again today made it clear he wants to close Guantanamo without having a plan in place for what to do with those detainees that are there , " Boehner said .
But not all conservatives were quick to blast Obama 's speech .
Andrew Sullivan , a conservative who supports many of Obama 's policies , said the speech touched on spiritual and human differences .
" At its heart , the speech sprang , it seemed to me , a spiritual conviction that human differences , if openly acknowledged , need not remain crippling , " he wrote on his TheAtlantic.com blog .
" It was a deeply Christian -- and not Christianist -- address ; seeking to lead by example and patience rather than seeking to impose from certainty . "
Thiessen , while mostly critical of what Obama had to say in his much - anticipated speech , did offer some reluctant praise .
" He took on the conspiracy theories about 9/11 ...
And he pointed out that al Qaeda has ' killed people of different faiths , more than any other , they have killed Muslims . '
All these are important points . "

When celebrities receive awards , they often express appreciation for the contributions of all the “ little people ” who made their success possible .
While this may seem like a back - handed acknowledgement , it is probably the most inclusive way to recognize people in the entertainment industry in which small stature and large headedness has reached pandemic proportions .
Today I am going to follow that lead , sans golden naked man statue , and give a shout out to one of my most successful “ little programs . ”
Introducing cmd2clip.exe
Although the details are a little fuzzy , I wrote cmd2clip and began using it around 1996 and have used it on a daily basis for over a decade .
It does one very simple , but incredibly useful thing .
It copies whatever is passed to it on the command line to the Windows clipboard .
Here is the original ( VB ) source code in all its diminutive glory :
Public Sub Main ( ) Clipboard .
Clear Clipboard .
SetText Command$ End Sub
What it does
While it may not immediately seem all that useful , context is everything .
This program is intended to live in the C : \Documents and Settings \yourpofile \SendTo\ directory which adds it to the “ Send To ” shortcut menu in explorer that is displayed when you right - click on an object in explorer .
This provides a quick way to copy the full path to a file or directory onto the clipboard making it easy to e-mail a path to someone or insert it into a configuration file , even if it is at the end of a long path .
The Update
In the years since I originally wrote this in VB4 , I ’ve only had to update it once .
In exchange for around 30 extra lines including white - space and comments , I modified the utility to provide better formatted output when selecting multiple objects or those with spaces in the path .
Public Sub Main ( )
' The SendTo command will pass in the following on the command line : ' - If multiple files are selected , they are space delimited ' - If there is a space in the path of a file it is enclosed in quotation marks .
Const DelimiterBetweenFilenames As String = vbCrLf Dim FileNames As String Dim EvalCharOffset As Long Dim EvalChar As String Dim AreQuotesOpen As Boolean : AreQuotesOpen = False For EvalCharOffset = 1 To Len( Command$ ) EvalChar = Mid( Command$ , EvalCharOffset , 1 ) If EvalChar = " " " "
Then ' Do n't append quotes to output , just toggle the AreQuotesOpen status AreQuotesOpen = Not AreQuotesOpen Else If ( EvalChar = " " )
And ( Not AreQuotesOpen )
Then ' A space outside of quotes indicates the start of a new path , add a delimiter FileNames = FileNames & DelimiterBetweenFilenames Else FileNames = FileNames & EvalChar End If End If Next EvalCharOffset Clipboard .
Clear Clipboard .
SetText FileNames End Sub
What ’s Next
Although I ’d love to get the line - count back down using the pre-tokenized args parameter provided in the Main ( ) method for both C# and VB .
NET , I doubt I ’ll bother updating unless I dream up some new functionality that I need that wo n’t drive up the complexity considerably .
The most likely candidate is to detect when the path contains a locally mapped path and convert it to its canonical format to make it more appropriate for e-mailing to someone else .
For example , changing X:\myfile.xml to \\myserver\fileshare\myfile.xml .
Why I am proud of this little utility
Admittedly , this hardly qualifies as code golf , and there is absolutely no major technical accomplishment demonstrated by this widget .
There is just something about the combination of brevity and utility of this app that makes me feel good about it .
I suppose it appeals to my notion that less is more , at least to the point where you start obfuscating more than simplifying .
I believe that SLOC metrics should work like golf scores , the lower the better .
How about you ?
I ’d love to hear about your mighty - mouse apps .
Feel free to brag about them in the comments .

The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland /27
by Michele Simionato
June 17 , 2009
Summary
In the last dozen episodes I have defined plenty of macros , but I have not really explained what macros are and how they work .
This episode closes the gap : it explains the true meaning of Scheme macros by introducing the concepts of syntax object and of transformer over syntax objects .
Advertisement
Syntax objects
Scheme macros - as standardized in the R6RS document - are built over the concept of syntax object .
The concept is peculiar to Scheme and has no counterpart in other languages ( including Common Lisp ) , therefore it is worth to spend some time on it .
A syntax - object is a kind of enhanced s-expression : it contains the source code as a list of symbols and primitive values , but also additional informations , such as the name of the file containing the source code , the position of the syntax object in the file , a set of marks to distinguish identifiers according to their lexical context , and more .
The easiest way to get a syntax object is to use the syntax quoting operation , i.e. the syntax ( # ' ) symbol you have seen in all the macros I have defined until now .
Consider for instance the following script , which displays the string representation of the syntax object # ' 1 :
$ cat x.ss ( import ( rnrs ) ) ( display # '1 )
If you run it under PLT Scheme you will get
$ plt-r6rs x.ss #< syntax:/home/micheles/Dropbox/gcode/artima/scheme/x.ss:2:11 >
In other words , the string representation of the syntax object # '1 contains the full pathname of the script and the line number / column number where the syntax object appears in the source code .
Clearly this information is pretty useful for tools like IDEs and debuggers .
The internal implementation of syntax objects is not standardized at all , so that you get different informations in different implementations .
For instance Ikarus gives
$ ikarus -- r6rs - script x.ss # < syntax 1 [ char 28 of x.ss ] >
i.e. in Ikarus syntax objects do not store line numbers , they just store the character position from the beginning of the file .
If you are using the REPL you will have less information , of course , and even more implementation - dependency .
Here are a few example of syntax objects obtained from syntax quoting :
> #'x ; convert a name into an identifier # < syntax x > > #''x ; convert a literal symbol # < syntax ' x > > #' 1 ; convert a literal number # < syntax 1 > > # ' " s " ; convert a literal string #< syntax " s " > > #'' ( 1 " a " ' b ) ; convert a literal data structure #< syntax ' ( 1 " a " 'b ) >
Here I am running all my examples under Ikarus ; your Scheme system may have a slightly different output representation for syntax objects .
In general # ' can be " applied " to any expression :
> ( define syntax - expr #'( display " hello " ) ) > syntax - expr #<syntax ( display " hello " ) >
It is possible to extract the s-expression underlying the syntax object with the syntax -> datum primitive :
> ( equal ? ( syntax -> datum syntax - expr ) '( display " hello " ) ) #t
Different syntax - objects can be equivalent : for instance the improper list of syntax objects ( cons #'display ( cons # '" hello " #'( ) ) ) is equivalent to the syntax object #'( display " hello " ) in the sense that both corresponds to the same datum :
> ( equal ?
( syntax - > datum ( cons #'display ( cons # '" hello " #'( ) ) ) ) ( syntax -> datum #'( display " hello " ) ) ) #t
The ( syntax ) macro is analogous to the ( quote ) macro .
Mreover , there is a quasisyntax macro denoted with #` which is analogous to the quasiquote macro ( ` ) .
In analogy to the operations comma ( , ) and comma-splice ( , @ ) on regular lists , there are two operations unsyntax # , ( sharp comma ) e unsyntax - splicing # , @ ( sharp comma splice ) on lists and improper lists of syntax objects .
Here is an example using sharp - comma :
> ( let ( ( user " michele " ) ) # `( display # ,user ) ) ( #< syntax display > " michele " . #< syntax ( ) >)
Here is an example using sharp - comma - splice :
> ( define users ( list # '" michele " #'" mario " ) ) > # `( display ( list # , @users ) ) ( #< syntax display > ( #< syntax list > #< syntax " michele " > #< syntax " mario " > ) . #< syntax ( ) >)
Notice that the output - in Ikarus - is an improper list .
This is somewhat consistent with the behavior of usual quoting : for usual quoting ' ( a b c ) is a shortcut for ( cons* ' a 'b 'c '( ) ) , which is a proper list , and for syntax - quoting #'( a b c ) is equivalent to ( cons* #'a #'b #'c # '( ) ) , which is an improper list .
The cons* operator here is a R6RS shortcut for nested conses : ( cons * w x y z ) is the same as ( cons w ( cons x ( cons y z ) ) ) .
However , the result of a quasi quote interpolation is very much implementation - dependent : Ikarus returns an improper list , but other implementations returns different results ; for instance Ypsilon returns a proper list of syntax objects whereas PLT Scheme returns an atomic syntax object .
The lesson here is that you cannot rely on properties of the inner representation of syntax objects : what matters is the code they correspond to , i.e. the result of syntax -> datum .
It is possible to promote a datum to a syntax object with the datum -> syntax procedure , but in order to do so you need to provide a lexical context , which can be specified by using an identifier :
> ( datum - > syntax #' dummy - context '( display " hello " ) ) #< syntax ( display " hello " )
( the meaning of the lexical context in datum - > syntax is tricky and I will go back to that in a future episode ) .
What syntax - match really is syntax - match is a general utility to perform pattern matching on syntax objects ; it takes a syntax object in output and returns a syntax object in output .
Here is an example of a simple transformer based on syntax - match : > ( define transformer ( syntax - match ( ) ( sub ( name . args ) #' name ) ) ) ; return the name as a syntax object > ( transformer #'( a 1 2 3 ) ) #< syntax a >
For convenience , syntax - match also accepts a second syntax ( syntax - match x ( lit ... ) clause ... ) to match syntax expressions directly .
This is more convenient than writing ( ( syntax - match ( lit ... ) clause ... ) x ) .
Here is a simple example : > ( syntax - match #'( a 1 2 3 ) ( ) ( sub ( name . args ) #'args ) ) ; return the args as a syntax object #< syntax ( 1 2 3 ) >
Here is an example using quasisyntax and unsyntax - splicing : > ( syntax - match #'( a 1 2 3 ) ( ) ( sub ( name . args ) # `( name # , @#'args ) ) ) ( #< syntax a > #< syntax 1 > #< syntax 2 > #< syntax 3 >) As you see , it easy to write hieroglyphs if you use quasisyntax and unsyntax - splicing .
You can avoid that by means of the with - syntax form : > ( syntax - match #'( a 1 2 3 ) ( ) ( sub ( name . args ) ( with - syntax ( ( ( a ... ) # 'args ) ) #'( name a ... ) ) ) ) ( # < syntax a > #< syntax 1 > #< syntax 2 > #< syntax 3 >) The pattern variables introduced by with - syntax are automatically expanded inside the syntax template , without need to resort to the quasisyntax notation ( i.e. there is no need for #` # , # , @ ) .
What macros really are Macros are in one - to - one correspondence with syntax transformers , i.e. every macro is associated to a transformer which converts a syntax object ( the macro and its arguments ) into another syntax object ( the expansion of the macro ) .
Scheme itself takes care of converting the input code into a syntax object ( if you wish , internally there is a datum -> syntax conversion ) and the output syntax object into code ( an internal syntax -> datum conversion ) .
Consider for instance a macro to apply a function to a ( single ) argument : ( def-syntax ( apply1 f a ) #'( f a ) )
This macro can be equivalently written as ( def- syntax apply1 ( syntax - match ( ) ( sub ( apply1 f a ) ( list #'f #' a ) ) ) )
The sharp - quoted syntax is more readable , but it hides the underlying list representation which in some cases is pretty useful .
This second form of the macro is more explicit , but still it relies on syntax - match .
It is possible to provide the same functionality without using syntax - match as follows : ( def- syntax apply1 ( lambda ( x ) ( let+ ( ( macro - name func arg ) ( syntax - > datum x ) ) ( datum - > syntax #' apply1 ( list func arg ) ) ) ) )
Here the macro transformer is explicitly written as a lambda function , and the pattern matching is performed by hand by converting the input syntax object into a list and by using the list destructuring form let + introduced in episode 15 .
At the end , the resulting list is converted back to a syntax object in the context of apply1 .
Here is an example of usage : > ( apply1 display " hey " ) hey sweet - macros provide a convenient feature : it is possible to extract the associated transformer for each macro defined via def-syntax .
For instance , here is the transformer associated to the apply1 macro : > ( define tr ( apply1 < transformer > ) ) > ( tr # '( apply1 display " hey " ) ) #< syntax ( display " hey " ) >
The ability to extract the underlying transformer is useful in certain situations , in particular when debugging .
It can also be exploited to define extensible macros , and I will come back to this point in the future .
A nicer syntax for association lists
The previous paragraphs were a little abstract and probably of unclear utility ( but what would you expect from an advanced macro tutorial ? ;) .
Now let me be more concrete .
My goal is to provide a nicer syntax for association lists ( an association list is just a non-empty list of non-empty lists ) by means of an alist macro expanding into an association list .
The macro accepts a variable number of arguments ; every argument is of the form ( name value ) or it is a single identifier : in this case latter case it must be magically converted into the form ( name value ) where value is the value of the identifier , assuming it is bound in the current scope , otherwise a run time error is raised " unbound identifier " .
If you try to pass an argument which is not of the expected form , a compile time syntax error must be raised .
In concrete , the macro works as follows : ( test " simple " ( let ( ( a 0 ) ) ( alist a ( b 1 ) ( c (* 2 b ) ) ) ) '( (a 0 ) ( b 1 ) ( c 2 ) ) ) ( test " with - error " ( catch - error ( alist a ) ) " unbound variable " )
Here is the implementation : ( def- syntax ( alist arg ... ) ( with - syntax ( ( ( ( name value ) ... ) ( map ( syntax - match ( ) ( sub n #'( n n ) ( identifier ? #'n ) ) ( sub ( n v ) #'( n v ) ( identifier ? #' n ) ) ) #'( arg ... ) ) ) ) #'( let* ( ( name value ) ... ) ( list ( list ' name name ) ... ) ) ) )
The expression #'( arg ... ) expands into a list of syntax objects which are then transformed by the syntax - match transformer , which converts identifiers of the form n into couples of the form ( n n ) , whereas it leaves couples ( n v ) unchanged , just checking that n is an identifier .
This is a typical use case for syntax - match as a list matcher inside a bigger macro .
We will see other use cases in the next Adventures .

It was the early 1990s and Frank was living the dream – unshaven , in pajama bottoms and his favorite hockey jersey , having just woken up at 12:18 PM , was now working in the dim light of his basement on one of his freelance projects .
Just as he was sipping a cup of coffee , the phone rang .
Frank tried fruitlessly to fight an unexpected open - mouthed yawn when he picked up the receiver .
" OOOOAAAaaahhhh ... hello ? "
" Hi , Frank .
We have a very exciting opportunity for a qualified individual like you .
Interested ? "
Odd that this caller had n't even identified what company he was with , Frank thought .
After sleepily getting some of the details , yeah , Frank was mildly interested , and he agreed to an interview in 30 minutes ... at a bagel shop that was 25 minutes away .
Ten minutes late and having not changed at all aside from putting on non-pajama pants and shoes , he was immediately flagged over by a man in a nice suit .
" You have the look like a computer genius , I already know you 're perfect for this , " he said without a hint of sarcasm .
He asked lots of vague questions about computers ; stuff like " So you know computers ?
What about , like , servers ? "
Frank had all the traits of a young man in IT – beyond his physical appearance , he was brash , overconfident , and narcissistic .
Throughout the brief interview , he did n't restrain any of these traits , but still , he was only vaguely interested in the position , so he winged all the questions .
Ten minutes later , the man pulled out a marker , wrote something on a napkin , and slid it across the table .
" That 's what your hourly rate would be . "
The man arched his eyebrow .
" Interested ? "
Frank was already pulling in some respectable bank , but this was more than twice what he was currently making .
Gears started turning in his brain while he mulled it over .
Well , I guess if I was to take this jo -" YES . "
On his way home from the interview , Frank picked up a razor , stopped for a haircut , and generally got himself kempt .
The Job
The day after the interview , he was sitting opposite the Executive Vice President of Data Processing , who was giving a second interview .
" Let 's say I asked you to consolidate twelve server facilities into one .
How would you do it ? "
Ahh , a riddle question , like " how would you move a mountain to the other side of a village ? "
" Well , " Frank started , winging his second interview in as many days , " I 'd take a systematic approach .
Figure out where everything was , how the different systems were integrated , how they communicate , and gradually migrate servers over . "
The Bank Boss was clearly impressed since Frank was given a contract on the spot ; no references or background checks .
And not just that , Frank was given keycard access to everything – all of the different datacenters and various facilities .
He did n't encounter anything his keycard did n't give him access to ( though he never tried the bank 's vault ) .
He was also given passwords to every sensitive system , including the money transfer system , responsible for transferring money in the range of around one trillion dollars every day .
It quickly became clear that the interview question was n't a hypothetical , and Frank was dealing with the impossible .
And maybe that 's why they hired him – he was an idealistic hard worker , a badass who could do anything .
What he lacked in experience then he'd make up for in tenacity .
At least that 's what Frank was having a harder and harder time reminding himself .
And for better or for worse , he 'd effectively be on his own .
As it turned out , his team and the man that hired him were electricians .
Back in those days , the bank ( and , more importantly , their union contract ) considered moving servers to be " electrical work " and , therefore , only union electrician companies were allowed to do it .
Or those that the electricians hired .
The Problem
In short , the bank had a dozen VAX datacenters that they wanted as a single cluster in a new building .
Everything communicated over DECnet , which was a network protocol not too dissimilar from TCP / IP .
One of the nice things about DECnet was the ability to route datagrams ( packets ) around the network in different ways to avoid failures , a fact which later proved to be useful .
The problem with the banks infrastructure was that either no one knew everything that was running in each datacenter , how it all worked , or how they 'd work together in a single facility .
Even worse , the people at the datacenters did n't want to talk to Frank , as the sooner Frank finished his job , the sooner they 'd lose theirs .
The visits to the various datacenters always left Frank in a worse mood .
All of them were in various states of disrepair – dirty , perhaps a flickering light , disorganized , but one stood above the others .
Its floor was almost completely torn up due to a major renovation project following an asbestos contamination .
All of the systems in this room were caked with dust , so much so that the labels were completely illegible .
Only one system had lights blinking on its network port ; so Frank brushed the dust off its label .
" VDL - 23 – Maintenance Test Box . "
Why does that sound so familiar ?
Earlier that morning , Frank had done some network analysis , and found that all redundant links between the Money Transfer System and the other datacenters ( aside from VDL - 23 ) had been down for quite a while .
Since DECnet routed around the failures and no one had thought to set - up network monitoring , no one had noticed that all of the other links had gone down .
And before Frank discovered it , no one knew ( or no one would tell him ) where the box was physically .
Immediately , Frank got cracking on a plan to bring the redundancy back online while keeping VDL - 23 up , thanking the stars that the architecture of DECnet prevented the network from going down with all of the other servers .
Still , something told him that the twisted , crushed , mistreated cables strewn across the floor might not remain reliable for transfers of $ 1T / day for long ...
His watch alarm went off before he finished , it was a reminder that he had a mandatory meeting for all staff involved in the migration – about two hundred people in total .
Frank rushed back to the main office , taking shortcuts using his everything - access keycard , and arriving just as the meeting was starting .
" Thank you all for coming , " the executive vice president said , voice quivering , with a sweaty brow .
" We 're required to migrate the network to TCP / IP by the communications standard director . "
Frank winced .
The VP of communications chimed in , equally nervous .
" Well ... it's DECnet ... it uses the non-routable LAT protocol .
I ... * ahem * we may need to push the deadline out ... "
The executive VP frowned , and asked for an update from the apps team .
The VP of Applications looked equally nervous , stammering out " we 're still gathering information on the applications ... and ... we 're not totally sure if we can actually run this all in one system ... "
In a hushed tone , the executive VP took the floor again .
" You 're telling me we 're going to miss our deadline .
The board is very firm about our deadline .
I 'm not happy . "
Frank craned his neck and looked around the room , everyone was staring at the floor .
This was his moment .
Once again feeling like a badass he rose from his seat dramatically , and in his most heroic voice , he boomed " There is a way . "
Success !
Three months later , a beautifully appointed datacenter hummed along , processing transfers and perfectly replicating all of the functionality from the former twelve separate datacenters .
Pristine rows of computers and neatly arranged drive controllers worked dutifully , everything in perfect order .
The board came through the datacenter to inspect the work , and left with no complaints .
It had been completed on schedule and was looking great , everyone was happy .
Under the raised floor , the tangle of cables told the real story .
What was really in that room was the original twelve datacenters , all of the systems sitting pretty on the raised floor , underneath which were piles of cables connected exactly the same way they 'd always been connected , and with back - hauled communication lines running between the systems .
As they say , out with the old , in with the old .
And off in one corner , on upgraded hardware , was VDL - 23 ; still responsible for routing all of the money transfer traffic , now safely sitting in a datacenter where it would remain unperturbed .
Footage of burning cars , masked boys and bloodied protesters in Iran is playing across the Middle East , captivating Arab countries where repressive regimes have for years been arresting political bloggers and cyberspace dissidents .
Egypt , Saudi Arabia and other Sunni nations have tense relations with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the Shiite - led theocracy ruling Iran .
But they do n’t want protests in Tehran to inspire similar democratic fervor in their countries -- especially the merging of Facebook and Twitter with a potent opposition leader like Iran ’s presidential challenger , Mir-Hossein Mousavi .
So far , that has yet to happen .
Egyptian activists , for example , have called for rallies and strikes on Internet social networks over the last year , but they have no galvanizing personality and are too disorganized to pose a threat to the police state controlled by President Hosni Mubarak .
“ I do n’t think similar events could even take place in Egypt or other Arab countries , ” said Ibrahim Issa , editor of the Cairo independent newspaper Al Dustour , who has been arrested a number of times for criticizing the Mubarak government .
“ We hope and we always keep faith that what ’s happening in Iran could push Arabs to try and do the same against their oppressive regimes .
But reality tells us that this is not applicable .
We are comparing 30 years of what I can call Iranian democracy to 30 years of Egyptian tyranny . ”

The Middle East is witnessing Iran slip into a guerrilla - style Internet and Twitter game of strategies and slogans pecked out by protesters attempting to outflank a government that has largely shut down communication outlets , leaving the nation breathless on snippets of text and stealthily uploaded pictures .
It is a battle on the streets and across the airways , a realm where technology is both churning out and smothering polarizing messages and images .
Iranian authorities have blocked opposition websites , jammed satellite TV channels and cut off text messaging .
But still , word is trickling beyond the censors , linking , however sparsely , protesters from Tehran to those elsewhere in the country .
Tweets by StopAhmadi are both philosophical and terse :
“ In a time of universal deceit , telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act .
Over n’ out . ”
Advertisement
“ Girl shot in Tehran . ”
Persiankiwi ’s tweets list updates of police movements and arrests : “ Our street is quiet now -- we can not move tonight but must move asap when dawn starts . ”
Iran is offering an intriguing glimpse into how years of disillusionment can suddenly leap from cafes and university campuses to a national revolt , where dueling political voices and agendas square off with banners , rhetoric and allegations of election fraud .
The Iranian elections have “ imposed themselves on everything .
The masses of young men , the noticeable presence of young women -- especially female university students -- and the slogans of change , the intense competition that raged , ” Mohammad Hussein al - Yusifi wrote in the Kuwait daily Awan .
“ All these factors left us no possibility but to observe closely what is happening on the Iranian scene . ”
Advertisement
The characters in that tumult , appearing amid videos of tear gas and baton - swinging police , have provided alluring narratives : presidential challenger Mousavi , whose Facebook fan group has about 50,000 members , standing amid throngs of his supporters ; Ahmadinejad proclaiming victory and calling for calm ; and the hovering visage of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
Each is mentioned on Twitter missives bristling with rumors about what might happen next .
But sometimes things go blank .
On Tuesday , Persiankiwi ’s Twitter feed , which has nearly 19,000 followers , posted this : “ I must log off now -- will log on when I have more info -- need phone line -- no mobile cover , no sms , no satellite , no radio . ”
Similar difficulties are encountered by international media .
Teymoor Nabili , a reporter for Al Jazeera , wrote on the network ’s website : “ Day - by - day our ability to access any information has been slowly whittled away .
. . .
I am no longer allowed to take a camera out into the streets .
I ’m not even sure I can walk out into the streets with a mobile phone without getting into trouble . ”
Activists and bloggers watching developments in Iran from afar say the protests show the promise and limits of technology in orchestrating the kind of social unrest seen in Tehran .
There is also the sentiment that Iranian activists rising up against an anti-Western regime enjoy more international support than their counterparts in Arab countries where anti-democratic governments are close U.S. allies .

“ A cyber war and its bloggers [ ca n ’t ] carry out a revolution or overthrow a certain regime on its own , ” said Wael Abbas , a blogger and human rights activist in Egypt .
“ Full revolution has to come from the masses in the streets . ”
The huge rallies and placards in Tehran make Issa , the Cairo editor , envious : “ The current Egyptian system was built on fraud while the Iranian revolution was built by the people , and that is why they are fighting for such a system , ” he said .
“ The bottom line is that unlike Iran , we are politically dead . ”
Iran ’s revolutionary spirit , evident 30 years ago in the Islamic Revolution , has been unbottled again .
And for the Arab world it is a lesson in resistance and a maturing democracy that may be controlled by clerics but is expressing its will in the streets and in blips of texts and tweets .

The market price for a seal pelt has plummeted in recent years
Canada 's annual seal hunt has ended with only a quarter of the quota of seals being caught .
The quota had been set at 273,000 , but fishermen in Newfoundland and Labrador , eastern Canada , took some 70,000 seals .
They blame plummeting prices for seal pelts and an impending European Union ban on seal products , which is expected to come into effect in October .
Some local fishermen are wondering if this could be the beginning of the end for the centuries - old practice .
Uphill battle
Many hunters from fishing communities in eastern Canada , did not even bother taking their boats out for this year 's seal hunt .
The market price for a seal pelt is about $ 12 , a steep decline from a peak of $ 100 a pelt a few years ago .
The depressed value of the Russian Rouble and the subsequent erosion of one of Canada 's largest markets for seal products , is partially to blame for the decline in numbers .
China is another major customer , also reeling from the global recession .
But it is clear that the prospect of a EU ban on seal products and growing international disdain for the hunt is becoming a major factor in its near collapse .
The European Parliament passed the ban in May , but it still needs the backing of EU governments .
That is expected to be a formality .
Canadian fisheries officials admit that they have an uphill battle in what has become an emotional international debate .
Animal rights groups have successfully campaigned for decades against the seal hunt .
The annual kill has been a source of critical seasonal income for fishing communities already hit hard by dwindling fish stocks .

Silver soldering or â€ œHard Solderingâ€ is an art form but itâ€™s an art form that anyone can learn with a little practice .
With silver soldering , practice really does make perfect .
I perfected the art of silver soldering many years ago while working for a company that remanufactured refrigerators , deep freezers and air conditioners .
I hadnâ€™t really thought about the steps involved in the process for years .
Silver soldering had become a reflex action for me .
At least I hadnâ€™t thought about them until my neighborâ€™s thirteen year old son started hanging out in my shop , watching my every move , eager to learn everything that I could teach him .
Which brings me to the point that I want to make here , any knowledge that isnâ€™t shared is wasted knowledge ?
In order to silver solder you will need the following tools and supplies .
1 ) A BernzOmatic torch with a self ignition torch head
2 ) BenzOmatic 4 in 1 tubing brush
3 ) Stay Clean paste flux
4 ) Safety Silv 40 Flux Coated 1/6â€ O.D. X 18â€ Silver solder rods
5 ) Tube deburring tool
6 ) Tubing cutter , 1/8â€ to 1 1/8â € 
7 ) Ñ˜â€ to 5 /8â € swaging tool set
8 ) Mini , close quarter tubing cutter , 1/8â€ to 5/8â € 
9 ) Emery cloth plumbers tape
All these tools and supplies are available from RSD Refrigeration Supplies Distributor online or from a local air conditioning and refrigeration parts and supplies outlet .
You will also need to pick up a few pieces of copper pipe of assorted sizes with a few fittings for each size pipe for practice .
The following is a good choice
1 ) One 8 foot length of Ð…â€ rigid copper pipe
2 ) One 8 foot length of Ñ•â€ rigid copper pipe
3 ) One Ð…â€ coupling .
and two Ð…â€ tees
4 ) One Ñ•â€ coupling and two Ñ•â€ tees
Plumberâ€™s grade pipe and fittings will suffice for practice because itâ€™s a great deal cheaper then A/C grade copper tubing .
Learning to silver solder isnâ€™t difficult but it does take a little practice to become proficient at it .
How to silver solder like a pro
1 ) Begin by cutting each length of copper pipe into eight pieces of approximate equal lengths .
Itâ€™s important to use a tubing cutter when cutting copper tubing because the slight compression made by the tubing cutter makes getting a proper fit much easier .
Donâ€™t force the cutter .
Hand tighten the cutter until the cutting wheel digs firmly into the cutter .
Then rotate the cutter completely around the tubing several times until the tubing is well scored .
After that tighten the cutterâ€™s feed know one turn with each revolution of the cutter until you have cut all the way through the tubing .
2 ) Using the deburring tool , carefully remove any burs from the inside of the pipe / tubing .
This is very important when working with refrigeration because the slightest bur will disrupt the flow of refrigerants causing the system to become noisy and inefficient .
3 ) Now , using the 4 in 1 BenzOmatic brush , clean the inside of each of the copper fittings and the outside of each piece of copper tubing that you are about to join with silver solder .
Clean the pipe back far enough so the cleaned areas extend a good Ñ•â€ to 1â€ beyond the end of the fittings .
4 ) Dry fit all the pieces to make sure they fit properly .
The pipe should fit snugly within the fittings .
5 ) One fitting at a time , coat the inside of the fitting and the outside of the pipe with Stay Clean paste flux .
6 ) To begin soldering place the blue inner flame of the torch against the fitting .
Move the flame evenly over and around the fitting .
Watching the inner flame on the side of the fitting away from the torch you will be ready to silver solder when this inner flame turns green .
7 ) With the flame concentrated on the central part of the fitting apply the silver solder rod to the pipe where it meets the fitting .
The silver solder should flow easily into the joint and around the pipe .
If it doesnâ€™t the pipe isnâ€™t hot enough yet .
8 ) Once the silver solder has flowed inside the joint and around the pipe , remove the torch and wrap the pipe in a wet rag .
This not only cools the joint quickly , it will provide you with a shiny , professional appearing joint .
9 ) Keep practicing until you have used all the fitting and lengths of pipe that you have prepared for practice .
Remember practice makes perfect .
You may have noticed that we didnâ€™t use some of the tools I listed .
Not to worry , you will if you when you apply your new skills to real life projects .
In what probably seemed like a two - birds - with - one - stone situation ( before the arrest , we mean ) , a 9 - member British gang used stolen credit cards to purchase their own music on iTunes and Amazon , then collected the royalties — an estimated $ 300,000 total .

The gang , made up of six men and three women , included one DJ who created the music .
They then listed it on iTunes and Amazon and negotiated a pretty plush 40 % commission for themselves before using stolen credit cards to purchase $ 750,000 worth of their music .
British police stated , " We will not know why they did what they did until we have conducted all the interviews , " which confirms my suspicion that there is no crime , and possibly not even formal currency , in England .
The scheme managed to inflate their almost certainly fragile musical egos and net a pretty penny at the same time , and the British police wo n't know why they did it until they ask them ?

Unfortunately , the artist name they used has n't been released , so I can't make fun of whatever clanging noise they passed off as music .
Apple and Amazon helped the police track down the culprits , who are currently being held in jail .

Billy Mays was about to film a bunch of commercials for Taco Bell -- this according to a radio host who talked to the pitchman a few hours before he died .
Todd " MJ " Schnitt from 93.3 WFLZ in Tampa was interviewing Billy 's " Pitchmen " co-star Anthony Sullivan this afternoon , when Todd eerily admitted to speaking with Billy on the phone late last night .
During the call , Todd said Billy had just signed a deal with Taco Bell for a series of infomercial - style adverts that were going to be filmed in August .
Todd also said Billy told him he " hit his head on the overhead luggage compartment " when the US Airways airplane blew its front tires while landing in Tampa yesterday .
WASHINGTON , June 3 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. dollar is “ seriously overvalued , ” mostly against the Chinese renminbi and some other Asian currencies , according to a new study published on Wednesday .
The Peterson Institute for International Economics , a Washington - based think tank , said the majority of the 29 currencies it studied need to appreciate against the dollar , with a large rise especially needed by the Chinese currency .
“ The principal counterpart to the overvalued dollar is the undervaluation of the Chinese renminbi , which would have needed to appreciate about 21 percent on a weighted average basis and about 40 percent against the dollar to achieve equilibrium , ” said the study by economists William Cline and John Williamson .
Investor flight to the dollar safe haven since last year has pushed the U.S. currency up by about 10 percent , which on top of an estimated overvaluation of about 7 percent a year ago made for an overvaluation of about 17 percent by March this year , the study said .
But the dollar slid to its low in 2009 on June 1 against the euro and a basket of currencies amid optimism the prospect of a global economic recovery boosted riskier assets .
Despite the dollar ’s recent slump , the study said the currency remained “ substantially overvalued . ”
Cline and Williamson said economic imbalances caused by the deficit and overvaluation of the dollar over the surplus and undervaluation of the Chinese renminbi posed systemic threats .
“ It is important that as the world emerges from the current crisis these imbalances be corrected , ” they said .
To rebalance the global economy , Cline and Williamson argued China should change its peg from the dollar to a basket of currencies .
Alternatively , China should resume the upward crawl of the peg against the dollar .
“ Unfortunately , the most recent evidence points in the other direction , as the policy over the past several months of keeping the renminbi unchanged against the dollar has remained intact , despite the dollar ’s reversal toward a declining trend subsequent to its peak in early March . ”
“ China has again begun to ride the dollar down , ” they added .

The bombshell dropped in 1976 , when " The Natural History of Chipping " appeared in the American Journal of Psychiatry .
In their article , Norman Zinberg , then clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard , and his research assistant R.C. Jacobson described five case studies , representative of 54 identified long - term heroin users who had regularly injected the drug for from two to 23 years , yet had never become addicts .
These " chippers , " whose existence Zinberg had noted as early as 1964 , actively developed social rituals and usage strategies that permitted stable , controlled use of heroin .
That article demolished the received wisdom of decades .
Ever since 1898 , when Bayer & Co. of Germany , makers of another painkiller , Bayer aspirin , introduced heroin to the pharmaceutical market , popular and scientific mythology had enshrined it as the most addictive of drugs .
( The word heroin , allegedly referring to heroic feelings stimulated by the drug , was originally a Bayer trademark . )
The finding that people could take heroin without forming habits challenged the whole idea that drugs themselves were addictive .
Since then , the ethos has shifted markedly .
" The idea of addictive drugs makes no sense , " says Howard Shaffer .
" It 's magical thinking to imagine that drugs have this power . "
Shaffer , associate professor of psychology in the department of psychiatry and director of the division on Addictions at Harvard Medical School , has studied both drug addicts and compulsive gamblers and notes , " We do n't talk about addictive dice . "
The old - fashioned concept of " addictive personality " has also collapsed .
Today , the word addiction does not appear in standard psychiatric nomenclature .
Rather , addiction seems to characterize neither a substance nor a personality type , but a form of relationship .
Clinicians now speak of addiction to gambling , sex , aerobic exercise , work , day - trading , eating carrots , shopping , even excessive drinking of water .
The term is vastly popular : people laughingly refer to themselves as " TV addicts " or " chocoholics . "
But Bertha Madras , professor of psychobiology in the department of psychiatry , objects : " The word is grossly overused .
Addiction is a neurobiological disorder .
Clinically , it 's a very clear syndrome .
If you look at all drug addictions from tobacco to heroin , there 's only one clear statement that applies to all of them : uncontrolled use despite negative consequences . "
Classically , drug addiction means tolerance ( the need for increasing doses to obtain the same effect ) and withdrawal ( psychic and / or bodily ailments , sometimes lethal , that accompany sudden cessation of use ) .
Both signs indicate neuroadaptation : repeated intake of a drug alters the brain in profound ways that both stimulate more drug use and render choice more difficult .
Yet " pathological gamblers show physiological signs of tolerance and withdrawal , just like narcotic addicts , " says Shaffer .
" And hospital patients medicated for pain can develop tolerance and withdrawal , but do n't show signs of addiction , such as drug - seeking behavior .
We can't be sure if it's the drugs or the behaviors that are changing the brain chemistry . "
The emerging consensus , he says , is that both factors are at work .
Such riddles suggest why addiction research spans many disciplines , from neurobiology to social policy .
The division on Addictions , founded in 1993 , is one of nine such divisions focusing on areas that do not fit well into the Medical School 's regular academic departments .
Addiction is as old as human history , and remains one of the costliest and most intractable of all social problems .
It confounds rationality : millions of addicts persist in their blatantly self - destructive behavior despite the loss of family , friends , jobs , money , and health .
( Some studies have shown the death rate for untreated heroin addicts to be as high as 7 percent annually . )
To use the analogy of professor of psychiatry George Vaillant ' 55 , M.D. ' 59 , the addict can resemble a cigar smoker in an elevator , oblivious to something that is obvious to everyone else .
Research is now beginning to show what makes addicted brains , bodies , minds , and spirits so different .
The Addicted Brain
Most animals will gladly take any drug that humans use , excepting marijuana and certain psychedelics like LSD .
" The addictive potential of drugs appears to be reflected in many mammalian species , " says Madras , who studies the effects of cocaine on macaque monkey brains at the Harvard - affiliated New England Regional Primate Research Center .
Pigeons , rats , and monkeys will all press levers to access cocaine or opiates , suggesting that addiction taps into widely shared neural pathways .
This makes sense because psychoactive drugs generally exert their most important effects on older brain structures , those areas sometimes called the " reptile brain . "
In fact , some current research suggests that these pathways may have evolved even before reptiles appeared .
Biologist Tristan Darland , a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Cabot professor of the natural sciences John Dowling , is currently running experiments on zebra fish -- common residents of home aquariums whose brains have enough cortex to let them learn some behaviors , though far less effectively than mammals .
Darland begins by having the fish swim for 30 minutes in a tank that has a wick saturated with cocaine at one end .
The next day , he returns the zebra fish to the same tank for two minutes , but with no cocaine on the wick .
Nonetheless , the fish usually prefer the end of the tank where they encountered the cocaine -- and spend 70 to 80 percent of their time there .
Even during their initial " conditioning " swim , the fish gravitate toward the cocaine end , but " prior exposure to cocaine evokes a stronger response .
Evidently , they see it as pleasurable , " Darland explains .
Results from more than 100 fish show that at least 85 percent prefer the side they associate with cocaine .
The zebra fish may be undergoing some systematic changes in brain chemistry .
Psychoactive drugs alter patterns of communication within the brain , via neurotransmitters ( molecules that convey messages in the nervous system ) .
" The chemical structure of drugs happens to resemble the chemical structure of the brain 's own neurotransmitters , " Madras explains .
" I call them ' the great brain impostors . '
They target the same communication systems as the brain 's natural messages .
But the complex communication and control systems in the brain are geared for the natural message , not the impostor .
As a result , the brain adapts to , and compensates for , the abnormal signals generated by the drug .
Here is where the addictive process begins .
Brain adaptation is central to addiction .
In the case of drugs that produce physical or psychological withdrawal , there is a compulsion to restore the brain to the status it had when it was awash with drugs . "
A central enzymatic pathway in the midbrains of vertebrates produces an important neurotransmitter called dopamine , which occurs at high concentrations in a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens .
" All addictive drugs seem to increase dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens , " says Darland .
" It 's been hypothesized that the dopamine system in potential addicts is somehow different .
Addictive drugs cause a big increase in dopamine release , with different mechanisms involved , depending on the drug .
Cocaine seems to block dopamine uptake , keeping it in circulation .
Morphine apparently shuts off inhibitory neurons in the ventral tegmental area of the brain , where the dopamine pathway begins .
" Dopamine release is associated with eating , with sex -- with many pleasurable states .
It 's a ' feel - good ' molecule , " Darland continues .
" These pathways did n't evolve for the sake of doing drugs .
They are there to keep humans procreating and eating . "
Draper professor of psychiatry Joseph Coyle says , " It looks like there are some final common pathways through which addictive drugs work , in the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala , and which involve the neurotransmitters dopamine and enkephalin .
This leads to some interesting things .
It 's rare to see an individual who uses only cocaine or heroin ; these brain systems are involved in other addictive behaviors .
Howard Shaffer , for example , has studied gamblers and finds that you rarely see a person who is just a pathological gambler -- usually it's a gambler who also smokes and drinks too much , or may have a drug habit .
Regarding treatment , it also might explain why Naltrexone , an opiate receptor antagonist , has been shown to be effective in reducing relapse among alcoholics . "
To better define the sites in the brain where these molecular firestorms occur , instructor in psychiatry Hans Breiter is using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to view patterns of neuronal activity in the brains of cocaine addicts .
He has begun to identify the brain centers that become active during euphoria ( when addicts are high on the drug ) and to distinguish them from those that fire when the user experiences craving ( strong desire for cocaine ) .
Some preliminary data suggest that the same brain centers may show parallel activity in compulsive gamblers , possibly indicating -- as Shaffer has suggested -- that addictive pathways in the brain can exist independent of drug input .
But the neuroscience of addiction is far from settled .
Madras , for example , dissents from the current model that sees drug effects converging on the dopamine system .
She cites the different effects of drugs , their different targets in the brain , the inability of one drug to substitute for another ( cocaine will not relieve morphine withdrawal , nor is methadone an effective treatment for cocaine addiction ) , and the fact that adverse circumstances such as fear or electric shock also prompt the release of dopamine .
" Dopamine may not be the brain 's euphoriant , " she says , " but the brain 's adrenaline . "
" In a sense , these drugs are stressors , " explains Gene Heyman , Ph.D. ' 77 , lecturer on psychology in the department of psychiatry .
" Besides their hedonic properties , they shock the system when taken in these amounts .
Rats on opiates , stimulants , or alcohol reliably show increases in corticosterone , a stress - related hormone .
Clinical evidence shows parallel findings with heroin addicts .
This suggests that opiates and perhaps other addictive drugs have a short - term effect of easing stress , but a long - term effect of increasing susceptibility to stress . "
Jack Mendelson , professor of psychiatry , draws a parallel between the hormonal responses caused by cocaine and those associated with thrilling or frightening pursuits like hang - gliding and bungee - cord jumping : " Cocaine triggers major stress hormones like epinephrine [ adrenaline ] , norepinephrine , adrenocorticotropic hormone [ ACTH ] , and serotonin .
These are the same ones that surge up during bungee jumping . "
Even if these chemical responses are common to all drugs of abuse , they are not uniform in degree among all individuals .
Darland and Dowling are now attempting to breed zebra fish with increased cocaine sensitivity , which may help identify genetic predispositions to drug addiction .
In humans , several lines of research suggest such genetic sensitivities .
In the 1960s and 1970s , Scandinavian researchers followed up families of alcoholics to find that the prevalence of alcoholism was four times greater in individuals from alcoholic backgrounds .
The researchers clearly demonstrated that genetic variables , rather than family behavior , were at work .
More recent research has indicated that hospital patients of Asian background need relatively higher doses of opiates to relieve pain , suggesting that they may metabolize opioids more rapidly , and hence are perhaps at greater risk for opiate addiction .
Differences in gene pools may influence cultural practices .
" In France and Italy , children drink wine with meals at early ages , whereas in Ireland they are discouraged from drinking before age 21 , " says Barry Kosofsky , associate professor of neurology .
" Some cultures may fear alcohol more , perhaps due to genetic predispostions for alcoholism . "
Not only genes but prenatal environments may incline an organism toward drug sensitivity .
Neurotransmitters " sculpt " the brain by controlling its early development .
Kosofsky investigates the effect of drugs on the developing brain by studying children born to women addicted to crack cocaine .
" The intrauterine environment is critical in terms of brain development , " he says .
" Alcohol , nicotine , or cocaine in a pregnant woman can all have great impact on the fetal brain . "
Kosofsky hopes to learn whether exposure to cocaine in the womb will increase the likelihood of someone becoming addicted to cocaine as an adult .
" This , " he says , " would raise the possibility that infants exposed to drugs before birth are more likely to beget others who are also exposed to drugs in the womb " -- creating a kind of nongenetic " inheritance " of drug abuse .
Early experiences with drugs , whether in the womb or as an adult , have ineradicable effects .
Drug users often describe a wish to recapture the bliss of their first high .
But this goal proves elusive because once the brain has neuroadapted to drugs , it is physiologically and structurally changed .
The director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and many others argue that voluntary drug consumption alters the brain in ways that lead to involuntary drug consumption .
The question of whether drug habits are voluntary or not leads us to ask how people get over their addictions , and raises some of the moral issues surrounding compulsive behavior .
The Ambivalent Addict
Even if we all have the neural wiring to become addicts , only a few of us actually do so .
Bertha Madras estimates that 5 to 10 percent of those who experiment with a drug become compulsive users or abusers .
( Cigarettes are the exception : data show habituation rates ranging from 10 to 70 percent . )
What distinguishes that 5 or 10 percent who get hooked ?
Some studies indicate that children who have " personality disorders , " earn poor grades , or have been sexually abused are at higher risk for drug abuse .
Yet Howard Shaffer says , " I do n't think there is an addictive personality , nor does the scientific literature support the concept . "
George Vaillant states flatly , " The ' addictive personality ' probably does n't exist , " noting that " addictions tend to distort personality .
You can't predict this -- alcoholics look like everyone else until they become alcoholics , much as cigarette smokers do . "
Some theorists postulate that " novelty - seeking " or " sensation - seeking " personalities are prone to drug abuse , but Vaillant observes , " They are seeking the high , not addiction . "
Similarly , he adds , " People with miserable childhoods may look like addictive personalities , but they are seeking pain relief , not addiction . "
Clinical professor of psychiatry Edward Khantzian has written extensively about addiction as a form of self - medication .
" The nature of suffering is at times overwhelmingly intense -- or elusive , vague , and beyond people 's control , " he says .
" The drug user suddenly feels some control over what had felt uncontrollable .
I do think there 's a specificity involved .
People with a lot of rage and irritability find the opiates very soothing .
Stimulants may appeal to those individuals who are dysphoric , de-energized , or depressed .
Some say that drugs hijack the reward centers of the brain , but I believe that what is hijacked is the emotional brain . "
According to clinical instructor in psychiatry Stephen Bergman ' 66 , M.D. ' 73 , " All addictions feed the ego , the self .
The ego is insatiable .
If you are into your ego , you can never
get enough - - not enough drugs , sex , money , alcohol , relationships , not enough anything .
Enough , that is , to feel ' not bad . '
Many of these people do n't like it if they have to be in a room by themselves for a while .
In 12 - step programs , those who recover do it by asking for help .
The connection has to change , from the self to a we .
The only thing that helps is getting beyond yourself . "
Shaffer 's studies of compulsive gamblers may support Bergman 's notion .
" Gambling at slot machines seems to have more addictive potential than table games like cards , dice , or roulette , " he says .
" There 's a lot of social ritual at the gaming tables , but fewer social controls available at the slot machines .
Similarly with compulsive shopping : if you do n't shop with other people , there are fewer social controls .
The excessive shopper shops alone . "
Other isolated addicts come readily to mind -- the solitary drinker , the solo food binges of the bulimic , the workaholic executive alone in the penthouse office at midnight .
Connections with other people interrupt the addictive cycle ; they redirect attention away from the self - reinforcing feedback of the addictive activity that can quickly escalate to excessive levels .
Addiction is not all pharmacology , neurotransmitters , and intrapsychic states ; the social settings of drug consumption have powerful effects .
They can influence basic brain chemistry -- which is one reason Gene Heyman rejects the notion that " addictive behavior is insensitive to persuasion , that there 's an irresistible urge to take the drug . "
Heyman agrees that drugs alter the brain , but disputes the idea that they change the brain in ways that make choice impossible -- he does not believe , in other words , that neuroadaptation makes drug use involuntary .
Exhibit A , he says , is 50 million ex-smokers who have voluntarily ended their intake of nicotine .
Many external factors can influence the choice to use drugs .
Culture matters : drug intake is far less prevalent in places where religion plays a major role -- Israel , Islamic nations , Mormon communities .
Laws , too , have an effect : during Prohibition , the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver , probably the best epidemiological index of alcoholism , plummeted .
Social class predicts some use patterns : differential quitting rates for tobacco use have strengthened the correlation between smoking and lower levels of education .
Then there are social norms : the precipitous drop in the social desirability of smoking has supported quitters .
And money talks : in experimental situations , social psychologists have offered addicts cash rewards -- say , $ 50 - - for not smoking , drinking , or doing cocaine .
" There are powerful positive results -- addiction will stop in the short run , " Heyman says .
" If drug use really is involuntary , it does n't matter whether it 's short - or long - term .
You can't pay someone not to have dandruff , not to be depressed , not to hallucinate . "
One reason people believe drug use is involuntary is that recovery rates for addicts treated at clinics are quite bad .
Within one year of treatment , relapse rates of 67 to 90 percent are common for alcohol , opiate , cocaine , and tobacco users .
" But most of the people who become addicted to drugs do n't go to clinics , " says Heyman .
" Actually , only 30 to 40 percent go to clinics .
Yet this clinic population has greatly influenced our vision and concept of addiction . "
It turns out that addicts who do n't go to clinics have much higher recovery rates .
Heyman cites two large community surveys , one from 1980 to 1984 and another from 1990 to 1992 , that interviewed a cross-section of the general population and reliably identified individuals who met recognized criteria for drug dependence .
" Most of those who had been addicts were no longer addicted , " says Heyman .
" Fifty - nine to 76 percent had been in remission for the previous year or longer .
Smaller scale ethnographic studies of general populations also report high remission rates for addicts , and these results strongly suggest that for most , remission is permanent . "
Another fascinating finding is the well - known 1975 study , conducted by Lee Robins of Washington University Medical School in St. Louis , of U.S. servicemen who became heroin addicts in Vietnam .
Thousands of men got hooked , and 80 percent of those who initially took heroin more than three times became regular users , taking the drug at least once per week .
Those who stayed in Vietnam longer often moved on from sniffing to injection .
Yet three years after these veterans returned to the States , more than 90 percent had quit .
( This contrasts sharply with relapse rates that often exceed 90 percent for heroin addicts in treatment . )
The veterans ' success in kicking their habits was n't simply due to decreased drug availability : half of the Vietnam addicts used heroin at least once after they returned home .
But " what 's really interesting is what happened to the 6 percent of the Vietnam addicts who went into treatment , " Heyman says .
" For this group , the relapse rate was about 70 percent !
In other words , Vietnam vets who go into treatment look pretty much like other Americans who go into treatment . "
The question of how addicts who present themselves for treatment differ from other addicts is not well studied , Heyman says .
" What has emerged is that treatment seekers are much more likely to have other psychiatric disorders -- depression , schizophrenia , affective disorders , or conduct disorders like sociopathy .
These psychiatric syndromes may undermine the mechanisms and processes that assist in recovery . "
Consider that 30 years ago , there was no apparent correlation between smoking and depression .
Today , there is one , Heyman explains - -" linked to a selective quit rate as a function of psychiatric disorders . "
He suggests we " think of addiction not as compulsion , but ambivalence .
Alcoholics often recognize that the alcohol is doing them in , yet they keep right on drinking .
These data lead people to conclude that the drinking is involuntary , out of control , since continuing to drink does n't make sense .
Another view is that people are inconsistent and contradictory , and predictably so -- it 's a slightly starker view of human nature .
When talking to his therapist , the guy says he wants to stop .
But that 's looking at his life as a whole -- after all , it 's hard to be a heavy drinker , or a heroin or cocaine user , without having tons of problems .
Yet at a given instant , when the alcoholic is looking at a glass of wine , the frame of reference is , ' What do I want to do right now ? '
The situations in which they say they want to stop are different from those in which the drug or substance is presented .
" Humans are inconsistent .
Their preferences change with the setting , " Heyman continues .
" To end an addiction , people need an alternative to drug use , something better to do .
The clinic population , people with other psychiatric disorders , have a much harder time changing their situations to ones where drug use is less preferred .
If you see it as preference rather than compulsion , you can account for all the data . "
Lethal Liquids , and Some Ways Out
One of the foremost scholars doing longitudinal research ( studies that follow up subjects over many years ) in psychiatry is George Vaillant , who directs the Study of Adult Development , based at Harvard Medical School .
Vaillant 's 1983 book The Natural History of Alcoholism , a milestone in the field , analyzes drinking patterns in two populations of World War II era men : a group from Harvard and another group from working - class , inner-city Boston .
Generations of researchers have followed these men as they have aged .
" Alcohol is more often the horse and less often the cart than any other social ill I can think of , " Vaillant says .
" I find it terribly interesting that people are much more concerned with every other form of addiction than they are with alcoholism , which -- as a problem to humanity -- is as big as all other addictions combined .
It costs as much as all infectious and pulmonary disease .
And it has more impact on others .
Drug addicts harm themselves , but that 's small beer compared with 25,000 alcohol - related traffic fatalities per year . "
Even though cigarette smoking is the direct cause of 400,000 American deaths annually , while alcohol directly causes only 100,000 deaths , " alcoholism is a major reason that people do n't stop smoking , " says Vaillant .
" Those who keep on smoking after age 50 tend to be alcoholics . "
In hospitals , alcoholics cost six times as much as other patients .
Half of all people who show up in emergency rooms with severe multiple fractures are alcoholics .
" But the emergency rooms treating multiple fractures ignore blood alcohol levels , " Vaillant says .
" The causal link is n't made . "
" No other drug of addiction impairs one 's aversion to punishment the way alcohol does , " he continues .
" Yes , compulsive gambling impairs your aversion to being poor , and heroin use impairs your aversion to being arrested .
But alcoholism goes across the board .
When drinking , people are much more likely to engage in all kinds of dangerous , life - threatening behavior -- wife beating , child abuse , unprotected sex with strangers , smoking , drunk driving .
You can be five foot two and willing to take on anyone in the bar . "
Such imperviousness to punishment also tends to forestall recovery .
In any case , " the best intentions in the world do n't help you with addiction , " says Vaillant .
" Will power is not a prognostic factor in recovery .
Addiction resides in what is often referred to as our reptilian brain , and -- well , alligators do n't come when they 're called .
What does matter , over the short term , is hitting bottom and having something to lose -- the employed , married , upper - middle - class drinker does better at the Betty Ford Center than the homeless alcoholic .
But over the long term , inner-city men recovered twice as often from alcoholism as the Harvard men did .
The difference has nothing to do with treatment , intelligence , self - care , or having something to lose .
It does have to do with hitting bottom .
Someone sleeping under the elevated train tracks can at some point recognize that he's an alcoholic , but the guy getting stewed every night at a private club may not . "
How , then , to change addictive behavior ?
We may start with the new understanding of the problem -- that the roots of addiction lie in both brain chemistry and behavior .
" It 's a wrong - headed bias to think that these are either psychological or biological problems , " says Gene Heyman .
Both voluntary and involuntary behaviors have biological bases .
Successful treatments for addiction need to address both realms at once -- say , combining a drug like Naltrexone , which influences neurotransmitters , with a healthier alternative to the drinking , drugging , or gambling life .
Vaillant 's studies have convinced him that there are four factors , common to all addictions , that predict success in breaking a habit .
Find a competing behavior that is less disruptive .
" Say a drinker goes to Alcoholics Anonymous , sobers up , and starts drinking a lot of coffee and smoking cigarettes , " he says .
" Then he quits smoking , by chewing the erasers off pencils and overeating , so he gains weight .
Now his problem is obesity , so he winds up hanging around Overeaters Anonymous and drinking a gallon of water a day .
It 's what teachers call ' redirecting . '
You may not be able to stop two four - year - olds from fighting , but you can say , ' Let 's go get ice cream cones . ' "
An external superego .
" If I tell you you 'll get liver disease if you keep on drinking , you could care less , " Vaillant says .
" But if I say that as an M.D. I 'm going to do random checks on your urine , you may pay attention .
Or if , when you drink Jack Daniels , it burns your stomach .
Methadone is an external superego , since it blocks the effect of heroin .
Someone who engaged in compulsive sex might not care if it hurt their spouse 's feelings , but if there were an electric bracelet that could transmit a shock at crucial moments , that might make a difference . "
" I get no kick from cocaine . "
" It 's fascinating that heroin addicts get better when they fall in love with someone new , " Vaillant says .
" Our brains are wired for falling in love , because that 's good for nature -- but you can short - circuit that pathway with morphine , nicotine , caffeine .
Love gets the whole brain involved .
Romantic attachment not only competes with the addiction , but takes place in a nonaddictive way . "
Spiritus contra spiritum .
" Charismatic religions offer a conversion experience , as described by William James and C.G. Jung .
Suddenly you find your higher power , and booze is no longer important , " Vaillant explains .
" There is also the protective wall of a human community - - something that AA , for example , provides .
It 's important to find a new social group , since you owe money to all your old ones .
Religion offers an oceanic high -- the sense that a higher power loves you .
To the addict , heroin , cocaine , and booze are like mother 's milk .
Religion is , too . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
It was n't too long ago that the thought of buying a reliable car from Korea seemed laughable .
Today , Korean vehicles are common fare and automakers from India are getting ready to invade the U.S. market .
Experts say their vehicles are no joke .
Plus , Detroit 's turmoil could give Indian automakers a foot in the door here .
With General Motors and Chrysler both looking to save money , in part by trimming their dealer ranks , hundreds of new - car dealers could be ready to sign up with new competitors like these .
By the end of 2009 , U.S. auto shoppers will be able to buy a mid-sized Mahindra pick - up truck and already almost 350 dealerships have signed on to sell it nationwide , according to Georgia - based Global Vehicles U.S.A. , Mahindra 's North American distributor .
As a serious towing - and - hauling truck , Mahindra 's small pick - up is aimed at taking a chunk of America 's big bread - and - butter market .
In addition , Tata Motors has said it intends to begin selling its Nano microcar here by 2011 for those seeking an ultra-cheap and fuel - efficient vehicle .
Who 's going to drive Indian ?
While it 's targeted at a core part of America 's vehicle market , Mahindra 's truck is unusual by American standards .
Global Vehicles hopes the trucks ' unique features will appeal to cost - conscious but open - minded truck buyers .
The typical customer will be an " independent thinker " with an active lifestyle , said Larry Daniel , Global Vehicles ' vice - president for sales .
" They do n't really care what people think of what they drive , " he said .
The trucks are much smaller than full - sized rigs like the Ford F - 150 and Dodge Ram .
They are closest in size to mid-size trucks like the Dodge Dakota but their cargo beds are about as big as the big trucks ' .
With high ground clearance , a tall cab and large bed , the trucks look oddly proportioned compared to competitors .
Most importantly , the Mahindra trucks are diesel - powered .
Diesel engines produce more pulling power than gasoline engines while getting better fuel mileage .
Mahindra boasts that its truck , with its 4 - cylider diesel engine and 6 - speed transmission , will get 30 miles per gallon on the highway and will also be able to haul more than competitors ' V6 - powered trucks .
The relatively high cost of diesel engines , combined with the additional technology required to make dirty diesel emissions conform to air quality rules in all 50 states , has so far kept major manufacturers from offering diesel in smaller trucks , Levine said .
Currently , diesel engines are used only in the biggest pickups sold in America , ones intended for strictly commercial use .
Buyers of smaller trucks would probably snap up diesel - powered ones , some analysts say , because truckers understand diesel .
" They realize what both the power fuel economy benefits of diesel are , " said Mike Levine , an editor for the Web site Pickuptrucks.com .
Mahindra insists it can sell its truck here in the low $ 20,000 range .
That 's in spite of a 25 % tariff on imported pick - ups that has even foreign companies like Toyota and Nissan building their trucks here .
Mahindra might open its own factory here , too , in order to beat the tariff , but only if sales take off .
India 's key to success .
Mahindra 's truck sales may benefit from the fact that , in rural markets , the name is already well known , said Levine .
Mahindra is already one of the biggest - selling tractor manufacturers in the American market and even sponsors a Nascar team .
The first couple of years will be critical to Mahindra 's success , said Levine .
If other truck manufacturers decide to offer diesel engines in their better - known small truck models , that could undercut Mahindra 's main selling point , especially if they can do it at a similarly low price .
Beyond that , Mahindra just has to keep an eye on quality .
" The two questions will be final pricing and the trucks ' reliability and dependability , " Levine said .
If the Mahindra trucks are n't rock solid , they will be quickly shrugged off , he said .
Mahindra trucks probably wo n't sweep the market right off , said Jeff Schuster , an analyst with J.D. Power and Associates .
With so much on the line , the trucks will probably get a slow - rolling , toe - in - the - water introduction he said .
" I think it 's likely to be in limited quantities and with limited fanfare , at least initially , " he said .
Global Vehicles , for its part , insists that there will be a strong retail market for these trucks , but Levine and Schuster both argue that commercial fleet buyers , focused on functionality and cost over style , will be the more likely buyers for these vehicles .
Despite changes to improve the trucks ' interior amenities and exterior design for the competitive U.S. market , the Mahindra truck will still be more of a rough - and - tumble work truck than the nearly car - like conveyance American buyers are used to , said Levine .
Global Vehicles really ought to concentrate on commercial buyers , he suggested .
" I think fleet is an optimal way for them to get in and have them win , " he said .
Schuster agrees that ordinary , non-business truck buyers will be slow to warm up to a new entry .
" The small commercial use person or contractor or someone that just needs a truck for hauling , " is how Schuster describes a likely customer , not the fun-loving , motorcycle - carrying young man Global Vehicles ' Daniel said the importer envisions .
Still , by entering the market with a diesel - powered mid-sized truck , a product that strikes at a weak spot in the market , Mahindra is smartly treading the path of least resistance , said J.D. Power 's Schuster .
Americans like trucks and they 're becoming more interested in fuel economy .
When Tata Motors enters the market later it will be trying to sway buyers toward a much smaller car than Americans are used to at a price that will compete against larger used compact cars from well - known brands .
" The risk associated with the Nano is much greater than Mahindra 's risk with the truck , " he said .
In the Software Construction course next week we will , inevitably , talk about maximum segment sum .
A natural next step is to continue with the theme of segment problems , which does n’t feel complete without mentioning Hans Zantema ’s Longest Segment Problems .
The paper deals with problem of this form :
ls = max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ segs
That is , computing the longest consecutive segment of the input list that satisfies predicate p .
When writing on paper I found it much easier denoting filter p by the Bird - Meertens style p ◁ and I will use the latter for this post too .
The function segs :: [ a ] → [ [ a ] ] , defined by segs = concat ∘ map inits ∘ tails returns all consecutive segments of the input list , and max# :: [ [ a ] ] → [ a ] returns the longest list from the input list of lists .
To avoid long nesting parenthesis , I denote function application by an infix operator ▪ that binds looser than function composition ∘ .
Therefore f ∘ g ∘ h ▪ x means f ( g ( h x ) ) .
Standard transformation turns the specification to the form
ls = max# ∘ map ( max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ) ∘ tails
Therefore we may solve ls if we manage to solve its sub-problem on prefixes :
lp = max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits
that is , computing the longest prefix of the input list satisfying predicate p .
One of the key propositions in the paper says :
Proposition 1 : If p is suffix - closed ( that is , p ( x ⧺ y ) ⇒ p y ) , we have : p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( a : x ) = p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( a : max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x )
It is useful because , by composing max # on both sides we get
lp ( a : x ) = max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( a : lp x )
that is , lp can be computed by a foldr .
Of course , we are not quite done yet .
We then have to somehow simplify p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( a : lp x ) to something more efficient .
Before we move on , however , proving Proposition 1 turns out to be an interesting challenge in itself .
Intuition
What does Proposition 1 actually say ?
Let x = [ 1,2,3 ] and a = 0 .
On the left - hand side , we are performing p ◁ on
[ ] [ 0 ] [ 0,1 ] [ 0,1,2 ] [ 0,1,2,3 ]
The right hand side says that we may first filter the tails of [ 1,2,3 ] :
[ ] [ 1 ] [ 1,2 ] [ 1,2,3 ]
Assuming that only [ ] and [ 1,2 ] get chosen .
We may then keep the longest prefix [ 1,2 ] only , generate all its prefixes ( which would be [ ] [ 1 ] [ 1,2 ] ) , and filter the latter again .
In other words , we lost no information dropping [ 1,2,3 ] if it fails predicate p , since by suffix - closure , p ( [ 0 ] ⧺ [ 1,2,3 ] ) ⇒ p [ 1,2,3 ] .
If [ 1,2,3 ] does n’t pass p , p [ 0,1,2,3 ] can not be true either .
Zantema has a nice and brief proof of Proposition 1 by contradiction .
However , the theme of this course has mainly focused on proof by induction and , to keep the possibility of someday encoding our derivations in tools like Coq or Agda , we would like to have a constructive proof .
So , is it possible to prove Proposition 1 in a constructive manner ?
The Proof
I managed to come up with a proof .
I ’d be happy to know if there is a better way , however .
For brevity , I denote if p then x else y by p → x ; y .
Also , define
a ⊕p x = p a → a : x ; x
Therefore p ◁ is defined by
p ◁ = foldr ⊕p [ ]
Here comes the the main proof :
Proposition 1
p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( a : x ) = p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( a : max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x )
if p is suffix - closed .
Proof .
p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( a : max # ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x )
= { definition of inits }
p ◁ ( [ ] : map ( a :) ∘ inits ∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x )
= { definition of p ◁ }
[ ] ⊕p ( p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ inits ∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x )
= { Lemma 1 }
[ ] ⊕p ( p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x )
= { Lemma 2 }
[ ] ⊕p ( p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x )
= { Lemma 1 }
[ ] ⊕p ( p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ inits ▪ x )
= { definition of p ◁ }
p ◁ ( [ ] : map ( a :) ∘ inits ▪ x )
= { definition of inits }
p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( a : x )
∎
The main proof refers to two “ decomposition ” lemmas , both are of the form f ∘ g = f ∘ g ∘ f :
Lemma 1 : p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) = p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ p ◁ if p suffix - closed .
if suffix - closed .
Lemma 2 : p ◁ ∘ inits ∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits = p ◁ ∘ inits for all predicate p .
Both are proved by structural induction .
For Lemma 1 we need the conditional distribution rule :
f ( p → x ; y ) = ( p → f x ; f y )
If we are working in CPO we need the side condition that f is strict , which is true for the cases below anyway :
Lemma 1
p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) = p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ p ◁
if p is suffix - closed .
Proof .
Structural induction on the input .
Case [ ] : trivial .
Case ( x : xs ) :
p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ p ◁ ▪ ( x : xs ) = { definition of p ◁ } p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ▪ ( p x → x : p ◁ xs ; p ◁ xs ) = { map distributes into conditionals } p ◁ ▪ ( p x → ( a : x ) : map ( a :) ∘ p ◁ ▪ xs ; map ( a :) ∘ p ◁ ▪ xs ) = { p ◁ distributes into conditionals } p x → p ◁ ( ( a : x ) : map ( a :) ∘ p ◁ ▪ xs ) ; p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) .p ◁ ▪ xs = { definition of p ◁ } p x → ( p ( a : x ) → ( a : x ) : p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ p ◁ ▪ xs ) ; p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ p ◁ ▪ xs ) ; p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ p ◁ ▪ xs = { induction } p x → ( p ( a : x ) → ( a : x ) : p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ▪ xs ) ; p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ▪ xs ) ; p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ▪ xs = { since p ( a : x ) ⇒ p x by suffix closure } p ( a : x ) → ( a : x ) : p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ▪ xs ) ; p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ▪ xs = { definition of p ◁ } p ◁ ( ( a : x ) : map ( a :) xs ) = { definition of map } p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ▪ ( x : xs )
∎
For Lemma 2 , it is important that p is universally quantified .
We need the following map - filter exchange rule :
p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) = map ( a :) ∘ ( p ∘ ( a : ) ) ◁
The proof goes :
Lemma 2
For all predicate p we have
p ◁ ∘ inits ∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits = p ◁ ∘ inits
Proof .
Structural induction on the input .
Case [ ] : trivial .
Case ( a : x ) :
p ◁ ∘ inits ∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( a : x ) = p ◁ ∘ inits ∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ▪ ( [ ] : map ( a :) ( inits x ) )
Consider two cases :
1. Case p [ ] ∧ null ( p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ inits ▪ x ) :
If ¬ p [ ] , both sides are undefined .
Otherwise :
... = p ◁ ∘ inits ∘ max # ▪ [ ] = [ ] = p ◁ ▪ ( [ ] : p ◁ ∘ map ( a : ) ∘ inits ▪ x ) = p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( a : x )
2. Case ¬ ( null ( p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ inits ▪ x ) ) :
... = p ◁ ∘ inits ∘ max# ∘ p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ inits ▪ x = { map - filter exchange } p ◁ ∘ inits ∘ max# ∘ map ( a :) ∘ ( p ∘ ( a : ) ) ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x = { since max# ∘ map ( a :) = ( a :) ∘ max # } p ◁ ∘ inits ∘ ( a :) ∘ max # ∘ ( p ∘ ( a : ) ) ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x = { definition of inits } p ◁ ( [ ] : map ( a :) ∘ inits ∘ max# ∘ ( p ∘ ( a : ) ) ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x ) = { definition of p ◁ } p ⊕p ( p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ inits ∘ max # ∘ ( p ∘ ( a : ) ) ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x ) = { map - filter exchange } p ⊕p ( map ( a :) ∘ ( p ∘ ( a : ) ) ◁ ∘ inits ∘ max# ∘ ( p ∘ ( a : ) ) ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x ) = { induction } p ⊕p ( map ( a :) ∘ ( p ∘ ( a : ) ) ◁ ∘ inits ▪ x ) = { map - filter exchange } p ⊕p ( p ◁ ∘ map ( a :) ∘ inits ▪ x ) = { definition of p ◁ } p ◁ ( [ ] : map ( a :) ∘ inits ▪ x ) = { definition of inits } p ◁ ∘ inits ▪ ( a : x )

Remember the “ Previously on Lost ” band that played on the Season 5 Finale LOST Untangled video ?
They ’re going to be in New York tonight , playing at the Mercury Lounge in lower Manhattan , where they will be performing their Season 5 Finale recap song live for the first time .
Also appearing are the headline act Malajube — a French - Canadian indie rock band — and two other bands .

The same applies to their interests .
Some , like their fascination with folklore , appeared eccentric at the time but seem less so now , as does the eclecticism of a couple as intrigued by physics and prefabrication as by Mexican craftsmanship .
All of this is visible in the house , which is filled with thoughtful arrangements of the pebbles , buttons , pencils , toys , masks , kites and other knickknacks they collected over the years , as well as furniture and artworks made by them and their friends .
Equally prescient was the Eameses ’ love of nature .
When they started work on the house in the mid-1940s as part of the Case Study House Program to build model modern homes in California , they envisaged it as two separate buildings : a house with ocean views across the meadow and a studio set into the hillside .
The longer they spent at the site , the more they loved it .
Abandoning the original design , the couple devised a plan to preserve the area ’s natural beauty by excavating a lot for both buildings between the trees and hill .

They were even early recyclers , and rarely threw anything away .
One of their cars , a Ford , lasted them 18 years , and in the four decades they lived in their house , they replaced only one appliance , a refrigerator .
The Eameses ’ way of working was influential , too .
“ Their practice of operating in multiple arenas — architecture , design , film and exhibitions — has become the template for today ’s avant - garde designers , who are intentionally blurring the boundaries between the disciplines , ” observed Joseph Rosa , chair of architecture and design at the Art Institute of Chicago .
Similarly Ray blazed a trail as one of the few prominent women designers of the day , although her contribution was often underestimated .
A British design organization once presented a medal to Charles and a rose to her , but he always insisted on crediting her equally .
When they appeared on NBC’s “ Today ” show in 1956 , Ray was welcomed on set with : “ This is Mrs. Eames and she is going to tell us how she helps Charles design his chairs . ”
He cringed , while she smiled gamely .
( See it for yourself on YouTube . )
“ Their house has become a beacon for the American way of poetic pragmatism , ” said Ms. Antonelli .
“ Chez Eames , art is not intimidating , great design really is for everybody , and high taste means being able to enjoy the occasional tchotchke in a modernist masterpiece . ”
That ’s why we love it .
A pair of useless self - serving political gits
Tony Blair was aware of the existence of a secret interrogation policy which effectively led to British citizens , and others , being ­tortured during counter - terrorism investigations , the Guardian can reveal .
The policy , devised in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks , offered guidance to MI5 and MI6 officers questioning detainees in Afghanistan whom they knew were being mistreated by the US military .
British intelligence officers were given written instructions that they could not “ be seen to condone ” torture and that they must not “ engage in any activity yourself that involves inhumane or degrading treatment of prisoners ” .
But they were also told they were not under any obligation to intervene to prevent detainees from being mistreated .
“ Given that they are not within our custody or control , the law does not require you to intervene to prevent this , ” the policy said .
Blair ’s role model
The policy almost certainly breaches international human rights law , according to Philippe Sands QC , one of the world ’s leading experts in the field , because it takes no account of Britain ’s obligations to avoid complicity in torture under the UN convention against torture .
Despite this , the secret policy went on to underpin British intelligence ’s relationships with a number of foreign intelligence agencies which had become the UK ’s allies in the “ war against terror ” .
The policy was set out in written instructions sent to MI5 and MI6 officers in January 2002 , which told them they might consider complaining to US officials about the mistreatment of detainees “ if circumstances allow ” .
RTFA .
Just one more political wimp who bent over and spread his “ ethics ” for the Bush - Cheney regime .
The appropriate word is “ collaborator ” and , yes , I ’m well aware of the historic meaning .
A number of my friends and relatives fought against Fascism in World War 2 – in the military and as partisan guerillas – and gladly exacted penalties upon those who chose to collaborate with the Nazis of several nations .
They got what they deserved .
So should Blair – and Bush and Cheney .
Hookers always remember to use your RADS kits , its not just there to provide you guys with a table to play spades .

“ In the olden days , the consequences of planning were great , so we ’d spend nine months before air date ” doing research , says Barry Lowenthal , the president of the Media Kitchen , a media planning and buying company that , like Varick , is a unit of MDC Partners .
“ Then , nine months after we ’d been running the ad , we ’d finally figure out whether it was working or not . ”
Online , though , advertisers get instant measurements and can make instant changes to a media plan .
Varick and its handful of competitors cement their strategies around a system called exchanges , a mechanism that helps online publishers like NBC.com or Yahoo.com sell ad space .
While publishers have some ad space no company would bid on in advance  few advertisers would book a random Yahoo mail page , for instance  publishers still want to show an ad when someone loads that page .
So the publishers let an ad exchange like Right Media , from Yahoo , or DoubleClick Advertising Exchange , from Google , sell that space instantly , through an electronic auction , and get a cut of sales .
Such random , seemingly unwanted space could be virtually worthless .
But because ad agencies can now use multiple sources to gather very specific demographic data about visitors , such space gains value and can be brokered on an exchange .
Among the sources agencies rely on for data - mining is information gathered from other sites .
Imagine that every time someone entered a store while shopping , she received a stamp on her hand .
By the time she got to Macy ’s , the clerk could see she had visited Williams - Sonoma and Home Depot and could direct her to housewares .
A similar principle is followed online .
When someone visits a site like Expedia or Autobytel.com , that site captures valuable information : Someone is a first - class traveler , for instance , or shopping for a hybrid car .
Those sites have deals with data companies , like BlueKai and eXelate , to place a so - called cookie  a small text file  on that visitor ’s hard drive , indicating those preferences .
An advertiser like Varick bids on those cookies , instructing an exchange that it will pay a certain amount for an ad when a certain cookie is for sale .
Other companies , like Media6 Degrees and 33 Across , analyze the world of social media , using cookies and interaction data to find “ lookalike ” groups among friends on Facebook , Flickr or other social sites .
Their theory is that friends share values and are likely to respond to similar marketing messages .
Finally , companies can add cookies for anyone who visits pages on their sites  if someone gets to the checkout page , then abandons his shopping cart , the company will probably pay lots of money to advertise to him again .
In Linux , the networking related services could be set up in three different ways :
1 ) /etc/hosts to /etc / hosts mapping based networking
2 ) DNS based networking
3 ) NIS / NIS + based networking which in turn can take the help of DNS or /etc / hosts file
For network - based services the actual network daemon reads some file for communication .
The first file that it reads is /etc/host.conf .
Over here one may generally find two lines as
Order hosts , bind , Nis
Multi on
The first line tells what would the network - related services like httpd , sendmail , nfsd , ypserv etc , which gets invoked at the time of booting from / etc / rc.d / init.d read , before doing remote communication .
It also tells whether the /etc / hosts file mapping where the host entries for each machine is present on each machine or it should read a DNS implemented by BIND software or a nis / nis + based networking which is dependent on either of the above setup .
The second line says whether one machine can have multiple IPaddresses attached with same machine name or not as a Linux platform allows a machine name to have multiple IPaddresses .
Example : Let ’s say a system administrator wants to setup 3 IPaddresses with the same machine name associated with one Ethernet card with 192.192.192.0
#ifconfig eth0 192.192.192.1
#ifconfig eth0:1 192.192.192.2
#ifconfig eth0:2 192.192.192.3
Now in /etc / hosts if we write
192.192.192.1 kshounish1
192.192.192.2 kshounish1
192.192.192.3 kshounish1
That means any another machine can access the services of kshounish1 machine by writing any of the ipaddress .
Remember that the order means the searching order if it ’s like Order hosts , bind .
That means all the services which need to read something before getting served or get requested will first see the mapping of the hosts in /etc / hosts file .
If it gets that file it would work or else it will search for the DNS through BIND software .
For DNS setup it should be Order bind , hosts .
And note that once you change the order you need to start
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/network restart
This is the first step before you start configuring DNS
What is DNS ?
DNS means Domain Name Service .
It is actually a service that can keep large number of machines ’ ipaddresses for huge network communication .
Now the question arises why is this needed .
Lets understand this with the help of an illustration .
Air France is replacing instruments that help measure airspeed on all its medium and long - haul Airbus jets , according to a memo sent to pilots following the disappearance of one of the airline 's jets over the Atlantic with 228 people on board .
Investigators have been focusing on incorrect speed readings as a potential reason for why the Airbus A330 went down on Sunday en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro .
While the airline refused to comment on the memo , saying it was for pilots only , the Associated Press reported that Air France has been replacing instruments known as Pitot tubes .
French search teams scouring the Atlantic have so far found no wreckage and are urging " extreme prudence " about possible plane wreckage retrieved so far , France 's transport minister said yesterday .
Dominique Bussereau said an earlier announcement by Brazilian officials that they had recovered debris from AF447 had turned out to be false , and that the priority was finding the " black box " flight recorders .
A French nuclear submarine has been sent to area to help locate the recorders , but hopes that bodies may be found are fading amid worsening weather conditions .
Airbus has sent an advisory note to all airlines using the A330 reminding them of how to handle the plane in extreme weather conditions similar to those thought to have been experienced by flight AF447 .
Airbus said this did not imply that the doomed pilots did anything wrong or that a design fault was in any way responsible for the crash .
Air France 's chief executive , Pierre - Henri Gourgeon , told family members of the missing passengers at a private meeting yesterday that the plane had disintegrated , either in the air or when it crashed into the ocean .
With the crucial flight recorders still missing , investigators were relying heavily on the plane 's automated messages to help reconstruct what happened .
One theory is that outside probes that feed speed sensors may have iced over , giving incorrect information and causing the autopilot to direct the aircraft to fly too fast or too slow when it met turbulence .
The last message from the pilot was a manual signal at 11 pm local time , in which he said he was flying through an area of black , electrically charged clouds with violent winds and lightning .
At 11.10 pm , a series of problems began : the autopilot disengaged , a key computer system switched to alternative power , and controls needed to keep the plane stable were damaged .
The French defence minister , Hervé Morin , and the Pentagon have said there were no signs that terrorism was involved , but Morin yesterday declined to rule out the possibility .
“ Hopefully , they ’ll just do the right thing , ” he said .
Cohen said that one of his primary arguments against the rule , which is part of the collective bargaining agreement between the league and union , was that soldiers can fight for their country at age 18 but not play in the N.B.A .
He also said noted that predominantly white sports like hockey , baseball and golf lack similar restrictions .
“ There ’s something wrong with keeping kids , who are more likely to be African - American than not , from playing professional basketball and football when they can help their families and communities immediately , ” Cohen said .
“ They ’re forced to go to school when they have no desire or interest in going to school . ”
The N.B.A. spokesman Mike Bass said the league was looking forward to receiving and responding to the congressman ’s letter .
The players union spokesman Dan Wasserman said he expected the age issue to be “ front and center ” when the collective bargaining agreement , which expires in 2011 , is renegotiated .
Wasserman added that the union looked forward to the opportunity to “ revisit the change to the rule that was made in 2005 . ”
Cohen said he began researching the issue in April and chose to write the letter now to use the spotlight of the N.B.A. finals for exposure .
Four of the biggest stars in the finals  Kobe Bryant , Andrew Bynum , Dwight Howard and Rashard Lewis skipped college before the rule changed .
( The current rule essentially forces players to attend college for a year . )
“ I do n’t think its fair , ” Lewis said , ticking off the names of the players in the finals .
He added : “ The M.V.P. of the league , LeBron James , came out of high school .
Kevin Garnett won a championship last year .
There are a handful of guys who are the face of the game who came out of high school .
So I think you should continue to let certain guys do it , make that jump . ”
May 17 , 1954 : The United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Brown v. Board of Education , deciding that racial segregation in public educational facilities is unconstitutional .
The case centered on Linda Brown , an African American girl , who had been denied admission to her local elementary school in Topeka , Kansas , because of the color of her skin .
This was a landmark decision , which overturned earlier rulings going back to Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 , by declaring that state laws that established separate public schools for black and white students denied black children equal educational opportunities .
The Warren Court 's unanimous ( 9 - 0 ) decision stated that " separate educational facilities are inherently unequal . "
As a result , de jure racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .

Before I try to rest I will set down these notes in preparation for the report I must make .
What I have found is so singular , and so contrary to all past experience and expectations , that it deserves a very careful description .
I reached the main landing on Venus , March 18 , terrestrial time ; VI , 9 of the planet ’s calendar .
Being put in the main group under Miller , I received my equipment — watch tuned to Venus ’s slightly quicker rotation — and went through the usual mask drill .
After two days I was pronounced fit for duty .
Leaving the Crystal Company ’s post at Terra Nova around dawn , VI , 12 , I followed the southerly route which Anderson had mapped out from the air .
The going was bad , for these jungles are always half impassable after a rain .
It must be the moisture that gives the tangled vines and creepers that leathery toughness ; a toughness so great that a knife has to work ten minutes on some of them .
By noon it was dryer — the vegetation getting soft and rubbery so that my knife went through it easily — but even then I could not make much speed .
These Carter oxygen masks are too heavy — just carrying one half wears an ordinary man out .
A Dubois mask with sponge - reservoir instead of tubes would give just as good air at half the weight .
The crystal - detector seemed to function well , pointing steadily in a direction verifying Anderson ’s report .
It is curious how that principle of affinity works — without any of the fakery of the old ‘ divining rods ’ back home .
There must be a great deposit of crystals within a thousand miles , though I suppose those damnable man-lizards always watch and guard it .
Possibly they think we are just as foolish for coming to Venus to hunt the stuff as we think they are for grovelling in the mud whenever they see a piece of it , or for keeping that great mass on a pedestal in their temple .
I wish they ’d get a new religion , for they have no use for the crystals except to pray to .
Barring theology , they would let us take all we want — and even if they learned to tap them for power there ’d be more than enough for their planet and the earth besides .
I for one am tired of passing up the main deposits and merely seeking separate crystals out of jungle river - beds .
Sometime I ’ll urge the wiping out of these scaly beggars by a good stiff army from home .
About twenty ships could bring enough troops across to turn the trick .
One ca n’t call the damned things men for all their ‘ cities ’ and towers .
They have n’t any skill except building — and using swords and poison darts — and I do n’t believe their so - called ‘ cities ’ mean much more than ant - hills or beaver - dams .
I doubt if they even have a real language — all the talk about psychological communication through those tentacles down their chests strikes me as bunk .
What misleads people is their upright posture ; just an accidental physical resemblance to terrestrial man .
I ’d like to go through a Venus jungle for once without having to watch out for skulking groups of them or dodge their cursed darts .
They may have been all right before we began to take the crystals , but they ’re certainly a bad enough nuisance now — with their dart - shooting and their cutting of our water pipes .
More and more I come to believe that they have a special sense like our crystal - detectors .
No one ever knew them to bother a man — apart from long - distance sniping — who did n’t have crystals on him .
Around 1 P.M. a dart nearly took my helmet off , and I thought for a second one of my oxygen tubes was punctured .
The sly devils had n’t made a sound , but three of them were closing in on me .
I got them all by sweeping in a circle with my flame pistol , for even though their colour blended with the jungle , I could spot the moving creepers .
One of them was fully eight feet tall , with a snout like a tapir’s .
The other two were average seven - footers .
All that makes them hold their own is sheer numbers — even a single regiment of flame throwers could raise hell with them .
It is curious , though , how they ’ve come to be dominant on the planet .
Not another living thing higher than the wriggling akmans and skorahs , or the flying tukahs of the other continent — unless of course those holes in the Dionaean Plateau hide something .
About two o’clock my detector veered westward , indicating isolated crystals ahead on the right .
This checked up with Anderson , and I turned my course accordingly .
It was harder going — not only because the ground was rising , but because the animal life and carnivorous plants were thicker .
I was always slashing ugrats and stepping on skorahs , and my leather suit was all speckled from the bursting darohs which struck it from all sides .
The sunlight was all the worse because of the mist , and did not seem to dry up the mud in the least .
Every time I stepped my feet sank down five or six inches , and there was a sucking sort of blup every time I pulled them out .
I wish somebody would invent a safe kind of suiting other than leather for this climate .
Cloth of course would rot ; but some thin metallic tissue that could n’t tear — like the surface of this revolving decay - proof record scroll — ought to be feasible sometime .
I ate about 3:30 — if slipping these wretched food tablets through my mask can be called eating .
Soon after that I noticed a decided change in the landscape — the bright , poisonous - looking flowers shifting in colour and getting wraith - like .
The outlines of everything shimmered rhythmically , and bright points of light appeared and danced in the same slow , steady tempo .
After that the temperature seemed to fluctuate in unison with a peculiar rhythmic drumming .
The whole universe seemed to be throbbing in deep , regular pulsations that filled every corner of space and flowed through my body and mind alike .
I lost all sense of equilibrium and staggered dizzily , nor did it change things in the least when I shut my eyes and covered my ears with my hands .
However , my mind was still clear , and in a very few minutes I realized what had happened .
I had encountered at last one of those curious mirage - plants about which so many of our men told stories .
Anderson had warned me of them , and described their appearance very closely — the shaggy stalk , the spiky leaves , and the mottled blossoms whose gaseous , dream - breeding exhalations penetrate every existing make of mask .
Recalling what happened to Bailey three years ago , I fell into a momentary panic , and began to dash and stagger about in the crazy , chaotic world which the plant ’s exhalations had woven around me .
Then good sense came back , and I realized all I need do was retreat from the dangerous blossoms — heading away from the source of the pulsations , and cutting a path blindly — regardless of what might seem to swirl around me — until safely out of the plant ’s effective radius .
Although everything was spinning perilously , I tried to start in the right direction and hack my way ahead .
My route must have been far from straight , for it seemed hours before I was free of the mirage - plant ’s pervasive influence .
Gradually the dancing lights began to disappear , and the shimmering spectral scenery began to assume the aspect of solidity .
When I did get wholly clear I looked at my watch and was astonished to find that the time was only 4:20 .
Though eternities had seemed to pass , the whole experience could have consumed little more than a half - hour .
Every delay , however , was irksome , and I had lost ground in my retreat from the plant .
I now pushed ahead in the uphill direction indicated by the crystal - detector , bending every energy toward making better time .
The jungle was still thick , though there was less animal life .
Once a carnivorous blossom engulfed my right foot and held it so tightly that I had to hack it free with my knife ; reducing the flower to strips before it let go .
In less than an hour I saw that the jungle growths were thinning out , and by five o’clock — after passing through a belt of tree - ferns with very little underbrush — I emerged on a broad mossy plateau .
My progress now became rapid , and I saw by the wavering of my detector - needle that I was getting relatively close to the crystal I sought .
This was odd , for most of the scattered , egg - like spheroids occurred in jungle streams of a sort not likely to be found on this treeless upland .
The terrain sloped upward , ending in a definite crest .
I reached the top about 5:30 and saw ahead of me a very extensive plain with forests in the distance .
This , without question , was the plateau mapped by Matsugawa from the air fifty years ago , and called on our maps ‘ Eryx ’ or the ‘ Erycinian Highland . ’
But what made my heart leap was a smaller detail , whose position could not have been far from the plain ’s exact centre .
It was a single point of light , blazing through the mist and seeming to draw a piercing , concentrated luminescence from the yellowish , vapour - dulled sunbeams .
This , without doubt , was the crystal I sought — a thing possibly no larger than a hen ’s egg , yet containing enough power to keep a city warm for a year .
I could hardly wonder , as I glimpsed the distant glow , that those miserable man-lizards worship such crystals .
And yet they have not the least notion of the powers they contain .
Breaking into a rapid run , I tried to reach the unexpected prize as soon as possible ; and was annoyed when the firm moss gave place to a thin , singularly detestable mud studded with occasional patches of weeds and creepers .
But I splashed on heedlessly — scarcely thinking to look around for any of the skulking man-lizards .
In this open space I was not very likely to be waylaid .
As I advanced , the light ahead seemed to grow in size and brilliancy , and I began to notice some peculiarity in its situation .
Clearly , this was a crystal of the very finest quality , and my elation grew with every spattering step .
It is now that I must begin to be careful in making my report , since what I shall henceforward have to say involves unprecedented — though fortunately verifiable — matters .
I was racing ahead with mounting eagerness , and had come within a hundred yards or so of the crystal — whose position on a sort of raised place in the omnipresent slime seemed very odd — when a sudden , overpowering force struck my chest and the knuckles of my clenched fists and knocked me over backward into the mud .
The splash of my fall was terrific , nor did the softness of the ground and the presence of some slimy weeds and creepers save my head from a bewildering jarring .
For a moment I lay supine , too utterly startled to think .
Then I half mechanically stumbled to my feet and began to scrape the worst of the mud and scum from my leather suit .
Of what I had encountered I could not form the faintest idea .
I had seen nothing which could have caused the shock , and I saw nothing now .
Had I , after all , merely slipped in the mud ?
My sore knuckles and aching chest forbade me to think so .
Or was this whole incident an illusion brought on by some hidden mirage - plant ?
It hardly seemed probable , since I had none of the usual symptoms , and since there was no place near by where so vivid and typical a growth could lurk unseen .
Had I been on the earth , I would have suspected a barrier of N - force laid down by some government to mark a forbidden zone , but in this humanless region such a notion would have been absurd .
Finally pulling myself together , I decided to investigate in a cautious way .
Holding my knife as far as possible ahead of me , so that it might be first to feel the strange force , I started once more for the shining crystal — preparing to advance step by step with the greatest deliberation .
At the third step I was brought up short by the impact of the knife — point on an apparently solid surface — a solid surface where my eyes saw nothing .
After a moment ’s recoil I gained boldness .
Extending my gloved left hands I verified the presence of invisible solid matter — or a tactile illusion of solid matter — ahead of me .
Upon moving my hand I found that the barrier was of substantial extent , and of an almost glassy smoothness , with no evidence of the joining of separate blocks .
Nerving myself for further experiments , I removed a glove and tested the thing with my bare hand .
It was indeed hard and glassy , and of a curious coldness as contrasted with the air around .
I strained my eyesight to the utmost in an effort to glimpse some trace of the obstructing substance , but could discern nothing whatsoever .
There was not even any evidence of refractive power as judged by the aspect of the landscape ahead .
Absence of reflective power was proved by the lack of a glowing image of the sun at any point .
Burning curiosity began to displace all other feelings , and I enlarged my investigations as best I could .
Exploring with my hands , I found that the barrier extended from the ground to some level higher than I could reach , and that it stretched off indefinitely on both sides .
It was , then , a wall of some kind — though all guesses as to its materials and its purpose were beyond me .
Again I thought of the mirage - plant and the dreams it induced , but a moment ’s reasoning put this out of my head .
Knocking sharply on the barrier with the hilt of my knife , and kicking at it with my heavy boots , I tried to interpret the sounds thus made .
There was something suggestive of cement or concrete in these reverberations , though my hands had found the surface more glassy or metallic in feel .
Certainly , I was confronting something strange beyond all previous experience .
The next logical move was to get some idea of the wall ’s dimensions .
The height problem would be hard , if not insoluble , but the length and shape problem could perhaps be sooner dealt with .
Stretching out my arms and pressing close to the barrier , I began to edge gradually to the left — keeping very careful track of the way I faced .
After several steps I concluded that the wall was not straight , but that I was following part of some vast circle or ellipse .
And then my attention was distracted by something wholly different — something connected with the still - distant crystal which had formed the object of my quest .
I have said that even from a great distance the shining object ’s position seemed indefinably queer — on a slight mound rising from the slime .
Now — at about a hundred yards —
I could see plainly despite the engulfing mist just what that mound was .
It was the body of a man in one of the Crystal Company ’s leather suits , lying on his back , and with his oxygen mask half buried in the mud a few inches away .
In his right hand , crushed convulsively against his chest , was the crystal which had led me here — a spheroid of incredible size , so large that the dead fingers could scarcely close over it .
Even at the given distance I could see that the body was a recent one .
There was little visible decay , and I reflected that in this climate such a thing meant death not more than a day before .
Soon the hateful farnoth - flies would begin to cluster about the corpse .
I wondered who the man was .
Surely no one I had seen on this trip .
It must have been one of the old - timers absent on a long roving commission , who had come to this especial region independently of Anderson ’s survey .
There he lay , past all trouble , and with the rays of the great crystal streaming out from between his stiffened fingers .
For fully five minutes I stood there staring in bewilderment and apprehension .
A curious dread assailed me , and I had an unreasonable impulse to run away .
It could not have been done by those slinking man-lizards , for he still held the crystal he had found .
Was there any connexion with the invisible wall ?
Where had he found the crystal ?
Anderson ’s instrument had indicated one in this quarter well before this man could have perished .
I now began to regard the unseen barrier as something sinister , and recoiled from it with a shudder .
Yet I knew I must probe the mystery all the more quickly and thoroughly because of this recent tragedy .
Suddenly — wrenching my mind back to the problem I faced — I thought of a possible means of testing the wall ’s height , or at least of finding whether or not it extended indefinitely upward .
Seizing a handful of mud , I let it drain until it gained some coherence and then flung it high in the air toward the utterly transparent barrier .
At a height of perhaps fourteen feet it struck the invisible surface with a resounding splash , disintegrating at once and oozing downward in disappearing streams with surprising rapidity .
Plainly , the wall was a lofty one .
A second handful , hurled at an even sharper angle , hit the surface about eighteen feet from the ground and disappeared as quickly as the first .
I now summoned up all my strength and prepared to throw a third handful as high as I possibly could .
Letting the mud drain , and squeezing it to maximum dryness , I flung it up so steeply that I feared it might not reach the obstructing surface at all .
It did , however , and this time it crossed the barrier and fell in the mud beyond with a violent spattering .
At last I had a rough idea of the height of the wall , for the crossing had evidently occurred some twenty or twenty - one feet aloft .
With a nineteen — or twenty - foot vertical wall of glassy flatness , ascent was clearly impossible .
I must , then , continue to circle the barrier in the hope of finding a gate , an ending , or some sort of interruption .
Did the obstacle form a complete round or other closed figure , or was it merely an arc or semi-circle ?
Acting on my decision , I resumed my slow leftward circling , moving my hands up and down over the unseen surface on the chance of finding some window or other small aperture .
Before starting , I tried to mark my position by kicking a hole in the mud , but found the slime too thin to hold any impression .
I did , though , gauge the place approximately by noting a tall cycad in the distant forest which seemed just on a line with the gleaming crystal a hundred yards away .
If no gate or break existed I could now tell when I had completely circumnavigated the wall .
I had not progressed far before I decided that the curvature indicated a circular enclosure of about a hundred yards ’ diameter — provided the outline was regular .
This would mean that the dead man lay near the wall at a point almost opposite the region where I had started .
Was he just inside or just outside the enclosure ?
This I would soon ascertain .
As I slowly rounded the barrier without finding any gate , window , or other break , I decided that the body was lying within .
On closer view the features of the dead man seemed vaguely disturbing .
I found something alarming in his expression , and in the way the glassy eyes stared .
By the time I was very near I believed I recognized him as Dwight , a veteran whom I had never known , but who was pointed out to me at the post last year .
The crystal he clutched was certainly a prize — the largest single specimen I had ever seen .
I was so near the body that I could — but for the barrier — have touched it , when my exploring left hand encountered a corner in the unseen surface .
In a second I had learned that there was an opening about three feet wide , extending from the ground to a height greater than I could reach .
There was no door , nor any evidence of hingemarks bespeaking a former door .
Without a moment ’s hesitation I stepped through and advanced two paces to the prostrate body — which lay at right angles to the hallway I had entered , in what seemed to be an intersecting doorless corridor .
It gave me a fresh curiosity to find that the interior of this vast enclosure was divided by partitions .
Bending to examine the corpse , I discovered that it bore no wounds .
This scarcely surprised me , since the continued presence of the crystal argued against the pseudo - reptilian natives .
Looking about for some possible cause of death , my eyes lit upon the oxygen mask lying close to the body ’s feet .
Here , indeed , was something significant .
Without this device no human being could breathe the air of Venus for more than thirty seconds , and Dwight — if it were he — had obviously lost his .
Probably it had been carelessly buckled , so that the weight of the tubes worked the straps loose — a thing which could not happen with a Dubois sponge - reservoir mask .
The half - minute of grace had been too short to allow the man to stoop and recover his protection — or else the cyanogen content of the atmosphere was abnormally high at the time .
Probably he had been busy admiring the crystal — wherever he may have found it .
He had , apparently , just taken it from the pouch in his suit , for the flap was unbuttoned .
I now proceeded to extricate the huge crystal from the dead prospector ’s fingers — a task which the body ’s stiffness made very difficult .
The spheroid was larger than a man ’s fist , and glowed as if alive in the reddish rays of the weltering sun .
As I touched the gleaming surface I shuddered involuntarily — as if by taking this precious object I had transferred to myself the doom which had overtaken its earlier bearer .
However , my qualms soon passed , and I carefully buttoned the crystal into the pouch of my leather suit .
Superstition has never been one of my failings .
Placing the man ’s helmet over his dead , staring face , I straightened up and stepped back through the unseen doorway to the entrance hall of the great enclosure .
All my curiosity about the strange edifice now returned , and I racked my brains with speculations regarding its material , origin , and purpose .
That the hands of men had reared it I could not for a moment believe .
Our ships first reached Venus only seventy - two years ago , and the only human beings on the planet have been those at Terra Nova .
Nor does human knowledge include any perfectly transparent , non-refractive solid such as the substance of this building .
Prehistoric human invasions of Venus can be pretty well ruled out , so that one must turn to the idea of native construction .
Did a forgotten race of highly - evolved beings precede the man-lizards as masters of Venus ?
Despite their elaborately - built cities , it seemed hard to credit the pseudo - reptiles with anything of this kind .
There must have been another race aeons ago , of which this is perhaps the last relique .
Or will other ruins of kindred origin be found by future expeditions ?
The purpose of such a structure passes all conjecture — but its strange and seemingly non-practical material suggests a religious use .
Realizing my inability to solve these problems , I decided that all I could do was to explore the invisible structure itself .
That various rooms and corridors extended over the seemingly unbroken plain of mud I felt convinced ; and I believed that a knowledge of their plan might lead to something significant .
So , feeling my way back through the doorway and edging past the body , I began to advance along the corridor toward those interior regions whence the dead man had presumably come .
Later on I would investigate the hallway I had left .
Groping like a blind man despite the misty sunlight , I moved slowly onward .
Soon the corridor turned sharply and began to spiral in toward the centre in ever - diminishing curves .
Now and then my touch would reveal a doorless intersecting passage , and I several times encountered junctions with two , three , and four diverging avenues .
In these latter cases I always followed the inmost route , which seemed to form a continuation of the one I had been traversing .
There would be plenty of time to examine the branches after I had reached and returned from the main regions .
I can scarcely describe the strangeness of the experience — threading the unseen ways of an invisible structure reared by forgotten hands on an alien planet !
At last , still stumbling and groping , I felt the corridor end in a sizeable open space .
Fumbling about , I found I was in a circular chamber about ten feet across ; and from the position of the dead man against certain distant forest landmarks I judged that this chamber lay at or near the centre of the edifice .
Out of it opened five corridors besides the one through which I had entered , but I kept the latter in mind by sighting very carefully past the body to a particular tree on the horizon as I stood just within the entrance .
There was nothing in this room to distinguish it — merely the floor of thin mud which was everywhere present .
Wondering whether this part of the building had any roof , I repeated my experiment with an upward - flung handful of mud , and found at once that no covering existed .
If there had ever been one , it must have fallen long ago , for not a trace of debris or scattered blocks ever halted my feet .
As I reflected , it struck me as distinctly odd that this apparently primordial structure should be so devoid of tumbling masonry , gaps in the walls , and other common attributes of dilapidation .
What was it ?
What had it ever been ?
Of what was it made ?
Why was there no evidence of separate blocks in the glassy , bafflingly homogenous walls ?
Why were there no traces of doors , either interior or exterior ?
I knew only that I was in a round , roofless , doorless edifice of some hard , smooth , perfectly transparent , non-refractive and non-reflective material , a hundred yards in diameter , with many corridors , and with a small circular room at the centre .
More than this I could never learn from a direct investigation .
I now observed that the sun was sinking very low in the west — a golden - ruddy disc floating in a pool of scarlet and orange above the mist - clouded trees of the horizon .
Plainly , I would have to hurry if I expected to choose a sleeping - spot on dry ground before dark .
I had long before decided to camp for the night on the firm , mossy rim of the plateau near the crest whence I had first spied the shining crystal , trusting to my usual luck to save me from an attack by the man-lizards .
It has always been my contention that we ought to travel in parties of two or more , so that someone can be on guard during sleeping hours , but the really small number of night attacks makes the Company careless about such things .
Those scaly wretches seem to have difficulty in seeing at night , even with curious glow torches .
Having picked out again the hallway through which I had come , I started to return to the structure ’s entrance .
Additional exploration could wait for another day .
Groping a course as best I could through the spiral corridors — with only general sense , memory , and a vague recognition of some of the ill - defined weed patches on the plain as guides — I soon found myself once more in close proximity to the corpse .
There were now one or two farnoth flies swooping over the helmet - covered face , and I knew that decay was setting in .
With a futile instinctive loathing I raised my hand to brush away his vanguard of the scavengers — when a strange and astonishing thing became manifest .
An invisible wall , checking the sweep of my arm , told me that — notwithstanding my careful retracing of the way — I had not indeed returned to the corridor in which the body lay .
Instead , I was in a parallel hallway , having no doubt taken some wrong turn or fork among the intricate passages behind .
Hoping to find a doorway to the exit hall ahead , I continued my advance , but presently came to a blank wall .
I would , then , have to return to the central chamber and steer my course anew .
Exactly where I had made my mistake I could not tell .
I glanced at the ground to see if by any miracle guiding footprints had remained , but at once realized that the thin mud held impressions only for a very few moments .
There was little difficulty in finding my way to the centre again , and once there I carefully reflected on the proper outward course .
I had kept too far to the right before .
This time I must take a more leftward fork somewhere — just where , I could decide as I went .
As I groped ahead a second time I felt quite confident of my correctness , and diverged to the left at a junction I was sure I remembered .
The spiralling continued , and I was careful not to stray into any intersecting passages .
Soon , however , I saw to my disgust that I was passing the body at a considerable distance ; this passage evidently reached the outer wall at a point much beyond it .
In the hope that another exit might exist in the half of the wall I had not yet explored , I pressed forward for several paces , but eventually came once more to a solid barrier .
Clearly , the plan of the building was even more complicated than I had thought .
I now debated whether to return to the centre again or whether to try some of the lateral corridors extending toward the body .
If I chose this second alternative , I would run the risk of breaking my mental pattern of where I was ; hence I had better not attempt it unless I could think of some way of leaving a visible trail behind me .
Just how to leave a trail would be quite a problem , and I ransacked my mind for a solution .
There seemed to be nothing about my person which could leave a mark on anything , nor any material which I could scatter — or minutely subdivide and scatter .
My pen had no effect on the invisible wall , and I could not lay a trail of my precious food tablets .
Even had I been willing to spare the latter , there would not have been even nearly enough — besides which the small pellets would have instantly sunk from sight in the thin mud .
I searched my pockets for an old - fashioned note - book — often used unofficially on Venus despite the quick rotting - rate of paper in the planet ’s atmosphere — whose pages I could tear up and scatter , but could find none .
It was obviously impossible to tear the tough , thin metal of this revolving decay - proof record scroll , nor did my clothing offer any possibilities .
In Venus ’s peculiar atmosphere I could not safely spare my stout leather suit , and underwear had been eliminated because of the climate .
I tried to smear mud on the smooth , invisible walls after squeezing it as dry as possible , but found that it slipped from sight as quickly as did the height - testing handfuls I had previously thrown .
Finally I drew out my knife and attempted to scratch a line on the glassy , phantom surface — something I could recognize with my hand , even though I would not have the advantage of seeing it from afar .
It was useless , however , for the blade made not the slightest impression on the baffling , unknown material .
Frustrated in all attempts to blaze a trail , I again sought the round central chamber through memory .
It seemed easier to act back to this room than to steer a definite , predetermined course away from it , and I had little difficulty in finding it anew .
This time I listed on my record scroll every turn I made — drawing a crude hypothetical diagram of my route , and marking all diverging corridors .
It was , of course , maddeningly slow work when everything had to be determined by touch , and the possibilities of error were infinite ; but I believed it would pay in the long run .
The long twilight of Venus was thick when I reached the central room , but I still had hopes of gaining the outside before dark .
Comparing my fresh diagram with previous recollections , I believed I had located my original mistake , so once more set out confidently along the invisible hall - ways .
I veered further to the left than during my previous attempts , and tried to keep track of my turnings on the records scroll in case I was still mistaken .
In the gathering dusk I could see the dim line of the corpse , now the centre of a loathsome cloud of farnoth - flies .
Before long , no doubt , the mud-dwelling sificlighs would be oozing in from the plain to complete the ghastly work .
Approaching the body with some reluctance I was preparing to step past it when a sudden collision with a wall told me I was again astray .
I now realized plainly that I was lost .
The complications of this building were too much for offhand solution , and I would probably have to do some careful checking before I could hope to emerge .
Still , I was eager to get to dry ground before total darkness set in ; hence I returned once more to the centre and began a rather aimless series of trials and errors — making notes by the light of my electric lamp .
When I used this device I noticed with interest that it produced no reflection — not even the faintest glistening — in the transparent walls around me .
I was , however , prepared for this ; since the sun had at no time formed a gleaming image in the strange material .
I was still groping about when the dusk became total .
A heavy mist obscured most of the stars and planets , but the earth was plainly visible as a glowing , bluish - green point in the southeast .
It was just past opposition , and would have been a glorious sight in a telescope .
I could even make out the moon beside it whenever the vapours momentarily thinned .
It was now impossible to see the corpse — my only landmark — so I blundered back to the central chamber after a few false turns .
After all , I would have to give up hope of sleeping on dry ground .
Nothing could be done till daylight , and I might as well make the best of it here .
Lying down in the mud would not be pleasant , but in my leather suit it could be done .
On former expeditions I had slept under even worse conditions , and now sheer exhaustion would help to conquer repugnance .
So here I am , squatting in the slime of the central room and making these notes on my record scroll by the light of the electric lamp .
There is something almost humorous in my strange , unprecedented plight .
Lost in a building without doors — a building which I can not see !
I shall doubtless get out early in the morning , and ought to be back at Terra Nova with the crystal by late afternoon .
It certainly is a beauty — with surprising lustre even in the feeble light of this lamp .
I have just had it out examining it .
Despite my fatigue , sleep is slow in coming , so I find myself writing at great length .
I must stop now .
Not much danger of being bothered by those cursed natives in this place .
The thing I like least is the corpse — but fortunately my oxygen mask saves me from the worst effects .
I am using the chlorate cubes very sparingly .
Will take a couple of food tablets now and turn in .
More later .
LATER — AFTERNOON , VI , 13
There has been more trouble than I expected .
I am still in the building , and will have to work quickly and wisely if I expect to rest on dry ground tonight .
It took me a long time to get to sleep , and I did not wake till almost noon today .
As it was , I would have slept longer but for the glare of the sun through the haze .
The corpse was a rather bad sight — wriggling with sificlighs , and with a cloud of farnoth - flies around it .
Something had pushed the helmet away from the face , and it was better not to look at it .
I was doubly glad of my oxygen mask when I thought of the situation .
At length I shook and brushed myself dry , took a couple of food tablets , and put a new potassium chlorate cube in the electrolyser of the mask .
I am using these cubes slowly , but wish I had a larger supply .
I felt much better after my sleep , and expected to get out of the building very shortly .
Consulting the notes and sketches I had jotted down , I was impressed by the complexity of the hallways , and by the possibility that I had made a fundamental error .
Of the six openings leading out of the central space , I had chosen a certain one as that by which I had entered — using a sighting - arrangement as a guide .
When I stood just within the opening , the corpse fifty yards away was exactly in line with a particular lepidodendron in the far - off forest .
Now it occurred to me that this sighting might not have been of sufficient accuracy — the distance of the corpse making its difference of direction in relation to the horizon comparatively slight when viewed from the openings next to that of my first ingress .
Moreover , the tree did not differ as distinctly as it might from other lepidodendra on the horizon .
Putting the matter to a test , I found to my chagrin that I could not be sure which of three openings was the right one .
Had I traversed a different set of windings at each attempted exit ?
This time I would be sure .
It struck me that despite the impossibility of trail - blazing there was one marker I could leave .
Though I could not spare my suit , I could — because of my thick head of hair — spare my helmet ; and this was large and light enough to remain visible above the thin mud .
Accordingly I removed the roughly hemi-spherical device and laid it at the entrance of one of the corridors — the right - hand one of the three I must try .
I would follow this corridor on the assumption that it was correct ; repeating what I seemed to recall as the proper turns , and constantly consulting and making notes .
If I did not get out , I would systematically exhaust all possible variations ; and if these failed , I would proceed to cover the avenues extending from the next opening in the same way — continuing to the third opening if necessary .
Sooner or later I could not avoid hitting the right path to the exit , but I must use patience .
Even at worst , I could scarcely fail to reach the open plain in time for a dry night ’s sleep .
Immediate results were rather discouraging , though they helped me eliminate the right - hand opening in little more than an hour .
Only a succession of blind alleys , each ending at a great distance from the corpse , seemed to branch from this hallway ; and I saw very soon that it had not figured at all in the previous afternoon ’s wanderings .
As before , however , I always found it relatively easy to grope back to the central chamber .
About 1 P.M.
I shifted my helmet marker to the next opening and began to explore the hallways beyond it .
At first I thought I recognized the turnings , but soon found myself in a wholly unfamiliar set of corridors .
I could not get near the corpse , and this time seemed cut off from the central chamber as well , even though I thought I had recorded every move I made .
There seemed to be tricky twists and crossings too subtle for me to capture in my crude diagrams , and I began to develop a kind of mixed anger and discouragement .
While patience would of course win in the end , I saw that my searching would have to be minute , tireless and long - continued .
Two o’clock found me still wandering vainly through strange corridors — constantly feeling my way , looking alternately at my helmet and at the corpse , and jotting data on my scroll with decreasing confidence .
I cursed the stupidity and idle curiosity which had drawn me into this tangle of unseen walls — reflecting that if I had let the thing alone and headed back as soon as I had taken the crystal from the body , I would even now be safe at Terra Nova .
Suddenly it occurred to me that I might be able to tunnel under the invisible walls with my knife , and thus effect a short cut to the outside — or to some outward - leading corridor .
I had no means of knowing how deep the building ’s foundations were , but the omnipresent mud argued the absence of any floor save the earth .
Facing the distant and increasingly horrible corpse , I began a course of feverish digging with the broad , sharp blade .
There was about six inches of semi-liquid mud , below which the density of the soil increased sharply .
This lower soil seemed to be of a different colour — a greyish clay rather like the formations near Venus ’s north pole .
As I continued downward close to the unseen barrier I saw that the ground was getting harder and harder .
Watery mud rushed into the excavation as fast as I removed the clay , but I reached through it and kept on working .
If I could bore any kind of a passage beneath the wall , the mud would not stop my wriggling out .
About three feet down , however , the hardness of the soil halted my digging seriously .
Its tenacity was beyond anything I had encountered before , even on this planet , and was linked with an anomalous heaviness .
My knife had to split and chip the tightly packed clay , and the fragments I brought up were like solid stones or bits of metal .
Finally even this splitting and chipping became impossible , and I had to cease my work with no lower edge of wall in reach .
The hour - long attempt was a wasteful as well as futile one , for it used up great stores of my energy and forced me both to take an extra food tablet , and to put an additional chlorate cube in the oxygen mask .
It has also brought a pause in the day ’s gropings , for I am still much too exhausted to walk .
After cleaning my hands and arms of the worst of the mud I sat down to write these notes — leaning against an invisible wall and facing away from the corpse .
That body is simply a writhing mass of vermin now — the odour has begun to draw some of the slimy akmans from the far - off jungle .
I notice that many of the efjeh - weeds on the plain are reaching out necrophagous feelers toward the thing ; but I doubt if any are long enough to reach it .
I wish some really carnivorous organisms like the skorahs would appear , for then they might scent me and wriggle a course through the building toward me .
Things like that have an odd sense of direction .
I could watch them as they came , and jot down their approximate route if they failed to form a continuous line .
Even that would be a great help .
When I met any the pistol would make short work of them .
But I can hardly hope for as much as that .
Now that these notes are made I shall rest a while longer , and later will do some more groping .
As soon as I get back to the central chamber — which ought to be fairly easy — I shall try the extreme left - hand opening .
Perhaps I can get outside by dusk after all .
NIGHT — VI , 13
New trouble .
My escape will be tremendously difficult , for there are elements I had not suspected .
Another night here in the mud , and a fight on my hands tomorrow .
I cut my rest short and was up and groping again by four o’clock .
After about fifteen minutes I reached the central chamber and moved my helmet to mark the last of the three possible doorways .
Starting through this opening , I seemed to find the going more familiar , but was brought up short less than five minutes by a sight that jolted me more than I can describe .
It was a group of four or five of those detestable man-lizards emerging from the forest far off across the plain .
I could not see them distinctly at that distance , but thought they paused and turned toward the trees to gesticulate , after which they were joined by fully a dozen more .
The augmented party now began to advance directly toward the invisible building , and as they approached I studied them carefully .
I had never before had a close view of the things outside the steamy shadows of the jungle .
The resemblance to reptiles was perceptible , though I knew it was only an apparent one , since these beings have no point of contact with terrestrial life .
When they drew nearer they seemed less truly reptilian — only the flat head and the green , slimy , frog - like skin carrying out the idea .
They walked erect on their odd , thick stumps , and their suction - discs made curious noises in the mud .
These were average specimens , about seven feet in height , and with four long , ropy pectoral tentacles .
The motions of those tentacles — if the theories of Fogg , Ekberg , and Janat are right , which I formerly doubted but am now more ready to believe — indicate that the things were in animated conversation .
I drew my flame pistol and was ready for a hard fight .
The odds were bad , but the weapon gave me a certain advantage .
If the things knew this building they would come through it after me , and in this way would form a key to getting out ; just as carnivorous skorahs might have done .
That they would attack me seemed certain ; for even though they could not see the crystal in my pouch , they could divine its presence through that special sense of theirs .
Yet , surprisingly enough , they did not attack me .
Instead they scattered and formed a vast circle around me — at a distance which indicated that they were pressing close to the unseen wall .
Standing there in a ring , the beings stared silently and inquisitively at me , waving their tentacles and sometimes nodding their heads and gesturing with their upper limbs .
After a while I saw others issue from the forest , and these advanced and joined the curious crowd .
Those near the corpse looked briefly at it but made no move to disturb it .
It was a horrible sight , yet the man-lizards seemed quite unconcerned .
Now and then one of them would brush away the farnoth - flies with its limbs or tentacles , or crush a wriggling sificligh or akman , or an out - reaching efjeh - weed , with the suction discs on its stumps .
Staring back at these grotesque and unexpected intruders , and wondering uneasily why they did not attack me at once , I lost for the time being the will - power and nervous energy to continue my search for a way out .
Instead I leaned limply against the invisible wall of the passage where I stood , letting my wonder merge gradually into a chain of the wildest speculations .
A hundred mysteries which had previously baffled me seemed all at once to take on a new and sinister significance , and I trembled with an acute fear unlike anything I had experienced before .
I believed I knew why these repulsive beings were hovering expectantly around me .
I believed , too , that I had the secret of the transparent structure at last .
The alluring crystal which I had seized , the body of the man who had seized it before me — all these things began to acquire a dark and threatening meaning .
It was no common series of mischances which had made me lose my way in this roofless , unseen tangle of corridors .
Far from it .
Beyond doubt , the place was a genuine maze — a labyrinth deliberately built by these hellish things whose craft and mentality I had so badly underestimated .
Might I not have suspected this before , knowing of their uncanny architectural skill ?
The purpose was all too plain .
It was a trap — a trap set to catch human beings , and with the crystal spheroid as bait .
These reptilian things , in their war on the takers of crystals , had turned to strategy and were using our own cupidity against us .
Dwight — if this rotting corpse were indeed he — was a victim .
He must have been trapped some time ago , and had failed to find his way out .
Lack of water had doubtless maddened him , and perhaps he had run out of chlorate cubes as well .
Probably his mask had not slipped accidentally after all .
Suicide was a likelier thing .
Rather than face a lingering death he had solved the issue by removing the mask deliberately and letting the lethal atmosphere do its work at once .
The horrible irony of his fate lay in his position — only a few feet from the saving exit he had failed to find .
One minute more of searching and he would have been safe .
And now I was trapped as he had been .
Trapped , and with this circling herd of curious starers to mock at my predicament .
The thought was maddening , and as it sank in I was seized with a sudden flash of panic which set me running aimlessly through the unseen hallways .
For several moments I was essentially a maniac — stumbling , tripping , bruising myself on the invisible walls , and finally collapsing in the mud as a panting , lacerated heap of mindless , bleeding flesh .
The fall sobered me a bit , so that when I slowly struggled to my feet I could notice things and exercise my reason .
The circling watchers were swaying their tentacles in an odd , irregular way suggestive of sly , alien laughter , and I shook my fist savagely at them as I rose .
My gesture seemed to increase their hideous mirth — a few of them clumsily imitating it with their greenish upper limbs .
Shamed into sense , I tried to collect my faculties and take stock of the situation .
After all , I was not as badly off as Dwight has been .
Unlike him , I knew what the situation was — and forewarned is forearmed .
I had proof that the exit was attainable in the end , and would not repeat his tragic act of impatient despair .
The body — or skeleton , as it would soon be — was constantly before me as a guide to the sought — for aperture , and dogged patience would certainly take me to it if I worked long and intelligently enough .
I had , however , the disadvantage of being surrounded by these reptilian devils .
Now that I realized the nature of the trap — whose invisible material argued a science and technology beyond anything on earth — I could no longer discount the mentality and resources of my enemies .
Even with my flame - pistol I would have a bad time getting away — though boldness and quickness would doubtless see me through in the long run .
But first I must reach the exterior — unless I could lure or provoke some of the creatures to advance toward me .
As I prepared my pistol for action and counted over my generous supply of ammunition it occurred to me to try the effect of its blasts on the invisible walls .
Had I overlooked a feasible means of escape ?
There was no clue to the chemical composition of the transparent barrier , and conceivably it might be something which a tongue of fire could cut like cheese .
Choosing a section facing the corpse , I carefully discharged the pistol at close range and felt with my knife where the blast had been aimed .
Nothing was changed .
I had seen the flame spread when it struck the surface , and now I realized that my hope had been vain .
Only a long , tedious search for the exit would ever bring me to the outside .
So , swallowing another food tablet and putting another cube in the elecrolyser of my mask , I recommenced the long quest ; retracing my steps to the central chamber and starting out anew .
I constantly consulted my notes and sketches , and made fresh ones — taking one false turn after another , but staggering on in desperation till the afternoon light grew very dim .
As I persisted in my quest I looked from time to time at the silent circle of mocking stares , and noticed a gradual replacement in their ranks .
Every now and then a few would return to the forest , while others would arrive to take their places .
The more I thought of their tactics the less I liked them , for they gave me a hint of the creatures ’ possible motives .
At any time these devils could have advanced and fought me , but they seemed to prefer watching my struggles to escape .
I could not but infer that they enjoyed the spectacle — and this made me shrink with double force from the prospect of falling into their hands .
With the dark I ceased my searching , and sat down in the mud to rest .
Now I am writing in the light of my lamp , and will soon try to get some sleep .
I hope tomorrow will see me out ; for my canteen is low , and lacol tablets are a poor substitute for water .
I would hardly dare to try the moisture in this slime , for none of the water in the mud-regions is potable except when distilled .
That is why we run such long pipe lines to the yellow clay regions — or depend on rain - water when those devils find and cut our pipes .
I have none too many chlorate cubes either , and must try to cut down my oxygen consumption as much as I can .
My tunnelling attempt of the early afternoon , and my later panic flight , burned up a perilous amount of air .
Tomorrow I will reduce physical exertion to the barest minimum until I meet the reptiles and have to deal with them .
I must have a good cube supply for the journey back to Terra Nova .
My enemies are still on hand ; I can see a circle of their feeble glow - torches around me .
There is a horror about those lights which will keep me awake .
NIGHT — VI , 14
Another full day of searching and still no way out !
I am beginning to be worried about the water problem , for my canteen went dry at noon .
In the afternoon there was a burst of rain , and I went back to the central chamber for the helmet which I had left as a marker — using this as a bowl and getting about two cupfuls of water .
I drank most of it , but have put the slight remainder in my canteen .
Lacol tablets make little headway against real thirst , and I hope there will be more rain in the night .
I am leaving my helmet bottom up to catch any that falls .
Food tablets are none too plentiful , but not dangerously low .
I shall halve my rations from now on .
The chlorate cubes are my real worry , for even without violent exercise the day ’s endless tramping burned a dangerous number .
I feel weak from my forced economies in oxygen , and from my constantly mounting thirst .
When I reduce my food I suppose I shall feel still weaker .
There is something damnable — something uncanny — about this labyrinth .
I could swear that I had eliminated certain turns through charting , and yet each new trial belies some assumption I had thought established .
Never before did I realize how lost we are without visual landmarks .
A blind man might do better — but for most of us sight is the king of the senses .
The effect of all these fruitless wanderings is one of profound discouragement .
I can understand how poor Dwight must have felt .
His corpse is now just a skeleton , and the sificlighs and akmans and farnoth - flies are gone .
The efjen - weeds are nipping the leather clothing to pieces , for they were longer and faster - growing than I had expected .
And all the while those relays of tentacled starers stand gloatingly around the barrier laughing at me and enjoying my misery .
Another day and I shall go mad if I do not drop dead from exhaustion .
However , there is nothing to do but persevere .
Dwight would have got out if he had kept on a minute longer .
It is just possible that somebody from Terra Nova will come looking for me before long , although this is only my third day out .
My muscles ache horribly , and I can’t seem to rest at all lying down in this loathesome mud .
Last night , despite my terrific fatigue , I slept only fitfully , and tonight I fear will be no better .
I live in an endless nightmare — poised between waking and sleeping , yet neither truly awake nor truly asleep .
My hand shakes , I can write no more for the time being .
That circle of feeble glow - torches is hideous .
LATE AFTERNOON — VI , 15
Substantial progress !
Looks good .
Very weak , and did not sleep much till daylight .
Then I dozed till noon , though without being at all rested .
No rain , and thirst leaves me very weak .
Ate an extra food tablet to keep me going , but without water it did n’t help much .
I dared to try a little of the slime water just once , but it made me violently sick and left me even thirstier than before .
Must save chlorate cubes , so am nearly suffocating for lack of oxygen .
Ca n’t walk much of the time , but manage to crawl in the mud .
About 2 P.M.
I thought I recognized some passages , and got substantially nearer to the corpse — or skeleton — than I had been since the first day ’s trials .
I was sidetracked once in a blind alley , but recovered the main trail with the aid of my chart and notes .
The trouble with these jottings is that there are so many of them .
They must cover three feet of the record scroll , and I have to stop for long periods to untangle them .
My head is weak from thirst , suffocation , and exhaustion , and I cannot understand all I have set down .
Those damnable green things keep staring and laughing with their tentacles , and sometimes they gesticulate in a way that makes me think they share some terrible joke just beyond my perception .
It was three o’clock when I really struck my stride .
There was a doorway which , according to my notes , I had not traversed before ; and when I tried it I found I could crawl circuitously toward the weed - twined skeleton .
The route was a sort of spiral , much like that by which I had first reached the central chamber .
Whenever I came to a lateral doorway or junction I would keep to the course which seemed best to repeat that original journey .
As I circled nearer and nearer to my gruesome landmark , the watchers outside intensified their cryptic gesticulations and sardonic silent laughter .
Evidently they saw something grimly amusing in my progress — perceiving no doubt how helpless I would be in any encounter with them .
I was content to leave them to their mirth ; for although I realized my extreme weakness , I counted on the flame pistol and its numerous extra magazines to get me through the vile reptilian phalanx .
Hope now soared high , but I did not attempt to rise to my feet .
Better crawl now , and save my strength for the coming encounter with the man-lizards .
My advance was very slow , and the danger of straying into some blind alley very great , but nonetheless I seemed to curve steadily toward my osseous goal .
The prospect gave me new strength , and for the nonce I ceased to worry about my pain , my thirst , and my scant supply of cubes .
The creatures were now all massing around the entrance — gesturing , leaping , and laughing with their tentacles .
Soon , I reflected , I would have to face the entire horde — and perhaps such reinforcements as they would receive from the forest .
I am now only a few yards from the skeleton , and am pausing to make this entry before emerging and breaking through the noxious band of entities .
I feel confident that with my last ounce of strength I can put them to flight despite their numbers , for the range of this pistol is tremendous .
Then a camp on the dry moss at the plateau ’s edge , and in the morning a weary trip through the jungle to Terra Nova .
I shall be glad to see living men and the buildings of human beings again .
The teeth of that skull gleam and grin horribly .
TOWARD NIGHT — VI , I 5
Horror and despair .
Baffled again !
After making the previous entry I approached still closer to the skeleton , but suddenly encountered an intervening wall .
I had been deceived once more , and was apparently back where I had been three days before , on my first futile attempt to leave the labyrinth .
Whether I screamed aloud I do not know — perhaps I was too weak to utter a sound .
I merely lay dazed in the mud for a long period , while the greenish things outside leaped and laughed and gestured .
After a time I became more fully conscious .
My thirst and weakness and suffocation were fast gaining on me , and with my last bit of strength I put a new cube in the electrolyser — recklessly , and without regard for the needs of my journey to Terra Nova .
The fresh oxygen revived me slightly , and enabled me to look about more alertly .
It seemed as if I were slightly more distant from poor Dwight than I had been at that first disappointment , and I dully wondered if I could be in some other corridor a trifle more remote .
With this faint shadow of hope I laboriously dragged myself forward — but after a few feet encountered a dead end as I had on the former occasion .
This , then , was the end .
Three days had taken me nowhere , and my strength was gone .
I would soon go mad from thirst , and I could no longer count on cubes enough to get me back .
I feebly wondered why the nightmare things had gathered so thickly around the entrance as they mocked me .
Probably this was part of the mockery — to make me think I was approaching an egress which they knew did not exist .
I shall not last long , though I am resolved not to hasten matters as Dwight did .
His grinning skull has just turned toward me , shifted by the groping of one of the efjeh - weeds that are devouring his leather suit .
The ghoulish stare of those empty eye - sockets is worse than the staring of those lizard horrors .
It lends a hideous meaning to that dead , white - toothed grin .
I shall lie very still in the mud and save all the strength I can .
This record — which I hope may reach and warn those who come after me — will soon be done .
After I stop writing I shall rest a long while .
Then , when it is too dark for those frightful creatures to see , I shall muster up my last reserves of strength and try to toss the record scroll over the wall and the intervening corridor to the plain outside .
I shall take care to send it toward the left , where it will not hit the leaping band of mocking beleaguers .
Perhaps it will be lost forever in the thin mud — but perhaps it will land in some widespread clump of weeds and ultimately reach the hands of men .
If it does survive to be read , I hope it may do more than merely warn men of this trap .
I hope it may teach our race to let those shining crystals stay where they are .
They belong to Venus alone .
Our planet does not truly need them , and I believe we have violated some obscure and mysterious law — some law buried deep in the arcane of the cosmos — in our attempts to take them .
Who can tell what dark , potent , and widespread forces spur on these reptilian things who guard their treasure so strangely ?
Dwight and I have paid , as others have paid and will pay .
But it may be that these scattered deaths are only the prelude of greater horrors to come .
Let us leave to Venus that which belongs only to Venus .
I am very near death now , and fear I may not be able to throw the scroll when dusk comes .
If I cannot , I suppose the man-lizards will seize it , for they will probably realize what it is .
They will not wish anyone to be warned of the labyrinth — and they will not know that my message holds a plea in their own behalf .
As the end approaches I feel more kindly towards the things .
In the scale of cosmic entity who can say which species stands higher , or more nearly approaches a space - wide organic norm — theirs or mine ?
I have just taken the great crystal out of my pouch to look at in my last moments .
It shines fiercely and menacingly in the red rays of the dying day .
The leaping horde have noticed it , and their gestures have changed in a way I cannot understand .
I wonder why they keep clustered around the entrance instead of concentrating at a still closer point in the transparent wall .
I am growing numb and cannot write much more .
Things whirl around me , yet I do not lose consciousness .
Can I throw this over the wall ?
That crystal glows so , yet the twilight is deepening .
Dark .
Very weak .
They are still laughing and leaping around the doorway , and have started those hellish glow - torches .
Are they going away ?
I dreamed I heard a sound ... light in the sky .
REPORT OF WESLEY P. MILLER , SUPT .
GROUP A , VENUS CRYSTAL CO .
( TERRA NOVA ON VENUS — Vl , 16 )
Our Operative A - 49 , Kenton J. Stanfield of 5317 Marshall Street , Richmond , Va. , left Terra Nova early on VI , 12 , for a short - term trip indicated by detector .
Due back 13th or 14th .
Did not appear by evening of 15th , so Scouting Plane FR - 58 with five men under my command set out at 8 P.M. to follow route with detector .
Needle showed no change from earlier readings .
Followed needle to Erycinian Highland , played strong searchlights all the way .
Triple - range flame - guns and D-radiation cylinders could have dispersed any ordinary hostile force of natives , or any dangerous aggregation of carnivorous skorahs .
When over the open plain on Eryx we saw a group of moving lights which we knew were native glow - torches .
As we approached , they scattered into the forest .
Probably seventy - five to a hundred in all .
Detector indicated crystal on spot where they had been .
Sailing low over this spot , our lights picked out objects on the ground .
Skeleton tangled in efjeh - weeds , and complete body ten feet from it .
Brought plane down near bodies , and corner of wing crashed on unseen obstruction .
Approaching bodies on foot , we came up short against a smooth , invisible barrier which puzzled us enormously .
Feeling along it near the skeleton , we struck an opening , beyond which was a space with another opening leading to the skeleton .
The latter , though robbed of clothing by weeds , had one of the company ’s numbered metal helmets beside it .
It was Operative B - 9 , Frederick N. Dwight of Koenig ’s division , who had been out of Terra Nova for two months on a long commission .
Between this skeleton and the complete body there seemed to be another wall , but we could easily identify the second man as Stanfield .
He had a record scroll in his left hand and a pen in his right , and seemed to have been writing when he died .
No crystal was visible , but the detector indicated a huge specimen near Stanfield ’s body .
We had great difficulty in getting at Stanfield , but finally succeeded .
The body was still warm , and a great crystal lay beside it , covered by the shallow mud .
We at once studied the record scroll in the left hand , and prepared to take certain steps based on its data .
The contents of the scroll forms the long narrative prefixed to this report ; a narrative whose main descriptions we have verified , and which we append as an explanation of what was found .
The later parts of this account show mental decay , but there is no reason to doubt the bulk of it .
Stanfield obviously died of a combination of thirst , suffocation , cardiac strain , and psychological depression .
His mask was in place , and freely generating oxygen despite an alarmingly low cube supply .
Our plane being damaged , we sent a wireless and called out Anderson with Repair Plane PG - 7 , a crew of wreckers , and a set of blasting materials .
By morning FH - 58 was fixed , and went back under Anderson carrying the two bodies and the crystal .
We shall bury Dwight and Stanfield in the company graveyard , and ship the crystal to Chicago on the next earth - bound liner .
Later , we shall adopt Stanfield ’s suggestion — the sound one in the saner , earlier part of his report — and bring across enough troops to wipe out the natives altogether .
With a clear field , there can be scarcely any limit to the amount of crystal we can secure .
In the afternoon we studied the invisible building or trap with great care , exploring it with the aid of long guiding cords , and preparing a complete chart for our archives .
We were much impressed by the design , and shall keep specimens of the substance for chemical analysis .
All such knowledge will be useful when we take over the various cities of the natives .
Our type C diamond drills were able to bite into the unseen material , and wreckers are now planting dynamite preparatory to a thorough blasting .
Nothing will be left when we are done .
The edifice forms a distinct menace to aerial and other possible traffic .
In considering the plan of the labyrinth one is impressed not only with the irony of Dwight ’s fate , but with that of Stanfield as well .
When trying to reach the second body from the skeleton , we could find no access on the right , but Markheim found a doorway from the first inner space some fifteen feet past Dwight and four or five past Stanfield .
Beyond this was a long hall which we did not explore till later , but on the right - hand side of that hall was another doorway leading directly to the body .
Stanfield could have reached the outside entrance by walking twenty - two or twenty - three feet if he had found the opening which lay directly behind him — an opening which he overlooked in his exhaustion and despair .

Microsoft just showed off Crackdown 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 at its E3 conference and said both were exclusive to Xbox 360 .
Crackdown 2 is due out in 2010 from Ruffian Games , as rumoured , and seems to have a multiplayer focus according to Microsoft 's announcement release .
Left 4 Dead 2 is due out on 17th November this year , and Valve subsequently said it was coming to PC at the same time .
The game " adds melee combat to enable deeper co-operative gameplay , with items such as a chainsaw , frying pan , axe , baseball bat , and more " .
The AI director has been updated to procedurally change weather effects , world objects and pathways in addition to the usual stuff .
Expect new survivors , zombies , bosses and campaigns .
Ubisoft then showed off Splinter Cell : Conviction , with a lot of fancy CG footage and Sam Fisher smacking people around .
It will be released " this fall exclusively on Xbox 360 " .
Prior to that , Epic unveiled an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive called Shadow Complex , developed by Chair Entertainment .
Shown off by Chairs Donald Mustard and Epics Cliff Bleszinski at the Microsoft E3 conference , its a 2D side - scrolling action game with exploration punctuated by moments of combat , in which you play as a chap called Jason Fleming , collecting power - ups and upgrading your character .
It 's based on the world of Orson Scott Card 's novel Empire .
Poor old Mustards microphone didnt work initially , but Cliff Bleszinski distracted us with a t - shirt that had Bill Gates mug - shot on it .
Big Park then showed a new XBLA game called Joy Ride , which is due out this winter and uses Avatars .
It s a free download too , and lets you share racetracks .
The announcement release suggests that you will be able to buy extras like new tracks , game modes and avatar items .
Check out our live coverage of the Microsoft conference for more , including Ellie 's description of the on-stage Conviction demo .
Not Exactly Rocket Science covers an intriguing study on how people try less hard in a competition as the number of competitors increases .
The researchers started off with a simple observation that US students tended to get better marks when they took their exams in smaller exam rooms .
This could have been for many reasons of course , so they set about running several experiments to see if the effect was genuinely down to competitiveness .
These additional studies found that smaller groups do indeed increase competitiveness , and several also allowed them to attempt to explain why :
… they told 50 students that they would have a week to win $ 100 by adding as many Facebook friends as possible .
They found that the students felt more motivated to compete when facing 10 competitors compared to 10,000 , and they were also more likely to compare themselves against the others within the smaller contest .
The number of competitors predicted the students ’ motivations to compete , but that association disappeared after adjusting for their tendency to compare themselves with others .
This same experiment allowed them to rule out the possibility that the students were more motivated in the smaller group , simply because they thought the task would be easier .
They certainly felt that way ( albeit wrongly – in both cases , the prizes went to the top 20 % and the students understood that ) but it did n’t affect their behaviour .
Adjusting for this perception of difficulty did n’t strongly affect the link between number of competitors and motivation .
In other words , the effect of the number of competitors on our motivation seems to work through how likely we are to compare ourselves to others .
But contrary to what we might expect , those who compare themselves most to others are more likely to be competitive when there are fewer people .
The authors suggest that this may be because personal comparisons are easier when we can think of our competitors as individuals rather than having a more abstract idea of a nebulous ‘ group ’ .
Anyway , another great piece from Not Exactly Rocket Science , where you can get a more detailed low - down on the study .

Last week we wrote about China 's blockade of most major social networks and search engines during the anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre on 4th of June .
Now , the Chinese authorities want to take it a step further , ordering that all PCs sold in the country , starting July 1 , must come with software that blocks certain websites .
According to the Chinese government , who have n't yet gone public with the announcement , but have warned PC makers about the deadline , this measure 's aim is to protect the Chinese from harmful content , primarily pornography .
But since this same government has blocked sites like Twitter , YouTube , MySpace and Bing , it 's quite possible that this software 's primary aim is adding another layer of censorship over the existing Great Firewall .
The Chinese authorities have , however , taken a somewhat lax approach - for now .
According to the WSJ , the software , whose Chinese name is " Green Dam - Youth Escort " need n't be pre-installed on the PCs ; it may simply come in the form of a CD , and the users can choose whether they want to install it or not .
The software is designed in such a way that it allows transferring of user 's private information , as well as blocking sites other than pornography ; according to software 's developer , Jinhui Computer System Engineering
Co , it would have no reason to do so .
It does n't sound very convincing , and given a choice , I 'd definitely skip it ; it 's unclear , however , whether the authorities plan to somehow pressure users into installing the software .
There 's always hope that the PC makers will try to resist these claims from the Chinese authorities , but it 's hard to imagine them saying no , given the importance of the Chinese market .
Furthermore , as we 've seen in this latest blockade , there 's always a technical workaround for these types of censorship attempts .
However , if Chinese censors had control of what happens on user computers locally , as well as being able to block certain online destinations , it would make it much harder for users to circumvent such measures .

On startup , the REPL analyzes your classpath and creates a database of every visible package and path .
This is available via tab - completion analagous to the path - completion available in most shells .
If you type a partial path , tab will complete as far as it can and show you your options if there is more than one .
scala > scala.co<tab > collection compat concurrent scala > org.w3c.dom.DOMI < tab > DOMImplementation DOMImplementationList DOMImplementationSource
scala > org.w3c.dom.DOMImplementation
Member Completion
Both static and instance methods of objects are also available .
scala > val x = " abc " x : java.lang .
String = abc scala > x.re < tab > regionMatches replace replaceAll replaceFirst scala > java.lang.String.c<tab > scala > java.lang.String.copyValueOf
And because this is all accomplished on the fly via reflection , even anonymous classes you 've only just defined are equally accessible .
scala > val x = new AnyRef { def kltpzyxm = " back to the 5th dimension " }
x : java.lang.Object{def kltpzyxm : java.lang .
String} = $ anon$ 1@9cb63b
scala > x.< tab >
asInstanceOf getClass isInstanceOf kltpzyxm toString
Interactive Debugging
The interpreter can now be conditionally launched from at an arbitrary point in a program , and make your program internals available interactively .
The arguments passed to Interpreter .
break
If can be inspected with tab - completion and even modified , with program execution resuming once you quit the REPL .
Coming Soon , Scala 2.8
There are many more minor improvements and conveniences in the REPL since the 2.7 release .
New features for the REPL are largely driven by user feedback , so take a nightly build for a spin and tell us what you 'd like to see .
In the following interview Dana Kaplan discusses his new book Contemporary American Judaism : Transformation and Renewal .
In the book , Kaplan focuses on the creative responses to contemporary spiritual trends that have made a Jewish religious renaissance possible .
He argues that American Jewish denominational structure is weakening at the same time that religious experimentation is rising , leading to innovative approaches that are supplanting existing institutions .
Question :
Is your book a comprehensive look at all aspects of American Judaism ?
Dana Evan Kaplan : Yes and no .
I cover a tremendous amount of territory , which was a great opportunity to learn about many aspects of American Judaism that I knew relatively little about .
But the book is not intended to be an encyclopedia of contemporary American Judaism .
The primary focus is on how American Judaism has changed since 1945 and especially since the 1970s .
The material that I present is intended to help readers understand what has happened over the past few decades .
My subject is primarily the American Judaism that was and is practiced by the “ mainstream ” Jewish community .
As a result of this focus , I talk very little about Haredi Judaism , what used to be referred to as “ ultra - Orthodox ” Judaism .
The book discusses two particular segments of Haredi Judaism at length — Chabad - Lubavitch and the baal teshuva movement .
The reason for this was that both of these subgroups have had a tremendous impact on the broader Jewish community .
Q : What is the central argument in the book ?
DEK . : I argue that American Jews , like other Americans , have become much more interested in personal spirituality , and this has transformed American Judaism .
Until the end of World War II , religion was seen as an ascribed part of identity rather than an achieved status .
It was ascribed because , like one ’s race , it was seen as being immutable .
In 1955 a Gallup poll found that only one in twenty five Americans had switched religions .
But , by the mid-1980s , American society had changed dramatically .
There are many reasons for this shift , including changing social mores , geographic mobility , globalization , and so forth .
As American Jews began to search for existential meaning , the organizations and institutions began to feel more and more pressure to respond to that need .
Q : In your book you talk about the “ rise and fall of American Jewish denominationalism . ”
Do you really believe that the Reform , Conservative , and Orthodox movements are a thing of the past ?
DEK . : Yes .
I remember when Rabbi Paul Menitoff , then the executive vice president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis , predicted the end of the Conservative movement in January 2004 .
There was shock and outrage .
But I think that prediction that we will soon see an era of “ dual denominationalism ” will come to be reality .
In recent weeks I ’ve seen a number of news stories about Conservative and Reform congregations merging and multidenominational efforts of various sorts .
The question is :
Is this primarily a cost - saving measure in tough economic times , or does it reflect a long - term trend ?
I would argue that it is both , but with the emphasis on the latter .
Q : You write about the “ collapse of the intermarriage stigma . ”
Have attitudes toward interfaith marriage really changed that much ?
DEK : Yes .
As late as the early 1960s , the intermarriage rate was still in the single digits .
A Jewish person “ marrying out ” was regarded as a traitor to the community .
But , outside of the Orthodox , that attitude has disappeared .
Certainly in my congregation it is expected that the children of members will date people who are not born Jewish .
The hope is that they will bring their partner into the congregation after they marry .
So , intermarriage does not necessarily mean that the Jewish community is going to disappear .
But those demographers who draw a direct connection between intermarriage and doubling or tripling of the American Jewish community are being overly optimistic .
Q : How do American
Jews see their religion differently now as opposed to two generations ago ?
DEK : In my book I speculate that most Jews in the 1940s and 1950s saw being Jewish and being American as separate components of their identity .
This is no longer the case for most American Jews .
Rather , American and Jewish values are increasingly seen as indistinguishable , a process Sylvia Barack Fishman calls “ coalescence . ”
The distinction between what is Jewish and what is American has been effectively eliminated .
“ The boundaries have disappeared and the two belief systems have merged into one coalesced whole known as ‘ Judaism . ’ ”
For many American Jews , liberal values such as democracy , pluralism , inclusivity , and human rights are now seen as core Jewish values .
Likewise , elements of Judaism are now seen as part of American culture and society .
All you have to do is turn on the TV .
Q : Do you see syncretism — the integration of two or more religions into a new entity — as a threat or an opportunity for the future of American Judaism ?
DEK : Both .
I am a bit surprised that more people have n’t been writing about the potential problems resulting from the conscious or unconscious integration of aspects of other religions into Judaism .
I was just reading about Jewish paganism which , in all seriousness , is an emerging religious orientation among some American Jews .
But the primary “ threat ” comes from the integration of Christianity into Judaism .
As you know , there are many Jewish - Christian interfaith couples joining synagogues .
Under those circumstances , it is amazing that Christian theological conceptions and practices have had so little impact on synagogue life — at least so far .
But it seems inevitable that this is going to become a significant issue in the coming years .
I think that readers will be amused at my discussion of the Chrismukkah phenomena .
Q : The emphasis on personal spirituality has led to some highly unusual developments .
Can you name a few mentioned in your book ?
DEK : For the majority of American Jews who do not feel constrained by halacha ( Jewish law ) , everything is possible and nothing is for sure .
The sole criteria is “ what do I find spiritually meaningful ? ”
So , for example , a group of women in Northern California wanted to symbolize how transgressive their lesbian sexual orientation was by putting bread on the seder plate .
Others have decided to get a Hebrew tattoo to show the world how proud they are of their Jewish identity , not caring that tattooing was prohibited in Jewish law .
One young man in Northern California even had a number tattooed on his arm as sign of solidarity with the victims of the Holocaust .
A rabbi in Wisconsin conducted a ceremony labeled a bark mitzvah to acknowledge the importance of a family pet .
I personally attended a Native American sweat lodge and considered organizing a Jewish version .
I ’m still waiting to attend my first Jewitchery ceremony !
Q : In your conclusion , you cite the inscription on the Merneptah Stela , commissioned by the pharaoh of Egypt .
What possible relevance does that have to contemporary American Judaism ?
DEK : The inscription includes the pronouncement “ Israel is stripped bare , wholly lacking seed . ”
So more than three thousand years ago people were pronouncing that Israel had come to the end of its history .
The pharaoh was only one in a long line of enemies who predicted the demise of the Jewish people .
The American scholar Simon Rawidowicz spoke of Israel as “ the ever - dying people , ” by which he meant that every generation saw themselves as the last , but that somehow we were able to keep going .
Nevertheless , I point out that sustaining Judaism in the twenty first century is going to be a tremendous challenge .
Contemporary Jews face the irony that while Judaism has established itself as an important component of American culture , the Jews themselves are losing much of the distinctiveness that made them a historic people .
Federal district judge Vaughn Walker has rejected lawsuits that aimed to hold telecommunications companies accountable for their role in a controversial warrantless surveillance program that was orchestrated in secret by the federal government .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation and American Civil Liberties Union are preparing to appeal the dismissal .
The warrantless surveillance program is one the more contentious controversies that still lingers from Bush 's tenure in office .
The Bush administration attempted to leverage the State Secrets privilege to block litigation that aimed to hold participants in the surveillance program accountable for violating privacy laws .
When it became clear that the courts were going to allow the lawsuits to move forward , Congress intervened and passed a FISA amendment to grant the telecom companies explicit immunity .
President Obama voted in favor of immunity , despite consistently promising to oppose it .
EFF and ACLU 's lawsuits against the telecoms are among the most significant pending lawsuits targeting the warrantless surveillance program , and they are viewed by privacy advocates as a means of bringing accountability and more robust judicial oversight to the surveillance mess .
Judge Walker has thrown out the suits , citing the FISA telecom immunity amendment as the basis for dismissal .
He affirmed that the evidence provided under seal by the government demonstrated that the conduct of the telecoms meets the criteria for immunity grants .
The ACLU and EFF argued that the surveillance program was so broad and far - reaching that it necessarily extended beyond those boundaries and should not be entitled to protection .
They contend that the function of the surveillance program was not to detect or prevent terrorist attacks , but to broadly enable collection of communication records regardless of whether those records are specifically needed .
" While plaintiffs have made a valiant effort to challenge the sufficiency of certifications they are barred by statute from reviewing , their contentions under section 802 are not sufficiently substantial to persuade the court that the intent of Congress in enacting the statute should be frustrated in this proceeding in which the court is required to apply the statute , " Walker wrote in his decision .
" The court has examined the Attorney General 's submissions and has determined that he has met his burden under section 802 ( a ) .
The court is prohibited by section 802 ( c ) ( 2 ) from opining further . "
The EFF and the ACLU are planning to launch an appeal , asserting that the FISA amendments which granted telecom immunity are unconstitutional .
" We 're deeply disappointed in Judge Walker 's ruling today , " said EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn in a statement .
" The retroactive immunity law unconstitutionally takes away Americans ' claims arising out of the First and Fourth Amendments , violates the federal government 's separation of powers as established in the Constitution , and robs innocent telecom customers of their rights without due process of law . "
The Obama administration has indicated that it has no plans to hold the telecoms or previous administration accountable for alleged illegal activity .
It will continue to sit on the details of the surveillance program and will not help to facilitate any of the ongoing litigation .
It 's looking increasingly likely that the telecoms will get a free pass and the true scope of the Bush administration 's surveillance program will never be known .
Update :
An EFF lawyer wrote in to point out that the suit filed by the EFF against the government on behalf of the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation is still ongoing .
Judge Walker has only thrown out the lawsuits against the telecoms .
The Al - Haramain case will proceed in September .
This is a relentless age we ’re living in , a time when innovative solutions — or any solutions , for that matter — to our seemingly infinite problems seem in short supply .
So how do we come up with new ideas ?
How do we learn to think outside of normal parameters ?
Are the processes in place for doing so flawed ?
Do we rely too much on computer models ?
On consultants ?
On big - idea gurus lauding the merits of tribes and crowds or of starfish and spiders ?
On Twitter ?
At the risk of sounding like a big - idea guru myself , I ca n’t help thinking that we ’re all so mired in it that we ’ve forgotten how to get out of it — how to daydream , invent , engage with the absurd .
That ’s why I am so enamored with the work of inventor / author / cartoonist / former urban planner Steven M. Johnson , a sort of R. Crumb meets R. Buckminster Fuller .
Johnson is a former urban planner , and his work tends toward the nodes where social issues intersect with design and urban planning issues .
In discussing his often fantastical , sometimes silly , sometimes visionary concepts , he has said , “ If I could use two words to describe what it is that I enjoy it is that I love to be sneakily outrageous . . .
[ It may be that ]
I have decided an idea has no practical worth and would never be likely to be adopted seriously ( like most of my ideas ) , but I like it anyway . ”
A latent inventor , Johnson discovered his “ ability ” only at age 36 in 1974 , when he was the editorial cartoonist for The Sierra Club Bulletin and the editor , Roger Olmsted , asked him to invent whimsical recreational vehicles .
Olmsted asked for 16 ; Johnson gave him 109 .
“ I had never invented anything before , ” he told me in an e-mail recently , “ because no one had ever asked me to invent anything ! ”
It would be ridiculous to suggest that the powers that be should do nothing but give in to their wild imaginations .
But there ’s something to Johnson ’s explorations that warrants our attention .
It may be , as the title of his 1984 book suggests , exactly “ What the World Needs Now : A Resource Book for Daydreamers , Frustrated Inventors , Cranks , Efficiency Experts , Utopians , Gadgeteers , Tinkerers , and Just About Everybody Else . ”
As the 70 - year - old told me last week , “ America has been falling into a depression , a psychological depression , for many years .
Yet this is a land of pioneer inventors .
It annoys me that an untrained person like myself can think up products easily ( in fact I usually spend energy ‘ turning off ’ the idea - generating machine just as psychics train themselves to turn off their capability ) and yet the nation seems to sit helplessly passive and wait to be saved somehow . ”
So maybe there are some lessons to be learned from Johnson .
Many of his musings are simply whimsical , existing primarily as a source of inspiration or delight .
Others tackle very real issues , from environmentalism to alternative transportation to homelessness .
Here , a look at both ends of the spectrum .
Every worker would appreciate the Nod Office ( 1984 ) , an ingenious desk that can be transformed into a hidden sleeping chamber , perfect for late afternoon naps .
Owning such a contraption remains for me a significant yet unrealized career goal .
Steven M. Johnson
Anyone who ever left the house without eating breakfast will appreciate his dashboard toaster oven .
( Another feature , the Automobile Snack Conveyer , allows you to deliver that toast to your kid in the back seat . )
Steven M. Johnson
Yet there ’s a darker side to Johnson as well , as evidenced by this much more recent exploration , drawn in 2009 , of office cubicles : these are now used not just for afternoon siestas but to offer working seniors , unable to retire in this economy , a much - needed place to rest .
Steven M. Johnson
In Johnson ’s oeuvre , nothing gets to exist if it does n’t have at least two functions : the skylight uses solar energy to cook the dinner , for instance , and the exercise bike operates the washing machine ( cleaning clothes and toning the wearer ’s muscles simultaneously ) .
Steven M. Johnson
Steven M. Johnson
“ Accessories with a purpose , ” drawings from 1991 , include such then seemingly silly items as “ hands - free phones ” and “ pouchpants ” ( a tragically unflattering variation on what would become the still tragically unflattering fanny pack ) .
A very small apartment might house the Hide - a - Shower , a sofa that can be upended for bathing .
Murder on the upholstery , no doubt .
Steven M. Johnson
Johnson has even done a series of drawings on how not to invent : here , a radio powered by a coffee grinder ( 2005 ) .
Other bizarre explorations include adjacent commodes in an exploration of Toilets for Immodest Times .
And the Cigaire smoke hood , which redirects cigarette smoke from the smoker ’s mouth into a stylish helmet , a variant of which Johnson actually saw at an inventors ’ convention in 1989 .
Steven M. Johnson
Transportation figures prominently in Johnson ’s work , much of it showcased in his second book , “ Public Therapy Buses ” ( 1991 ) .
Again , many of his concepts are simply cute and clever , like the self - shortening sedan with its adjustable bumper ( combines the stability of a larger car with the parking convenience of a tinier one ) , or the View Cab ( puts some power back in the hands of the drivers of compact cars ) .
Steven M. Johnson
Other Johnson transportation ideas do move increasingly , if not entirely , toward practicality , like the clever albeit cumbersome Bike Vest :
Steven M. Johnson
A golf - cart - meets - treadmill contraption seems to predate the Segway .
Steven M. Johnson
Some of his transit concepts begin to address tangible issues .
Automobile Abandonment Zones intuit the very contemporary possibility of commuters fleeing gridlock for a nearby train , willingly relinquishing their keys to Abandonment Officers .
Pedaltrains posit the intriguing concept of combining two car alternatives : bicycles and public transit .
It was nearly 20 years ago , in “ Public Therapy Buses , ” that Johnson predicted that shopping malls would be given over to mega-malls for consignment and thrift items .
He was pretty on - target with concepts like Landfill Surprise : The Quality Trash Store .
Steven M. Johnson
And his Neighborhood Sharing Booths , designed to provide food , water and clothing from kiosks on neighborhood lawns , seem eerie predictors of the current reality of foreclosed subdivisions .
Fans of prefab can appreciate flexible housing concepts like “ Rooms Added a Piece at a Time ” and “ Homes Purchased by the Room , ” while builders of gated communities , tongue firmly out of cheek , clearly missed the intended irony of Johnson ’s “ Double - Walled Communities , ” in which “ developers gain approval from planning departments to build double - walled communities for wealthy executives , ” or his “ Monitowers ” — staffed towers in subdivisions that feature surveillance cameras .
What fascinates me about Johnson is his ability to riff on anything , from a sort of frivolous contraption called a brief skate ( yes , a briefcase that morphs into a skateboard — perfect for today ’s unemployed boomers ) to a wholly prescient formed concept like Oakville , a gasoline - and - diesel - engine free city that features a freeway for electric cars and bicycles , and a medieval - like perimeter wall that keeps polluting cars out .
He can be so out there as to make one think he should n’t be taken seriously until you realize just how serious his thinking can be .
To be sure , there ’s no small amount of goofiness in Johnson ’s creations , but deeper exploration into his decades of inventions show not only a complex and intuitive mind but real visionary tendencies .
His mental process ?
It ’s one he describes as “ Mix - ‘ N - Match , outrageous extrapolation , speeded - up thinking , random / lateral thinking ( which comes close to the hypnagogic state between waking and sleep where some claim inspired inventions and scientific inventions come through ) , and so forth . ”
He writes of avoiding his desk when inventing , avoiding the connotations of serious endeavor , of earning a living .
“ I wish instead , ” he writes , “ to be irresponsible , rash , associative , dreamy , impish , brainy , intuitive , and stupid . ”
Which seems , to me , about the right strategy for our times .
■ EV SSL を緑色だというだけで信用してはいけない実例
EV SSL に関して以前から懸念されていたことが既に現実になっていた。一時期、EV証明書を発行する一部のCA事業者が、EV
SSLの宣伝で「緑色になったら安全」などといいかげんな広告を打っていて、誤った理解が広まりかねないと心配されていたわけだが、「緑色になったら安全」という理解がなぜ駄目なのか、その理由の一つは、いわゆる「共用SSL」サービスにEV
SSLが使われかねないという懸念だった。
そして、その実例が既に存在していたことに気付いた。図1は私が作ったWebページである。
アドレスバーは緑色になっているが、ここに入力されたデータは私宛にメールで送信
されてくる。（このページは既に閉鎖している。）
悪意ある者がこうしたページを作成 し、何らかの方法でこのページに人々を誘導
すれば、フィッシングの被害が出るおそれがある。
もっとも、このサービスの場合、画面のデザインの自由度が低くなっており、銀行などと見た目がそっくりな偽サイトを作成することはできないだろうから、実際にフィッシング被害が出るかというと、量的には少ないものになるだろう。
なお、こうしたいわゆる 「 共用SSL 」サービスの場合、EV SSLを導入する意義はない。なぜなら、どこの誰ともわからない馬の骨と同じサイトを共用する以上、SSLは通信の暗号化 のためのみに意味を成すのであり、サイトの場所（ページの設置者が誰か）を保証するものにならないし、サイトの実在性を保証する（緑色で表示される会社が運営するサイトとして）といっても、誰でも入力画面を作成できるサイトの実在性を保証したところで意味がない。
Webブラウザ利用者にとって正しいEV SSLの理解は、アドレスバーが単に緑色になることを確認するのではなく、緑色で表示される会社名を確認することである。そして、その会社が、自分がデータを送信しようとしている相手として相応しいかを確認することである。
ちなみに、このサービスは自分で自分の首を絞めているとも言える。図2は、このサービスの利用者（入力フォーム設置者）が管理画面（入力データのダウンロードメニューなどがある）に入るためのログイン画面であるが、これが図1と同じサイト上に存在している。
アドレスバーを見ても、本物のログイン画面なのか、それとも、どこぞの馬の骨が開設した入力画面なのか、区別できない。このサービスの場合、画面のデザインの自由度が低くなっているため、本物そっくりのパスワード入力画面を作ることはできないだろうから、被害はでないだろうけれども、このような設計は避けた方がよい。
加えて言えば、このサービスの運営会社は、このサービスの存在によって、会社が今後運営することになるかもしれない本当にEV
SSLを必要とするサービスにおいて、信用を得られなくしてしまった。会社名を見ても、どこの馬の骨が設置した入力画面かわからないのだから、信用できない。このことについては、2008年7月3日の日記「EV SSL導入に伴い生じ得る特有の脆弱性」でも次のように書いていた。
しばしば、 「 共用SSL 」などとして、共同利用型のSSLサーバを提供しているレンタルサーバサービスを見かける。レンタルサーバ会社が代表でサーバ証明書を取得して、コンテンツは利用者に自由に書かせるというものだ。もし、こういったSSLサーバで、EV証明書が使われるようになると、運営会社の信用を誰でも汚すことができるようになってしまう。このようなサービスにEV証明書を導入する意義はなく、避けるべきである。
EV SSL 導入に伴い生じ得る特有の脆弱性 , 2008年7月3日の日記
ところで、そもそも、EV SSLに限らず（通常 のSSLを使った）「 共用SSL 」というサービス自体、どうなんだろうか。以下に4つのケースに分けて検討してみる。
( a) http://example.com/ から「共用SSL」サイト上に設置された入力フォームにリンクしている場合、SSLによる通信の暗号化の安全性は達成されない。なぜなら、http://foo.example.com/
にアクセスした時点で、リンク先が改竄されている可能性があるので、ジャンプした先が
https:// のページであることを確認しても、偽サイト、あるいは偽ページ の可能性がある。
( b ) http://example.com/
上に入力フォームを設置して、フォームの送信先を「共用SSL」サイト上のCGIプログラムとした場合、そもそも入力画面が
http:// なので、SSLによる通信の暗号化の安全性は達成されない。
( c ) https://example.com/ から「共用SSL」サイト上に設置された入力フォームにリンクしている場合、これはSSLによる通信の暗号化の安全性は達成される。しかし、入力画面で、入力する人が「ここは本物サイトかな？」と確認しようとしても、その場では確認できない。そこにジャンプする前のページが
https:// の（本物サイトの）ページだったことを覚えているなら、入力ページも本物であると確認できるが、そのような確認を入力者に求めるのは非現実的である。
( d) https://example.com/
上に入力フォームを設置して、フォームの送信先を「共用SSL」サイト上のCGIプログラムとした場合、入力者は、入力前に本物サイトの確認ができるし、SSLによる通信の暗号化の安全性も達成される。
このように 、( d ) のケースにおいて、いちおう「共用SSL 」 にも存在意義はある。
しかし、 「 共用SSL 」サービスにEV SSLを用いることには意味がない。意味がなく、かつ、紛らわしく誤解をする利用者もいるだろうから、やめてほしいと思う。
図1のサービスでは、サービス開始時のプレスリリースで、次のように書かれていた。
従来の無料プランとは別に、新しく設定した有料プラン(月額\1,575)では、さらに上位のSSL証明書「EV-SSL証明書」に対応しており、サイトの安全性の高さを明示することができます。
■ 「 EV - SSL証明書」とは 認証基準レベルが既存のサーバー証明書よりも厳格に行われる証明書です。EV証明書で認証されたWEBサイトは、ブラウザー( Internet Explorer 7 ) 上でアドレスバーが緑色に変化し、WEBサイトの安全性を明示することができます。主要な最新ブラウザーのアドレスバーでは証明書に記載されている組織名と認証局名が表示されるため、通常の証明書よりもフィッシング詐欺に対して大きな効果を発揮します。
EV SSL が何であるか（もしかすると 、SSLが何であるかさえ）誤って理解されていることが窺える。
追記
2009年8月24日、このサービスは中止すると発表された。
This is what packaging should be all about by Ritwik on July 21 , 2009
Help Remedies has come up with a medicine packaging idea that is elegant and effective , yet so simple that it ’s surprising nobody has thought of it before :
As lovelypackage.com notes ,
This is one of the best examples of product concept and design .
From the naming down to the witty copy and simple , clean design , it does n’t get much better than this .

For older adults , the medical screening that all applicants must undergo can be prolonged .
“ We have to look at the individual ’s health history , the conditions in the host country and the medical support available , ” Ms. Lartigue said .
“ Your apartment in Ukraine may be on the fifth floor with no elevator  can you climb those stairs day in and day out ? ”
Leslie Michael , 59 , of Columbia , S.C. , first thought of joining the Peace Corps in college but instead embarked on a 31 - year career in elementary education .
Seven years ago , she learned that she had breast cancer , and the Peace Corps idea resurfaced .
She waited five years after completing her cancer treatment and applied .
“ The application process was not difficult , but the medical screening was awful , ” she said by e-mail .
“ At first , I was rejected because I have rheumatoid arthritis , but I appealed and was finally accepted . ”
After four weeks of training in Namibia , including site visits and job shadowing , she lived with a family for several weeks for cultural and language training and is now training preprimary teachers in Swakopmund .
The Peace Corps provides volunteers with comprehensive health coverage ; round - trip transportation to the placement destination ; a monthly stipend to cover rent , food , clothing and transportation ; and an accrued allowance paid at the end of service .
Volunteers also receive job - placement support and preferential treatment if they apply for federal jobs .
Older adults whose children have left home and who have completed their primary careers are ripe for what gerontologists call life review and new challenges , said Dr. Carl Eisdorfer , director of the Center on Aging at the University of Miami .
“ You start asking , ‘ What have I done with my life ? ’
For some people , life has been good , and there ’s a tendency towards altruism .
What better way to do that than spend time in another culture where your skills have value ? ”

Today Science Magazine is reporting that the Army has banned all pathogen research at one of its labs at the Armed Forced Institute of Pathology ( AFIP ) in Washington , DC .
This decision was made December 2 , 2008 as a result of an earlier failed Biological Surety Inspection , and not made public .
Science reports that “ officials found that lab managers ignored information about certain employees that could have disqualified them from having access to dangerous pathogens .
The redacted version of the IG ’s [ Inspector General ’s ] report released to Science does not divulge the nature of this so - called potentially disqualifying information , but it could be anything from alcoholism to mental instability . ”
On October 28 , 2008 AR 50 - 1 came into effect , stipulating a strict Biological Personnel Reliability Program for DOD employees as part of their Biological Surety Program .
It includes and intense background investigation and interviews of employees as well as regulations regarding substance abuse and mental health .
In early February the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) also suspended its research on biological select agents and toxins when it was realized that there were problems with the system of accounting for high risk microbes and biological materials in the laboratories at Fort Detrick , MD .
At the age of 113 Henry Allingham , the oldest surviving veteran of the first world war , has officially been proclaimed the oldest man alive by Guinness World Records , after the death today of Tomoji Tanabe in Japan .
His friend Denis Goodwin , a founder of the First World War Veterans Association , who has escorted Allingham to innumerable parades , memorial services and presentations , said : " It 's staggering .
He will take it in his stride , like he does everything else .
He withdraws in himself and he chews it over like he does all the things he has done in his life .
That 's his secret , I think . "
At St Dunstan 's home for blind ex-service personnel , near Brighton , where Allingham has lived since he finally gave up his Eastbourne flat at the age of 110 , chief executive Robert Leader sent sympathy to the family of Tanabe , who died in his sleep , also aged 113 .
He added : " We are proud to be caring for such a remarkable man .
He has just celebrated his 113th birthday , and knowing Henry as I do , he will take the news in his stride . "
It is the latest in a series of recent landmarks in the extraordinarily ordinary life of a man who remembers watching WG Grace playing cricket , returned from the hell of the trenches to marriage , and had a long contented career as an engineer .
He never spoke of his wartime experiences for most of the 20th century until he was asked to give some talks to school children .
Allingham is the last survivor of the Battle of Jutland , the last surviving founding member of the Royal Air Force , the last survivor of the Royal Naval Air Service , and the oldest ever surviving member of any of the British armed forces .
As an engineer on a Sopwith Schneider seaplane , he recalls shells bouncing across the waves in the Battle of Jutland , and he was behind the lines in training and support units at the Western Front in 1917 .
Despite an apparently blameless life , he attributes his longevity to " cigarettes , whisky and wild , wild women – and a sense of humour " .
On his 110th birthday , when he was already the oldest man in Britain , his presents included enough whisky to swim in , including a bottle personally presented by Gordon Brown .
He was awarded France 's highest honour , the Légion d'honneur in 2003 as a chevalier , upgraded earlier this year to officier .
In the last decade he has joined hundreds of ceremonies marking major anniversaries of the first world war .
He joined the march past the Cenotaph every year until 2005 .
The following year 's parade was the first without any veterans of the first world war .
But Allingham was not tucked up at home .
He was laying a wreath in France .
An honour which particularly pleased him came last December , when the Institute of Mechanical Engineers presented him with an honorary award as Chartered Engineer and he has since also been awarded an honorary doctorate from Southampton Solent University .
Despite a lifetime working in aviation and car engineering – he finally retired from Ford in Dagenham in 1960 – he had no formal qualifications .

By Charles Bodsworth
BBC , Japan
Japan 's mafia , the infamous yakuza , have a fearsome reputation both at home and abroad .
Highly realistic prosthetics match the skin tone and texture
A man bearing the marks of a yakuza is likely to receive a frosty reception in respectable Japan .
Gangsters are known for the spectacular tattoos that sometimes cover most of their bodies .
Most Japanese public pools and gyms as a result exclude anyone with a tattoo of any kind .
For a gangster wishing to pass unnoticed , tattoos can be covered or even removed , at a price .
But a different mark of a life of crime presents more of a problem .
One man I know has a dummy finger and gave as his motivation the fact that he did not want to embarrass his children when he was operating his video camera at school sports days
Dr Peter Hill , Oxford University
In the practise of " yubitsume " the little finger is chopped off at the knuckle to demonstrate penitence .
Further punishments can involve more joints being removed until the finger is gone entirely .
For a gangster content with social exclusion , public revulsion at a mutilated finger may not present much of a problem .
The Oxford University sociologist Dr Peter Hill , who studies trends in organised crime in Japan , says he has encountered a man in the city of Osaka who was not only missing a finger but who had his gang 's crest tattooed on his forehead .
New clinic
But Japan 's crime syndicates , like its legitimate businesses , have been feeling the pinch during the recent years of recession .
Niino says she was " afraid at first " of her yakuza client
The result has been a surge in the number of gangsters leaving their life of crime , or at least doing their best to cover up their past .
A Tokyo clinic called the New Body Institute has inadvertently come to the aid of the country 's reviled criminals .
The institute fits highly realistic prosthetic body parts which match the skin tone and texture of their human subjects and even change colour when exposed to heat or cold .
The clinic was founded in the early 1990s by Maria Niino who had previously undergone a mastectomy due to breast cancer .
She explains : " After my operation I felt as if Japanese doctors did n't care that I had lost a breast , so I started to research European prosthetic techniques which were far more advanced . "
" I established my clinic because I wanted to help other women who had suffered like me , " she says .
' Shaking yakuza '
But soon after she opened for business she found herself serving a far more unexpected clientele .
She described how she felt meeting her first yakuza client : " I was afraid at first .
But actually , I think he was more afraid than I was - when he came in sandwiched between two policemen , he was actually shaking . "
Throughout the 1990s Japan 's crime syndicates were reeling from the twin blows of the national recession and a 1992 law against organised crime .
But as well as cracking down on the criminals the authorities offered them help to leave the yakuza and begin new lives .
Some companies have joined the effort and , through the police , offer jobs to reformed yakuza .
For those gangsters without tattoos or mutilated fingers joining a legitimate company is straightforward enough .
But in a country wary of organised crime , employing people with severed fingers is out of the question .
' Appearing normal '
However , with a realistic prosthetic finger the prospect of a legitimate job can become a possibility .
Recently though , Ms Niino says she has noticed a shift in the aim of her gangster clients .
Far from turning their backs on crime , some now say they want to continue in the yakuza but to also have the option of appearing normal , she says .
" When their children get married , they want to be able to meet their in - laws and look like respectable people .
And for that 10 fingers are necessary . "
Dr Hill confirms this : " One man I know has a dummy finger and gave as his motivation the fact that he did not want to embarrass his children when he was operating his video camera at school sports days . "
While the criminal nature of yakuza activities make reliable data hard to come by , Dr Hill says it is generally accepted that finger amputation is growing less common amongst gangsters .
In future , then , the unusual alliance between Japan 's first clinic dedicated to prosthetic body parts and reformed yakuza may come to an end .
But for the time being Ms Niino is helping men who have changed their minds about their commitment to the criminal cause .

The Twittering Machine ( painting by Klee here )
Alice Shapiro
“ A line is a dot that went for a walk ” – Paul Klee
Clock .
Time ’s machine
twittering off each glassy moment
fragile soundings faraway
at the nape of memory
reminding , rewinding .
O clock , o’clock
machine of mornings
to wash , to work , to win
against your ticking , always
on .
Toaster .
Bread burner
hot molecular intrusion making food smack
of sweet and crunchy bliss ,
morning ’s stomach - hug
tactile power in the lift of a stiff slice
buttered , jammed , swallowed
well before the dreaded time to clock
in .
Auto .
Legs in , torso in , head
swivels east to west checking traffic
from a rear - view looking glass .
Leather smells spiked with stale tobacco smoke
suffocate in a cloistered cocoon space
blasted by a vulgar booming song
muffling twittering signals
from a wrist - clock , reminding
of commitment .
And the auto , instead of turning in ,
punching in to work
drives straight into the sunset .
Comment :
Watch me join “ The Twittering Machine , ” but first look at the painting and read MoMA ’s short commentary in the link above .
We could spend time talking about the “ natural ” / ” industrial ” fusion ; the ambiguity of the lines upon which the birds are perched , or are shackled to , or are defined by .
The hand crank , the pit that seems to be the same color as the top of the painting , the “ monstrosity ” of the “ birds ” are more what I ’m interested in : why the deformity , why the suggestion of a greater horror inside a music box ?
The appearance of the whole makes one wonder if what keeps us in the cave are sounds more than images , but again , watch me join the machine : images do not necessarily liberate .
Onto the poem .
The fragments that mark spoken word are not quite twitterings , but what if we recognized them as everyday and incessant ?
Clock , Toaster , Auto : the location switches but our subject ’s movement is at best defined by restraint .
“ Toaster ” sticks out : it is a machine made for the human .
“ Clock ” and “ Auto[ matic ] ” are machines we are within .
“ Glassy ” and “ glass ” may hint at the abstractions used to create the machine : first , the form of the thing , not the thing itself .
Take those moments , they are emptying ; react to the reflections of other autos .
Those “ fragile soundings faraway at the nape of memory ” are otherworldly , even though they are the empty tickings of the clock .
The clock is time ’s machine , not ours necessarily ; it becomes the machine of morning once the dreamworld is abandoned for the dream ( “ to wash , to work , to win ” ) .
We fight the clock as we are beholden to it ; it is “ always on . ”
“ In ” ends the second stanza , and it is n’t hard to see the mechanistic process that we are come into full swing ( “ buttered , jammed , swallowed ” ) .
What is interesting is the “ smack of sweet and crunchy bliss : ” a toaster is n’t a deformed or deforming machine necessarily .
But our “ human ” spoken about sticks himself into the car and limits his own motion and seeing for pure speed .
The car is filled with narcotics of one sort or another : smoke replaces air , the noise replaces even the twittering .
We are in the pit .
Our subject may or may not be going to work : if he can only imagine material happiness , then the cliche of driving off into the sunset with his automobile will suffice .
He may be going to work , though : we could say “ work ” is the “ sunset ” – the finality – since “ work ” has been reduced to being machinery .
Either way , it does n’t matter : this whole poem has been at the nape of memory ; twitterings are no replacement for the awareness , joining and articulation of thought .
There is a machine at work there too , but one that strives for consciousness rather than bliss or a substitute for bliss .
At best , twitterings are a memento mori ( cf. Dickinson , “ The Earth has many keys … ” ) , and that is all that has really been said so far .
This Social Thing Has Been Around for a While
We act like social networking is a new thing or that social media has n’t been around since the first cave paintings .
Who are we convincing ?
We learn the rules of relationships before we learn to read .
Then we get into business and progressively learn how to undo them .
The part that is new thing was separating the “ personal ” from the “ business . ”
If you think about it , it ’s … um … inhuman .
How can you give personal service when you leave relationships at the door ?
Now we ’re talking about social networking and social media marketing .
Social business is not a new thing .
What Every Small Town Always Knew About Social Business
Step into any small town — say a town of 2000 .
Visit the general store and watch the owner go through a day of business .
It may strike you that it ’s a little like watching a Twitterstream .
Connecting conversation :
The owner will have a short chat with customers about their families or their businesses .

Extending Relationships :
Hang around and you ’ll probably see the owner head off with a vendor to have lunch at a local diner — a “ meetup ” to “ eat - up . ”

The store owner will introduce the diner folks to the vendor .
And they all know the lawyer and the banker .

Multiplicity of Contexts :
The store owner will see the diner owner and the vendor at the ball field when their kids ’ teams play each other .
The store owner will see the diner owner and the vendor at the ball field when their kids ’ teams play each other .
Mutual History and Values : Some customers and owners went to the same schools together .
A few of them might even remember who wet his pants in first grade and who has a criminal record for staying out past curfew — when they still had one .
In small towns , businesses build a history together that is linked and interconnected .
To try to check the social at the door would be ridiculous .
Relationships and conversation are the currency that builds the ecosystem .
Authenticity , trust , and reputation pile on the transactions that have been made on handshakes and over conversations at weddings .
People invest in each other .
The resulting business has the same quality as the relationships .
Have you ever seen a real - life social business ecosystem ?
Think we have a chance of building that on the Internet ?

A new study from Harvard School of Public Health ( HSPH ) researchers found that participants who drank for a week from polycarbonate bottles -- the popular , hard - plastic drinking bottles and baby bottles -- showed a two - thirds increase in their urine of the chemical bisphenol A ( BPA ) .
Exposure to BPA , used in the manufacture of polycarbonate and other plastics , has been shown to interfere with reproductive development in animals and has been linked with cardiovascular disease and diabetes in humans .
The study is the first to show that drinking from polycarbonate bottles increased the level of urinary BPA , and thus suggests that drinking containers made with BPA release the chemical into the liquid that people drink in sufficient amounts to increase the level of BPA excreted in human urine .
In addition to polycarbonate bottles , which are refillable and a popular container among students , campers and others and are also used as baby bottles , BPA is also found in dentistry composites and sealants and in the lining of aluminum food and beverage cans .
( In bottles , polycarbonate can be identified by the recycling number 7 . )
Numerous studies have shown that it acts as an endocrine - disruptor in animals , including early onset of sexual maturation , altered development and tissue organization of the mammary gland and decreased sperm production in offspring .
It may be most harmful in the stages of early development .
" We found that drinking cold liquids from polycarbonate bottles for just one week increased urinary BPA levels by more than two - thirds .
If you heat those bottles , as is the case with baby bottles , we would expect the levels to be considerably higher .
This would be of concern since infants may be particularly susceptible to BPA 's endocrine - disrupting potential , " said Karin B. Michels , associate professor of epidemiology at HSPH and Harvard Medical School and senior author of the study .
The researchers , led by first author Jenny Carwile , a doctoral student in the department of epidemiology at HSPH , and Michels , recruited Harvard College students for the study in April 2008 .
The 77 participants began the study with a seven - day " washout " phase in which they drank all cold beverages from stainless steel bottles in order to minimize BPA exposure .
Participants provided urine samples during the washout period .
They were then given two polycarbonate bottles and asked to drink all cold beverages from the bottles during the next week ; urine samples were also provided during that time .
The results showed that the participants ' urinary BPA concentrations increased 69 % after drinking from the polycarbonate bottles .
( The study authors noted that BPA concentrations in the college population were similar to those reported for the U.S. general population . )
Previous studies had found that BPA could leach from polycarbonate bottles into their contents ; this study is the first to show a corresponding increase in urinary BPA concentrations in humans .
One of the study 's strengths , the authors note , is that the students drank from the bottles in a normal use setting .
Additionally , the students did not wash their bottles in dishwashers nor put hot liquids in them ; heating has been shown to increase the leaching of BPA from polycarbonate , so BPA levels might have been higher had students drunk hot liquids from the bottles .
Canada banned the use of BPA in polycarbonate baby bottles in 2008 and some polycarbonate bottle manufacturers have voluntarily eliminated BPA from their products .
With increasing evidence of the potential harmful effects of BPA in humans , the authors believe further research is needed on the effect of BPA on infants and on reproductive disorders and on breast cancer in adults .
" This study is coming at an important time because many states are deciding whether to ban the use of BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups .
While previous studies have demonstrated that BPA is linked to adverse health effects , this study fills in a missing piece of the puzzle — whether or not polycarbonate plastic bottles are an important contributor to the amount of BPA in the body , " said Carwile .
The study was supported by the Harvard University Center for the Environment and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Biological Analysis Core , Department of Environmental Health , HSPH .
Carwile was also supported by the Training Program in Environmental Epidemiology .
THE ABC has taken
The Chaser 's War On Everything off the air for two weeks following the controversy surrounding the program 's " Make - A - Realistic - Wish Foundation " sketch .
The ABC 's managing director , Mark Scott , made the decision last night amid a backlash that has been building since the program was broadcast on Wednesday night .
" We have decided that this is the most appropriate course of action , " Mr Scott said .
" It gives the ABC an opportunity to complete a review of editorial approval processes .
It also gives The Chaser a chance to regroup and review their material . "
In a statement , The Chaser team said they " do n't agree " with the ban and were " disappointed " by the decision .
They again apologised for the skit , saying it " was a very black sketch .
Obviously too black .
And we 're really sorry for the significant pain and anger we have caused . "
They also said they " got it wrong " and should never have done the skit .
" We do n't think sick kids are greedy and we do n't think the Make - a - Wish Foundation deserves anything other than praise .
It was meant to be so over - the - top that no one would ever take it seriously . "
The ABC said in a statement that the decision was made with the ABC 's director of television , Kim Dalton and followed discussions with the program 's cast members .
TEHRAN 
In the West , Iran ’s coming presidential election is viewed largely through the lens of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s crackdown on social freedoms and his combative approach to Israel , the United States , and Iran ’s nuclear program .
But here , as in so many other elections , another issue is seen as more important : the economy .
Iran ’s crippling inflation rate , unemployment , and the question of how its oil revenue is being spent are at the top of the agenda for most voters , analysts say .
The two main camps here see the issue in starkly opposed terms , with Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s supporters saying his policies have improved things for average people , while all three of his challengers in the election on Friday insist that the economy is in serious trouble .
Even when it comes to basic economic indicators , the two sides often present starkly opposed statistics and projections , leaving many voters confused about what to believe .
To some extent , both sides have a case to make : Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s populist policies have enriched some segments of the population , but a longer trend of unemployment and economic stagnation is evident as well .
In response to the reinvigorated buzz surrounding Michael Jordan , Medicom
Toy is releasing a new figure dedicated to MJ and the 1992 US men 's Olympic basketball team .
The " Dream Team " collectible has surfaced following the airing of ESPN 's recent Michael Jordan documentary , The Last Dance .
The six - inch figure depicts Jordan in his number 9 Dream Team uniform , which is made from actual fabric .
The attention to detail is second to none , as the toy comes with two interchangeable portraits and sets of hands , as well as a basketball , while MJ is also wearing leg and elbow sleeves and his " Olympic " Air Jordan 7s .
The 1992 Olympic team , more commonly referred to as the Dream Team , is arguably the greatest sports team ever assembled .
Alongside Jordan , the roster consisted of Magic Johnson , Larry Bird , Charles Barkley , Scottie Pippen , and numerous other Hall of Famers .
With the six - inch Michael Jordan figure scheduled to release in April of 2021 , you can go ahead and pre-order it by following the link below .
do n’t wind back the clock on medicine
When we reject centuries of medical science and research , we 're effectively going back and time to make ailments we tamed into life - threatening afflictions once again .
You ’re probably familiar with the old axiom that it ’s not what you say , but how you say it that matters .
However , that ’s not entirely true .
The way you make your argument can flock people who agree with your basic premise to your side and maybe sway a couple of neutral observers .
But carefully wielded words specifically intended to appeal to the right set of emotions , are much more potent .
A perfect example of that is a recent comment about my coverage of a study which investigated why quack medicine is so prevalent throughout the world .
It hits all the high notes , casting all modern medication as poisons being peddled by clueless doctors , trying to appeal to our wholesome feelings about nature by asking why we do n’t trust what it provides us and leaving us with the plea to be more open minded .
Like most defense of alternative medicine , it ’s emotional and more than a little misleading .
By asking you to choose between “ man-made poison ” and what nature provides us in herbs , it sets up a classic false dichotomy .
And in my case , I would take the so - called poison over some herb any day of the week .
Why ?
Because I have no idea what all those earthy sounding mixtures actually contain or what exactly will happen when I ingest them .
There ’s no approval by the FDA , no study , no authority to which I could appeal for a review of what happens if I take it for a long period of time .
With modern medication , I could at least try to get an idea of what it will do to my body .
With herbs , there ’s seldom such luck .
Another interesting little tidbit is that the most potent poisons we know of are found in nature .
The bite of a big Sydney funnel web spider is fatal without swift medical attention .
Komodo dragons have mouths filled with all sorts of horrifying bacteria that seeps into wounds left from their bites and leads to a very painful death .
Some frogs are also about as safe to handle as a biological weapon .
Predation on our planet created a biosphere in which horrifying toxins are frequently used weapons .
And they ’re all natural , reaching their current composition over millions of years .
Oh , and did I mention plants with poisonous leaves ?
To say that man -made medicine is poisonous but that we should trust something that nature provides because it ’s nature , is to forget that most of our biosphere is actively engaged in killing for survival and if you do n’t watch what you ingest , you might end up as yet another victim of natural selection .
Of course nature does offer a number of compounds that can be used to help us which is why , contrary to the dogma of herbal advocates , drug companies use quite a few natural extracts and by - products of venoms for a wide variety of medications .
Those supposed “ man- made poisons ” are often based on what nature provides , so when an alternative medicine proponent ridicules modern pharmacology , he ’s also unwittingly taking aim at the plants and animals which provide the base for its products .
The very same plants and animals he later holds as superior to the experts who practice evidence - based medicine .
Obviously , that proponent really is n’t familiar with the topic and relying on the wordplay to make a point because the science is n’t there to back up his claims and outrage at how anyone would be so foolish to believe that humans are smarter than nature in making remedies .
Rather than do a quick search and find ongoing projects which scour nature to look for the new cancer cure or HIV treatment , he tries to tap into New Age sensibilities .
Interestingly enough , herbal medicine and many alternative treatment methods have a very long track record .
Our ancestors used them for thousands of years and we can compare their life expectancy and the quality of their care to that of the modern world .
After developing vaccines , antibiotics and solidifying the germ theory of disease , we ’ve been able to subdue polio , mumps , rubella and measles , eradicate smallpox , drive down the previously terrifying infant mortality rate and double life expectancy .
In less than a century , today ’s principles of medicine were able to do what traditional remedies could n’t since Neolithic times .
Granted , at the time when homeopathy and modern incarnations of herbal remedies were invented , doctors still had a hard time getting a grip on why people got sick and how to treat most diseases .
Going to the hospital back then was gambling with your life and people would embrace alternative treatments because they did n’t make things worse .
We ’ve come a long way since then and the results are very clear if we look at the drastic improvements to our quality of life .
Why should we wind back the clock to the days when diseases were thought to be evil spirits or black magic spells contaminating the body and the cure was a chi re-alignment followed by an aura polishing until the light from your chakras repelled any ghost in the vicinity ?

About 350 medical experts , computer gaming professionals and entrepreneurs gathered last week at the fifth annual Games for Health Conference in Boston .
For the first time , the conference featured a day of sessions specifically focused on gaming and cognitive health , and included presentations by researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology , as well as Warner Bros .
Interactive Entertainment .
GAME HUNTERS : Check out Brain Age or Personal Trainer : Math games YOUR HEALTH : Fitness games get a workout LOOK QUICK : Action games improve adult vision Topics ranged from the use of gaming to change behavior to helping neurodegenerative disease patients improve balance .
" Ten years ago , researchers would n't have thought this could happen , " said Alvaro Fernandez , CEO and co-founder of Sharp Brains , a San Francisco market research firm that specializes in cognitive science , and that organized the conference .
" Now we 're seeing that brain games may be able to help with attention , memory and the ability to regulate stress , " Fernandez said .
Alvaro says products come in many formats : CD - ROMs , iPhone applications , handheld devices , while others , like Wii , are adapted for big screens .
One birdwatching game , for example , by Luminosity , aims at improving attention and the ability to process visual information .
Medical experts say there is a lot of pilot research looking at how gaming can help patients with an array of illnesses , but more research is needed to understand what kind of games and how much time spent with them will make a difference , says David Rabiner , director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Duke University .
Another hurdle is that gaming and medicine are such disparate fields , says Murali Doraiswamy , chief of Biological Psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center , who gave a talk at last week 's conference , encouraging attendees to form a consensus group made up of leaders from many sectors to bring gaming for health to the next level .
" We 're on the cusp of something big .
What it needs to galvanize is discussion between academia , government agencies , gaming companies and insurance companies , " Doraiswamy says .
" There are two streams of thought right now :
Do you take something healthy and try to make it fun or something fun and try to make it healthy ? " he says .

The announcement of Left 4 Dead 2 resulted in outrage and even a boycott among fans .
The ESRB is n’t too happy either , but not because of the game itself : Apparently the cover art was too gory .
( They apparently do n’t like the V sign )
It seems that three chewed off fingers is just a little too much for the ESRB .
They ’ve banned Valve from using the image in any marketing materials and the cover art .
One chewed off thumb is okay , though .
Maybe it ’s because the thumb is n’t actually a finger but an appendage .
Who knows ?
It ’s a little ridiculous to say the least .
Luckily the game itself is fine with the guys over at the ESRB , but even something as little as the cover art ban is sure to only put fuel on the boycott fire .
My life as a fast - food consumer pretty much ended the moment my kids became old enough to drive themselves to the nearest hamburger stand .
But even back then I knew that all such chains could be divided into two categories :
There was In - N - Out , and there was everybody else .
The In - N - Out cult -- is there any other word for it ? -- is rooted in its patrons ’ appreciation for its simple menu and its sedulous devotion to fresh , high - quality ingredients .
To be sure , there are other fascinations .
These include the mystique created by its management ’s traditional refusal to ever speak to the press ( including for this column ) .

Then there are the biblical citations imprinted on the edges and seams of its burger wrappers and disposable cups , a practice started by the late Richard Snyder , the born - again younger son and onetime heir apparent to In - N - Out ’s founders , Harry and Esther Snyder .
Finally , there are the intertwined issues of In - N - Out ’s colorful past and its unsettled future , which are touched on in a new book titled simply “ In - N - Out Burger , ” by BusinessWeek writer Stacy Perman .
Perman observes that In - N - Out has prospered by hewing close to the stolid principles of controlled growth , limited menu , fresh food and regional focus -- with the exception of one store in Utah , its 232 locations are all in California , Nevada or Arizona -- set in stone by its founders , like commandments .
( Harry died in 1976 , his widow in 2006 . )
As a private company , In - N - Out does n’t release financial figures , though the trade press estimated sales in 2005 at $ 370 million -- a healthy sum for a small chain .
Southern Californians have grown up appreciating the company ’s virtues , while the rest of the country slavers from afar :
In - N - Out generally pays better than other burger chains , in return for which employees are held to rigorous standards of appearance and behavior .
It ’s a fair bet you ’ll never see a video on YouTube of workers adulterating In - N - Out food even in jest , as recently befell another chain .

In - N - Out management , from corporate headquarters in Baldwin Park and Irvine down to store level , is first class .
“ The executive corps is the key to their success at weathering problems , ” says Perman , who did n’t get the company ’s help with her book .
The menu never changes -- burgers that can be piled high like flapjacks , fries and shakes or soda .
The provisions are all fresh thanks to the chain ’s fabled quality control and a tight geographic footprint that keeps all stores within a few hundred miles of regional distribution centers .
There ’s no denying that next to an In - N - Out burger , the fare at McDonald ’s , despite the latter ’s relentless menu experimentation and customer research , tastes like premasticated garbage .
That ’s not to say that In - N - Out serves health food .
I do n’t have room here for a detailed analysis of its nutritional value , other than to say that a normal adult should be able to cross the Sahara fueled by the caloric , fat and sodium content of a standard dose double - double with fries and a shake .
I believe the In - N - Out meal I ingested a week ago Tuesday ( submitted as a reporting expense ) is still burbling about in my system somewhere , not that I did n’t enjoy it to the utmost .

Yet In - N - Out ’s history is anything but dull .
The Snyders established a line of succession skipping over their older son , Guy , in favor of the more stable Richard .
That well - laid plan dissolved with Richard ’s death in a 1993 plane crash .
The inheritance passed to Guy , who had a history of drug abuse and died from an overdose of a prescription painkiller in 1999 .
With Esther ’s death seven years later , majority control became vested in two family trusts .
It will pass after 2011 to Guy ’s only natural child , his daughter Lynsi Martinez , 27 .
What little has been said about Martinez for public consumption comes from the 2006 court battle between the company and Richard Boyd , a former executive who said he had grown close to Esther , only to be shouldered aside by Lynsi and In - N - Out Chief Executive Mark Taylor , the husband of one of her half - sisters .
The fight aired a pile of In - N - Out ’s dirty laundry , which goes to prove that no matter how hard you work to keep your public image sewn up tight , it can blow at any seam .
Boyd alleged that Taylor and Martinez kept the nearly bedridden Esther Snyder a virtual prisoner in her home , screening and intercepting phone calls and visitors .
He depicted Martinez as an immature religious fanatic with a taste for “ partying hard ” who cast him from the company after concluding he was no “ man of God . ”

The company dismissed these assertions as “ conspiracy theories ” and said Boyd had been dismissed for fraud and embezzlement .
Boyd called the allegations against him “ demonstrably false . ”
The dueling lawsuits were eventually settled on confidential terms , though the courthouse allegations animate Perman ’s book .
Boyd , for his part , remains upbeat about the company where he worked for more than 20 years .
“ It ’s a great company , ” he told me this week .
“ When Rich Snyder died , he had so many good people in place that it never missed a heartbeat . ”
But that still leaves the question of how forcibly Martinez might impose her will on the company and -- even more intriguing -- what is her will ?
Once she takes formal ownership , if she declares In - N - Out will henceforth sell only Buffalo Burgers or Broccoli Burgers , or will dispense prayers rather than food , her word will be law .
Indeed , given the inviolability of the trusts , her word probably already is law .
Advertisement
What should keep the chain ’s fans up at night is whether In - N - Out can continue to tread the fine line between modern business imperatives and its own traditions .
Taylor has been quoted as saying he intends to stick to a pattern of opening 10 to 12 new stores a year , though Boyd claimed in his lawsuit that he had heard him express national ambitions .
An expansion across the Mississippi would probably strain In - N - Out ’s self - generated financial resources to the limit -- the chain does n’t even accept franchisees .
But a public offering , much less a buyout by a public company , would almost certainly render it unrecognizable .
The homogenizing cost - cutting of corporate number - crunchers ( “ let ’s drop the beef by a grade ; the customers wo n’t notice ” ) could mean the end of In - N - Out as we know it .
That suggests the company ’s best option might be to remain the happy prisoner of its own success .
Boyd may be right when he says : “ If they leave it exactly as it is and do n’t make any changes , they ’ll last forever . ”

Charles Barkley 's impromptu , line - crossing NBA analyst technique is what endears him to millions and it continues to amaze me how much he gets away with on - air / off - court without any career - ending consequences .
The latest installment : Last night 's TNT broadcast where Sir Roundmound calls Kenny Smith " Numb nuts " and his producer a " pussy . "

This is a step down on the insult chain for Kiely , who 's had to put up with Barkley insults throughout most of his career at TNT , going from " big fat obnoxious boss " to pussy .
Reggie Miller 's " What 's wrong with you ? ! " reaction after Barkley 's p-word is also pretty amusing and another reason why this show continues to be one of the most entertaining sports broadcasts in history .
Charles Barkley Lets Cat Get His Tongue [ You Been Blinde ]

The booms can be inflated with gas but need then to be made rigid Satellites and spent rocket stages could soon deploy " sails " to guide them back to Earth much faster than they would otherwise fall out of the sky .
With space becoming ever more crowded , there is a need to remove redundant objects that could pose a collision threat to operational missions .
Extending a sail on an old spacecraft would increase drag and pull it into the Earth 's atmosphere to burn up .
Major European space firm EADS Astrium says the scheme has great potential .
" It is an interesting solution , especially for the satellite that has no propulsion system at the end of its life , " Brice Santerre told BBC News .
Santerre and colleague Max Cerf have been working on the Innovative DEorbiting Aerobrake System ( IDEAS ) .
The concept involves extending booms and sheeting from spacecraft to increase the amount of drag they experience from the residual air molecules still present at altitudes up to even 750 km ( 470 miles )
" The principle of aerobraking is to increase the surface over mass ratio of an orbital object , to accelerate the fall - out by increasing the drag on the system , " Mr Santerre said .
" To do that , we need to deploy a very light structure .
That 's why we chose to use ' gossamer structures ' .
These are composed of booms and very thin membranes . "
Microscope will investigate the behaviour of free - falling objects Astrium has been developing an aerobraking sail concept for the forthcoming French Microscope satellite .
Microscope is a science mission that will investigate the force of gravity and the behaviour of free - falling objects in a test of what has become known as the equivalence principle .
The satellite will take about a year to make its measurements and will then have no further purpose .
Ideally , such a spacecraft would be removed from orbit , especially since it will be circling at an altitude where many important Earth observation satellites also operate .
" Microscope has no propulsion system so it cannot de-orbit by itself .
If we were to do nothing , the fall - out duration would be between 50 and 100 years , " said Mr Santerre .
By erecting their boom and membrane mechanism , Santerre and Serf believe Microscope could be brought out of the sky in less than 25 years , which meets international orbital junk mitigation guidelines .
Astrium is now investigating how the IDEAS concept could be applied to spent rocket stages .
The company leads the production of Europe 's premier launcher , the Ariane 5 .
The concept developed for Microscope would bring it back inside 25 years Much of the Ariane 's structure - its main core stage and solid boosters - fall rapidly out of the sky at the end of a flight ; but the upper - stage is much longer lived in orbit .
Once it has ejected its satellite payload , the stage continues to circle the Earth in a large ellipse , running out to more than 35,000 km from the Earth and coming as close as about 250 km .
It may take 100 years before an upper - stage falls naturally from the sky .
" Our study shows that if we want to apply the aerobraking concept to an Ariane - class upper - stage then we need a system with booms , or masts , of about 12 m and a deployed surface of about 250 sq m .
" This is possible with our current technologies .
We need now to check that this is the best solution .
We are also thinking whether this type of system can be applied to other launchers as well . "
One alternative , of course , is to give the Ariane 5 upper - stage the capability to take a powered dive into the Earth 's atmosphere .
The Ariane 5 upper - stage continues to circle the Earth for decades
This was done for the first time last year at the end of the launch of the Jules Verne space station freighter .
This was considered essential because of the number of manned missions that routinely follow the station 's orbit .
Once Jules Verne was released from the rocket , the upper - stage reignited its engine to make a controlled burn - up over the Pacific .
The advantages of de-orbiting in this way are clear , but the extra fuel requirements and complexity of re-ignitable engines add cost to what is already a very expensive endeavour .
Aerobraking sails , on the other hand , are lightweight and extremely simple .
Their operation could even be controlled by a pre-set timer , fixed to deploy a certain number of minutes after the end of a flight .
This means that even an upper - stage that is out of control can still be guaranteed to return to Earth in a timely fashion .
Santerre and Serf presented their latest research at the recent European Conference on Space Debris in Darmstadt , Germany .
The meeting closed with a statement from its organisers saying that effective measures to clean up space debris needed to be devised and implemented .
The upper -stage that launched Jules Verne took itself into a controlled dive

Despite the fact that the U.S. government publicly approved a CIA destabilization campaign in Iran two years ago
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , June 24 , 2009
President Barack Obama was forced to address accusations that the CIA was involved in fomenting the post-election riots in Iran during his White House press conference yesterday , claiming the allegations were “ patently false , ” despite the fact that the U.S. government publicly gave the CIA approval to undertake a destabilization campaign in Iran more than two years ago .
“ There are reports suggesting that the CIA is behind all this – all of which is patently false but it gives you a sense of the narrative that the Iranian government would love to play into , ” said Obama .
CIA involvement in Iran is not a “ narrative ” manufactured by the Iranian government , as Obama well knows .
As we highlighted in our report earlier this week , evidence of U.S. intelligence meddling in Iran is widespread , which is no surprise considering the fact that the U.S. all but announced they would pursue a destabilization campaign in Iran years ago .
In May 2007 , the London Telegraph and others revealed that President George W. Bush had “ Given the CIA approval to launch covert “ black ” operations to achieve regime change in Iran . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
On May 23 , 2007 , Brian Ross and Richard Esposito reported on ABC News : “ The CIA has received secret presidential approval to mount a covert “ black ” operation to destabilize the Iranian government , current and former officials in the intelligence community tell ABC News . ”
The plan set in motion CIA propaganda and disinformation campaigns “ intended to destabilise , and eventually topple , the theocratic rule of the mullahs ” .
It also released funds to bankroll the militant Jundullah organization , an Al - Qaeda offshoot formerly headed by the alleged mastermind of 9/11 Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
The group has been blamed for a number of bombings inside Iran aimed at destabilizing Ahmadinejad ’s government .
It is widely suspected that the well known right - wing terrorist organization known as Mujahedeen-e Khalq , once run by Saddam Hussein ’s dreaded intelligence services , is now also working exclusively for the CIA ’s Directorate of Operations and carrying out bombings in Iran .
A large number of Mujahedeen-e Khalq members were arrested following riots last week , according to a Press TV report .
The article claims that the men were “ extensively trained in Iraq ’s camp Ashraf to create post- election mayhem in the country ” .
As part of CIA destabilization efforts in Iran , former Pakistani Army General Mirza Aslam Beig last week claimed that the Agency had distributed 400 million dollars inside Iran to evoke a revolution .
Beig cited documents that prove “ the CIA spent 400 million dollars inside Iran to prop up a colorful - hollow revolution following the election . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The CIA program approved by Bush also included funding opposition groups and providing them with communications equipment that would bypass Internet censorship and allow demonstrators to communicate .
Twitter and other social networking websites have played a key role in the demonstrations .
The U.S. State Department , which routinely demonizes the Internet as a tool of extremists and terrorists when it is used to criticize U.S. foreign policy , took the unprecedented step last week of requesting that Twitter.com “ delay planned maintenance work so that Iranian protesters can continue to use it to post images and reports of unrest , ” according to a London Times report .
According to several different reports , the CIA and Mossad has been creating fake Twitter feeds and flooding Iranians with SMS messages inspiring them to riot .
According to author Thierry Meyssan , Iranians received messages before the election votes had even been counted telling them that the Iranian Guardian Council had declared Mir-Hossein Mousavi to be the winner .
When the official announcement of Ahmadinejad ’s victory was later broadcast , the sentiment that fraud had took place was therefore amplified .
Meyssan also charges that the CIA and Mossad used Twitter feeds to put out fake reports of gun fights and deaths that were never confirmed , rousing Iranians to riot in the belief that their fellow countrymen were being brutally suppressed by the authorities .
Another website clearly documents the fact that the main Twitter accounts used to send out hundreds of alerts during the protests were only recently created and had not send out any alerts whatsoever before the protests began .
Top Neo-Cons with deep ties to the U.S. military - industrial complex like John Bolton and Henry Kissinger have been calling for the CIA to fund a ‘ color revolution ’ in Iran for years as a gateway to regime change .
Lest we forget that it was a violent CIA coup that led to the overthrow of the democratically elected Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh in 1953 under Operation Ajax .
The ousting was achieved by means of staged bombings and shootings which were blamed on the Iranian government in order to antagonize the population and enable the coup .
During the coup , the CIA also bribed Iranian government officials , businessmen , and reporters , and paid Iranians to demonstrate in the streets .
Given this history , allied with the U.S. government ’s own public program to instigate a destabilization campaign in Iran through the CIA , Obama ’s claim that CIA involvement is “ patently false ” is clearly contradicted by the facts .
The only thing that ’s “ patently false ” is Obama ’s statement itself .

Short sentences are usually best .
But not always and not all the time .
Newspapers teach journalists to write a single thought in a sentence .
That way the meaning is clearer .
The Economist Style Guide makes a joke of this in its guide to punctuation :
Full stops .
Use plenty .
They keep sentences short .
This helps the reader .
Much as I love short sentences , too many in a row makes writing boring and hard to read .
They can also be uneconomical .
As Harold Evans points out in Newsman ’s English :
Often it is wasteful to introduce a subject and predicate for each idea .
The subordinate clause in a complex sentence can state relations more precisely and more economically than can a string of simple sentences or compound sentences joined by and , but , so , etc .
There ’s another reason to use complex sentences in your writing .
They add rhythm .
Use too many short sentences and your copy will have a staccato flow annoying and distracting readers .
Use too many long sentences and your writing will lack pace .
You may lull your readers to sleep .
Most writing is not poetry .
Yet the best poets master rhythm .
It makes words easier to listen to , easier to read .
A similar logic applies to paragraphs .
View them as bundles of closely related thoughts .
There ’s no hard and fast rule about the best length of paragraphs .
It ’s a good idea to minimise the number of one sentence paragraphs you write .
As with sentences , vary the pace .
Too many consecutive short paragraphs are annoying .
Too many long ones are hard work for the reader .
Both approaches are difficult to read .
Above all else use paragraphs to make your writing easier to read .

Following Netanyahu ’s much anticipated policy speech , politicians and journalists , like mindless automatons , have set about repeating Israel ’s tired mantra that Palestinians should recognize Israel ’s right to exist .
Never mind the fact that the PLO and Palestine Authority have obliged this ludicrous call , not once , but four times .
And never mind that Israel has always denied Palestine ’s right to exist , not only as a nation , but as individuals seeking a dignified life in our own homeland .
Does anyone find it interesting that Israel is the only country on the planet going around with this incessant insistence that everyone recognize her right to exist ?
Given that we Palestinians are the ones who have been dispossessed , occupied , and oppressed , one might expect that we should be the ones making such a demand .
But t hat is n’t the case .
Why ?
Because our right to exist as a nation is self - evident .
We are the natives of that land !
We know we have that right .
The world knows it .
That ’s why Palestine does n’t need Israel or any other country to recognize her right to exist .
We are the rightful heirs to that land and this can be verified legally , historically , culturally , and even genetically .
And as such , the only true legitimacy Israel will ever have must come from us abdicating our inheritance , our history , and our culture to Israel .
That ’s why Israel insists we declare she had a right to take everything we ever had — from home and property , cemeteries , churches and mosques , to culture and history and hope .
Israel is a country that was founded by Europeans who came to Palestine , formed terrorist gangs who set about a systematic ethnic cleansing of the native Palestinians from their homes on 78 % of Historic Palestine in 1948 .
Those Palestinians and their descendants still languish in refugee camps .
Israel attempted a similar scenario in 1967 when they conquered the remainder of Palestine , but Palestinians then could n’t be dislodged from their homes as easily .
This remains true , despite 40 years of Israel ’s violent and oppressive military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza .
Despite home demolitions , land confiscations , rapacious building of Jewish - only colonies , endless checkpoints , targeted assassinations , bombings of schools , hospitals , municipal buildings and malls , closures and denials ; despite the massive human rights abuses , the imprisonment and torture of men women and children alike , the separation of families , the daily humiliations ; despite the massive killings —
Palestinians remain .
We still resist .
We still live , love , and have babies .
As much as we can , we rebuild what Israel destroys .
Such are rights !
Rights are inherent and inherently just , like the right to live with dignity and to be masters of one ’s own fate .
It is a human right not be persecuted and oppressed because you happen to belong to one religion and not another .
That Israelis simply take property belonging to Palestinians is not a right .
That is theft .
That Israel cut off the movement of food , medicine and other basic goods to the Gaza strip , causing massive malnutrition , economic collapse and misery because Palestinians elected particular leaders is not a right .
That is an affront to humanity .
That Israel rain death from the skies on an already battered and starved Gaza , murdering over 3000 human beings and maiming thousands more in a single month is not a right .
It ’s a war crime .
That Israel has employed every imperialistic tactic to subjugate , humiliate , break , and expel an entire nation of principally unarmed civilians because of their religion is not a right .
It is a moral obscenity .
That every Jew from Europe , Africa , Asia , the Americas , and Australia be entitled to dual citizenship , one in their native country and one in Israel , while the rightful heirs to the land linger as refugees without citizenship anywhere is not a right .
It is an outrage .
I ’m sure my words will be twisted in some way to imply that I ’m advocating pushing Israelis “ into the sea ” or some other asinine claim .
So let me be explicit :
We all have the right to exist , to live , to be masters of our own destiny .
We all have the right not to be oppressed by others .
Such rights are inherent to every individual living in that land : Jew , Muslim , or Christian .
But Israelis do not have the right to create particular religious demographics by causing the demise of the natives .
To be a Jewish [ or Muslim or Christian ] state , where privilege is accorded to those belonging to a particular religion at the expense of those who do not is not a right .
A nation that discriminates against and oppresses those who do not belong to a particular religious , racial , or ethnic group is not a light onto nations .
It is a blight .
And to recognize such racism as a human or national right goes against every tenet of international law .
It defies the basic sense that the worth of a human being should not be measured by their religion , any more than it should be measured by the color of their skin or the language they speak .
Adam Smith and Karl Marx agree that workers not bosses create value .
By Eric Toussaint , translated by Charles La Via in collaboration with Christine Pagnoulle .
In the following citations , we discover that what Adam Smith wrote in the 1770s is not so distant from what Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels would write 70 years later in the famous Communist Manifesto .
According to Adam Smith :
“ The labour of a manufacturer adds , generally , to the value of the materials which he works upon , that of his own maintenance , and of his master 's profit . ”
In Marxist terms , this means that through their labour workers reproduce part of the constant capital ( the quantity of raw materials , energy , percentage of the value of the technical machinery , and so on , that are accounted for in the manufacturing of a given commodity ) to which must be added the variable capital corresponding to their wages and the profit made by capitalists , which Karl Marx called surplus value .
Karl Marx and Adam Smith – each in his own time – both considered that it is the workers not the bosses / capitalists who produce value .
Workers create value , then , without in fact costing [ their capitalist bosses ] anything : “ Though the manufacturer ( i.e. the worker ) has his wages advanced to him by his master , he , in reality , costs him ( the capitalist ) no expense , the value of those wages being generally restored , together with a profit , in the improved value of the subject upon which his labour is bestowed ”
In the following passage , Adam Smith analyses the conflicts of interest and the class struggle opposing capitalists and workers :
What are the common wages of labour , depends everywhere upon the contract usually made between those two parties ( workers and capitalists ) , whose interests are by no means the same .
The workmen desire to get as much , the masters to give as little as possible .
The former are disposed to combine in order to raise , the latter in order to lower the wages of labour .
It is not , however , difficult to foresee which of the two parties must , upon all ordinary occasions , have the advantage in the dispute , and force the other into a compliance with their terms .
The masters , being fewer in number , can combine much more easily ; and the law , besides , authorizes , or at least does not prohibit their combinations , while it prohibits those of the workmen .
We have no acts of parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; but many against combining to raise it .
In all such disputes the masters can hold out much longer .
A landlord , a farmer , a master manufacturer , a merchant , though they did not employ a single workman , could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired .
Many workmen could not subsist a week , few could subsist a month , and scarce any a year without employment .
In the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him ; but the necessity is not so immediate .
We rarely hear , it has been said , of the combinations of masters , though frequently of those of workmen .
But whoever imagines , upon this account , that masters rarely combine , is as ignorant of the world as of the subject .
Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit , but constant and uniform combination , not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate .
To violate this combination is everywhere a most unpopular action , and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbours and equals .
We seldom , indeed , hear of this combination , because it is the usual , and one may say , the natural state of things , which nobody ever hears of .
Masters , too , sometimes enter into particular combinations to sink the wages of labour even below this rate .
These are always conducted with the utmost silence and secrecy , till the moment of execution , and when the workmen yield , as they sometimes do , without resistance , though severely felt by them , they are never heard of by other people .
Such combinations , however , are frequently resisted by a contrary defensive combination of the workmen ; who sometimes too , without any provocation of this kind , combine of their own accord to raise the price of their labour .
Their usual pretences are , sometimes the high price of provisions ; sometimes the great profit which their masters make by their work .
But whether their combinations be offensive or defensive , they are always abundantly heard of .
In order to bring the point to a speedy decision , they have always recourse to the loudest clamour , and sometimes to the most shocking violence and outrage .
They are desperate , and act with the folly and extravagance of desperate men , who must either starve , or frighten their masters into an immediate compliance with their demands .
The masters upon these occasions are just as clamorous upon the other side , and never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate , and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so much severity against the combinations of servants , labourers , and journeymen . ” .
According to Adam Smith , this state of things motivates the capitalist as follows :
“ The consideration of his own private profit is the sole motive which determines the owner of any capital to employ it either in agriculture , in manufactures , or in some particular branch of the wholesale or retail trade .
The different quantities of productive labour which it may put into motion , and the different values which it may add to the annual produce of the land and labour of the society , according as it is employed in one or other of those different ways , never enter into his thoughts . ”
Adam Smith argues that there are three basic social classes : 1 . landowners , who live by renting their land ; 2 . wage earners ; and 3 . capitalists , who live off the profits they make .
Smith describes the class consciousness and class interests of these three social groups in his own terms .
“ The whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country , or what comes to the same thing , the whole price of that annual produce , naturally divides itself , it has already been observed , into three parts ; the rent of land , the wages of labour , and the profits of stock ; and constitutes a revenue to three different orders of people ; to those who live by rent , to those who live by wages , and to those who live by profit .
These are the three great , original , and constituent orders of every civilised society , from whose revenue that of every other order is ultimately derived . ” (…)
Speaking of the class that has its own private means , that is the landowners , Adam Smith asserts that : “ They are the only one of the three orders whose revenue costs them neither labour nor care , but comes to them , as it were , of its own accord , and independent of any plan or project of their own .
That indolence , which is the natural effect of the ease and security of their situation , renders them too often , not only ignorant , but incapable of that application of mind which is necessary in order to foresee and understand the consequences of any public regulation .
The interest of the second order , that of those who live by wages , is as strictly connected with the interest of the society as that of the first . ( … ) .
But though the interest of the labourer is strictly connected with that of the society , he is incapable either of comprehending that interest or of understanding its connection with his own .
His condition leaves him no time to receive the necessary information , and his education and habits are commonly such as to render him unfit to judge even though he was fully informed .
In the public deliberations , therefore , his voice is little heard and less regarded , except upon some particular occasions , when his clamour is animated , set on and supported by his employers , not for his , but their own particular purposes .
His employers constitute the third order , that of those who live by profit .
It is the stock that is employed for the sake of profit which puts into motion the greater part of the useful labour of every society .
The plans and projects of the employers of stock regulate and direct all the most important operations of labour , and profit is the end proposed by all those plans and projects . ( … ) .
Merchants and master manufacturers are , in this order , the two classes of people who commonly employ the largest capitals , and who by their wealth draw to themselves the greatest share of the public consideration .
As during their whole lives they are engaged in plans and projects , they have frequently more acuteness of understanding than the greater part of country gentlemen . ( … ) .
The interest of the dealers , however , in any particular branch of trade or manufactures , is always in some respects different from , and even opposite to , that of the public .
To widen the market and to narrow the competition , is always the interest of the dealers .
To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public ; but to narrow the competition must always be against it , and can serve only to enable the dealers , by raising their profits above what they naturally would be , to levy , for their own benefit , an absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow - citizens .
The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution , and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined , not only with the most scrupulous , but with the most suspicious attention .
It comes from an order of men whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public , who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public , and who accordingly have , upon many occasions , both deceived and oppressed it . ”
Smith ’s works contain other similar judgements , which would give rashes to those politicians and ideologists who claim to be his disciples :
“ Our merchants frequently complain of the high wages of British labour as the cause of their manufactures being undersold in foreign markets , but they are silent about the high profits of stock .
They complain of the extravagant gain of other people , but they say nothing of their own .
The high profits of British stock , however , may contribute towards raising the price of British manufactures in many cases as much , and in some perhaps more , than the high wages of British labour . ”
This statement would be a heresy for the capitalists , who hold wage costs – always too high in their opinion – responsible for inflation and the lack of competitiveness .
These concepts , which are as essential ( if not more ) in the thought of Adam Smith as the famous invisible hand ( only mentioned three times in his work ) , are systematically forgotten by today ’s dominant economic thinkers .
One of the fundamental differences between Adam Smith and Karl Marx , is that the former , although he was conscious of how workers are exploited by capitalists , supported the capitalists whereas the latter argued for the emancipation of workers .
The General Rules of the International Workingmen 's Association 1864 ( IWA ) written by Karl Marx express the basic substance of his position :
“ Considering ,
That the emancipation of the working classes must be conquered by the working classes themselves , that the struggle for the emancipation of the working classes means not a struggle for class privileges and monopolies , but for equal rights and duties , and the abolition of all class rule ;
That the economical subjection of the man of labor to the monopoliser of the means of labour — that is , the source of life — lies at the bottom of servitude in all its forms , of all social misery , mental degradation , and political dependence ;
That the economical emancipation of the working classes is therefore the great end to which every political movement ought to be subordinate as a means ;
That all efforts aiming at the great end hitherto failed from the want of solidarity between the manifold divisions of labour in each country , and from the absence of a fraternal bond of union between the working classes of different countries ;
That the emancipation of labour is neither a local nor a national , but a social problem , embracing all countries in which modern society exists , and depending for its solution on the concurrence , practical and theoretical , of the most advanced countries ;
That the present revival of the working classes in the most industrious countries of Europe , while it raises a new hope , gives solemn warning against a relapse into the old errors , and calls for the immediate combination of the still disconnected movements ;
For these reasons —
The International Working Men's Association has been founded .
It declares :
That all societies and individuals adhering to it will acknowledge truth , justice , and morality as the basis of their conduct toward each other and toward all men , without regard to colour , creed , or nationality ;
That it acknowledges no rights without duties , no duties without rights .

CLIFTON , N.J .
Sometimes during the past two weeks , making her rounds as a hospital resident , Dr. Saughar Samali has caught a glimpse of television news in a patient ’s room or heard a bulletin on the radio in the family - practice office .
Against her desire , against her better judgment , she has been plunged back into the maelstrom of Iran .
As long as she is on duty , Dr. Samali can suppress what she sees and hears of the marchers , the arrests , the beatings .
But when she leaves St. Joseph ’s Hospital in Paterson and returns home to nearby Clifton , the present conjures up a terrible past .
She remembers when her father ’s factory in Tehran was set afire , leaving him severely scarred and blind in one eye .
She remembers her family ’s trying to escape to Pakistan , traveling in a smuggler ’s Jeep , headlights out on a midnight desert .
She remembers the army bullets that shattered the windshield and pierced the tires , and she remembers the months in prison that followed .
It was 1985 , and she was 5 years old .
In all the years since , even after a subsequent , successful escape and a new life in the United States , Dr. Samali has not forgotten what it meant to be a Bahai in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
The man Guan Baihua shows his self - made multi-angle - wheel bicycle on May 6 , 2009 in Qingdao of Shandong Province , China .
Guan Baihua spent 18 months to complete this strange bicycle .
The Jewish magazine Moment ran an article in its latest issue asking rabbis from a variety of Jewish sects how Israel can promote peace with its Arab neighbors ( HT : Pharyngula ) .
Most of the rabbis express fairly bland , liberal views about the importance of peace and tolerance , which are fine in themselves , although few of them offer any concrete suggestions as to what Israel might do differently .
However , one rabbi , Manis Friedman of the Chabad - Lubavitch movement , was eager to make some specific proposals .
Here are some of them :
I do n’t believe in western morality , i.e. do n’t kill civilians or children , do n’t destroy holy sites , do n’t fight during holiday seasons , do n’t bomb cemeteries , do n’t shoot until they shoot first because it is immoral .
The only way to fight a moral war is the Jewish way : Destroy their holy sites .
Kill men , women and children ( and cattle ) .
The first Israeli prime minister who declares that he will follow the Old Testament will finally bring peace to the Middle East .
The rabbi did n’t elaborate on which verses from the Old Testament he had in mind , but the context of his statement suggests he was thinking of ones like these :
“ When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it , and hath cast out many nations before thee , the Hittites , and the Girgashites , and the Amorites , and the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , seven nations greater and mightier than thou ; and when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee , thou shalt smite them , and utterly destroy them ; thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor shew mercy unto them . ”
— Deuteronomy 7:1-2
“ So Joshua smote all the country of the hills , and of the south , and of the vale , and of the springs , and all their kings : he left none remaining , but utterly destroyed all that breathed , as the Lord God of Israel commanded . ”
— Joshua 10:40
“ And Amaziah strengthened himself , and led forth his people , and went to the valley of salt , and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand .
And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces . ”
— 2 Chronicles 25:11-12
In case Rabbi Friedman or anyone else is confused , I ’ll say it clearly :
The behavior that these verses describe is called genocide .
It is a war crime ; it is the greatest evil known to humankind .
I would think that the Jews , of all people , would understand this .
This attitude is why terrorism and bloodshed are ongoing in the Middle East , and why they will continue as long as people allow religion to guide their actions .
Brutal , violent books like the Old Testament are , as Sam Harris put it , “ a perpetual engine of extremism ” .
Although many liberal Jewish believers have reinterpreted and allegorized these stories until they ’re scarcely recognizable , the violent texts are always there to be rediscovered by zealots who interpret them with the frightening simplicity that their context suggests .
The Bible teaches clearly that it is God ’s will that the Jews should control all the land promised to their ancestors , and that genocide is the appropriate way to rid that land of anyone else who makes a claim on it .
Of course , Friedman ’s views are the mirror image of those on the other side who ’ve waged war and committed acts of terrorism against Israel .
His scorn for the principle “ do n’t kill civilians or children ” mirrors the suicide bomber zealots who set off their explosives on buses , in nightclubs , or wherever else will cause the most deaths .
His rejection of the idea “ do n’t destroy holy sites ” accords with the fanatics who deliberately target buildings and places held sacred by other sects .
What he calls the “ Jewish way ” of fighting a war is really the principle held by every fanatic who believes that outsiders are subhuman and that the righteous must bloodily cleanse them from the earth .
These competing fundamentalisms are why there is war in the Mideast and why there will continue to be war in the Mideast .
Compromise and diplomacy are not to be thought of by those who firmly believe that they are carrying out God ’s will .
So long as both sides are anchored in the immovable certainty of faith , there ’s little hope of ending the bloodshed and destruction .
The army has been targeting militants in Pakistan 's Swat valley
At least two soldiers have been killed and three others wounded by a suicide blast in Pakistani - administered Kashmir , officials say .
The Taliban has said it carried out the attack , the AP news agency reported .
Militants have launched deadly attacks on soldiers across Pakistan , but it is thought to be the first such bombing in Pakistani - administered Kashmir .
The army is engaged in an intense battle to dislodge the Taliban from strongholds in the north - west .
The Pakistani Taliban fighting the army in the north - west have no obvious presence in Pakistan - controlled Kashmir , our correspondent says .
Security tight
The bomber targeted soldiers in Shaukat Lines , a military area in Muzaffarabad , the regional capital .
He was described as about 18 years of age .
The attacker hit an army vehicle in an area which is used for residential purposes , a military spokesman said .
Witnesses told the BBC that the bomber walked up to a gate near the residences of junior officers , and engaged the guard in a conversation .
Other soldiers gathered at the scene , after which the bomber detonated the explosives , the witnesses said .
Security was tightened immediately after the explosion and an investigation was under way .
Widening offensive
The Pakistani army has recently widened its offensive to include assaults on South Waziristan , considered the stronghold of Pakistan 's Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud .
Hakimullah Mehsud , a deputy of the Pakistani Taliban leader , claimed responsibility for the attack and said they were to prove that Baitullah Mehsud had not been weakened by the recent onslaught .
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan says that the Taliban are hitting what is seen by many as a " soft " target in Muzaffarabad .
The purpose appears to be to widen the threat of militant attacks .
Talk about some bad timing .
Trading away all their top players this season has n’t been the only boneheaded move by the Tribe lately .
Today , the Cleveland Indians traded catcher Victor Martinez to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Justin Masterson and Nick Hagadone .
But guess what tomorrow is in Cleveland – Victor Martinez Bobblehead night at Progressive Field .
All fans attending the Aug. 1 game against the Detroit Tigers will receive a Victor Martinez catcher bobblehead , compliments of Time Warner Cable .
The game , which begins at 7:05 pm , will also feature “ Turn Back the Clock ” night .
Both teams will be sporting Negro League uniforms instead of their regular attire .
Only in Cleveland ……
Maybe Indians fans headed out to the game tomorrow could sell them on eBay , after all , there will be a demand in Boston now .
New Air Navigation Concept Means Greener Flights
The aviation industry has achieved notoriety given its massive carbon footprint .
But greening airline travel is apparently a big priority for aviation industry officials .
Members of the world aviation community have signed a Declaration calling for the implementation of Performance - based Navigation ( PBN ) , a new air navigation concept , that will contribute to further improving the safety , efficiency and environmental sustainability of the global air transport system .
The new concept is expected to enable the aviation industry to cut up to 500,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year .
One of the major benefits of PBN is that it will enable the industry to transition from conventional ground - based navigation procedures , to satellite - based navigation aids and area navigation procedures .
The latter are more accurate and allow for shorter , more direct routes between two given points , as well as more efficient take - offs and landings .
This reduces fuel burn , airport and airspace congestion , and aircraft emissions .
The aviation industry is also committed to using sustainable biofuels , such as algae , as the main source of fuel for commercial flights .
Even though it will be more expensive ( at least in the short term ) , industry officials believe that consumers will be committed to paying high price tags for cleaner fuel , even in this economy .

The Security Mindset
Uncle Milton Industries has been selling ant farms to children since 1956 .
Some years ago , I remember opening one up with a friend .
There were no actual ants included in the box .
Instead , there was a card that you filled in with your address , and the company would mail you some ants .
My friend expressed surprise that you could get ants sent to you in the mail .
I replied : “ What ’s really interesting is that these people will send a tube of live ants to anyone you tell them to . ”
Security requires a particular mindset .
Security professionals — at least the good ones — see the world differently .
They ca n’t walk into a store without noticing how they might shoplift .
They ca n’t use a computer without wondering about the security vulnerabilities .
They ca n’t vote without trying to figure out how to vote twice .
They just ca n’t help it .
SmartWater is a liquid with a unique identifier linked to a particular owner .
“ The idea is for me to paint this stuff on my valuables as proof of ownership , ” I wrote when I first learned about the idea .
“ I think a better idea would be for me to paint it on your valuables , and then call the police . ”
Really , we ca n’t help it .
This kind of thinking is not natural for most people .
It ’s not natural for engineers .
Good engineering involves thinking about how things can be made to work ; the security mindset involves thinking about how things can be made to fail .
It involves thinking like an attacker , an adversary or a criminal .
You do n’t have to exploit the vulnerabilities you find , but if you do n’t see the world that way , you ’ll never notice most security problems .
I ’ve often speculated about how much of this is innate , and how much is teachable .
In general , I think it ’s a particular way of looking at the world , and that it ’s far easier to teach someone domain expertise — cryptography or software security or safecracking or document forgery — than it is to teach someone a security mindset .
Which is why CSE 484 , an undergraduate computer - security course taught this quarter at the University of Washington , is so interesting to watch .
Professor Tadayoshi Kohno is trying to teach a security mindset .
You can see the results in the blog the students are keeping .
They ’re encouraged to post security reviews about random things : smart pill boxes , Quiet Care Elder Care monitors , Apple ’s Time Capsule , GM ’s OnStar , traffic lights , safe deposit boxes , and dorm room security .
One recent one is about an automobile dealership .
The poster described how she was able to retrieve her car after service just by giving the attendant her last name .
Now any normal car owner would be happy about how easy it was to get her car back , but someone with a security mindset immediately thinks :
“ Can I really get a car just by knowing the last name of someone whose car is being serviced ? ”
The rest of the blog post speculates on how someone could steal a car by exploiting this security vulnerability , and whether it makes sense for the dealership to have this lax security .
You can quibble with the analysis —
I ’m curious about the liability that the dealership has , and whether their insurance would cover any losses — but that ’s all domain expertise .
The important point is to notice , and then question , the security in the first place .
The lack of a security mindset explains a lot of bad security out there : voting machines , electronic payment cards , medical devices , ID cards , internet protocols .
The designers are so busy making these systems work that they do n’t stop to notice how they might fail or be made to fail , and then how those failures might be exploited .
Teaching designers a security mindset will go a long way toward making future technological systems more secure .
That part ’s obvious , but I think the security mindset is beneficial in many more ways .
If people can learn how to think outside their narrow focus and see a bigger picture , whether in technology or politics or their everyday lives , they ’ll be more sophisticated consumers , more skeptical citizens , less gullible people .
If more people had a security mindset , services that compromise privacy would n’t have such a sizable market share — and Facebook would be totally different .
Laptops would n’t be lost with millions of unencrypted Social Security numbers on them , and we ’d all learn a lot fewer security lessons the hard way .
The power grid would be more secure .
Identity theft would go way down .
Medical records would be more private .
If people had the security mindset , they would n’t have tried to look at Britney Spears ’ medical records , since they would have realized that they would be caught .
There ’s nothing magical about this particular university class ; anyone can exercise his security mindset simply by trying to look at the world from an attacker ’s perspective .
If I wanted to evade this particular security device , how would I do it ?
Could I follow the letter of this law but get around the spirit ?
If the person who wrote this advertisement , essay , article or television documentary were unscrupulous , what could he have done ?
And then , how can I protect myself from these attacks ?
The security mindset is a valuable skill that everyone can benefit from , regardless of career path .

FRANKFURT 
If gold is the ultimate sanctuary for small investors who have taken furious flight to quality , then Thomas Geissler may have invented the ultimate vending machine .
After creating an online platform for trading precious metals this year , his small company has hit on a frontier beyond the Internet : the seemingly endless line of devices at airports and train stations that spit out cigarettes , condoms , toothpaste and candy bars in exchange for a little cash .
But his machines will allow customers to buy small chunks of gold .
Mr. Geissler ’s argument centers on gold ’s role as the investor ’s last bulwark against inflation .
As the Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank and the Bank of England print vast amounts of money to combat the worst economic downturn in a generation , prices are likely to rise .
“ No one knows how these experiments of the central banks will work out , ” Mr. Geissler said .
“ When you close your eyes , you ca n’t possibly imagine that this will go well . ”
My review would be a reiteration of the previous review .
I agree that this talk is clear and as comprehensive as one could be in less than an hour .

This is one of Chomsky 's clearest articulations of his political philosophy .
His reading of libertarian philosophers show their critiques to be far more trenchant than is typically assumed , and argues that in that respect there is an unbroken line between them and modern anarchists .
What Chomsky has to say is very clear and very persuasive .

Part 6 : Tips On Finding Work By Matthew C. Keegan
I will not pretend that this is the easiest topic to write about .
In fact , my knowledge of how one finds work as a private flight attendant is based chiefly on what others have shared with me .
You can find some useful tips within the many threads written on the Corporate Flight Attendant Community message boards , but to save you from culling through hundreds of threads I will highlight various standout points and include others that have been shared with me over the past several years by industry insiders : Cold calling .
Time honored and time tested this is an important method for finding work and it is also one of the hardest for the majority of people to do .
If you do not have the skills to contact strangers you will find an important avenue for securing work omitted .
Even the unskilled can accomplish much by attempting this step ... practice , practice , practice and you will get the hang of it .
You many never feel comfortable doing it , but you accomplish much by trying .
Always keep this in mind : every person that you meet is a potential contact for helping you find work ; conversely , you may also be able to help someone out too .
Attend conferences / meetings .
Attending NBAA related conferences and events will get your name and face out there .
Preferably , you would also attend events where a lot of pilots hang out , especially pilots of cabin class jets which include the Global Express , G - V and Falcon Jet 2000 .
The NBAA 's annual conference is a very important venue for networking as well as are their one - day regional conferences .
If you are an NBAA member you get a copy of their directory which lists many companies that fly these very same jets .
In addition , membership will give you access to their message boards and other important information on events that they host .
How To Become A Corporate Flight Attendant :
Taking The First Step What Types Of Jets Will I Be Flying ?
What Kind Of Pay Can I Expect ?
What Type Of Training Do I Need ?
How Should I Craft My R�sum� ?
Tips On Finding Work How about attending the annual NBAA Flight Attendant Conference ?
Yes , it can be an important place to learn more about the industry , attend seminars , and network .
Many of the newer folks find it helps them gain a better understanding of private flying , while some veterans will tell you to save your money for the big conferences .
Your call : conference fees , hotel and transportation charges can add up significantly .
Not many people have the luxury of attending every event .
Local airport events .
Is your airport hosting a seminar ?
Is an important industry leader speaking ?
Well , why not attend ?
Sure , aircraft de-icing / anti-icing may not be the most exciting topic , but it is to pilots .
Guess what ?
Some of the same people you want to fly with will be attending .
Guess what ?
There is usually a social time afterwards .
After the recent crashes involving corporate jets you certainly do want to be knowledgeable about industry best practices involving ice .
Oh , by the way , have several copies of your r�sum� with you and copies of your business card to hand out .
Yes , get business cards made up and be prepared to share them liberally .
Consider joining your local airport 's advisory board , helping out with special community outreach programs , organizing an airport wide event , etc .
Anything that you like to do and that helps get your face and name out there is a plus .
In this business your name is golden .
Promote it and protect it for all that it is worth !
Become an expert self marketer / promoter .
The internet .
Do Google searches and start reading and bookmarking every page that interests you pertaining to business aviation .
The internet has more information then any library and it is updated frequently .
The Corporate Flight Attendant Community .
This website was created by me to be a resource center for private flight attendants , those who aspire to become one , and their supporters .
I draw upon industry leaders as well as the private flight attendants themselves to communicate what is going on in the industry , particularly from the cabin crewmember 's point of view .
Helpful articles , relevant links , catering information , r�sum� posting , and message boards are some of the more important features of the community .
This is truly a niche community one that has gained the attention and respect of many in the industry .
Of particular importance for learning / growing / networking are the message boards .
Mostly everyone who participates is already working in the field as a crewmember either full time or on a contract basis .
Others are working on the skills they need to enter the industry , while still others offer important help or guidance to the industry .
Let me say this : your screen name is your business and I do not reveal who you are if I happen to make the connection between your screen name and true identity .
Many business relationships and friendships have been made between our members because of the message boards .
By participating in our Open Chat time or via p.m. [ private message ] contact you can " meet " our members .
Job sites .
There are many sites on the internet listing aviation related jobs .
They include : Skyjobs , Plane Jobs , AviaNation , Climb to 350 , AEPS , and JetEmployment .
A big hint : if you do sign up check out the jobs listed on the " pay sites " with the free sites .
See if you notice any difference in jobs listed .
If you are a corporate flight attendant , do not expect many jobs to be listed publicly in any case .
There just are n't all that many available at any given time and most companies do not want to publicly advertise their openings .
Agencies .
AirCareCrews ; Integrity Flight Crews , LLC ; Jet Professionals , Inc. ; J.S. Firm ; Turner Services are all some of the names out there associated with providing hiring services .
Expect to pay a fee in most cases ; do not expect many opportunities .
Your call .
As one of our message board members has advised : build your own sources .
You may find that something works better for you than another person .
Much depends on your own initiative ; I find that those individuals who do the most exploring have an easier time finding work .
If flying corporate is something that you want , be persistent .
Another good trait : be flexible .
This includes having a willingness to relocate and being available to work 24/7/365 .

The first word came from abroad .
An aunt in the United States called her Saturday in a panic .
“ Do n’t go out into the streets , Golshad , ” she told her .
“ They ’re killing people . ”
The relative proceeded to describe a video , airing on exile television channels that are jammed in Iran , in which a young woman is shown bleeding to death as her companion calls out , “ Neda ! Neda ! ”
A dark foreboding swept over Golshad , who asked that her real name not be published .
She began calling the cellphone and home numbers of her friend Neda Agha - Soltan -- who had gone to the chaotic demonstration with a group of friends -- but Neda did n’t answer .
At midnight , as the city continued to smolder , Golshad drove to the Agha - Soltan residence in the Tehran Pars section in the eastern part of the capital .
As she heard the cries and wails and praising of God reverberating from the house , she crumpled , knowing that her worst fears were true .
“ Neda ! Neda ! ” the 25 - year - old cried out .
“ What will I do ? ”
Neda Agha-Soltan , 26 , was shot dead Saturday evening near the scene of clashes between pro-government militias and demonstrators who allege rampant vote fraud in the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
The jittery cellphone footage of her bleeding on the street has turned “ Neda ” into an international symbol of the protest movement that erupted after the June 12 balloting .
Images of her final moments have spread virally on social networks , been beamed across the world on cable and held aloft on placards on the streets of Tehran .
‘ A beam of light ’
To those who knew and loved Agha - Soltan , she was far more than an icon .
She was a daughter , sister and friend , a music and travel lover , a beautiful young woman in the prime of her life .
“ She was a person full of joy , ” said her music teacher and close friend Hamid Panahi , who was among the mourners at her family home Sunday , awaiting word about her burial .
“ She was a beam of light .
I ’m so sorry .
I was so hopeful for this woman . ”
Security forces urged her friends and family not to hold memorial services for her at a mosque and asked them not to speak publicly about her , associates of the family said .
Authorities even asked the family to take down the black mourning banners in front of their house , aware of the potent symbol she had become .
But some insisted on speaking out anyway , hoping to make sure the world would not forget her .
Neda Agha -Soltan was born in Tehran , they said , to a father who worked for the government and a homemaker mother .
They were a family of modest means , part of the country ’s emerging middle class who built their lives in rapidly developing neighborhoods on the eastern and western outskirts of the city .
Like many in her neighborhood , Agha -Soltan was loyal to the country ’s Islamic roots and traditional values , friends say , but also curious about the outside world , which was easily accessed through satellite TV , the Internet and occasional trips abroad .
The second of three children , she studied Islamic philosophy at a branch of Tehran ’s Azad University until deciding to pursue a career in tourism .
She took private classes to become a tour guide , including Turkish - language courses , friends said , hoping to someday lead groups of Iranians on trips abroad .
Travel was her passion , and with her friends she saved up enough money for package tours to Dubai , Turkey and Thailand .
Two months ago , on a trip to Turkey , she relaxed along the beaches of Antalya , on the Mediterranean coast .
She also loved music , especially Persian pop , and was taking piano lessons , according to Panahi and other friends .
She was also an accomplished singer , they said .
But she was never an activist , they added , and she began attending the mass protests only because she was outraged by the election results .
‘ Neda , do n’t go ’
Her parents and others told her it would be dangerous to go to Saturday ’s march , said Golshad .
On Friday , Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , had warned in his weekly sermon that demonstrators would be responsible for any violence that broke out .
Even Golshad stayed away .
At 3:30 p.m. , the two friends spoke .
“ I told her , ‘ Neda , do n’t go , ’ ” she recalled , heaving with sobs .
But Agha -Soltan was as stubborn as she was honest , Golshad said .
“ She said , ‘ Do n’t worry .
It ’s just one bullet and its over . ’ ”
Her friends say she , Panahi and two others were stuck in traffic on Karegar Street , east of Tehran ’s Azadi ( Freedom ) Square , on their way to the demonstration sometime after 6:30 p.m .
After they stepped out of the car to get some fresh air and crane their necks over the jumble of cars , Panahi heard a crack from the distance .
In the blink of an eye , he realized Agha - Soltan had collapsed to the ground .
“ We were stuck in traffic and we got out and stood to watch , and without her throwing a rock or anything they shot her , ” he said .
“ It was just one bullet . ”
Blood poured from the right side of her chest and began bubbling out of her mouth and nose as her lungs filled up .
“ I ’m burning , I ’m burning ! ” Panahi recalled her saying , her final words .
Those nearby gathered around .
A doctor tried to help , Panahi said , telling him to put his palm over the wound and apply pressure .
A driver coming from the other direction urged the crowd to put her into his car .
A frantic search for a hospital followed .
They took a wrong turn down a dead end and switched her limp body to another car .
Along the way , protesters and others screamed at drivers to clear a path in the snarled traffic .
The medical staff of Shariati Hospital made a heroic effort to rush her into surgery , but it was too late .
She was dead by the time she arrived at the emergency room , Panahi said .
“ This is a crime that ’s not in support of the government , ” he said .
“ This is a crime against humanity . ”
Iranian authorities have strenuously denied that police were using lethal force to quell the protest .
During tours of the riot scene before , during and after the worst of the melee , there were no signs of security officials using guns .
Investigation begun
The prosecutor general ’s office has launched an investigation into the killing of “ several people ” Saturday and arrested one “ armed terrorist , ” the website of Iran ’s Press TV said .
At least 13 people were killed in Saturday ’s rioting .
“ Policemen are not authorized to use weapons against people , ” said Tehran Police Chief Azizollah Rajabzadeh , according to Press TV .
“ They are trained to only use anti-riot tools to keep the people out of harm ’s way . ”
The government has suggested that loyalists to the exiled , outlawed opposition group Mujahedin Khalq may bear responsibility for the killings .
But family members and friends suspect that zealous pro-government paramilitaries , the Basiji or Ansar-e Hezbollah , might have been responsible .
Panahi said witnesses at the scene said the shooter was not a police officer but among a group of plainclothes security officials or militiamen lurking in the area .
On Sunday at the Agha - Soltan residence , friends and relatives came in droves , weeping and bent over , clutching one another .
A steady murmur of sobs and wails emanated from the apartment .
Mascara stained the cheeks of the women , some in sweeping black chadors and others in shapely designer mini-coats and sunglasses .
The men ’s eyes looked sore and bloodshot .
Two helped a distraught young man walk along the hallway , one of Agha - Soltan ’s two brothers , someone said .
“ She died full of love , ” Golshad said .
The relatives and friends piled into minivans for the hourlong trek to Tehran ’s Behesht Zahra cemetery , where she was buried .
Her loved ones were outraged by the authorities ’ order not to eulogize her , to loudly sing her praises and mourn her loss .
But they were too afraid and distraught to speak out , except for Panahi , who said he had nothing more to lose .
“ They know me , ” he said .
“ They know where I am .
They can come and get me whenever they want .
My time has gone .
We have to think about the young people . ”
Neda , he said , was smart and loving .
She had a mischievous streak , gently teasing her friends and causing them to laugh .
She was passionate about life and meant no one any harm .
In the election unrest , friends found in her an unexpected daring , a willingness to take risks for her beliefs .
“ She could n’t stand the injustice of it all , ” Panahi said .
“ All she wanted was the proper vote of the people to be counted .
“ For pursuing her goals , she did n’t use rocks or clubs , ” he said .
“ She wanted to show with her presence that ‘ I ’m here .
I also voted .
And my vote was n’t counted . ’
It was a very peaceful act of protest , without any violence . ”
As to the person or persons responsible for her death , they will not be forgiven , he said .
“ When they kill an innocent child , this is not justice .
This is not religion .
In no way is this acceptable , ” he said .
“ And I ’m certain that the one who shot her will not get a pass from God . ”

Check this crazy video out , it 's a chick fight where the goal is to rip the other girl 's bra off .
( CNN ) -- Rescuers on Tuesday spotted the wreckage of a Yemeni jet that crashed in the Indian Ocean off the island nation of Comoros , the country 's Vice President Idi Nadhoim said .
Relatives of passengers of the plane that crashed arrive at Marseille airport in southern France .
The plane , carrying more than 150 people , was en route to Moroni , the capital of Comoros , from Yemen 's capital , Sanaa .
A reconnaissance plane spotted traces of the jet in waters off the town of Mitsamiouli , Nadhoim said .
" There were no sign of survivors , " he said .
" There are a few bodies floating and there is a lot of debris floating around . "
The crash occurred as the plane approached the Hahaya airport in Moroni .
The plane tried to land , but could n't , and then U - turned before it crashed , Nadhoim said .
Officials did not know why the plane could not land , he said .
There were 142 passengers and 11 crew members aboard , Yemenia Air officials said .
Nadhoim offered another figure , saying there were 147 passengers .
Flight 626 left Sanaa at 9:30 p.m. ( 2:30 p.m. ET ) for what was expected to be a four - and - a - half - hour flight .
The airline has three regular flights a week to Moroni , off the east coast of Africa , about 2,900 km ( 1,800 miles ) south of Yemen .
The crash occurred about 1:30 a.m. , Nadhoim said .
Most of the passengers aboard the Airbus A310 were Comoran , an official at Sanaa 's international airport told CNN .
An official at Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris said there were 66 French passengers aboard .
There was no indication of foul play behind the crash , the official in Yemen said .
The crash was the second involving an Airbus jet in a month .
On June 1 , an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris , France .
All 228 aboard are presumed dead .
The cause remains under investigation .

The Indian government plans to give all of its 1.2 billion citizens biometric ID cards , and Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani will lead the project .
The project team will face a huge challenge in securing the information stored , which will be a target for hackers .
But unlike the UK , the general population are likely to accept the cards .
The project is going to cost an estimated £ 3 bn .
The UK ID cards scheme was expected to cost £ 5.3bn and the UK government has now abandoned its plan to make ID cards compulsory .
There was lot of opposition to the scheme in the UK .
Nandan Nilekani , who left Infosys to lead the project , has described it as a " humongous , mind - boggling challenge " , according to The Telegraph .
Infosys said it accepts Nilekani 's decision to leave with " a sense of duty to a larger cause , but with deep sadness " .
The ID scheme is an attempt to fight corruption and could identify illegal immigrants and tackle terrorism .
Each card will contain personal data and proof of identity , such as fingerprint or iris scans .
It will be linked to a central database .
Kris Lakshmikanth , managing director at Indian recruitment firm Headhunters , said it will take a decade to do this .
He doubts the project will get the same level of opposition as the UK scheme because the general population are not aware of the privacy risks .
But he is concerned about the security .
" I am sure hackers will hack into the database , " he said .
Pradipta Bagchi , head of communications at Indian IT supplier TCS , said the biggest challenge will not be IT but getting all the states and government departments involved to agree .
He said it is an ambitious IT project .

Presentations are an important ( and often free ) way of sharing your ideas and thoughts with others .
But whether or not they are effective rests with the presenter .
With the rise of small online start - ups , developers are taking an increasingly active role in presenting .
However , sometimes the personality traits that can make someone a good developer can make them a bad presenter .
So in an effort to help programmers everywhere share their ideas and expertise more effectively , I offer 7 Must Know Presentation Tips for Developers .
1. Know Your Audience .
If you are in front of a group talking about a particular subject , then you probably know your stuff .
Whether the topic is a new website or company your launching , an application you are demoing , or the finer points of your particular programming language , you most likely know more than your audience ( otherwise , why would you be up there in the first place ? )
Not to overgeneralize , but I have known many programmers who become frustrated or annoyed by what they view as dumbing things down to an audience .
This type of outlook only ensures both you and your audience will be unhappy with your presentation .
Take some time to think about who is in your audience , and adjust your material accordingly .
If you are speaking to a group of like - minded developers , then you can probably get away with using a certain amount of jargon and not having to explain certain concepts in detail .
But if you are in front of , say , an investor , or a marketing group , make sure they will understand what you are trying to get across .
Â
Often times programmers end up breezing over subjects their audience might not understand , or use terms everyone may not be familiar with .
When someone does n’t grasp something you said , you have a risk of them shutting down and not paying attention to the rest of what you have to say .
2. Focus on Flow .
In any good presentation , flow can not be underrated .
Flow is the natural rhythm of your presentation , and is made of up several elements .
The overall structure of your presentation plays a big part , as does your actual speech pattern and delivery .
Proper flow helps people stay engaged , and helps them consume the information you are sharing .
It also reduces the possibility of awkward moments .
When there are big pauses or disruptions during a presentation , it makes the audience feel uncomfortable .
Be wary of interrupting your flow .
Keep things rolling smoothly and your audience will stay with you for the ride .
3 . Have at least three WOW ! moments .
There is always an element of showmanship in any good presentation .
Adding WOW !
moments is a great way to get , and keep , your audience engaged .
When structuring your presentation , do n’t feel the need to tell the story in chronological order .
Feel free to open with something strong , then take a “ now let ’s show you how we did that ” approach .
For example , as Microsoft is out there presenting Project Natal , it does n’t make sense to start by talking about the problem they want to solve , or to dive into the details of infrared tracking .
They should start with the WOW !
moment of seeing Natal in action , then loop back around to the specifics .
In a relatively short presentation , focus on adding three of these moments .
Place the first right at the beginning , to draw people in .
Then add another in the middle , as people ’s attention starts to drift away .
Then , like a good Vegas lounge singer , one big WOW !
right at the end to close on a high note ( “ You ’ve been a great crowd .
Be sure to tip your waitress . ” )
Product demos lend themselves well to this format .
Find the three most remarkable features in your product and sprinkle them throughout your presentation .
Your audience will be left clamoring for more .
4. Assume everything will go wrong .
This is where a lot of presentations fall apart .
Always assume everything will go wrong .
For starters , NEVER DO A LIVE DEMO .
It ’s just asking for trouble .
Present from a local version of your product if you need to , but trying to present the live version is a recipe for disaster .
You are making assumptions based on things outside of your control , such as the quality of the network connection from your presentation site .
Always assume the network wo n’t work , or the wi- fi will be down .
If you have seen a few product demos , you probably know you should also bring a series of screenshots of your product on a USB drive , just in case everything blows up .
5 . Never write code live .
Actually writing code in front of your audience will just bore them to tears .
If the code itself is the actual topic of the presentation , than have a bunch of examples already written in advance , and organized in a way that makes it easy to jump to each one .
You would be surprised how hard it is to type in front of an audience .
Subjecting them to the chore of watching you type out code is just plain mean .
And you run the risk of making stupid mistakes , like getting an error from some minor typo .
Making a simple mistake in front of a large group has the potential to damage your credibility as an expert .
There is a saying that a good lawyer never asks a question he does n’t already know the answer to .
Well , a good programmer should never present a piece of code that he has n’t already tested .
6 . If something goes wrong , move on .
Keeping a proper flow can be difficult during a product demo .
When something ( inevitably ) goes wrong , a programmer ’s instinct can be to fix it right away , especially when they feel it “ should n’t be doing that . ”
But leaving your audience hanging while you troubleshoot an issue is presentation suicide .
It ’s best to just move past it and keep going .
Everyone who has presented to a group of people knows that there are always hiccups .
They wo n’t judge you based on the hiccup , they ’ll judge you based on how you handle it .
7 . Save questions for the end .
A presenter who is aware of the first tip , Know Your Audience , will want to make sure their audience understands the subject matter .
But often times , they try and do this by asking the audience throughout the presentation if there are any questions , which at best interrupts you , and at worst , leads to drifting , unrelated tangents .
It ’s best to announce in the beginning of your presentation that you will be taking questions at the end , then sticking to that .
It reminds the audience to hold on to questions until the end and will make sure your presentation stays on track .
Do n’t forget about the importance of flow .
Programmers tend to be extremely intelligent people , and have a lot to share with the rest of us .
A killer presentation is one of the best ways to share those smarts with others .
So make sure you do your best to follow these tips , and wow the crowd .
Now go out there and knock ’em dead !
... I do n't know what to make of this clip of Texas Congresscritter Joe Barton ( who once said that taking action against global warming is " absolute nonsense " ) asking Secretary of Energy ( and Nobel Laureate ) Steven Chu about the origin of gas and oil in Alaska .
Is he denying global warming ?
Is he denying continental drift ?
Is he denying the multi-billion - year age of the age of the Earth ?
Is he denying all of them ?
One thing he 's certainly denying : his own credibility .
Wow .
This guy is in the House of Representatives of the United States of America .
Wow .
Josh Rosenau has some more about Chu , too .
I think I like this guy .
Barton ?
Not so much .
Hmmm , have n't used this one in a while , but it sure fits here :

A Dusty Iris Nebula
Credit & Copyright : Alvin Jeng ( LightBuckets.com )
Explanation :
These clouds of interstellar dust and gas have blossomed 1,300 light - years away in the fertile star fields of the constellation Cepheus .
Sometimes called the Iris Nebula and dutifully cataloged as NGC 7023 , this is not the only nebula in the sky to evoke the imagery of flowers .
Surrounding it , obscuring clouds of dust and cold molecular gas are also present and can suggest other convoluted and fantastic shapes .
Within the Iris , dusty nebular material surrounds a hot , young star .
The dominant color of the brighter reflection nebula is blue , characteristic of dust grains reflecting starlight .
Central filaments of the cosmic dust glow with a faint reddish photoluminesence as some dust grains effectively convert the star 's invisible ultraviolet radiation to visible red light .
Infrared observations indicate that this nebula may contain complex carbon molecules known as PAHs .
At the estimated distance of the Iris Nebula this remarkable wide field view is over 30 light - years across .

( CNN ) --
A friend of mine had a houseguest recently who , while sipping a cup of tea at her kitchen table late at night , broke out into nasty - looking hives all over his back .
A quick inspection found that a tick had burrowed its way into his skin .
After removing it with a pair of tweezers , she whisked him to the emergency room .
Can name - dropping get you seen faster in a crowded emergency room ?
" I was really worried , " she told me .
" Ticks can cause allergic reactions .
I wanted him to be seen by a doctor immediately . "
But when they arrived at the ER , they were told there would be a three - hour wait .
Thinking fast , my friend remembered reading the name of the hospital 's president ; we 'll call him John Smith .
" I lightheartedly said , ' I wonder what would happen if I called John Smith and woke him up ?
Would that get him seen any faster ? ' "
Her houseguest was seen by a doctor immediately .
Was my friend being really smart -- or really obnoxious ?
Both , said the emergency room doctors I talked to .
As waits continue to grow longer in the emergency room , patients need to think about what to do if they feel that they 're not getting the attention they need in an already overtaxed ER .
Watch more on getting into the ER faster »
According to a report out this week , the average total waiting time in a U.S. emergency room in 2008 was four hours and three minutes , a 27 - minute increase in nationwide average wait times since 2002 .
The report by Press Ganey Associates analyzed the experiences of nearly 1.4 million patients treated at more than 1,700 emergency departments nationwide .
The recession is one chief reason for the increase , according to the American College of Emergency Physicians .
In a survey in January of more than 1,700 emergency doctors , 66 percent said they 'd seen an increase in the number of patients in their emergency rooms over the preceding six months .
Most of the physicians -- 83 percent -- reported seeing patients who'd lost their jobs and health insurance and delayed medical care .
" Some of these people come to the ER because they 've been turned away by their primary care physician , because they 've lost their insurance , " said Dr. Angela Gardner , incoming president of the physicians group .
" Sometimes they 've delayed care because they have no insurance and end up with a much more serious condition . "
Gardner , who works in the ER at Parkland Hospital in Dallas , Texas , said these newly uninsured people are taxing an overburdened system .
" We 're overwhelmed and swamped , " she said .
Given this situation , I asked four ER doctors what they would do if their spouse had a life - threatening emergency and they felt as if they were n't getting the attention they needed in the emergency room .
Although they all pointed out that emergency rooms do an excellent job of triaging patients , and you might have to wait while others who are sicker than you get seen by the doctor , there are some steps you can take if you truly fear that you or your loved one is not getting the care you need .
Dr. Assaad Sayah , chief of emergency medicine , Cambridge Health Alliance , Massachusetts
" I would start by saying to the triage nurse , ' I know that you are busy , and I need one minute of your time .
My wife has been waiting for a long time , and her condition has gotten worse since we arrived . '
Describe her worsening condition and say , ' I would really appreciate it if you could take a minute and look at her again . '
" This would work most of the time .
If I got a hostile answer , I would ask to speak with the charge nurse or charge physician .
If I felt like I was not getting anywhere , I would ask to speak with the administrator on call .
The last resort is to call the hospital operator ( dial 0 from the emergency department waiting room phone ) and ask to page the patient advocate and hospital administrator .
... I would not use inappropriate or threatening language . "
Dr. Jesse Pines , assistant professor of emergency medicine , Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania
" You could say , ' She 's not acting right .
This is not normal for her . ' ...
As your friend did , you can always try to drop a big name , like say you 're friends with the president of the hospital .
In general , if they think you 're a VIP ( even if you 're not ) , you 'll definitely get seen more quickly .
...
Obnoxious real VIPs get the fastest service , while obnoxious wannabe VIP liars get the slowest service .
" A basic principle of medical care is that ' the squeaky wheel gets the grease . '
I would recommend advocating on behalf of your spouse .
It 's uncomfortable that it has to be this way , but it works the same in any service business .
The more you complain , the faster the service .
But it 's a fine line .
Complaining can piss off the staff , so it 's important not to go over the top .
Family members who are too vocal are sometimes escorted out by security . "
Dr. Joseph Guarisco , chief of emergency services at Ochsner Health System , Louisiana
" I would ask to speak with the Emergency Department director .
If they were n't there , I would ask to speak with the charge nurse or shift supervisor .
... I would advise them that you think the patient has an 'emergency medical condition that should be evaluated right away . '
Most of us in emergency medicine define the urgency in those terms and should be responsive .
" If you do n't get a response , advise the individual in charge dispassionately and without confrontation , ' I understand you are busy , but I feel the patient will have a bad outcome if not seen right away . '
If the person in charge was a nurse , ask to speak with the physician and repeat the same thing .
If there 's no response , further advise the individual in charge , ' I feel strongly about this and must call the administrator on call . '
If no response , I would call the hospital administrator on call and advise him or her of those same concerns .
And yes , name - dropping the administrator 's name always helps .
It should not .
But if you truly feel the patient may suffer harm by not being seen right away , do it . "
Health Library MayoClinic.com : 10 symptoms not to ignore
Dr. David Beiser , assistant professor of medicine , University of Chicago
" If you are concerned that a family member or friend is getting sicker while awaiting treatment in the Emergency Department , it 's always reasonable to request that the triage nurse do a quick re-assessment of the patient .
As far as invoking the threat of a letter to the CEO , that can trigger the ' VIP Care ' response , which may save time , but also may expose the patient to increased risk by changing practice patterns .
VIP treatment subverts the normal way we practice medicine and in my experience usually leads to medical errors .
I have made my worst mistakes while treating friends , colleagues , and other VIPs .
...
Belligerence , histrionics or requests for VIP treatment usually end up working against the doctor - patient relationship . "
In case you were wondering , my friend 's houseguest was indeed having an allergic reaction to a tick .
He received an antihistamine and antibiotics to prevent infection and is fine and very happy with the care he received in the emergency room .
Will Ferrell 's Highs and Lows , best and worst Will Ferrell movies , Will Ferrell roles
Movies Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
Will Ferrell never has been one to show much concern for his questionable script selection .
He pretty much does whatever he wants – from streaking in his tighty whites to wrestling bears ( twice ) – and gets away with it .
Since breaking in to the business in 1998 with the " SNL " sketch - turned - feature film " Night at the Roxbury , " Ferrell has been all about quantity over quality .
Over the course of the last decade , the actor has appeared in no less than 25 different projects , and for every career highlight like " Anchorman , " there 's been a box office flop like " Bewitched " to balance it out .
Surprisingly , Ferrell 's been able to escape such disasters virtually unscathed , but just because Hollywood is willing to forgive him does n't mean we are as well .
In honor of his latest film , the basketball comedy " Semi - Pro , " we decided to revisit the actor 's best and worst cinematic performances of his career .
And to show that we do n't hold a grudge , we gave him a free pass on " Superstar " and " Boat Trip . "
THE HIGHS
1. Anchorman : The Legend of Ron Burgundy ( 2004 )
For those who contend that Ferrell is a one - trick pony , you need n’t look any further than “ Anchorman ” to realize just how wrong you are .
For starters , the concept of the movie is so ridiculous that it ’s impossible not to laugh at , and Ferrell ’s performance as sexist 1970s newscaster Ron Burgundy is a major reason why .
As San Diego ’s top-rated newsman , Ferrell does n’t just rely on his moustache and burgundy suits to score laughs ; he also plays the jazz flute , sings “ Afternoon Delight ” with his closest buds , and even has a dog who ’s literally his best friend .
And to top it all off , he is n’t afraid to get into a “ West Side Story ” gang fight between the other news stations in town .
There ’s just one ground rule : “ No touching of the hair or face … AND THAT ’S IT ! ”
Of course , without Ferrell to orchestrate the madness , it never would have worked .
" Anchorman " is the least accessible movie he ’s ever made , but Ferrell is so good at what he does that it gets better with every repeat viewing .

2. Elf ( 2003 )
Hard to believe that this sweet , sentimental Christmas film came out the same year as “ Old School , ” is n’t it ?
Some would say that this was truly the flick that made Ferrell into a superstar ; he could ’ve continued to do vaguely lowbrow comedies ‘ til the cows came home , but this was the first time it became evident that he actually had mainstream crossover appeal .
Ferrell plays Buddy the Elf ( “ What ’s your favorite color ? ” ) , an ordinary human who , as a baby , snuck out of an orphanage by way of Santa ’s bag of toys and found himself at the North Pole … but , y’know , when you ’re raised by elves , it ’s easy to consider yourself one of the gang .
Ferrell portrays Buddy as the very definition of a man-child , a little boy in an adult ’s body who lives the Christmas spirit every day of the year .
When he meets his dad ( James Caan ) , who ’s on Santa ’s Naughty List , Buddy sets out to earn his love .
It seems like a fool ’s errand , given what a grump his dad is , but not only does he succeed on that front , he also manages to hook up with a girl who looks like Zooey Deschanel .
Behold the power of naïveté .
God bless us , everyone !

3. Wedding Crashers ( 2005 )
Ironically enough , Ferrell did n’t even get a screen credit for one of his funniest roles — lecherous innovator Chazz Reinhold , the Thomas Alva Edison of crashing weddings for the purpose of obtaining meaningless sex .
Having transitioned from invading weddings to funerals ( “ Grief is nature ’s most powerful aphrodisiac ! ” ) , Chazz terrifies visiting disciple Owen Wilson , embodying the dark side of the over - aged frat - boy characters that made Will Ferrell famous .
Living with his crabby mother , screaming infantile demands for food ( “ Ma ! The meatloaf ! " ) , and randomly moving from one inappropriate emotion to another , Ferrell ’s Chazz is the ultimate emotional bottom - feeder .
He ’s repellent and pathetic , or he would be if he was n’t so completely comfortable in his insanity and inexplicably successful at satisfying beautiful women .
The funeral crasher might be a study in denial , but we ’re also fairly certain that this is the best he can do .
Chazz Reinhold might only be an extended cameo , but he might also be the ultimate Will Ferrell caricature .

4. Stranger Than Fiction ( 2006 )
This terrific , low - key fantasy comedy gives us Ferrell as Harold Crick , a shy , goodhearted IRS auditor who learns that the disembodied British voice he keeps hearing belongs to famed novelist Emma Thompson — and that she is literally plotting his death .
For once not playing an unbelievably overconfident buffoon in an anything - goes farce , Ferrell shows that he is , after all , an actor .
At every turn , he plays the reality of the bizarre situation as his character slowly wakes from his emotional torpor , and eventually contemplates willingly sacrificing his life for the sake of a really good book .
He does n’t seem to want sympathy , but he gets it anyway .
When Crick practices his guitar playing , performing Wreckless Eric ’s early punk - pop classic “ The Whole Wide World , ” he ’s barely aware that true - love Maggie Gyllenhaal is listening — his eyes are closed and Ferrell barely moves — but something is clearly happening .

5. Old School ( 2003 )
Frank Ricard ( Ferrell ) is a nice guy .
Once upon a time , he was so much of a party animal that he actually warranted his own nickname : Frank the Tank .
Nowadays , he ’s newly married , and his idea of excitement is to crank up the Whitesnake and give his old car a tune - up , even though he ’ll probably never get to take it out on the road again .
That all changes , however , when Frank attends a housewarming bash for his buddy Mitch ( Luke Wilson ) and makes the mistake of doing just one beer bong .
Beer bongs are like potato chips ; you ca n’t do just one .
Fast - forward a few hours , and Frank ’s running naked through the streets of town , which causes a few marital problems when his wife and her friends drive past him while he ’s in mid-streak .
Ferrell ’s performance in the film starts off surprisingly subtle – as a guy who desperately wants to embrace his new marriage – but even after the sweet , hop - laden nectar glides down the bong and across his lips , causing him to slip back into his old ways , he still manages to imbue the role with a certain amount of sweetness .
Frank the Tank might be a drinking machine , but no matter how drunk he gets , his heart always comes shining through …well , unless you ’re a pledge .
In that case , you ’re screwed .
– WH
THE LOWS
1. Bewitched ( 2005 )
Ferrell ’s decision to take part in this 2005 update of the '60s TV classic was clearly one of desperation .
After both “ Old School ” and “ Elf ” scored big at the box office , Ferrell ’s star was rising fast and he needed a big - budget project to secure a spot amongst the A - list elite .
Imagine his haste , then , when he was offered a role ( no matter how wrong it was for him ) in a summer tentpole movie alongside Nicole Kidman .
Granted , he probably should have read the script before signing on , but Ferrell ’s never been one to say no ( see : “ Boat Trip ” ) , and it was a disaster just waiting to happen .
Neutered to the point where you could n’t help but feel bad for the guy , Ferrell ’s performance falls somewhere between Jim Carrey ( on a bad day ) and Dane Cook ( on a good day ) .
“ Bewitched ” certainly was n’t the finest moment in his career , but if nothing else , it was a lesson well learned .

2. Talladega Nights : The Ballad of Ricky Bobby ( 2006 )
When comedians and actors praise each other , one word you ’ll often hear is “ generous , ” meaning that a star performer is wise enough not to try and hog every scene .
Actors , the theory goes , get better results when they ’re working with other first - rate performers who challenge them and bring out their best .
That ’s how it ’s supposed to work , but sometimes “ supposed to ” is n’t good enough .
In this funny but disjointed mock biopic , Ferrell and co-writer - director Adam McKay surround lame - brained NASCAR legend Ricky Bobby with hordes of even zanier characters played by some of the world ’s best comic character actors , including John C. Reilly , Sacha Baron Cohen , Amy Ryan and Gary Cole ( “ Office Space ” ) .
The cast gets some very big laughs , but when it ’s Ferrell ’s turn to be funny , the funny mostly does n’t arrive .
Why ?
Well , it might be because there ’s not much more than a Southern accented , quick - to - get naked void where Ricky Bobby should be .
– BW
3. The Producers ( 2005 )
It ’s a little unfair to compare performances between an original and a later version , but who said comedy was fair ?
First , we looked at Ferrell ’s introductory scene in 2005 's " The Producers " as Franz Leibkind , the manic Nazi playwright of “ Springtime for Hitler . ”
As he persuades conniving producers Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane to join him in the Aryan dance hit , “ Der Guten Tag Hop - Clop , ” we smiled and tapped our toes a bit —
Will ’s surprisingly comfortable with musical comedy — but the mechanical pigeons in the scene generate more laughs than he does .
Then we watched comic character actor Kenneth Mars ’ performance ( including some very similar dialogue ) from the 1968 non-musical .
Mars ’ Franz Leibkind is no mere fascist fool , he ’s a fireball of venomous fear and Hitlerian hatred ; Ferrell ’s Leibkind is a relatively unfunny pussycat .
To be fair , Ferell does nail the syrupy ballad version of “ Hop Clop ” under the end credits , wrapping up with a whispered “ " Do n't forget to purchase Mein Kampf in paperback .
You can find it at Borders ... und Amazon.com . ” – BW
4. Melinda and Melinda ( 2004 )
The only person who can play Woody Allen is Woody Allen himself .
It ’s an unfortunate truth , and one of several reasons Ferrell ’s first semi-serious role can be chalked up as a disappointment .
Ferrell ’s work in “ Melinda and Melinda ” – in which he plays an out - of - work actor who falls head - over - heels for the title character in one of two alternate storylines – is n’t completely horrible , but it pales in comparison to what the real Allen could have done in the role .
Sure , it was encouraging to see the usually over - the - top comedian tackle a more nuanced character , but he just ended up looking like an amateur stuck in an already boring movie .
Despite his middling performance , however , Ferrell is one of few actors today who actually has what it takes to embody such an oddball persona , and he proved it only two years later as the paranoid protagonist of “ Stranger Than Fiction ” ( see above ) .

5. Kicking & Screaming ( 2005 )
Scholars of Will Ferrell will look back on 2005 as The Lost Year , where he threw all caution to the wind and seemingly made every movie he was offered .
That is the only real explanation for “ Kicking & Screaming , ” a bumbling comedy about a softie dad ( Ferrell ) who tries to show up his ruthless , overly aggressive father ( Robert Duvall ) for trading his own grandson off his soccer team .
The premise has potential , to be sure , but Ferrell confuses good acting with overacting , to the point where Mike Ditka (! ) becomes the model of subtlety .
It is curious to note that , following this and his voice work in “ Curious George , ” Ferrell realized that “ Elf ” was not a career path but a fluke and abandoned the kiddie market entirely .
It is not a coincidence that his career has taken off as a result .

A secret report by Army bosses to be presented to the Iraq war inquiry blames Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for the botched occupation of the country .
The dossier - prepared for ex-military chief General Sir Mike Jackson - criticises then Chancellor Mr Brown for withholding funds to rebuild Basra for FIVE months after our troops went in .
And the 100 - page document attacks Mr Blair for " uncritically " accepting flawed US plans for the March 2003 invasion , which led to tens of thousands of deaths , including those of 179 British troops .
The report - Stability Operations in Iraq - will not be officially made public because the inquiry 's head , Sir John Chilcot , ruled all documents will remain secret .
But the contents have been leaked to the Sunday Mirror .
We can reveal that a lack of cash for the operation meant British troops sent to fight in Iraq :
Used mobile phones to communicate in combat because radios did not work .
Were forced to leave wounded soldiers on the battlefield for an average of two - and - half hours before getting them to a field hospital .
Needed more " spy in the sky " aircraft to track rebel fighters .
Lacked machine guns , night - vision equipment and grenade launchers when protecting supply convoys .
Were in danger of breaching the Geneva Convention by having so few resources .
The convention says occupiers must provide vital services such as humanitarian aid and water .
In a broadside at the then PM Mr Blair , the report says the battle for the hearts and minds of ordinary Iraqis was lost because of a lack of planning and the five - month delay in starting to rebuild their country .
It says : " The failures to plan ... seriously hindered Coalition chances of stabilising post - Saddam Iraq .
The lack of improvements to essential services and the standard of living together with disorder meant many locals who were ' sitting on the fence ' were not persuaded to support the Coalition . "
It was only after riots in Basra in August 2003 that Mr Brown agreed to release £ 500 million for reconstruction work , the report says .
And it contradicts six years of Government spin which claimed ordinary Iraqis backed the " liberation " , saying troops " found themselves fighting insurgents without clear support ( from local people ) " .
MOST DAMNING CONCLUSIONS :
Flawed US plans were rubberstamped by Blair
Brown blocked vital funding for five months
It took mass rioting in Basra to make him pay up
Chaos lost us the battle for Iraqi hearts & minds
Yishay sez , " The road to hell is paved with the best intentions ( including mine ) .
Learn how to actually help the protesters and not the gov't in Iran . "
The purpose of this guide is to help you participate constructively in the Iranian election protests through Twitter .
1 . Do NOT publicise proxy IP 's over twitter , and especially not using the #iranelection hashtag .
Security forces are monitoring this hashtag , and the moment they identify a proxy IP they will block it in Iran .
If you are creating new proxies for the Iranian bloggers , DM them to @stopAhmadi or @iran09 and they will distributed them discretely to bloggers in Iran .
2. Hashtags , the only two legitimate hashtags being used by bloggers in Iran are #iranelection and # gr88 , other hashtag ideas run the risk of diluting the conversation .
3 . Keep you bull $ hit filter up !

Informing men that a new vaccine to prevent human papillomavirus ( HPV ) would also help protect their female partners against developing cervical cancer from the sexually transmitted infection did not increase their interest in getting the vaccine , according to a new Florida State University study .
Mary Gerend , assistant professor of medical humanities and social sciences at the FSU College of Medicine , and Jessica Barley , a 2008 Florida State psychology graduate who based her honors thesis on the study , found that men are no more likely to want the vaccination just because they can help protect their female sexual partners .
An HPV vaccine for women has been available since 2006 , and a vaccine for men is likely to be approved in the near future .
" You can probably interpret this finding in a number of ways , " Gerend said .
" Thinking about the benefit to their own health -- protection again rare genital cancers and genital warts -- is all men really need to know ; telling them all that extra stuff really is n't going to push them one way or another . "
For maximum benefit to public health , both men and women should be vaccinated but little was known about men's interest in the vaccine before Gerend 's study , which was published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases .
Gerend presented the findings recently at the annual meeting of the Society of Behavioral Medicine in Montreal .
HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , which estimates that approximately 20 million Americans are currently infected with HPV and that another 6.2 million people become newly infected each year .
HPV - related cancers are very rare in men , but last year the American Cancer Society estimated that nearly 20,000 women would be diagnosed with cervical and other cancers caused by HPV in 2008 .
Gerend 's research team randomly divided 356 male college students into groups and gave one group a self - protection message that focused on the benefits of HPV vaccination for men and the other a partner - protection message that focused on the benefits of HPV vaccination for men and their female partners .
Men were asked to rate , on a scale of 1 to 6 , the likelihood that they would get the vaccine , with 1 equalling " very unlikely " and 6 equalling " very likely . "
There was little difference between the groups , with both expressing only moderate interest in getting the vaccine .
Those who received the self - protection message had a mean response of 3.9 on the 6 - point scale , while the mean response from the group who got the partner - protection message was 3.8 .
Moreover , men who identified themselves as being in a committed relationship also did not indicate a higher degree of interest in the vaccination .
" Now , we have to remember that these were 18- , 19 - , 20 - year - old male college students , so we have to keep that in mind when considering their idea of a committed relationship , " Gerend said .
" And if we did this study again , I 'd really want to make sure we drilled home the message of the seriousness of HPV for women .
I think they got that message , but it might not have been strong enough . "
The key point in encouraging women to receive the vaccine is the message about how it reduces their risk of developing cervical cancer .
The results of Gerend 's study have important implications for how the vaccine for men will be marketed for public acceptance when it becomes available .
Efficacy trials in men are ongoing , and the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve it for use in men as early as this year .
In the meantime , Gerend is working on another study funded by the National Cancer Institute to gauge the best message for encouraging young women to receive the HPV vaccination .
The most recent estimates from the CDC , based on 2007 data , suggest that acceptance rates for the HPV vaccine remain low -- about 1 in 4 for girls ages 13 to 17 and about 1 in 10 for women in the 18 to 26 age group .
( Pocket - lint ) - A VPN , or Virtual Private Network , enables you to surf the web and browse anonymously by hiding your IP address ( your digital ID ) and data traffic to external snoopers .
Many people use a VPN to trick some streaming services into believing they are in a different country , or to hide what they are doing , making many believe that they might be illegal , but while that might sound nefarious it is perfectly legitimate .
A VPN works by utilising a set of servers often sited in various different countries and run by a specific VPN company .
Connecting to a VPN establishes an encrypted " tunnel " into the server , and then any connections out to the big wide world are routed through these servers .
By doing this , the end user 's identity - that 's you - is masked and you can then surf with relative anonymity .
Businesses often utilise VPNs to allow staff to access confidential e-mail accounts and file servers with a high degree of security , usually in business - critical situations .
VPNs are n't just restricted to businesses though .
You can use a VPN on your phone , desktop or even smart TV to protect and hide yourself from the internet .
It 's this hiding , or lack of visibility , that has questioned some to ask if a VPN is illegal or not ?
The short answer is no .
But , if you proceed to use this anonymity for illegal purposes that 's a different matter .
If you break the law , you 're breaking the law whether you use a VPN or not .
One of the biggest grey areas about the legality of using a VPN is whether you are allowed to spoof services that are geographically sensitive , such as Netflix .
The US streaming service offers different programming options to different markets depending on the rights for certain TV shows .
It 's the same for accessing BBC iPlayer from outside of the UK .
Sky
Go too .
The reason is that most TV companies make a lot of money by selling broadcast rights to their shows to different territories and even different providers .
Star Trek Discovery in the US , for example , is on CBS , but outside of the US it 's available on Netflix .
Netflix reportedly paid over $ 7 m an episode for the privilege .
Using a VPN in the US , you could pretend that you are in another country , and therefore access the Netflix version of the show - thereby circumnavigating CBS ' advertising or payments .
CBS loses out and Netflix gains .
In most instances , you 'll find that the Ts & Cs you signed up to when you signed up to the service prohibit such access .
Yes , but it is still illegal .
Remember a VPN is just a secure way of surfing the internet .
However , while a VPN may cover your tracks and keep your activity hidden from your internet provider , torrenting copyrighted material while using a VPN does n’t make it legal .
You 'll be in trouble if you get caught .
While a VPN service will hide copyright infringement activities , it wo n’t protect users who are caught even after using a VPN service .
Many services will , however , maintain no -log policies and IP leak protection to help prevent situations where user identity might be compromised .
No .
Many VPNs do n't offer full " invisibility " on the web , and some do n't encrypt everything you do .
Find out our top 10 VPN providers that offer full " invisibility " and encryption .
Using a VPN itself is not illegal , but if you use it to try and hide illegal activity , it 's still your neck on the chopping block .

Norm Coleman can use campaign donations to pay for some -- but not all -- of the legal fees he 's amassing as a result of two lawsuits and an FBI investigation .
| REUTERS FEC : Donors can't pay all Coleman bills
Norm Coleman can use campaign donations to pay for some — but not all — of the legal fees he ’s amassing as a result of two lawsuits and an FBI investigation targeting one of his top donors .
That ’s the conclusion Federal Election Commission lawyers reached in a pair of draft advisory opinions that the full commission is slated to consider Thursday .
Advertisement
The draft opinions reflect slightly different interpretations of the law , and the full commission on Thursday is slated to determine which it prefers .
Either would be a mixed result for Coleman , a former Minnesota senator who has accumulated a mountain of legal bills since Election Day .
The bills stem from his lawsuit to overturn the results of his November loss to Democrat Al Franken ( a decision from the Minnesota Supreme Court is expected imminently ) and his monitoring of two lawsuits alleging that longtime confidant Nasser Kazeminy improperly steered cash to Coleman 's wife , in addition to an alleged FBI investigation into Kazeminy .
Coleman , who is not a party to the lawsuits and has denied any wrongdoing in his relationship with Kazeminy , has asked donors for contributions to pay lawyers to contest the election and has asked the commission for permission to use campaign cash to pay legal bills stemming from the Kazeminy matters , as well .
Federal election law only allows politicians to use campaign cash to pay legal bills related to their positions as officeholders or candidates .
And the FEC lawyers concluded that means Coleman ca n’t use donor cash to pay lawyers to represent him if the FBI inquiry delves into “ allegations not directly related to his campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder . ”
The Politico 44 Story Widget Requires Adobe Flash Player
The more restrictive of the two draft advisory opinions also bars him from using campaign cash to pay for legal bills related to the two Kazeminy suits .
Coleman ’s “ need for legal representation in the two lawsuits stems from his role as a potential witness .
Senator Coleman ’s obligation to serve as a witness would exist irrespective of his campaign or duties as a Federal officeholder , ” the lawyers wrote .
“ Accordingly , the use of campaign funds to pay legal fees and expenses for representing Senator Coleman in the ... lawsuits , including the preservation of documents , would be an impermissible personal use . ”
Nonetheless , he can use campaign cash to pay for 50 percent of the legal fees accrued from monitoring the two cases , the draft concludes .
The more permissive draft allows him to use campaign funds to represent him in the suits , while both allow him to use the money to respond to media inquiries about the lawsuits , the FBI investigation and related complaints with the Senate Ethics Committee .

Today , my mom's will was read to the rest of the family .
I helped my mom write it a couple years ago , and I was to get funds to pay off school loans .
She revised it and put in a note saying I was to get nothing because I was " lazy . "
The executor read it out loud .

The Utah Test & Training Range ( UTTR ) on Hill Air Force Base ( AFB ) is a Superfund site , meaning abandoned hazardous waste exists requiring federal authority to clean it up .
Â According to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , there are ten areas containing hazardous waste materials at Hill AFB .
Â
“ In addition , Hill AFB deposited heavy metals and various solutions at Landfill # 5 on the Utah Test and Training Range .
The Air Force is monitoring this area in accordance with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ( RCRA ) . ” Â The Air Force is doing more than monitoring this site ; they are using dummy bombs to clean up the mess .
Image by a4gpa
UTTR ’s mission is to :
Provide war fighters with a realistic training environment and conduct operational test and evaluation including tactical development and evaluation supporting large footprint weapon systems to enhance combat readiness , superiority , and sustainability .
All that “ realistic training ” has contaminated the groundwater at UTTR with the possible carcinogen trichloroethene ( TCE ) .
Â
According to Greener Design , the Air Force is testing ground up fake bombs made from lead to filter the polluted water .
Iron strips TCE from water , so the Air Force bought a machine to crush up its piles of dummy bombs into small granules ( right ) and use the iron as a water filter …
This is the first time dummy bombs have been enlisted to clean up the environment , and if the test is successful , the use of iron bombs will expand at the Utah site and could be used in other U.S. Department of Defense cleanup efforts .
The crushed up dummy bombs will fill 56 feet deep holes where there is the highest concentrations of TCE .
Â
Thirty four tons of crushed iron will be needed to fill all eight holes .
Â
After monitoring , the Air Force will decide if the project is economically feasible .
Â
It may be cheaper to buy lead rather than crush up old dummy bombs .

Back in February I 'd been walking home at night and decided to take the path that runs along the side of Merri Creek and noticed a massive storm water drain that was just begging to be explored .
You can see the entrance on Google maps here .
Now when you 're considering exploring a storm drain there 's obvious issues about safety .
You really need to weigh up the pros and cons of doing something like this and decide whether it 's actually worth it .
Instead of explaining these , I 've prepared some handy graphics : CONS : PROS : Clearly the pros VASTLY outweigh the cons so this was definitely A Good Thing To Do .
One night I was just in the mood to go exploring , so I grabbed my trusty torch and headed out .
I bought some fresh batteries at the service station across the road and I was on my way !
I left at about 12.30 am , figuring I 'd be back in time to get plenty of sleep before work the next day .
First I had to brave the Forest of Woes : Then I had to cross the Sporting Oval Of Terror , and then the Bridge of Doom : Finally I could approach the Hellmouth itself :
Now some people might be worried that I was in some danger exploring a storm drain on my own , but I was n't worried .
If it was dangerous I 'm sure they would have put a warning sign up or something .
Well , there was this :... but I could n't quite make out what it was saying so I ignored it .
: DThe drain itself was huge , at least 3 metres high .
It was heavily graffitied for about a hundred metres : A little way in I found a sleepy little bat hanging from the ceiling : Aw , what a cutie !
Every couple of hundred metres there 'd be an access hatch : Good to know in case a damn burst somewhere and there was a freak flashflood , or if the C.H.U.D.s attacked .
The drain continued on and on and on , with a few twists and turns that ensured I soon had no idea which direction I was travelling in .
After several kilometres the concrete drain ended and the red brickwork began :
There was some graffiti on the way at the changeover point and I got the impression that the Cave Clan werefans of the old redbrick drain .
I actually thought the redbricks looked much nicer than the drab concrete sewers , so I had no idea what the CC 's problem was .
LITTLE DID I KNOW !!
I trudged along the redbrick drain for another few kilometres .
This is where I expected Shelob to spring out and fang me .
Even the smaller offshoot pipes were more interesting in this part of the drain :
It was at this point I started to see white fungus - like growths coating the walls of the drain and started wishing I 'd brought a ventilator mask .
Eventually the diameter of the drain dropped off and I had to duck my head in order to keep going .
I took that photo with the camera 's automatic timer , and seconds after it'd taken the photo I slipped rather badly .
I did n't fall over but I did drop the torch , which fell into the water and went out .
Daaaaaamn .
I used the light from my mobile phone to find the torch , unscrewed the top and poured all the water out and flicked the switch .
Luckily it still worked .
Onwards !
( Note : it 's really a good idea to take at least one backup torch .
Preferably two : one LED long - life torch and one hand powered wind - up torch , just in case . )
I 'd been walking for several hours at this point and there had been no large cross tunnels or chambers or anything interesting , so when I found a large dry offshoot pipe I decided to crawl through it and see what I could find .
This shot shows you how small the pipe was :
That smaller pipe just lead to a junction with another long pipe leading off it , so I turned around and went back to the storm drain .
At this point the going was a lot trickier since there was often water seeping out of the walls and the bricks were pretty slippery .
There was also all sorts of pipes and things to navigate :
The drain got even smaller and I had to duck down quite a bit to avoid smacking my head on the ceiling .
Eventually I got to a point where the drain shrank even further and I could n't walk upright at all any more .
The only way forward would be to scrabble ahead on all fours , hunched over like the Striders in The Dark Crystal .
I reasoned that I 'd come way too far to turn back and the drain had to come outso on I went .
Every now and then I 'd start hearing voiced ahead , which was ... odd .
But then I 'd pass an access manhole and realise I was hearing people from Above .
It was still a little odd .
Every now and then a car would drive across one of those access manholes and there 'd be a deafening WHOOOMP echoing down the drain .
Eventually I realised it was getting close to 4 am , and I 'd lost track of time and stayed down there much longer than I 'd intended .
I kept convincing myself that there 'd be an outlet just around the next turn , and then just around the next turn , and then just around the next one ... but it just kept going and going .
I realised that the drain might go for 20 km or something like that and I had to accept that I 'd have to turn back soon .
I climbed up a few of the access manholes ( the ones that were n't full of redback spiders ) and try to lift the cover off but they were all much too heavy .
Finally it wasclose to 4 am and I decided to take a risk and crawl down one of the smaller offshoot pipes to see if it did n't lead me to some sort of exit .
This pipe was even smaller than the other one I 'd crawled down , and it ran for about 30 m before it reached a junction .
Once I got to the junction I saw that there was a concrete cover on it , so all I had to do was lift that and I could walk home in the open air .
Once again , it was much too heavy .
I crawled back along the pipe into the drain and had to face the fact that I 'd have to walk aaaaaaaaall the way back the way I 'd came .
Here 's a photo I took at that exact moment : I ama happy camper .
By this point I was pretty darned exhausted and I was also quite dehydrated .
Crawling back on all fours along that narrow section of the drain was really physically difficult and I had to stop for a break every few minutes .
It was n't until 4.45 am that I could walk just hunched over on two legs again , but it felt like it took MUCH longer to get back to that point .
At the start of the journey I 'd flinched every time a spiderweb brushed the top of my head , but I was way past caring at this point and just barreled through them all .
It was n't until 5.25 am that the drain opened up enough that I could walk fully upright again , and I celebrated by taking a leak .
Now I 'm really not one for public urination but I figured if you can't pee in a drain , where could you ?
Seconds later I smashed my head on the ceiling when I found out that this taller part of the drain was just a new section they 'd recently put in and I had to duck my head again after a few metres .
Eventually the drain opened up for real and I could walk fully upright and I was making pretty good time .
It was about 30 minutes into this that I had my first serious fall when I smashed my head on one of those overhead pipes I 'd seen earlier .
This time I did fall down , landing on my side in the water and soaking my camera and my mobile .
I somehow kept hold of the torch this time .
Apparently I was n't the only one who had smashed his head on that particular pipe :
Okay , now I was tired , filthy , thirsty and soaking wet , and I was still several hours away from the entrance .
The torch was also starting to grow dim and the splay - legged way I had to walk to avoid the slippery bricks in the centre of the drain was giving me blisters .
Once again I just hunkered down and trudged along , dreaming of getting out and getting to the 7 - 11 convenience store on the way to my house and buying something to drink .
Trudge , trudge , trudge , trudge .... Eventually I saw some familiar landmarks , and then I got back to the concrete pipe ( at which point I just walked through the water running down the centre of the pipe and got my boots soaked ) .
I could hear a lot more traffic above me , and even the occasional tram .
Eventually I saw aq truly marvelous sight :
The open air !
I crossed back over the Bridge of Joy , around the Sporting Oval of Triumph , though the Forest of Wondrous Delights and finally reached my goal :
The 7 - 11 of Heavenly Splendor !
And then I watched the sun come upI stumbled through my front door at about 7 am , took off all my wet clothing , checked my gear ( my phone was screwed ) and had a wonderful hot shower .
I was incredibly sore at this point so I called in sick and went to bed .
And that was my stupid adventure !
Post Script : one of the Cave Clan guys eventually saw my original LJ post and got in contact with me .
Apparently I was pretty close to the end of the drain when I decided to turn back .
:( Apparently there 's no exit at the end of the drain , just a brick wall .
Post Script 2 : when I got to work the day after and my boss asked me where I 'd been the day before I just showed her these photos .
Her only response was " I 'm sorry you did n't find the TMNT . " :D
If a professor at the University of Florida ( U.F. ) has his way , the first flying saucer to grace Planet Earth 's skies is n't likely to come from outer space but rather from Gainesville , where the faculty member is drawing up plans to build a circular aircraft that can hover in the air like a helicopter without any moving parts or fuel .
In other words , it will look like a UFO , but will actually be more of an IFO — an identified flying object .
The saucer will hover and propel itself using electrodes that cover its surface to ionize the surrounding air into plasma .
Gases ( such as air , which has an equal number of positive and negative charges ) become plasma when energy ( such as heat or electricity ) causes some of the gas 's atoms to lose their negatively charged electrons , creating atoms with a positive charge , or positive ions , surrounded by the newly detached electrons .
Using an onboard source of energy ( such as a battery , ultracapacitor , solar panel or any combination thereof ) , the electrodes will send an electrical current into the plasma , causing the plasma to push against the neutral ( noncharged ) air surrounding the craft , theoretically generating enough force for liftoff and movement in different directions ( depending on where on the craft 's surface you direct the electrical current ) .
The concept sounds far - fetched , but U.F. mechanical and aerospace engineering associate professor Subrata Roy plans to have a mini model ready to demonstrate his theory within the next year .
At six inches ( 15.2 centimeters ) in diameter , the device , which Roy calls a " wingless electromagnetic air vehicle " ( WEAV ) , will truly be a flying saucer .
Theoretically , Roy says , the flying saucer can be as large as anyone wants to build it , because the design gives the aircraft balance and stability .
In other words , this type of aircraft could someday be built large enough to ferry around people .
But , Roy says , " we need to walk before we can run , so we 're starting small . "
The biggest hurdle to building a WEAV large enough to carry passengers would be making the craft light , yet powerful enough to lift its cargo and energy source .
Roy is not sure what kind of energy source he will use yet .
He anticipates that the craft 's body will be made from a material that is an insulator such as ceramic , which is light and a good conductor of electricity .
" In theory you probably should be able to scale it up , " says Anthony Colozza , a researcher with government contractor Analex Corporation who is stationed at NASA 's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland and helped Roy draw up the original plans for powering the saucer .
The choice of a power source that is powerful , yet lightweight is " probably going to be the thing that makes or breaks it . "
Roy began designing the WEAV in 2006 .
The following year , he and Colozza wrote a paper for the now - defunct NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts ( NIAC ) about the use of electrohydrodynamics , or ionized particles , as an alternative to liquid fuel for powering space vehicles .
When NASA shut down NIAC in August 2007 , Roy decided to continue his work at U.F .
If he 's successful , Roy hopes to develop a more stable aircraft and a new form of fuel — air .
Other craft that interact with the atmosphere have a problem : moving parts , whether jet engines , propellers or rotors .
" My interest started when I saw inherent problems in helicopters and airplanes , " Roy says .
If these parts stop moving , the aircraft falls from the sky .
The flying saucer , on the other hand , has no moving parts .
In theory , the WEAV would be more stable than an aircraft — airplanes and helicopters , for example — that rely on aerodynamics to provide lift .
Using a plasma field , " you could produce lift in any direction , you could change direction quickly and that power could be turned on or off almost instantly , " Colozza says .
If the pilot wanted such an aircraft to move to the right , he or she would increase power to electrodes on the left side of the craft and vice versa for moving to the left .
Electrodes on the bottom of the craft would power its lift , whereas those on top would bring the craft back down to Earth .
Assuming Roy 's WEAV prototype gets off the ground next year — and that 's a big if — it could prove useful in a number of ways .
What makes the WEAV potentially appealing as a way to power spacecraft is that it relies on electricity ( from a battery or some other power source ) rather than combustion — a process that requires oxygen , which is in short supply outside Earth 's atmosphere , Colozza says .
Still , the WEAV 's biggest fans are likely to be in the U.S. military , who would use the craft as a drone for gathering intelligence , reconnaissance and surveillance information .
Roy has been working with the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright - Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton , Ohio , since 2001 to study how plasma could be used to control the flow of air — pushing air in different directions — and thereby the vehicle 's movements .
" If plasma ( flow ) is turned on the right way , I can blow air any direction I want to blow air , " says Doug Blake , deputy director of the Air Force Research Lab's Air Vehicles Directorate , of the craft 's ability to push air away from itself .
" If I have a jet coming out of the bottom of this , I can create a helicopter with no moving parts .
Things that you would use a helicopter for , you could use this for . "
But this does not mean the Air Force is ready to order a fleet of Roy 's flying saucers .
" We have worked with ( Roy ) on plasma studies but there are no concrete plans in place that I 'm aware of to explicitly support the development of this device , " Blake says .
At this early stage , and without a clear decision on how the craft will be powered , Roy says it is unclear how much a WEAV might cost to build and operate .
Still , he is optimistic .
" All of the materials needed to make this aircraft currently exist , " he says , " and plasma is the most abundant form of matter in the universe .
If we can somehow tap into that in the future we should be able to fly anywhere . "
Box office preview :
The comedy calm before the “ Transformers ” storm ?
Awaiting the coming midweek arrival of the next big fanboy franchise entry , “ Transformers : Revenge of the Carniverous Unicorns ” or whatever it ’s called , a couple of high concept comedies with theoretically strong potential sail into the nation ’s multiplexes this weekend .
While both should do okay business , the “ meh ” to “ Cathy ” - style “ ack ! ” reactions from critics ( I know we do n’t really count but , hey , if you tickle us , do we not chuckle ? ) might indicate somewhat limited potential against the ongoing one - two punch of “ The Hangover ” and “ Up . ” I expect a close one .
But then , I ’m always wrong .
Of the two new comedies , “ The Proposal , ” starring Ryan Reynolds as a put - upon assistant cajoled into a sham marriage with his you - know - what - on - wheels boss played by Sandra Bullock , appears to be the somewhat stronger contender .
This initially struck me as something of a gender - reversed redo of Mike Nichols ’ similarly high - concept 1988 Melanie Griffith vehicle , “ Working Girl , ” with the executives originally played by Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver mushed into Bullock ’s publishing bigwig .
However , the reviews indicate something darker at times , but probably less entertaining for a mass audience .
With a 44 % “ fresh ” at Rotten Tomatoes , mirrored by our own David Medsker ’s split critical decision , critics are turning no cartwheels .
The Hollywood Reporter however suggests that the film has some pretty serious date - movie appeal and that might be enough for $ 20 million or so , which might be enough to hit the # 1 spot .
Certainly many women may feel that , to paraphrase Griffith 21 years back , Reynolds has a mind for comedy and a body for sin .
It ’s therefore a good bet they subtly encourage their significant others to attend with them , who themselves might not mind looking at the adorable , if now fully adult , Ms. Bullock for a couple of hours themselves .
We shall see .
If critics were unconvinced by “ The Proposal , ” they were hurling ancient curses at what sure seemed to me like a promising comedy concept but , then , there ’s the me - always - being - wrong thing .
I speaketh of the hunter - gatherers - go - biblical “ Year One , ” directed by comedy veteran multi-hyphenate Harold “ Egon Spengler ” Ramis .
The critics seem to agree that this vehicle for two of the best known names in youth - targeted comedy , Jack Black and the gifted savior of dry humor among the young , Michael Cera , is a million miles away from being Ramis ’s best work .
( That would include probably one of the beloved films of the last twenty years , “ Groundhog Day ” as well as the frat - boy touchstone , “ Caddyshack . ” )
On the other hand , Variety offers the thought that it ’s “ tracking ” is improving .
I ’m still trying to figure out what “ tracking ” actually means , but I guess that ’s supposed to be a good thing .
Nevertheless , our own Jason Zingale heaps some pretty serious 1.5 star scorn on a film which mixes some fairly extreme - sounding scatological humor with some pretty big comic prey in taking on some of the best known characters from the ever - popular first half of Jehovah ’s bestselling two - part epic .
He ’s hardly alone , as only 19 % of the RT gang saw much of worth in it and some saw the opportunity to hurl a few would - be comic zingers of their own .
CHUD ’s Devin Faraci commenteth :
Year
One is so dedicated to being historically accurate that it only uses jokes that are at least two thousand years old .
Entertainment Weekly ‘s Owen Glieberman went the contrarian root and actually awarded the film a relative rave with a B - rating , and appears to be one of the few ( only ? ) critics to heap praise on Jack Black ’s performance while attacking the dryness of Cera .
He also offers what the film ’s many detractors will take as a terrifying thought :
Every era gets the prehistoric comedy it deserves .
Meanwhile in arthouse land :
The would - be prestige comedy “ Away We Go ” widens to 132 screens this weekend .
Also , the week ’s new limited release is yet another promising sounding attempt at America ’s funnybone , the latest from Woody Allen ( though apparently the original script dates back to the seventies ) , “ Whatever Works ” starring HBO ’s own Larry David .
Allen ’s films are almost the definition of review - driven hits - or - misses and this one has engendered what is at best a split decision with 53 % ( only 9 % among “ top critics ” ! ) at RT .
That ’s low enough to ( forgive me , Lord , for what I ’m about to say ) curb filmgoer enthusiasm .

The episode of Pokémon Sunday today revealed a new device that could connect to Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver .
This pedometer known as the 「 ポケウォーカー 」 PokéWalker will be given to those who purchase HeartGold or SoulSilver .
The PokéWalker has both the shape and colors of a regular Monster Ball .
It has at least three buttons and a monochrome interface .
It will allow players of HeartGold and SoulSilver to deposit one Pokémon there .
The Pokémon gains experience points and happiness as players walk , somewhat similar to the toys based on the Digivice of the Digimon series .
Mini games are also included .
This pedometer is the remake of Pokémon Pikachu 2 , a toy that can be used to obtain Mystery Gifts in Gold , Silver and Crystal .
Similar to that toy , the PokéWalker will use the currency Watt ( W ) for purchasing items , some of which can be sent to HeartGold or SoulSilver .
It is currently unknown if this will be available outside of Japan .
A team of Virginia Commonwealth University scientists has discovered a ‘ magnetic superatom ’ – a stable cluster of atoms that can mimic different elements of the periodic table – that one day may be used to create molecular electronic devices for the next generation of faster computers with larger memory storage .
The newly discovered cluster , consisting of one vanadium and eight cesium atoms , acts like a tiny magnet that can mimic a single manganese atom in magnetic strength while preferentially allowing electrons of specific spin orientation to flow through the surrounding shell of cesium atoms .
The findings appear online in the journal Nature Chemistry .
Through an elaborate series of theoretical studies , Shiv N. Khanna , Ph.D. , professor in the VCU Department of Physics , together with VCU postdoctoral associates J. Ulises Reveles , A.C. Reber , and graduate student P. Clayborne , and collaborators at the Naval Research Laboratory in D.C. , and the Harish - Chandra Research Institute in Allahabad , India , examined the electronic and magnetic properties of clusters having one vanadium atom surrounded by multiple cesium atoms .
They found that when the cluster had eight cesium atoms it acquired extra stability due to a filled electronic state .
An atom is in a stable configuration when its outermost shell is full .
Consequently , when an atom combines with other atoms , it tends to lose or gain valence electrons to acquire a stable configuration .
According to Khanna , the new cluster had a magnetic moment of five Bohr magnetons , which is more than twice the value for an iron atom in a solid iron magnet .
A magnetic moment is a measure of the internal magnetism of the cluster .
A manganese atom also has a similar magnetic moment and a closed electronic shell of more tightly bound electrons , and Khanna said that the new cluster could be regarded as a mimic of a manganese atom .
“ An important objective of the discovery was to find what combination of atoms will lead to a species that is stable as we put multiple units together .
The combination of magnetic and conducting attributes was also desirable .
Cesium is a good conductor of electricity and hence the superatom combines the benefit of magnetic character along with ease of conduction through its outer skin , ” Khanna said .
“ A combination such as the one we have created here can lead to significant developments in the area of “ molecular electronics , ” a field where researchers study electric currents through small molecules .
These molecular devices are expected to help make non-volatile data storage , denser integrated devices , higher data processing and other benefits , ” he said .
Khanna and his team are conducting preliminary studies on molecules composed of two such superatoms and have made some promising observations that may have applications in spintronics .
Spintronics is a process using electron spin to synthesize new devices for memory and data processing .
The researchers have also proposed that by combining gold and manganese , one can make other superatoms that have magnetic moment , but will not conduct electricity .
These superatoms may have potential biomedical applications such as sensing , imaging and drug delivery .
This research was supported by the U.S. Department of the Army .
Analyzing MRI studies of the brain with software developed at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) may allow diagnosis of Alzheimer 's disease and of mild cognitive impairment , a lesser form of dementia that precedes the development of Alzheimer 's by several years .
In their report that will appear in the journal Brain and has been released online , the MGH / Martinos team show how their software program can accurately differentiate patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer 's disease from normal elderly individuals based on anatomic differences in brain structures known to be affected by the disease .
" Traditionally Alzheimer 's has been diagnosed based on a combination of factors – such as a neurologic exam , detailed medical history and written tests of cognitive functioning – with neuroimaging used primarily to rule out other diseases such as stroke or a brain tumor , " says Rahul Desikan MD , PhD , of the Martinos Center and Boston University School of Medicine , lead author of the Brain paper .
" Our findings show the feasibility and importance of using automated , MRI - based neuroanatomic measures as a diagnostic marker for Alzheimer 's disease . "
The researchers note that mild cognitive impairment occurs in about 20 percent of elderly individuals – as many as 40 percent of those over 85 – 80 percent of whom develop Alzheimer 's within five or six years .
Since drugs that may slow the progression of Alzheimer 's are in development , the ability to treat patients in the earliest stages of the disease may significantly delay progression to dementia .
To investigate whether MR imaging can produce diagnostic markers for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer 's disease , the research team used FreeSurfer – an openly available imaging software package developed at the Martinos Center and the University of California at San Diego – to examine a number of neuroanatomic regions across a range of normal individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer 's disease .
In the first phase of the study , the investigators examined MR images of 97 elderly individuals , some who had been determined to have mild cognitive impairment and others who were cognitively normal .
Analyzing those images identified three regions of the brain where structural differences distinguished the normal controls from participants with mild cognitive impairment with an accuracy of 91 percent .
Earlier pathological and imaging studies have found evidence of early Alzheimer 's disease in these three areas – the hippocampus , entorhinal cortex and the supramarginal gyrus .
To validate the accuracy and assess the reliability of the first - phase observations , the investigators analyzed imaging data from 216 individuals in the Alzheimer 's Disease Neuroimaging Database – 94 of whom were normal , 58 who had mild cognitive impairment at the time of imaging and went on to develop dementia , and 65 who had probable Alzheimer 's based on their clinical symptoms .
These participants also had a series of neuropsychological tests , and samples of cerebrospinal fluid were available for many of them .
Automated MRI measures of the same three areas identified in the first phase – entorhinal cortex , hippocampus , and supramarginal gyrus – discriminated individuals with mild cognitive impairment from normal elderly controls with 95 percent accuracy , and patients with Alzheimer 's were discriminated from normal controls with 100 percent accuracy .
The MRI measures also were significantly correlated with clinical and cognitive tests of dementia , particularly memory decline , and with biomarkers of cellular pathology such as the Alzheimer 's - associated forms of the tau and amyloid proteins .
" Our results indicate that these automated MRI measures are one effective way of identifying individuals in the earliest stages of Alzheimer 's disease , but before this technology can be used clinically , several follow - up studies need to be done , " says Desikan .
" Those include determining whether these automated MRI measures can accurately predict which individuals with mild cognitive impairment will progress to Alzheimer 's ; seeing if they can differentiate Alzheimer 's from other neurodegenerative diseases ; assessing how these measures do at early diagnosis , compared to other measures such as cellular biomarkers ; and then validating all of these findings against the gold standard for diagnosis , postmortem examination of brain tissue .

WHEN Otto von Bismarck introduced the first pension for workers over 70 in 1889 , the life expectancy of a Prussian was 45 .
In 1908 , when Lloyd George bullied through a payment of five shillings a week for poor men who had reached 70 , Britons , especially poor ones , were lucky to survive much past 50 .
By 1935 , when America set up its Social Security system , the official pension age was 65 — three years beyond the lifespan of the typical American .
State - sponsored retirement was designed to be a brief sunset to life , for a few hardy souls .
Now retirement is for everyone , and often as long as whole lives once were .
In some European countries the average retirement lasts more than a quarter of a century .
In America the official pension age is 66 , but the average American retires at 64 and can then expect to live for another 16 years .
Average spending on public pensions across the OECD is now the equivalent of more than 7 % of GDP ( they cost America just 0.2 % back in 1935 ) .
In some countries the current figure could double by 2050 , to say nothing of the cost of private pensions and extra spending on health and long - term care .
Grey and proud of it
Although the idea that “ we are all getting older ” is a truism , few governments , employers or individuals have yet come to terms with where longer retirement is heading : the end of the whole concept ( see special report ) .
Whether we like it or not , we are going back to the pre-Bismarckian world , where work had no formal stopping point .
That reversion will not happen overnight , but preparations should start now — to ensure that when the inevitable happens it is a change for the better .
It should be for the better because it is being partly driven by a wonderful thing : people are living ever longer .
Life expectancy has been rising by two or three years for every ten that pass , despite repeated forecasts that it was about to reach its limit .
Centenarians used to be rarer than hens ' teeth ; now America alone has 100,000 of them .
By the end of this century the age of 100 may have become the new three score and ten .
This imminent greying of society is compounded by two other demographic shifts .
First , in most rich countries women no longer have enough babies to keep up the numbers ( a prospect that may please a lot of greens but not many governments ) ; and the huge baby - boom generation , born after the second world war , has begun to retire .
In 1950 the OECD countries had seven people aged 20 - 64 for every one of 65 and over .
Now it is four to one — and on course to be two to one by 2050 .
That will ruin the pay - as - you - go state pension schemes that provide the bulk of retirement income in rich countries .
It is tempting to think that some of the gaps in the rich countries ' labour forces could be filled by immigrants from poorer countries .
They already account for much of what little population growth there is in the developed world .
But once ageing gets properly under way , the shortfalls will become so large that the flow of immigrants would have to increase to many times what it is now .
Given the political resistance to even today 's levels of immigration ( as shown up in the recent elections to the European Parliament ) , that , alas , looks unlikely .
So individuals , companies and governments in rich countries will have to adapt .
There are some signs the first two are beginning to do that .
Many employers remain prejudiced against older workers , and not always without reason : performance in manual jobs does drop off in middle age , and older people are often slower on the uptake and less comfortable with new technology .
But people past retirement age would not necessarily carry on in the same jobs as before .
In Japan , where pensions are Spartan and lots of people are still working in their later 60s and even 70s , big companies like Hitachi have found ways of re-employing staff after retirement — but in a different capacity and , significantly , at lower pay .
Elsewhere employers have been less inventive .
But retailers such as Wal - Mart or Britain 's B&Q , and caterers such as McDonald 's , have started hiring pensioners because their customers find them friendlier and more helpful .
And skills shortages are already creating opportunities : in the past year or two a dearth of German engineers has caused companies to bring back older workers .
Once labour forces start declining , from about 2020 , employers will no longer have much choice .
As for the older workers themselves , many of them seem keen enough to carry on beyond retirement .
A recent Financial Times / Harris poll showed most Americans , Britons and Italians would work for longer in return for a larger pension ( though Germans were much less enthusiastic ) .
This surely makes sense : as long as the job is not too onerous , many people benefit in mind and body from having something to get them out of the house .
Many baby - boomers say they never want to bow out altogether , though they would often prefer to put in shorter hours .
If they want to go on working , they will have to accept that pay can go down as well as up .
It will all work out , sort of
Can governments make sure this inevitable adjustment goes smoothly ?
In the recent past some policies have bordered on the demographically insane — for instance “ job - creation ” schemes that encourage older workers to take early retirement .
Many things that make sense anyway , such as making benefits more portable , encouraging immigration , promoting private saving or reforming health care ( see article ) , make even more sense now .
Banning mandatory retirement ages in the private sector ( as America has done ) looks sensible , as does creating conditions in which people can retire more gradually .
Above all , the retirement ages for state pensions need to be put back .
Recent increases to 67 or 68 are doing no more than compensate for the likely rise in life expectancy : 70 would be a better figure .
So far only Denmark has taken the radical step of indexing the pensionable age to life expectancy .
Some of this will be unpopular .
Private pensions , which might make up for some of this , last year lost nearly a quarter of their value , a terrifying $ 5.4 trillion .
But as Herb Stein , an economist , pointed out , “ if something cannot go on forever , it will stop . ”
Better to try to enjoy the consequences .
This is a lovely sentiment , forget the swearing , read the message and understand why your teddy means so much to you

[ Kepler - Project ] Re : Basic benchmark result
Guillame ; Herewith my notes .
You can instruct Lighttpd to launch as many FCGI workers as you like , but it 's a little counter - intuitive .
Specify it with the " max - procs " setting in the fastcgi.server .
I was interested by your results , and so decided to have a little shootout of my own .
Here are my results for plain HTML , PHP and Lua .
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Plain HTML , default Lighttpd on Ubuntu VM : ab -c 10 -n 10000 http://10.1.1.6/hello_world.html
... Requests per second : 3163.00 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 3.162 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 0.316 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 1000.79 [ Kbytes / sec ] received ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Plain PHP with default Lighttpd settings : ab -c 10 -n 10000 http://10.1.1.6/hello_world.php
... Requests per second : 1431.15 [ #/sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 6.987 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 0.699 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 373.24 [ Kbytes / sec ] received ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Plain PHP , with PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN increased to 16 : ab -c 10 -n 10000 http://10.1.1.6/hello_world.php
... Requests per second : 1388.17 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 7.204 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 0.720 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 361.95 [ Kbytes / sec ] received ----------------------------------------------------------------------
PHP , default settings , with XCache opcode cache installed : ab -c 10 -n 10000 http://10.1.1.6/hello_world.php
... Requests per second : 1076.88 [ #/sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 9.286 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 0.929 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 280.81 [ Kbytes / sec ] received ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now the interesting stuff -- using Lua .
This involved a lot of futzing about with ubuntu .
9.04 intrepid includes promising - looking packages for WSAPI , but they are incomplete .
Apparently 9.10 karmic will have integrated WSAPI packages which get over the " it just works " hurdle that I am able to vault by myself .
My installation is thus luarocks - based .
As has been noted on this mailing list ( thanks Google ! ) , this means installing luafilesystem and rings , both of which are required , neither of which are automatic dependencies .
I consider this a bug .
Anyhow , moving along .
----------------------------------------------------------------------
First I run the microbenchmark with the default 4 wsapi.fcgi instances : ab -c 10 -n 10000 http://10.1.1.6/hello_world.ws
... Requests per second : 1664.60 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 6.007 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 0.601 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 374.03 [ Kbytes / sec ] received ----------------------------------------------------------------------
And now at max - procs = 16 : ab -c 10 -n 10000 http://10.1.1.6/hello_world.ws
... Requests per second : 1526.44 [ #/sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 6.551 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 0.655 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 342.92 [ Kbytes / sec ] received ----------------------------------------------------------------------
And now at max - procs = 32 : ab -c 10 -n 10000 http://10.1.1.6/hello_world.ws
... Requests per second : 1487.43 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 6.723 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 0.672 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 334.26 [ Kbytes / sec ] received
In this latter test I looked at load .
It never breaks past 0.07 .
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Now max - procs = 32 with higher concurrency : ab -c 50 -n 10000 http://10.1.1.6/hello_world.ws
Requests per second : 1434.58 [ #/sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 34.854 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 0.697 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 322.32 [ Kbytes / sec ] received
Not a huge improvement , but then , not much degradation either .
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Last of all , something a bit different .
The lighttpd " mod_magnet " module allows you to embed lua scripts directly into the web server .
Let 's see how that performs : ab -c 10 -n 10000 http://10.1.1.6/hello_world
... Requests per second : 3005.95 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 3.327 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 0.333 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 675.37 [ Kbytes / sec ] received Notice that this is twice as fast as any other FastCGI configuration and only slightly slower than raw HTML .
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The same again , with much higher concurrency : ab -c 250 -n 10000 http://10.1.1.6/hello_world
... Requests per second : 2653.38 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 94.220 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 0.377 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 596.03 [ Kbytes / sec ] received Still much better than FCGI .
There is a big " gotcha " for this , however .
Lighttpd is single - threaded by design , and the pass through a lua script is a single - threaded pass .
In scenarios where you have a long - running lua script , this will be worse than the fcgi scenario .
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The busy - wait script , run on FCGI with 16 wsapi instances : ab -c 10 -n 10000 http://10.1.1.6/busy_world.ws
... Requests per second : 954.08 [ # /sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 10.481 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 1.048 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 214.32 [ Kbytes / sec ] received ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The busy - wait script , run inside lighttpd with mod_magnet : ab -c 10 -n 1000 http://10.1.1.6/busy_world
Requests per second : 5.20 [ #/sec ] ( mean )
Time per request : 1922.162 [ ms ] ( mean )
Time per request : 192.216 [ ms ] ( mean , across all concurrent requests )
Transfer rate : 1.17 [ Kbytes / sec ] received
The results are catastrophically worse for this case -- it was so slow that I killed the original test and ran it again with only 1000 requests ( 10 x less ) .
This is because every request is dealt with by itself .
The normal model allows lighty to push a job onto a fastcgi worker , let them run while it services the next HTTP request , then send the reply when it 's ready .
mod_magnet breaks this model .
You have been warned .
----------------------------------------------------------------------
My conclusions : * Lua is faster than PHP in a FastCGI environment * Lua probably scales better -- compare the multi - worker examples .
* Embedding lua in lighttpd using mod_magnet can be incredibly fast ... * ... but does not scale for long - running scripts .
* I should be studying for my exams , instead of spending a morning on this stuff .

One of Britain 's leading economic thinktanks has called an end to the recession after industrial output showed its first rise in more than a year in April .
The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said March this year was the trough of the downturn that began in the summer of 2008 .
NIESR said that output had risen in both April and May after a tough first three months of the year that saw the economy contract by 1.9 % .
If sustained in June , the second quarter of 2009 would show the first increase in gross domestic product since the first three months of 2008 .
" The monthly figures are inevitably erratic but the picture is coherent with the broader picture of stabilisation which has emerged since we first suggested that the output had stopped falling in our GDP release on 13 May " , the NIESR said .
Earlier , figures from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) showed a 0.3 % increase in production after a run of falls that began in March 2008 .
Manufacturing output – the largest component of industrial production – was up by 0.2 % in April , while the ONS also revised up a previously estimated drop of 0.1 % in March to a 0.2 % increase .
Output of oil and gas from the North Sea also rose .
Despite the pickup in April , the ONS said industrial output in the latest quarter – a guide to the underlying trend – was down 3.2 % on the previous three months and 12.6 % lower than in the February - to - April period of 2008 .
Manufacturing output fell 2.8 % on the quarter and by 12.1 % on the year .
The government will , however , be boosted by evidence that the sharp devaluation of the pound and the easing of monetary policy to boost growth appear to be working .
The Prime Minister 's spokesman said : " There are clearly signs that the action the government has taken is starting to have effect , but it remains a very , very difficult global situation that our businesses are facing .
There is no room for complacency . "
In common with the rest of the world , Britain 's factories slashed production after the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September paralysed the financial markets .
Many factories were either closed or put on short - time working .
Recent data has suggested , however , that companies have run down stocks of goods and now need to increase output to meet demand .
Amit Kara , an economist at UBS , said : " It 's not too surprising we have seen the [ manufacturing ] sector expand after the purchasing managers ' index figures .
Going forward , the currency effect should start feeding through into the manufacturing data .
" From a policy perspective , it 's not going to make much difference .
The Bank of England 's monetary policy committee will want to see more evidence of a sustainable recovery before they consider an exit strategy . "
Separate figures from the ONS revealed the UK 's trade deficit widened to its biggest gap in April since September last year .
A flat performance by exports and an increase in imports pushed the visible trade gap up from just under £ 6.5 bn to just over £ 7bn .
Update 1:26 PM : President Obama 's statement :
" I look forward to working with Senator - Elect Franken to build a new foundation for growth and prosperity by lowering health care costs and investing in the kind of clean energy jobs and industries that will help America lead in the 21st century . "
Update 1:22 PM : Amy Klobuchar , Minnesota 's senior Senator : " Norm Coleman did the right thing for our state . "
Update 1:13 PM : Video of Coleman 's concession .
Senator - elect ( ai n't it fun to say that ? )
Al Franken will speak at 2:15 Pacific time .
Update 1:02 PM , from Coleman 's press conference : " We have reached the point where future litigation damages the unity of our state .... I congratulate Al Franken on his victory . "
Original post : Can you say Senator - elect Al Franken ?
Finally !
These are pictures I received in an email .
Apparently , this “ dead baby ” was aborted from a cow in Thailand .
What would be the explanation for a human - like torso and head with hoof like legs and a tail ?
Is this genetic engineering gone wrong , or did something else happen ?
This was the description that came with the email .
This is all I know :
“ This dead alien - like being found in a small town in Thailand was claimed to be born from a cow and seems at first to be a severe case of birth malformation defect .
A closer examination however reveal that the alien being resembles too much of a human baby with its front legs looking more like hands than feet .
In the form of a ritual , the local residents pour baby powder onto the dead body and burnt incense in their belief of cleansing the area of evil and hopeful that it will be reincarnated peacefully . ”
I am hoping that this is just a malformed aborted calf .
But it does have some resemblance to an alien with cow ’s feet .
Are abominations possibly going on with mating animals and humans / aliens / demonic beings in the last days ?
I show the pictures .
You decide .
While in Egypt , I became interested in the cuisine of ancient Greece and Rome .
I found that more than a few surviving recipes , such as Squash Alexandria - Style and Parthian Chicken , called for a gum resin taken from a plant called silphium .
Silphium grew only in the region of eastern Libya known as Cyrenaica , and “ Cyrenian silphium ” was widely popular in Greece and Rome from the sixth century bc to the first century of our era , when it was believed to have become extinct .
After that , Roman cooks turned to asafoetida as a substitute , a sufficiently similar spice that Persian traders brought to Rome .
TOP : SAWDIA ; Above : MONEY SHARMA / DRIK INDIA /
MAJORITYWORLD
To find some asafoetida in Cairo , I headed to the well - known Harraz Herb Shop near bustling Bab al - Khalq square .
The shop resembled a medieval apothecary , with row upon row of seeds , powders and baskets of dried plants , and shelves filled with bottles of essential oils .
I bought a fist - sized lump of brown - gray resin .
Slightly sticky to the touch , it was as dense as a block of wood .
Mostly , though , it was remarkable for its terrible , aggressive smell — a sulfurous blend of manure and overcooked cabbage , all with the nose - wrinkling pungency of a summer dumpster .
The stench leached into everything nearby , too , which meant I had to double - wrap it and seal it in a plastic tub if I wanted to keep it in the kitchen .
Later , as cookbooks suggested , I unwrapped the lump , scraped off a pea-sized piece of resin and dropped it into olive oil to sauté .
The transformation was astonishing :
When heated , the asafoetida disintegrated in the hot oil and gave off a rich , savory scent , reminiscent of sautéed onions .
It bestowed a delicate base flavoring to the dishes I made .
It quickly became obvious why something that had at first seemed so repulsive proved so popular , first in the ancient world and up to the present day in a number of countries — especially India , where it is used in everything from pickled dishes , chutneys and curries to vegetarian dishes and lentils ( dal ) .
In the West , asafoetida remains virtually unused , with one exception :
It ’s an ingredient in Worcestershire sauce , which was based on a recipe from a British officer returned from colonial India .
he earliest mention of asafoetida in the historical record dates from the eighth century BC , when the plant was listed in an inventory of the gardens of Babylonian King Marduk - apla - iddina II .
Not long after that , in Nineveh ( near modern Mosul , Iraq ) , asafoetida was included in a catalogue of medicinal plants in the library of King Ashurbanipal .
From that beginning , the story of asafoetida reaches from ancient India and Persia to Rome , the Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad , medieval Europe , India ’s Mughal Empire and modern Afghanistan and Iran .
Its story is also closely entwined with that of its mysterious lost cousin , silphium .
The word asafoetida is a linguistic meeting of East and West : aza means “ resin ” or “ mastic ” in Persian and foetida means “ stinking ” in Latin .
While “ stinking resin ” seems adequately descriptive , other languages use colorful adaptations of the notion of “ devil ’s dung ” for the spice : şeytan tersi in Turkish ; Teufelsdreck in German ; dyvelsträck in Swedish ; merde du diable in French and esterco - do - diabo in Portuguese .
In Afghanistan ( where asafoetida grows widely today ) and in India ( its biggest modern consumer ) , its name is far simpler : hing , which derives from the Sanskrit han , meaning “ kill ” — likely another reference to its deadly uncooked smell .

Asafoetida is the exudate — technically a mixture of gum and resin— collected from the root of Ferula assafoetida , a relative of the carrot and fennel plants .
Today , the plant grows only from eastern Iran to western Afghanistan and in parts of Kashmir , and it has never been successfully cultivated .
Generally , a plant must be at least four years old before it will yield , and is tapped in the spring .
On finding a suitable plant , a harvester digs away the soil and makes an incision in the top of the thick , carrot - like root , which then exudes , for up to three months , as much as a kilogram ( 35 oz ) of milky resin .
The exudate hardens on exposure to air and gradually turns brown .
Chemically , the gum resin ’s signature pungency is the scent of 2 - butyl 1 - propenyl disulfide and other disulfides , which break down when subjected to the heat of cooking .
Its scent also contains the more pleasant diallyl sulfide , familiar from onions and garlic , which remains intact in cooking , giving asafoetida its distinct , leek - like flavor .
According to Mohammed Shah Rauf , a specialist in sustainable development in rural Afghanistan , much of the asafoetida collected in Afghanistan comes from Herat province near the border with Iran .
In Herat , one of the largest asafoetida dealers is Mahmood , who goes only by his first name and who counts among his local customers the Indian consulate , which buys asafoetida from him in bulk .
In total , he says his business is “ around 2000 kilograms [ 4400 lb ] of asafoetida per year . ”
Although there are no reliable national statistics , Rauf estimates that Iran and Afghanistan together annually produce approximately 500 to 600 tons of asafoetida .
Most is exported to India , since in Iran and Afghanistan it is used only medicinally .
East of Herat , the other major center for asafoetida is in central Afghanistan , in the hills around the provincial capital of Chaghcharan .
From there , it is delivered to Kandahar , Afghanistan ’s second largest city , and transshipped overland to Quetta in Pakistan and on to India .
In Iran , asafoetida is collected in the region around the city of Mashhad and in the rocky highlands southeast of the Dasht - e - Kevir desert .
Chef Yumana Devi mentions in her cookbook Lord Krishna ’s Cuisine ( 1987 , Dutton ) that in Delhi ’s historic Red Fort area , a district of spice - milling shops , “ a cloud of the heady asafoetida smell pervades several blocks . ”
There , the dried asafoetida resin is ground into a powder and mixed with gum arabic and flour , which both keep it from lumping and dilute its intensity .
The resulting compound is sold commercially as bandhani hing , several varieties of which can be found in almost any spice market in India , and in North America and Europe on shelves at international groceries , where jars cost a few dollars .
Asafoetida ’s popularity in India is not just a matter of taste .
Many followers of Jainism avoid eating root vegetables , so they use asafoetida in lieu of onions and garlic .
Additionally , some Hindus abstain from onions and garlic , too , particularly in the south , where asafoetida is especially popular .
There are also health reasons :
Among its medicinal properties , asafoetida is believed to help digestion and counteract flatulence — which is why it is often used with legumes such as chickpeas and lentils .
ealth benefits have been attributed to asafoetida as far back as its culinary history reaches .
In the early 11th century , the great physician Ibn Sina recommended it for treating indigestion .
Much earlier , in the first century , in his authoritative work on botanical medicine , De Materia Medica , the Greek herbalist Dioscorides recommended it almost as a cure - all : Not only was it good for goiters , baldness , toothache and lung diseases from pleurisy to bronchitis , but asafoetida could also bring on menstruation — a characteristic also attested by Pliny .
It could be applied to scorpion bites , and ( if one dared ) could even “ cast[s ] off horseleeches that stick to the throat ” when “ gargled with vinegar . ”
It is with Dioscorides that we also get the earliest hints of how closely related asafoetida was to my unobtainable Roman ingredient , Cyrenian silphium , because Dioscorides uses the word silphium interchangeably with asafoetida , as if they were varieties of the same plant : “ Silphium grows in places around Syria , Armenia , Media [ Persia ] and Libya ....
Though you taste ever so little of the Cyrenian , it causes dullness over your body , and is very gentle to smell , so that if you taste it your mouth breathes but a little of it .
The Median and Syrian [ varieties ] are weaker in strength and they have a more poisonous smell . ”
His “ silphium ” from Syria , Armenia and Persia is almost surely Ferula assafoetida , which does not grow in Libya but which may , in those times , have grown in Syria and Armenia as well as Persia , where it still grows today .
Similarly , the Roman historian Arrian , who is the source of much of our information about Alexander the Great ’s expedition to Asia in the late fourth century BC , recounts that in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan , Alexander ’s army found “ silphium ” — again presumably the ancestor of Ferula assafoetida .
It is interesting to know that , 200 years earlier , part of the population of the Cyrenian city of Barce had been deported by the Persians to Bactria — a territory that overlaps the borders of modern Afghanistan , Turkmenistan and eastern Iran — and to speculate that the involuntary migrants might have taken with them the seeds of such a nourishing and medically valuable plant as silphium .
In any case , once Libyan silphium ceased to be available , asafoetida from Central Asia turned out to be a convenient substitute .

Pour fish sauce over them and mix with wine .
Place the chicken in a Cumaean clay pot and pour the blended mixture over the chicken .
Dissolve fresh silphium in warm water and pour on the chicken as you cook it .
Season with ground pepper .

The most likely trade route for asafoetida in Roman times ran from Herat ( Roman Aria ) northwest to Mashhad ( in today ’s eastern Iran ) , where it joined the Silk Roads to follow the southeastern shore of the Caspian Sea , across the Iranian plateau to Ctesiphon , near Baghdad , and then north along the Euphrates to Dura Europos in Syria ’s eastern desert .
From there , caravans traveled to the Mediterranean either by a northerly route to the port city of Antioch , or a southerly route , via Palmyra and Damascus , to Tyre .
In the first centuries of our era , Rome ’s new dependence on Asian asafoetida was part of a much greater Roman boom in imported spices .
In the words of John Keay , author of The Spice Route : A History , “ The spice trade in the early years of the Roman Empire probably exceeded anything seen in the West until the 15th century . ”
The fact that Romans had access to Asian asafoetida at all highlights the transcendent economic importance of the spice trade , for the Parthian Empire , which controlled the regions where asafoetida grew , was hostile to Rome ’s political ambitions in the East .
Nonetheless , the Parthians refrained from disrupting the trade that was the source of their wealth .
With the arrival of Islam in the seventh century , the region where asafoetida grew came to be part of the Abbasid Empire ’s Persian territories .
Under the Abbasid caliphs , their capital , Baghdad , developed a cosmopolitan court culture .
An emerging appreciation of haute cuisine led to a raft of Arabic cookbooks .
Best known today is the encyclopedic Kitab al - Tabikh ( The Book of Recipes ) , dating from the 10th century .
Covering everything from condiments to stews , yogurt - based dishes and sweets ( along with a chapter on vegetarian entrees ) , the recipes make use of all parts of the asafoetida plant .
The resin ( al - hiltit ) and root ( al - mahrut ) are occasionally listed as ingredients , but it is the plant ’s leaves ( al - anjudhan ) that seem to have been most popular in Abbasid cuisine :
There is an entire chapter devoted to asafoetida - leaf stews ( anjudhaniyya ) , such as the following :
“ Cut meat into thin slices and chop onion and fresh herbs .
Put them in a pot and add to them olive oil of excellent quality .
When the pot boils and the meat browns , add black pepper , cumin , caraway seeds and a little liquid fermented sauce .
Add to the pot crushed asafoetida leaves , as much as needed .
Break eggs on the meat and let it simmer for as long as it needs , God willing . ”
Asafoetida also appears in kebabs marinated in the ground leaves , along with a vinegar–caraway –asafoetida - leaf dipping sauce , and in a recipe for dried salt fish .
By the mid-13th century , the Mongols had toppled the Abbasids .
Their unified rule , the pax Mongolica , guaranteed the relative safety of traders along the Silk Roads .
Although there is little evidence that medieval Europeans inherited the Roman use of asafoetida in cooking , it was certainly imported , via Venice , to apothecaries and druggists .
It is probably at around this time that the modern word asafoetida was coined by Italian merchants .
few centuries later , the rise of the Mughal Empire in India opened another trade route to another market .
Indian food historian S. N. Mahindru points out that , between 1628 and 1658 , during Shah Jahan ’s rule , “ the export trade attained great heights and was diversified .
Turmeric , asafoetida and other drugs were the new merchandise that accompanied the earlier exports of pepper , poppy - seed and saffron . ”
In Agra and Delhi , court singers reportedly ate asafoetida to improve their voices :
They would wake before dawn , eat a spoonful of it with butter , and go down to the banks of the river to practice their art at sunrise .
At that same time , one of the most astute observers of asafoetida ’s use in India was Garcia da Orta , physician to the Portuguese governor of Goa for 30 years .
A diligent student of botanical medicine , da Orta studied with Indian physicians and yogis as well as with traders who passed through Goa .
In Colloquies on the Simples and Drugs of India ( 1563 ) , called “ the first scientific book on oriental spices published in the western world , ” da Orta says :
“ You must know that the thing most used throughout India , and in all parts of it , is that Assafetida , as well for medicine as in cookery .
A great quantity is used , for every Gentio [ Hindu ] who is able to get the means of buying it will buy it to flavor his food ....
These [ people ] flavor the vegetables they eat with it , first rubbing the pan with it , and then using it as seasoning with everything they eat .
All the other Gentios who can get it eat it , and laborers who , having nothing more to eat than bread and onions , can only eat it when they feel a great need for it . ”
Although da Orta was also honest enough to admit that asafoetida had “ the nastiest smell in the world for me , ” he was also wise enough to observe , “ The truth is that there is a good deal of habit in the matter of smells . ”
As for me , I still have n’t gotten used to the odor of the raw resin , although the promise of its almost buttery scent when cooked keeps me coming back to it .
I still keep it double - wrapped , inside a plastic tub , on the shelf .

The disappearance of silphium , around the first century , from Cyrenaica , the promontory of eastern Libya that juts out into the Mediterranean , remains a botanical mystery .
By all ancient accounts , the plant grew only there , in the hills and meadows rising from the coastal plain to Jabal al - Akhdar ( Green Mountain ) .
Behind the mountain , in 630 BC , Greek colonists founded Cyrene , the city - state that grew rich on its monopoly of silphium .
KYLIX : BIBLIOTHEQUE NATIONALE / ARCHIVES CHARMET / BRIDGEMAN ART LIBRARY
Silphium had long been known to the local Amazigh ( Berber ) peoples of the region , and carvings and pictographs uncovered in Knossos , on Crete , suggest it was also known to the Minoans , probably as a trade good , as early as the second millennium bc .
From the Greek nature writer Theophrastus , we know that silphium gum was collected much the same way asafoetida is collected today — by making incisions in the root or lower stalk and gathering the exuded gum .
Like the Greeks , the Romans too prized Cyrenian silphium , although it was clearly becoming a rare commodity .
In an attempt to halt the decline , Rome had declared silphium an imperial monopoly , but by the end of the first century the science writer Pliny the Elder declared : “ For these many years past , however , it has not been found in Cyrenaica , as the farmers of the revenue , who hold the lands there on lease , have a notion that it is more profitable to depasture flocks of sheep upon them .
Within the memory of the present generation , a single stalk is all that has ever been found there , and that was sent as a curiosity to the Emperor Nero . ” CLASSICAL NUMISMATIC GROUP , INC / WWW .

Romans craved silphium not only for its flavor .
Historian John M. Riddle , author of Eve ’s Herbs ( 1997 , Harvard ) , cites another reason : “ anecdotal and medical evidence from classical antiquity tell us that the drug of choice for contraception was silphium . ”
In an article with J. Worth Estes in American Scientist , Riddle argues that women in the ancient world regulated conception with drugs , and that this may even have been the most important use of silphium and the reason for its great value : “ Silphium ’s sap may have been the ancient world ’s most effective antifertility drug . ”
In recent laboratory experiments , their article claims , some asafoetidas have inhibited conception in rodents .
The shape of the silphium seeds , which we know only from their depiction on Cyrene ’s coins , reinforces this link to fertility :
The seeds were distinctly heart - shaped — the same heart shape we see in modern western culture associated with romantic love , despite its lack of resemblance to the anatomical human heart .
Thus , some researchers have speculated that this symbol of romance derives from the silphium seed .
One of our most important sources on Roman cuisine is a cookbook from the late Roman Empire titled De Re Coquinaria ( On Cookery ) .
Many of its recipes call for silphium as a base seasoning ( see “ Parthian Chicken , ” page 41 ) , and it includes instructions on “ How to make one ounce of silphium last indefinitely . ”
( Store it in a closed jar with pine nuts , which absorb the flavor .
Use and replenish the pine nuts , keep the silphium . )
By then , Roman cooks must already have been using asafoetida as a substitute .
Yet there are tantalizing hints that Cyrenian silphium in fact survived .
For example , there is a letter written by the Christian bishop of Cyrene in the fifth century in which he thanks his brother for the silphium cuttings sent from his garden .
Some scholars have proposed that Ferula tingitana , a relative of Ferula assafoetida that grows wild across North Africa , the Levant and the Iberian Peninsula , is in fact silphium .
( Cyrenian silphium is unrelated to the modern plant genus Silphium , which includes more than 400 species , mostly in North America . )
However , in the early 1990 ’s , Italian archeologist Antonio Manunta of the University of Rome found in Cyrenaica specimens of Cachrys ferulacea , which grows wild from Sardinia to Uzbekistan .
Bedouin in Cyrenaica believed it to be the same as silphium , based on the images on Cyrenian coins , and they took Manunta to a valley with abundant Cachrys ferulacea in the exact areas where silphium once flourished .
Additionally , the oil from the seeds has a pleasant smell , which matches Dioscorides ’ statement that Libyan silphium did n’t have the strong odor of asafoetida .
But for Manunta , the strongest piece of evidence was the seed :
Of all the seeds of plants hypothesized to be silphium ’s descendants , it ’s the only seed that is heart - shaped .
Today at E3 , I finally got my hands on Sony ’s hot new PSP revision , and to sum it up on one word would be WOW .
Admittedly , when I first heard that the PSP
Go would be launching for the steep price of $ 249.99 , I decided that it was n’t worth it .
Once I got to hold it in my hands , I quickly changed my mind .
The unit itself , is a tech lover ’s wet dream .
The look and feel is exactly what you would expect from the brand that is ‘ like.no.other ’ .
It ’s so lightweight it almost feels fake , and that was even with the metal tether that was there making sure no one made off with the device .
Sadly , that same metal tether prevented the unit ’s “ sliding screen ” from being slide back and fourth , but from what we have seen it looks like it ’s smooth , and clicks in place nicely .
When the device is open , it gives the appearance that it ’s much slimmer than it really is , and fits perfectly comfortable in your hands .
The buttons are responsive , and the analog nub has noticeably more range .
However , it ’s offset to the right of the d-pad , making it feel a bit awkward at first .
Although I am sure it ’s something you would get used to over time .
The screen itself is bright , and even with the screen being smaller than the original PSP , it ’s not noticeable enough to cause any grief .
The casing , as well as the screen still has that shiny finish .
Looks great , but it ’s the same material as the original PSP , and the PS3 that is notorious for smudging and fingerprints .
So bad , that I felt the urge to wipe the screen on my PlayStation LifeStyle staff T - Shirt .
Then again , there were so many different hands on the PSP Go , that it was bound to pick up more fingerprints than normal .
We got to play LittleBigPlanet , and Gran Turismo on it , and both look incredible .
We ’ll have hands on impressions up on those two titles and many more PSP games a little bit later .
Mumbai , India
ON Thursday morning , my neighbors and I joined an orderly line in front of the election desk at the end of our street .
We did what the public - service ads had been urging us to do for weeks : “ Give them the finger . ”
The polling officer did n’t even raise her head .
After dipping a plastic straw into a bottle of purple ink , she drew a blotchy line down the middle finger of my left hand .
Then I stepped up to the voting machine to press a button in India ’s 15th general election .
The scene was repeating itself across Mumbai .
At another polling station , I saw Bollywood B - listers happily show off their ink -smeared digits to TV cameras .
A practice that had originally been instituted to ward off electoral scams like ballot - box stuffing ( we call it “ booth capturing ” ) was transformed into a proud reaffirmation of faith in Indian democracy .
In the weeks leading up to this election , the ink smearing became a source of inspiration for a barrage of pun-studded campaigns aimed at getting normally apathetic middle - class Indians to fulfill their civic responsibility .
The election  with more than 714 million voters  was also a fantastic advertising opportunity .
An automobile parts company ran an ad of a finger imprinted with an ink mark in the shape of a car battery .
“ Vote for a trouble - free five - year term , ” was its message .
A purveyor of tea , India ’s pick - me - up , declared : “ If you continue sleeping , so will our politicians .
Wake up and vote ! ”

On Thursday , many Indians ignored that advice .
Turnout was sluggish across the city , but the figures were especially disappointing in affluent South Mumbai , which had been a particular focus of the get - out - the - vote effort .
Only 43.3 percent of eligible voters in the area exercised their franchise , but that was n’t much of a surprise .
Rich Indians have long known that they command more powerful means to influence politicians than votes .
Mr. Nadelmann , a boomer himself at 52 , says the biggest difference since the last legalization push , in the late 1970s , is the drug savvy of parents now versus then .
“ In the ’70s , that older generation of parents did n’t know the difference between marijuana and heroin , ” Mr. Nadelmann said .
“ This generation of boomer parents has a high familiarity with marijuana .
An awful lot tried it , liked it ; the vast number never went on to cocaine or heroin or even had a problem with marijuana . ”
That would be me .
The 20 - something me used marijuana in moderation , did not fall victim to reefer madness , did not go on to harder drugs , believed it to be a drug superior to alcohol in many respects , enjoyed it like the mayor , and inhaled like the president .
The 20 - something me preferred alcohol when socializing in large groups but pot for coupling .
The 20 - something me smoked a joint , then went to the Central Square Cinema in Cambridge , Mass. , and howled at the 1936 anti-drug documentary “ Reefer Madness , ” which showed how pot -smoking could lead to hard drugs , murder , suicide , rape and the inevitable descent into insanity .
( Afterward , the 20 - something me had major munchies and hurried to Elsie ’s restaurant for the enormous roast beef sandwich special . )
The 20 - something me believes marijuana could be legalized , regulated and taxed like alcohol , providing much needed revenue .
But the 50 - something me , the parent of three boys and a girl , ages 14 to 21 , is not so sure .
The 50 - something me  who has n’t smoked in more than 20 years  knows stories in our little suburb about classmates of my kids smoking pot in middle school , using heroin in college , going into rehab , relapsing , trying again .
The 50 - something me has seen the eyes of those boomer parents  good people  seen the weariness and fear , and thought , “ There but for the grace of God . ... ”
Recently I read David Sheff ’s best seller , “ Beautiful Boy , ” about his son Nic ’s addiction to methamphetamines , the boy ’s myriad rounds of rehab and repeated heartbreaking relapses .
And while the problem drug in our house is legal ( our boys went through numerous rounds of painful , nerve - racking alcohol - related groundings during high school ) , I was surprised by how much Mr. Sheff ’s book moved and frightened me as a parent .
By George Friedman
In 1979 , when we were still young and starry - eyed , a revolution took place in Iran .
When I asked experts what would happen , they divided into two camps .
The first group of Iran experts argued that the Shah of Iran would certainly survive , that the unrest was simply a cyclical event readily manageable by his security , and that the Iranian people were united behind the Iranian monarch 's modernization program .
These experts developed this view by talking to the same Iranian officials and businessmen they had been talking to for years —
Iranians who had grown wealthy and powerful under the shah and who spoke English , since Iran experts frequently did n't speak Farsi all that well .
The second group of Iran experts regarded the shah as a repressive brute , and saw the revolution as aimed at liberalizing the country .
Their sources were the professionals and academics who supported the uprising — Iranians who knew what former Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini believed , but did n't think he had much popular support .
They thought the revolution would result in an increase in human rights and liberty .
The experts in this group spoke even less Farsi than those in the first group .
Misreading Sentiment in Iran Limited to information on Iran from English - speaking opponents of the regime , both groups of Iran experts got a very misleading vision of where the revolution was heading — because the Iranian revolution was not brought about by the people who spoke English .
It was made by merchants in city bazaars , by rural peasants , by the clergy — people Americans did n't speak to because they could n't .
This demographic was unsure of the virtues of modernization and not at all clear on the virtues of liberalism .
From the time they were born , its members knew the virtue of Islam , and that the Iranian state must be an Islamic state .
Americans and Europeans have been misreading Iran for 30 years .
Even after the shah fell , the myth has survived that a mass movement of people exists demanding liberalization — a movement that if encouraged by the West eventually would form a majority and rule the country .
We call this outlook " iPod liberalism , " the idea that anyone who listens to rock ' n ' roll on an iPod , writes blogs and knows what it means to Twitter must be an enthusiastic supporter of Western liberalism .
Even more significantly , this outlook fails to recognize that iPod owners represent a small minority in Iran — a country that is poor , pious and content on the whole with the revolution forged 30 years ago .
There are undoubtedly people who want to liberalize the Iranian regime .
They are to be found among the professional classes in Tehran , as well as among students .
Many speak English , making them accessible to the touring journalists , diplomats and intelligence people who pass through .
They are the ones who can speak to Westerners , and they are the ones willing to speak to Westerners .
And these people give Westerners a wildly distorted view of Iran .
They can create the impression that a fantastic liberalization is at hand — but not when you realize that iPod - owning Anglophones are not exactly the majority in Iran .
Last Friday , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected with about two - thirds of the vote .
Supporters of his opponent , both inside and outside Iran , were stunned .
A poll revealed that former Iranian Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi was beating Ahmadinejad .
It is , of course , interesting to meditate on how you could conduct a poll in a country where phones are not universal , and making a call once you have found a phone can be a trial .
A poll therefore would probably reach people who had phones and lived in Tehran and other urban areas .
Among those , Mousavi probably did win .
But outside Tehran , and beyond persons easy to poll , the numbers turned out quite different .
Some still charge that Ahmadinejad cheated .
That is certainly a possibility , but it is difficult to see how he could have stolen the election by such a large margin .
Doing so would have required the involvement of an incredible number of people , and would have risked creating numbers that quite plainly did not jibe with sentiment in each precinct .
Widespread fraud would mean that Ahmadinejad manufactured numbers in Tehran without any regard for the vote .
But he has many powerful enemies who would quickly have spotted this and would have called him on it .
Mousavi still insists he was robbed , and we must remain open to the possibility that he was , although it is hard to see the mechanics of this .
Ahmadinejad 's Popularity
It also misses a crucial point : Ahmadinejad enjoys widespread popularity .
He does n't speak to the issues that matter to the urban professionals , namely , the economy and liberalization .
But Ahmadinejad speaks to three fundamental issues that accord with the rest of the country .
First , Ahmadinejad speaks of piety .
Among vast swathes of Iranian society , the willingness to speak unaffectedly about religion is crucial .
Though it may be difficult for Americans and Europeans to believe , there are people in the world to whom economic progress is not of the essence ; people who want to maintain their communities as they are and live the way their grandparents lived .
These are people who see modernization — whether from the shah or Mousavi — as unattractive .
They forgive Ahmadinejad his economic failures .
Second , Ahmadinejad speaks of corruption .
There is a sense in the countryside that the ayatollahs — who enjoy enormous wealth and power , and often have lifestyles that reflect this — have corrupted the Islamic Revolution .
Ahmadinejad is disliked by many of the religious elite precisely because he has systematically raised the corruption issue , which resonates in the countryside .
Third , Ahmadinejad is a spokesman for Iranian national security , a tremendously popular stance .
It must always be remembered that Iran fought a war with Iraq in the 1980s that lasted eight years , cost untold lives and suffering , and effectively ended in its defeat .
Iranians , particularly the poor , experienced this war on an intimate level .
They fought in the war , and lost husbands and sons in it .
As in other countries , memories of a lost war do n't necessarily delegitimize the regime .
Rather , they can generate hopes for a resurgent Iran , thus validating the sacrifices made in that war — something Ahmadinejad taps into .
By arguing that Iran should not back down but become a major power , he speaks to the veterans and their families , who want something positive to emerge from all their sacrifices in the war .
Perhaps the greatest factor in Ahmadinejad 's favor is that Mousavi spoke for the better districts of Tehran — something akin to running a U.S. presidential election as a spokesman for Georgetown and the Upper East Side .
Such a base will get you hammered , and Mousavi got hammered .
Fraud or not , Ahmadinejad won and he won significantly .
That he won is not the mystery ; the mystery is why others thought he would n't win .
For a time on Friday , it seemed that Mousavi might be able to call for an uprising in Tehran .
But the moment passed when Ahmadinejad 's security forces on motorcycles intervened .
And that leaves the West with its worst - case scenario : a democratically elected anti-liberal .
Western democracies assume that publics will elect liberals who will protect their rights .
In reality , it 's a more complicated world .
Hitler is the classic example of someone who came to power constitutionally , and then proceeded to gut the constitution .
Similarly , Ahmadinejad 's victory is a triumph of both democracy and repression .
The Road Ahead : More of the Same
The question now is what will happen next .
Internally , we can expect Ahmadinejad to consolidate his position under the cover of anti-corruption .
He wants to clean up the ayatollahs , many of whom are his enemies .
He will need the support of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
This election has made Ahmadinejad a powerful president , perhaps the most powerful in Iran since the revolution .
Ahmadinejad does not want to challenge Khamenei , and we suspect that Khamenei will not want to challenge Ahmadinejad .
A forced marriage is emerging , one which may place many other religious leaders in a difficult position .
Certainly , hopes that a new political leadership would cut back on Iran 's nuclear program have been dashed .
The champion of that program has won , in part because he championed the program .
We still see Iran as far from developing a deliverable nuclear weapon , but certainly the Obama administration 's hopes that Ahmadinejad would either be replaced — or at least weakened and forced to be more conciliatory — have been crushed .
Interestingly , Ahmadinejad sent congratulations to U.S. President Barack Obama on his inauguration .
We would expect Obama to reciprocate under his opening policy , which U.S. Vice President Joe Biden appears to have affirmed , assuming he was speaking for Obama .
Once the vote fraud issue settles , we will have a better idea of whether Obama 's policies will continue .
( We expect they will . )
What we have now are two presidents in a politically secure position , something that normally forms a basis for negotiations .
The problem is that it is not clear what the Iranians are prepared to negotiate on , nor is it clear what the Americans are prepared to give the Iranians to induce them to negotiate .
Iran wants greater influence in Iraq and its role as a regional leader acknowledged , something the United States does n't want to give them .
The United States wants an end to the Iranian nuclear program , which Iran does n't want to give .
On the surface , this would seem to open the door for an attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities .
Former U.S. President George W. Bush did not — and Obama does not — have any appetite for such an attack .
Both presidents blocked the Israelis from attacking , assuming the Israelis ever actually wanted to attack .
For the moment , the election appears to have frozen the status quo in place .
Neither the United States nor Iran seem prepared to move significantly , and there are no third parties that want to get involved in the issue beyond the occasional European diplomatic mission or Russian threat to sell something to Iran .
In the end , this shows what we have long known :
This game is locked in place , and goes on .
One of the biggest problems with open source is understanding what it means out in the real world .
I 'm not talking about understanding the actual technology .
I 'm talking about the impact of open source .
How open source is actually useful .
What 's clear to me is that open source is not an end in itself .
Open source is an enabler .
It 's a catalyst .
It allows other things to happen .
It 's the fulcrum upon which can be rested the lever that will move the world .
But it is n't the lever itself .
Open source cannot change the status quo on its own , and of itself .
This has become entirely clear now , after 10 years of hype leading to effectively the exact same situation as when we started .
No , open source needs to be combined with something else , and that 's usually a technology .
That technology can be the Web , in the case of Mozilla , or a hardware platform , in the case of the recent netbook revolution .
Below I look at some of the biggest challenges to the current computing status quo .
In each and every case , open source is playing a part .
It 's only now , around ten years after the open source revolution was supposed to have begun , that we 're actually seeing things really begin to happen .
In the examples below , it is n't the case that people make a choice to use open source .
It 's more the case that open source is the only choice because only open source offers what 's needed .
Online Applications
Microsoft has a problem , and it's this :
Its entire business model is built around discrete computers running discrete applications .
Microsoft fell into this business model more by luck than anything else , but it 's served them well .
What if there 's a move away from this model towards freely - accessible online applications ?
How can a company whose revenue comes almost entirely from licensing fees live in a world where there are no licensing fees to collect ?
How can a company feasibly charge $ 50 - $ 250 for an operating system in a world where an operating system 's primary task is an extremely simple one : to let users get online so they can access their data ?
The key thing about online applications is that they are platform agnostic .
Google Docs works just as well on a Windows PC as it does on a Mac or a Linux box .
And I 'll bet that a number of people have it working on their Amiga computers too .
I access Google Docs on my Nokia N800 handheld - - a hardware platform that Microsoft would never touch because it runs Linux , but which is otherwise unserved by office applications .
Put simply , we 're getting to a stage in the evolution of computing where Microsoft 's role in the scheme of things is shrinking .
Bizarrely , Microsoft just do n't seem to have realised .
Perhaps they 're like the archetypal oil tanker -- so big and unwieldy that they 're simply unable to turn around .
People might still choose to use Microsoft , of course .
Old loyalties die hard .
But the nature of Microsoft 's business model has always been to tie the user to a post , and force - feed them products .
Now that tether has been broken .
Is n't that liberating ?
Open source does n't require licensing fees , and is like a double - jointed Russian gymnast :
It 's flexible .
Really flexible .
This puts it in a far better position to provide a platform for the new platform agnostic online world .
Chrome ( technically Google Chromium ) is open source because it makes no sense for Google to lock - down software to one hardware platform or architecture .
The platform no longer matters in the Google universe , and this perhaps is the biggest difference between the Microsoft and Google philosophies .
Microsoft needs you to keep you using Windows and an x86 platform .
Google do n't care what computer or platform you use , and is actively encouraging you to be eclectic in your choice .
Microsoft 's approach is all about restriction .
Google 's approach is all about freedom .
I know which approach sounds healthiest to me .
Esoteric Architectures
Microsoft has a problem , and it's this : Virtually its entire business model is based on the x86 platform .
It climbed into bed with Intel back in the day , again mostly by accident , but has steadfastly refused to climb out again , even though the bed clothes are smelling a bit musty .
There was a brief flirtation with getting NT to work on alternative chips a few years ago , but that pretty much came to nothing .
And Microsoft is prepared to use other platforms in its specialist divisions , such as handheld computers and games consoles .
But its core desktop and server businesses are most definitely x86 .
It 's a winning formula .
Why change it ?
Here 's why : the incredibly rampant world of mobile phones and PDAs has lead to a variety of low - powered chips that are making their way into the likes of netbooks .
And it 's not hard to see how these chips could migrate upwards to all kinds of computing devices .
ARM seems to be the king of this particular empire , and their chips promise insanely long battery life of 8 hours or more , yet with the same features and performance as regular chips ( including hi - def video ) .
Netbooks based on ARM chips use significantly less power , and are smaller , and quieter because they lack a fan ( low power = less heat ) .
There 's a powerful environmental argument to be made too .
Given the choice between a computer that uses 10 watts , and one that uses 200 , which would you choose ?
While America has long - been slow to wake - up to environmental questions such as this , for the rest of the world the answer is a no-brainer .
Speaking as somebody who lives in Europe , where energy bills are high , I 'll probably never buy a desktop computer again .
With power supplies now typically pushing 500 - 1000 watts , they simply use too much juice .
A notebook computer uses just a fraction of that power , and one of these new ARM - based netbooks will use so little power that it 's practically negligible .
Now , it 's no - doubt possible for Windows to run on ARM , which is after all a completely different architecture compared to x86 .
Microsoft certainly has the engineering expertise to make it happen .
But it would be like converting a petrol engine to run on diesel .
It 's possible , but a little pointless .
After all the hard work is completed you may be wondering why you even bothered .
It 's not just Windows that would have be converted , of course -- short of creating a messy emulation layer that probably would n't work well on these slower processors , key applications such as Office would also need to be ported too .
Linux run on ARM for years .
That 's the nature of Linux .
It is n't locked down , either philosophically or practically .
So when the manufacturers of the new ARM - based notebooks look for an operating system , there was virtually only one choice ( Windows CE is a possibility but that 's too strongly associated with restricted - functionality mobile devices ) .
In a weird kind of way , Linux has almost a virtual monopoly in the non-x86 marketplace .
Microsoft simply are n't there .
Google
Microsoft has a problem , and it's this : Google .
This is a battle for silverback supremacy in the jungle because , in reality , the two companies can easily exist alongside each other and be extremely healthy doing so .
But this town simply ain't big enough for the two of them .
Google has always been an open source company .
Its search engine has run on Linux since day one , and when it was looking for a platform on which to build its Android mobile operating system , it did n't hesitate in choosing Linux ( imagine how unthinkable it would be had Google decided that it would use Windows CE instead ; such a decision would have been greeted with hoots of laughter ) .
Google has also made efforts to support Linux with its desktop products , such as Google Earth ( even if the products themselves are n't open source ) .
There 's little doubt that , should Google launch any further software products or platforms in future , there 's a strong chance they 'll be open source .
In many key ways , Google uses open source as a weapon with which to beat Microsoft over the head .
Google uses open source to define itself , and thereby illustrate the difference between itself and fuddy - duddy Microsoft ( a trick also used by Apple , at least a few years ago ) .
The Google people also know how much open source irritates Microsoft and how using open source destroys Microsoft 's traditional " fear , uncertainty and doubt " ( FUD ) approach to discrediting open source .
The next time somebody asks you what Linux ever did for anybody , point out that the Google search they just did was facilitated by it .

IS A supervolcano brewing beneath Mount St Helens ?
Peering under the volcano has revealed what may be an extraordinarily large zone of semi-molten rock , which would be capable of feeding a giant eruption .
Magma can be detected with a technique called magnetotellurics , which builds up a picture of what lies underground by measuring fluctuations in electric and magnetic fields at the surface .
The fields fluctuate in response to electric currents travelling below the surface , induced by lightning storms …
_ Contracts worth $ 9 million were approved for four educational management organizations ( EMOs ) to continue providing services to 16 schools for one year .
Two of the EMOs - Foundations Inc. and Victory Schools - also received two - year contracts to continue working with Martin Luther King High and E.W. Rhodes High , respectively .
The other EMOs are EdisonLearning and Universal Companies .
The district plans to spend the next year working with the EMOs to overhaul how the companies provide services to schools .

I ’m excited to get my hands on the newest iteration of everyone ’s favorite NFL video game – Madden NFL 10 .
I have added the release date to my calendar ( and getting psyched for the early August PSN demo ) .
I have dreamed of this year ’s release , excited that a sports game that I really enjoy will include trophies .
There ’s only one thing I ’m having a hard time grasping – the controls .
I ’ll admit that I took two years off from the franchise ( I was just that bitter about the E3 announcement that Madden NFL 08 would only be 30 fps on PS3 , but 60 fps on Xbox 360 ) .
And now after being out of the game for so long , it ’s not going to be easy to sort out all of the intricacies with the control scheme .
As EA Sports strives for more realism and expanded gameplay , they are running out of places to put the controls for it !
It seems like too much is being stuffed into one place – the right analog stick ( er , ONLY analog stick for PSP ) .
This year we will find yet another new “ stick ” feature under our thumbs .
Wait , how many sticks does that make now ?
Madden NFL 04 introduced the Playmaker stick to make pre-snap route adjustments
stick to make pre-snap route adjustments Madden NFL 05 added the Hit Stick on defense for big fumble - inducing , stick - flickin’ hits
on defense for big fumble - inducing , stick - flickin’ hits Madden NFL 06 brought us the Truck Stick which was basically an improved Hit Stick but for offense .
Also new was QB Vision ( using right analog ) for precise cone - lit passing
which was basically an improved Hit Stick but for offense .
Also new was QB Vision ( using right analog ) for precise cone - lit passing Madden NFL 07 delivered with the Highlight Stick , a refined Truck Stick with more finesse
, a refined Truck Stick with more finesse Madden NFL 08 and 09 did n’t have any new right analog functionality but I did n’t buy them ( did you already forget ? ! )
Madden NFL 10 picks back up with the QB Avoidance Stick which you use to avoid pressure in the pocket .
As our friends at PastaPadre describe , “ By hitting the right analog stick the QB will make a quick move .
Push up and he ’ll step up in the pocket , right to shift right , and left to shift left . ”
I probably missed a few right analog controls in there ( feel free to add them in the comments ) , but I think the continuously expanding controls create a serious barrier - to - entry that intimidates new players to the franchise .
What do you guys think ?
Does anyone else have friends that wo n’t buy Madden because it ’s just “ too late ” for them to start learning ?
Oh and while I ’m here – please , EA Sports , stop branding every new game engine enhancement as its own technology !
Last year it was Madden IQ , the Adaptive Difficulty Engine ( ADE ) , EA Sports BackTrack , EA Sports Rewind , and the all - new Total Control Animation System .
This year it ’s EA Sports Pro-Tak , Adaptive AI , Procedural Awareness , Madden NFL Your Way , and the aforementioned QB Avoidance Stick .
While internally I ’m glad the team is refining the game , each year these buzz words make it seem like the game is completely reinvented when much stays the same ( if it ai n’t broke , do n’t fix it ) .
If you want a real insider ’s look into the behind - the - scenes technology in the game , I recommend reading the posts from Sr. Producer Ian Cummings at the Madden Blog and ignore the marketing mumbo jumbo .
Education really does pay .
An overwhelming number of schools participating in a controversial program that pays kids for good grades saw huge boosts — up to nearly 40 percentage points higher — in reading and math scores this year , a Post analysis found .
MIKE’S CONTROL IS A ‘GIFT ’ FOR STAR STUDENTS
THE CLASSES ARE CLASSIC AT BROOKLYN LATIN
PHOTOS : NYC STUDENTS CASH IN
About two - thirds of the 59 high - poverty schools in the Sparks program — which pays seventh - graders up to $ 500 and fourth - graders as much as $ 250 for their performance on a total of 10 assessments — improved their scores since last year ’s state tests by margins above the citywide average .
The gains at some schools approached 40 percentage points .
For example , at PS 188 on the Lower East Side , 76 percent of fourth - graders met or exceeded state benchmarks in English — 39.6 percentage points higher than last year , when the kids were in third grade .
At MS 343 in The Bronx , 94 percent of seventh - graders met or surpassed state standards in math this year — 37.3 points higher than last year , when the students were sixth - graders .
In all , of the 61 fourth and seventh grades involved in the pupil - pay program , only 16 improved less than the citywide average gain in math since last year , while 21 did so in reading .
Principals at the highest - scoring schools cautioned that the Sparks program was just one of many factors in the test - score jumps .
But many reported seeing indisputable academic benefits — including more motivation , better focus and an increase in healthy competition for good grades among students .
“ It ’s an ego booster in terms of self - worth , ” said Rose Marie Mills , principal at MS 343 in Mott Haven , where nearly 90 percent of students qualify for federal poverty aid .
“ When they get the checks , there ’s that competitiveness — ‘ Oh , I ’m going to get more money than you next time ’ — so it ’s something that excites them . ”
More than 8,000 kids have collectively earned $ 1.25 million since September in the second year of the privately funded pilot program .
The higher the kids score on tests , the more they get paid : up to a maximum of $ 50 per test for seventh - graders and up to $ 25 for fourth - graders .
The initiative , created by Harvard University economist Roland Fryer , is run out of the Cambridge , Mass . - based Educational Innovation Laboratory ( EdLabs ) , which is conducting similar cash - for - kids trials in Chicago and Washington , DC .
Critics argue that paying kids corrupts the notion of learning for education ’s sake alone .
But supporters of student incentives say immediate rewards are necessary to help some kids connect the dots between school and future income — and the students agree .
Alize Cancel , a 13 - year - old at IS 286 , spent some of the $ 180 she has earned this year on school supplies and shoes .
“ It ’s all we talk about .
Every day we ask our teachers , ‘ Did we pass ?
When do we get paid ? ’ ” she said .
“ It made me study more because I was getting paid . ”
City Department of Education officials said it was too early to evaluate the program ’s results .
A spokeswoman for EdLabs said the group was hoping to release a study this fall that looks at individual student improvements rather than gains across an entire grade .

Can military machines be programmed with a conscience ?
( Image : Robert Nickelsberg / Getty )
Technology has always distanced the soldiers who use weapons from the people who get hit .
But robotics engineer Ron Arkin at the Georgia Institute of Technology , Atlanta , is working to imagine wars in which weapons make their own decisions about wielding lethal force .
He is particularly interested in how such machines might be programmed to act ethically , obeying the rules of engagement .
Arkin has developed an “ ethical governor ” , which aims to ensure that robot attack aircraft behave ethically in combat , and is demonstrating the system in simulations based on recent campaigns by US troops , using real maps from the Middle East .

Virtual battlefield
In one scenario , modelled on a situation encountered by US forces in Afganistan in 2006 , the drone identifies a group of Taliban soldiers inside a defined “ kill zone ” .
But the drone does n’t fire .
Its maps indicate that the group is inside a cemetery , so opening fire would breach international law .
In another scenario , the drone identifies an enemy vehicle convoy close to a hospital .
Here the ethical governor only allows fire that will damage the vehicles without harming the hospital .
Arkin has also built in a “ guilt ” system which , if a serious error is made , forces a drone to start behaving more cautiously .
You can see videos of these simulations on Arkin ’s website .
In developing the software , he drew on studies of military ethics , as well as discussions with military personnel , and says his aim is to reduce non-combatant casualties .
One Vietnam veteran told him of soldiers shooting at anything that moved in some situations .
“ I can easily make a robot do that today , but instead we should be thinking about how to make them perform better than that , ” Arkin says .
Complex scenarios
Simulations are a powerful way to imagine one possible version of the future of combat , says Illah Nourbakhsh , a roboticist at Carnegie Mellon University , Pittsburgh , US .
But they gloss over the complexities of getting robots to understand the world well enough to make such judgements , he says ; something unlikely to be possible for decades .
Arkin stresses that his research , funded by the US army , is not designed to develop prototypes for future battlefield use .
“ The most important outcome of my research is not the architecture , but the discussion that it stimulates . ”
However , he maintains that the development of machines that decide how to use lethal force is inevitable , making it important that when such robots do arrive they can be trusted .
“ These ideas will not be used tomorrow , but in the war after next , and in very constrained situations . ”
Public debate
Roboticist Noel Sharkey at Sheffield University , UK , campaigns for greater public discussion about the use of automating in war .
“ I agree with Ron that autonomous robot fighting machine look like an inevitability in the near future , ” he told New Scientist .
Arkin ’s work shows the inadequacy of our existing technology at dealing with the complex moral environment of a battlefield , says Sharkey .
“ Robots do n’t get angry or seek revenge but they do n’t have sympathy or empathy either , ” he says .
“ Strict rules require an absolutist view of ethics , rather than a human understanding of different circumstances and their consequences . ”
Yet in some circumstances , a strict rule - based approach is valuable .
The Georgia Tech group has also made a system that advises a soldier of the ethical constraints on a mission as they program it into an autonomous drone .
That kind of tool could see practical use much sooner , says Nourbakhsh : “ Similar systems exist to help doctors understand the medical ethics of treatments . ”
Arkin will discuss his latest results at the AUVSI Unmanned Systems conference in Washington , DC , in August
Two years ago I fell down my stairs at home .
I wound up in a crumpled heap in excruciating pain on my side and in both feet .
I live alone and my neighbors did n't hear me calling for help .
My side was killing me , especially when I inhaled .
I suspected I had broken a rib .
By sight it was obvious I had broken several toes .
This is what I was thinking : " I just got a job contract after being out of work for a month .
I have $ 300 to last me to my next paycheck .
I can't afford to call 911 ( you have to pay the city yourself for the service if you do n't have insurance ) .
If I have a broken rib , all the doctors will do is bind it up and give me painkillers .
The same thing for the toes . "
So I taped my toes , hobbled to my car , and bought a back - support belt on the way to work .
I worked for 3 days with only aspirin for the pain .
The weekend came and , after being in bed for two days , on Sunday evening I realized I would n't be able to cope the next day if I did n't have better pain management , so I hobbled to the emergency room with my last $ 300 .
X -rays confirmed that I had a broken rib and three broken toes .
The brisk nurse practicioner was suddenly more sympathetic to my whimpering , saying that she had seen doctors inject themselves right into the rib fracture with Lidocaine because broken ribs are so painful .
I was given a real painkiller , and had my waist and toes taped .
I also was told to stay home from work for one week , but unfortunately that was a luxury I could n't afford .
At least I had the painkiller and I did n't miss any work .
My rib and toes healed in about 6 weeks , so I got off easier than a lot of people like me who do n't have health insurance .
Insurance is a simple concept : if a specific activity or situation that a group of people have in common carries some risk , that group can choose to spread the risk among themselves to minimize individual financial disaster .
Insurance is a collective choice which today thrives in different formats , including self - insurance .
What conservatives are trying to deny the American people is the opportunity to self - insure our health care by spreading the risk among all Americans through taxes .
Why is self - insurance ok for corporations but not for us ?
It 's obvious that the most efficent , most fair , and least expensive way to accomplish universal coverage is by having one group of insureds and spreading the risk among everyone in that group , rather than having innumerable private insurance companies fight each other for healthy members , and fight claims by the sick members they are stuck with .
All that fighting takes money , you know ?
Everyone has heard of supply and demand behavior - supply goes up , demand goes down , costs come down .
Demand goes up , supply goes down , costs go up .
Well , what happens when there is universal demand , like with health care insurance ?
Friedman and Reagan were wrong in many ways , one of which is relevant here : when the widget is a necessity , like electricity or roads or health care , free market competition alone will not reduce costs .
Instead , the fact that there is universal demand ( by definition with necessities ) will cause costs to go up .
Conservatives use the " socialism " label to describe any government service they do n't like .
However , any necessity , by definition universal , will need some government action , because only the government has the legitimacy and resources to deal with problems that are universal in scope .
Conservatives also tout a free market solution to everything , but you can't switch private insurance coverage freely .
Pre-existing health conditions , which alas are not subject to the free market , will always affect the decision to buy new health insurance or to switch providers , as well as the very availability of insurance itself .
Health insurance , like all necessities , is not something the free market was meant to handle nor is it competent to handle , as it has shown repeatedly over the last few decades .
A recent egregious , but not unusual , example of insurance company bad behavior is a Scientific Americanarticle detailing health insurance companies investing in tobacco company stocks .
As the article asks , " Is this who we want running our health care system ? "
The UK's international reputation has suffered " real damage " as a result of the British National Party gaining their first seats in the European Parliament , politicians , unions and race relations groups said today .
Labour MEP for London Claude Moraes said that a threshold had been crossed after the far - right party won two seats yesterday .

Speaking at a Unite Against Fascism press conference in Westminster , Mr Moraes also acknowledged that the BNP had " jumped upon " Gordon Brown 's slogan " British jobs for British workers " during the election .
BNP leader Nick Griffin picked up the seat in the North West of England region and Andrew Brons won a seat in the Yorkshire and Humber region .
Mr Moraes said : " There is real damage here to Britain because we have never elected fascists in a national election .
" Fascists in the European Parliament where I sit have long wanted members from Britain to join this transnational group so for those reasons there is deep concern that we have now crossed that threshold .
" There was a long period in which we could have said neo fascists would not be elected in Britain to represent us in an international parliament . "
He said that many people would today be viewing Britain as a " nastier " place than they had prior to yesterday 's election .
Mr Moraes said Labour had suffered as a consequence of the expenses scandal but acknowledged the BNP had manipulated Gordon Brown 's British jobs slogan .

He explained : " That phrase was jumped upon by the BNP , they are trying increasingly to look at what mainstream politicians say to embarrass the politicians as a way of getting support . "
The BNP wins came as the party appeared to attract significant numbers of disaffected Labour voters .
Frances O'Grady , TUC deputy general secretary , told the press conference the election results had to be viewed as a breakthrough for the BNP .
But she argued that in many parts of the UK the far - right party had been beaten .
She said : " It seems we are living in very strange times , we are commemorating the D - Day landings on Saturday and electing fascists on Sunday . "
She added : " The BNP are not a normal democratic party , they are a fascist party with no place in British democratic life . "
Mr Griffin said that his party winning two seats would herald a " huge change in British politics " .
Speaking yesterday , he said : " The most demonised and lied about party in British politics has made a massive breakthrough .
The public have had their say in a democratic election and we should respect that . "
But Lee Jasper , from the National Assembly Against Racism , said the election posed a huge threat to the black community .
He explained : " It 's a critical moment .
We are suffering a national crisis in confidence in race relations . "
Urging mainstream political parties to come together to fight the BNP , he said : " We must ensure this is not used as a platform or springboard for the next General Election .
" The election of the BNP is a massive threat to the black community nationwide . "
Sabby Dhalu , from Unite Against Fascism , warns that whenever the BNP were voted in racist attacks increased in those areas .
She added : " The BNP stands for virtually every form of hatred you can think of . "
Peter Hain , the newly - appointed Welsh Secretary , released a statement via United Against Fascism which read : " It 's a shameful stain on Britain that we now have racists and fascists representing our country .
" It is vital that everyone now isolates and confronts the BNP and works with United Against Fascism to defeat them . "
Former London mayor Ken Livingstone released a statement which read : " The economic crisis and abuse of MPs ' expenses have provided fertile ground for the extreme right .
" It is no surprise in these circumstances to see an electoral breakthrough for the BNP , a fascist party in Britain .
" The BNP claims to be a normal political party .
In fact , they are 21st century Nazis .
As in the 1930s , they exploit people 's anxieties in an economic crisis to scapegoat minorities and ultimately threaten all our democratic freedoms . "
Relatives of a 14 - year - old Iraqi schoolgirl who was raped and murdered by a US soldier yesterday called for her killer to be executed after a Kentucky court found him guilty of the crimes .
Private Steven Green , now 24 , was the ringleader of one of the most shocking atrocities committed by US forces following the 2003 invasion .
The crime sparked a wave of protests by the Iraqi public , brought angry condemnation from the government , and aggravated tensions between Baghdad and Washington .
A group of soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division plotted the raid , at Green 's instigation , over a game of cards and a session drinking whiskey .
They donned black " ninja " outfits in an attempt to hide their identities and then broke into the family home of Abeer Qassim al - Janabi in Mahmudiya , 20 miles south of Baghdad .

The private , who was 19 at the time of the attack , shot Abeer 's father , mother and six - year - old sister to eliminate witnesses , while two colleagues raped the girl in an adjoining room .
According to his accomplices , Green then joined them and said with a laugh : " I have shot them all , they are all dead " .
He went on to take his turn raping the schoolgirl before covering her face with a pillow and shooting her three times .
The soldiers started to leave but paused to consider the corpse and after a discussion , decided to douse Abeer 's body with kerosene and set it alight .
The men then went back to base and celebrated with a barbecue .
Before the investigation began into the multiple killings .
Green was " honourably discharged " from the army , having been diagnosed with a personality disorder .
He was the first ex-soldier to be charged under a US law that allows prosecution for crimes committed overseas .
After more than 10 hours of deliberations , a Kentucky jury on Thursday found Green , who hails from Midland , Texas , guilty on 16 charges including rape , premeditated murder and obstruction of justice .
The jurors will reconvene on Monday to decide the penalty for his crimes .
Yesterday relations of the murdered Iraqi family said they would only be satisfied that justice had been done if Green was given a death sentence and it was carried out .
" So they decided this criminal was guilty , but we do n't expect he 'll be executed .
Only if he 's executed , will we know that the right thing was done , " a cousin , Yusuf Mohammed Janabi , told Reuters .
The dead schoolgirl 's uncle , Karim Janabi , added : " By all measures , this was a very criminal act .
We are just waiting for the court to sentence him so he gets justice and the court can change the image of Americans . "
An AK - 47 rifle , the usual weapon of choice for militants , was found at the al - Janabi house .
And initially , the soldiers claimed that the attack had been carried out by Sunni insurgents .
When local people disputed this , the story was changed to the family , who were Sunnis , being murdered by a Shia death squad .
Green , however , repeatedly spoke about killing Iraqis to avenge fellow American soldiers who had been killed in the area – the so - called " Triangle of Death " – in clashes with militants .
He also boasted about what he had done saying the experience was " awesome " , although he later maintained that he was not being serious .

What actually took place only emerged during a series of post - combat debriefings .
At which point , an investigation was started by the military police .
A few weeks after the killings in Mahmudiya , the mutilated bodies of two American soldiers were found in the area .
A video showing the corpses was posted on a jihadist website with the message : " We present this as revenge for our sister who was dishonoured by soldiers of the same brigade .
We have taken this revenge for the honour of our sister . "
The cold - blooded brutality at Mahmudiya led to comparison with atrocities committed by US forces in Vietnam .
The Iraqi events became the subject a film , Redacted , directed by Brian De Palma , which won an award at the Venice Film Festival .
The production was , however , strongly criticised by some right - wing columnists and shock jocks for supposedly undermining American forces in Iraq and putting them in danger .
The Mahmudiya rape and murder came at a time of several controversial incidents of Iraqi deaths involving the US military and private security contractors .
The Baghdad government demanded the right to try those responsible before Iraqi courts , but the call was rejected by Washington .
Green admitted participating in the killings at his trial before a federal court in Padukah .
His defence team maintained that he was suffering from combat stress due to the deaths of comrades and in a confused state of mind , he could not tell the difference between friend and foe .
" You have to understand the background that leads up to this perfect storm of insanity , " Patrick Bouldin , one of Green 's defence lawyers , told the court .
" They could n't tell the village people and the farmers from the insurgents and the terrorists . "
But prosecutors gave that explanation short shrift , saying that Green was predisposed to the crime .
" Who could have done these things ?
It was n't done by insurgents or terrorists .
It was the work of this man , Steven Green , " argued federal prosecutor Brian Skaret .
" Steven Green wanted to kill Iraqi civilians ... he wanted to kill them all the time , nonstop . "
The defence also claimed that correct procedures had not been followed in Green 's discharge from the army , and that he had offered to re-enlist so he could be tried before a court martial like his accomplices and not in front of a civilian jury .
His family said they believed that he would be less likely to face a death sentence from a military jury .
In August 2007 , Private Jesse Spielman was convicted of conspiracy to rape and murder and sentenced to 110 years in prison for his role in the incident .
Two other soldiers , Specialist James Barker and Paul Cortez were also convicted and are serving 90 years and 100 years respectively in prison .
A fourth was sentenced to 27 months for his role as a lookout .
Darren Wolff , one of Green 's defence lawyers , told the Associated Press : " Is this verdict a surprise to us ?
No .
The goal has always been to save our client 's life .
And , now we 're going to go to the most important phase , which is the sentencing phase and we 're going to accomplish that goal . "
The unrest continues in the garment industry - another worker killed as rioting spreads across the whole garment factory area in Ashulia .
Ashulia district , Savar , near Dhaka ;
The unrest that began on Saturday ( see previous story ; http://libcom.org/news/fury-garment-worker-shot-dead-bangladesh-workers-...) - when security forces killed a worker during demonstrations for the reinstatement of sacked workers - has escalated .
As workers gathered in the industrial zone on Sunday morning ( 28th June ) , to demand punishment of the killers and compensation for the dead worker 's family , trouble erupted again .
Despite a common 7 - day working week ( with 14 hr days ) , factories remained closed today for fear of further violence ; but garment workers gathered together at their factory gates and then converged in one mass of several thousands on the nearby main highway .
At 9 am the crowd began to block the highway , barricading it with burning tyres ; cops baton charged and workers responded with a barrage of bricks and stones .
Running battles began , of chase and counter - chase , and the whole industrial area became a battleground .
Workers began attacking shops , petrol stations and other commercial premises along the highway - they also vandalised 50 vehicles .
Police and paramilitary security forces replied with over 200 rounds of rubber bullets and tear gas .
During the battle over 150 people were injured ; six workers were shot , one of whom was killed , and at least 30 were critically injured .
Four news reporters were also injured - one seriously .
Twenty cops were also injured .
As news of another killing spread the assaults on bosses ' property swept through the industrial zone .
Fifty garment factories were attacked and some set on fire ; thick plumes of smoke could be seen across the garment sector .
By 2.30 pm the trouble had calmed - but tension remains high and this evening massive numbers of police and security forces are patrolling the area .
Three Ansar personnel - the civilian volunteer paramiltary unit responsible for yesterday 's killing - have been remanded in custody as suspects .
==8 8 8 8==
The unrest coincides with release of a report by the government 's office of the Chief Inspector of Factories ;
At least one in every seven garment factories does not pay salaries to the workers regularly and one in every three factories could in no way be considered a good employer in view of the labour laws , an official survey reveals .
Labour rights violation is actually more widespread in garment factories than the survey has projected , said labour leaders , who alleged that factory owners had found global recession as a useful pretext for cruel exploitation of workers . [...]
The report also listed 34 per cent or 309 of the factories surveyed as substandard in terms of implementation of labour rules .
( New Age - 29 June 09 )
Though there has been some improvement on these issues in recent years , these figures are still probably significant underestimates .
Garment factories have certain tricks they use to fake ' compliance ' with workplace labour guidelines and obligations .
When government inspectors or Compliance Officers representing international buyers conduct inspections they have sometimes been shown especially arranged ' compliant ' areas of the workplace - set up specifically to impress such inspectors with their adherence to health & safety rules and facilities , while the rest of the factory fails to conform to these standards .
Fake accounts are also used , to conceal the long hours worked by employees .
The garment sector workplace is a dangerous environment ; physical exhaustion ( made worse by malnutrition due to low wages ) , toxic chemicals , factory fires , physical assaults by management personnel etc are common hazards .
The last major revolt of garment workers was in 2006 and was massive ;
To illustrate the scale of events : around 4000 factories in Dhaka went on wildcat strike , 16 factories were burnt down by strikers and hundreds more ransacked and looted , pitched battles were fought with cops and private security forces in workplaces and workers ' neighbourhoods , main roads were blocked .
Casualties include 3 workers shot dead , thousands injured , several thousand jailed .
The Government eventually felt compelled to bring in the Army to restore ' order ' .
It was a working class revolt that spread beyond the workplace and generalised to involve the wider working class community .
( http://libcom.org/news/article.php/bangladesh-garment-revolt-140706)
The present events are probably the fiercest clashes since then .
The Bangladeshi garment sector industry is reporting that export orders are largely holding up so far , despite the economic crisis .
The cheapest labour paid the lowest wages in the world still gives bosses a competitive edge .
But as inflation eats further into wages and workers ' anger grows , brute repression may be of limited use in keeping a lid on labour relations .
Increasing population density , rather than boosts in human brain power , appears to have catalysed the emergence of modern human behaviour , according to a new study by UCL ( University College London ) scientists published in the journal Science .
High population density leads to greater exchange of ideas and skills and prevents the loss of new innovations .
It is this skill maintenance , combined with a greater probability of useful innovations , that led to modern human behaviour appearing at different times in different parts of the world .
In the study , the UCL team found that complex skills learnt across generations can only be maintained when there is a critical level of interaction between people .
Using computer simulations of social learning , they showed that high and low - skilled groups could coexist over long periods of time and that the degree of skill they maintained depended on local population density or the degree of migration between them .
Using genetic estimates of population size in the past , the team went on to show that density was similar in sub-Saharan Africa , Europe and the Middle - East when modern behaviour first appeared in each of these regions .
The paper also points to evidence that population density would have dropped for climatic reasons at the time when modern human behaviour temporarily disappeared in sub-Saharan Africa .
Adam Powell , AHRC Centre for the Evolution of Cultural Diversity , says : " Our paper proposes a new model for why modern human behaviour started at different times in different regions of the world , why it disappeared in some places before coming back , and why in all cases it occurred more than 100,000 years after modern humans first appeared .
" By modern human behaviour , we mean a radical jump in technological and cultural complexity , which makes our species unique .
This includes symbolic behavior , such as abstract and realistic art , and body decoration using threaded shell beads , ochre or tattoo kits ; musical instruments ; bone , antler and ivory artefacts ; stone blades ; and more sophisticated hunting and trapping technology , like bows , boomerangs and nets .
Professor Stephen Shennan , UCL Institute of Archaeology , says : " Modern humans have been around for at least 160,000 to 200,000 years but there is no archaeological evidence of any technology beyond basic stone tools until around 90,000 years ago .
In Europe and western Asia this advanced technology and behaviour explodes around 45,000 years ago when humans arrive there , but does n't appear in eastern and southern Asia and Australia until much later , despite a human presence .
In sub -Saharan Africa the situation is more complex .
Many of the features of modern human behaviour – including the first abstract art – are found some 90,000 years ago but then seem to disappear around 65,000 years ago , before re-emerging some 40,000 years ago .
" Scientists have offered many suggestions as to why these cultural explosions occurred where and when they did , including new mutations leading to better brains , advances in language , and expansions into new environments that required new technologies to survive .
The problem is that none of these explanations can fully account for the appearance of modern human behaviour at different times in different places , or its temporary disappearance in sub-Saharan Africa . "
Dr Mark Thomas , UCL Genetics , Evolution and Environment , says : " When we think of how we came to be the sophisticated creatures we are , we often imagine some sudden critical change , a bit like when the black monolith appears in the film 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
In reality , there is no evidence of a big change in our biological makeup when we started behaving in an intelligent way .
Our model can explain this even if our mental capacities are the same today as they were when we first originated as a species some 200,000 years ago .
" Ironically , our finding that successful innovation depends less on how smart you are than how connected you are seems as relevant today as it was 90,000 years ago . "
In The Shock Doctrine , Naomi Klein relates how nations brutalized by the Chicago School ’s savage capitalism and the Dirty War juntas enforcing it have recovered and developed a healthy immunity against more eviscerating shock therapy :
Any strategy based on exploiting the window of opportunity opened by a traumatic shock relies heavily on the element of surprise ... in North America , the September 11 attacks were , at first pure event , raw reality , unprocessed by story , narrative or anything that could bridge the gap between reality and understanding .
Without a story , we are , as many of us were after September 11 , intensely vulnerable to those people who take advantage of chaos for their own ends .
As soon as we have a new narrative that offers perspective on the shocking events , we become reoriented and the world begins to make sense again .
That psychology pertains on both the individual and societal levels : a trauma that is never dealt with openly , but suppressed in the subconscious , festers , reinforcing crippling habits and sabotaging recovery .
Maybe it is our reigning paradigm of dogmatic materialism that keeps us from acknowledging afflictions of the mind and spirit ; imbibe a new pill to correct the faulty chemistry , or ingest an economic stimulus package to cure our destructive addiction to greed and gluttony .
Consciousness , our scientists tell us , is a mere epiphenomenon of electrical brain circuits , so there can be no such thing as a collective “ national psyche ” capable of being wounded ( socialist psychology ! ) .
But how do we explain the shocking backsliding of Obama and his majority party : indefinite detention , torture lite continuing in Gitmo and Bagram , virtual immunity for war criminals , acceptable collateral drone carnage of civilians in Pakistan and Afghanistan , escalation of the disingenuous War on Terror , not to mention the subsidization of our piratical financial class .
We are still locked in the shock of 9/11 , the sole justification for this endless train of abuses , usurpations , and crimes .
To forswear waterboarding would be regression to a perilous “ September 10th mentality , ” Elizabeth Cheney assures us .
9/11 is the wellspring that keeps on gushing , fueling our fear , barbaric behavior , and coffers of the merchants of death .
But if the officially sanctioned narrative of 9/11 is any way deficient — if it is a cover - up of some kind , as many credible Commission staffers , prominent academics , military and intelligence officers , architects and engineers have alleged — then we cannot continue tacitly endorsing it without very grave and perhaps fatal consequences to our republic .
To censor all inquiry that reflects critically on that first , very panicked draft of history , and declare any revisionist narrative heresy , surrenders our minds to the perpetual War lobby still feeding on it .
The disillusioning betrayals by our Democratic majority should be sufficient evidence of that by now .
The torture , renditions , bloodbaths and bankrupting imperialism could be extended for 10 more years , as a Pentagon general recently envisioned .
The Constitution , and critical domestic initiatives , are indefinitely detained .
In South America , after decades of plutocratic plunder and police - state oppression , genuinely pluralistic and vital democracies are resurgent , in no small measure because their citizens have courageously and tenaciously faced the horrors of their past , excised the cancer , and insured their progress with legal deterrence — exposure and prosecution of the Dirty War thieves and killers .
Wall Street ’s IMF shock troops have been evicted from the whole continent , and the rule of law has triumphed .
In Argentina , Peru , or Spain , Bush , Cheney and Rumsfeld would be in the dock by now .
But here in United States , cradle of modern democracy and the unfettered Fourth Estate , our ostensible leaders and most of our media still cannot honestly face the seminal neo - fascist crime of over 40 years ago , the assassinations of JFK ..
When one of the principal suspects , Cold War fanatic E. Howard Hunt , arranged a posthumous confession two years ago ( “ Surely someone would have talked by now ! ” ) , implicating the CIA ’s Cuba faction , it was left to Rolling Stone alone to get the word out ( whatever the veracity of that confession was later determined to be , there is no excuse for blacking out news of it ) .
Twenty years earlier , when Mark Lane convinced a Miami jury that the same E. Howard Hunt and the CIA were complicit in the assassination , news of the landmark trial ( Hunt vs. Liberty Lobby ) never made it beyond a local Miami TV station .
If there ’s a conspiracy - of - silence theory here , fault our panjandrums of the press for feeding it , including radical luminaries Alexander Cockburn , Noam Chomsky and Justin Raimondo , all still preposterously swearing fealty to the rancid Warren Commission corpse as a holy relic .
Because : power is structural , institutional and ruthless , but it would never stoop to this level ( except overseas ) .
Because American exceptionalism embodies more than the privilege to flaunt whatever laws get in the way of its blundering manifest destiny — we are blessed also with a congenital / Constitutional immunity to those Machiavellian maladies common in most other polities in history .
A Caesar Borgia is impossible in our land ( except Chicago ) !
We suffer the downside of our singular individualism — Lone Nuts and postal pariahs — but they rarely collaborate in socialistic cabals .
God ’s , or Madison ’s , dispensation has forever freed us from the alien scourge of conspiracy ( except the Mafia , famously apolitical ) .
To assert otherwise is a faux pas as impudent as “ class warfare . ”
It ’s self - evident : there is no ruling class in the shining city on the hill , but if there were , it would never , ever conspire darkly against the general welfare .
Case closed !
Let us give praise : with a few picayune exceptions , every skeleton in our internal National Security empire is dragged out into the disinfecting glare of a summer day in Death Valley .
Our congressional investigations are , by and large , enviable forays of forensic rigor and infallibility .
We may falter and stumble , but in the Invisible Hand we trust to right the ship in all storms .... as long as our faith is sure and we stifle all doubt .
All our current problems ensue , really , from a surfeit of the white man ’s burden : Democracy and uplifting Capitalism are threatened by global epidemics of insurgency and virulent socialism that could , if not checked by our stalwart sacrifice , plunge the nation , or even the planet , into a great depression !
The only language they understand : napalm on the wedding party .
Since WWII , we have successfully crusaded and seeded capital democracy like conquistadors of the Enlightenment : Guatemala , Iran , Greece , Indonesia , Chile , the Phillipines , Indonesia , Vietnam , Iraq .
We ca n’t abandon the mission of 1776 now .
We must summon the fortitude to stand up to our swelling coalition of enemies .
It ’s not the Cold War — it ’s the Slush War , thawed by global warming .
Becoming more fully automated , privatized and casualty minimizing .
Replacing body bags , we ’ll suffer wounded and killed drones and cyborg Marines — boom time for the robot contractors .
Moreover , the market is stable , growing and self - fertilizing ; new crops of terrorists spring up like bush seedlings after one of our F - 22 forest fires .
Our boys in uniform will be joystick jocks ; when Star Wars is finally deployed ( with offensive capability ) , even the previously disabled can be war heroes .
Given the order , a future Steven Hawking , for example , if he got bored with physics , could obliterate one of the Stan countries .
Is that not another advance for equality and social justice ?
Even as we kill prolifically , we do good .
Virtue rises and permeates our character undefeated , however rough and tumble we ’re forced to be .
Most importantly , the Brits do n’t have it over us on decorum ; our prudence , civility and good taste in public are not inferior — we know when and where to censor ourselves .
God save the Queen and the rest of the leisure class .
After 45 years of unpunished serial abuse , the collective unconscious of the nation must be roiling with a lot of repressed baggage , and we imagine this is inconsequential as we “ look forward , ” that all the talk of “ festering wounds ” in the national soul is just so much metaphorical prattle .
America is a future - forging dynamo , untroubled by the dead weight of remorse for Abu Ghraib , the Gulf of Tonkin , or the Manchurian hit on RFK .
No , such detours into the past would hinder the breathtaking progress we ’re making on all fronts : reigning in the corporate - financial kleptocracy , ushering in a universal health care system approximately efficient as Cuba ’s , withdrawing from the bankrupting quagmires overseas .
Deploy the windshield , I ’m gasping !
Certainly , let us not distract from celebrating the shower of fig leaves over this swinish epidemic of corruption in the capital .
Yes , our gallant Democrats have shifted the political landscape — so the bulk of lobby loot now gravitates to their pockets , and we are appeased with a few grudging lipstick concessions from the bloodsuckers of Wall Street , the Pentagon and the insurance aristocracy — vested agents of bankruptcy , sickness and death feasting now with marginally less ravenous gluttony .
Hoorah .
Perhaps our illegal immigrants from the South can assist by cultural diffusion : maybe they can teach us how to conduct a proper truth and reconciliation commission and reclaim our democracy .
Maybe their example can shame most of our own journalists , professors and pols into growing some balls .
Are we serious about dismantling this murderous , parasitical apparatus , or not ?
Outraged citizens in Bolivia , Argentina , Lebanon and even Britain take to the streets — our vanguard cannot even open its mouth , except to abjectly slander those who have taken action and risk the kick of outraged consensus reflex .
To cite one example of this noxious co-dependency : here on Daily Kos recently , a longtime blogger , Tocque DeVille was banished for declaring the proscribed L*** P theory about 9/11 , even after masochistic denials that he was giving any credence to subversive “ conspiracy theory ” — that ever potent meme adapted to divert investigation of the worst shock therapy crimes .
Too grim and serious for us happy , optimistic Americans .
Please do not disturb our precious innocence — we will persist peeing the bed and sucking the pacifier of big lies as Uncle confidently prepares to rape us again .
Well , I am serious .
The body parts of 92 children in Bola Boluk were just shoveled into graves , courtesy of the Audaciously Hopeful One .
And that was merely a downpayment .
It is necessary , because somewhere among the gore there may have been a splattered towelhead hatching another 9/11 .
If I have not already committed punishable perfidy here , I now offer no theories , conspiratorial or otherwise , but simply the following citation of officiously endorsed empiricism .
As Kos repeats the hackneyed gem in his online Rules : “ Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof . ”
Well , here it is :
Firm evidence of nano - thermite residue in four distinct WTC dust samples .
From a paper published in the peer - reviewed Open Chemical Physics Journal by dissident physicist Stephen Jones ( our own Andrei Sakharov ) and eight colleagues ( summary here : http://www.globalresearch.ca/...
Jones states it was the most rigorous peer - review he had ever undergone , in a long and distinguished career .
So far , none of the dependable debunkers have disputed this research — that would perhaps draw too much undesired attention to it .
So what does it mean ?
First , it provides an explanation for two anomalies in the Twin Towers ’ destruction : the great plumes of pulverized mass at the beginning of the collapse ; and the pools of molten metal found in the debris weeks later ( kerosene jet fuel fires may weaken steel , but can not melt it ) .
People are quick to jump to unwarranted conclusions , but I will keep this safely within the designated free speech zone : no theories straying off limits into how or by whom the nano - thermite was employed on 9/11 .
But prima facie , it is a national security issue .
Nano - thermite , or super - thermite , is a controlled pyrotechnic compound under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation ( ITAR ) .
It has to be engineered in a fairly sophisticated lab ( like the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , where it was originally synthesized .
Or like the distinctive strain of anthrax used in the post 9/11 attacks ) .
If the 19 hijackers and / or unknown confederates somehow acquired or created this devastatingly explosive terrorist weapon ( it can be embedded or molded into almost anything , like ceiling tiles , shoes or carry - on luggage ) , should this not be discussed and investigated ?
Can our airport scanners detect this stuff ?
Is there an al - Qaeda nano - technology lab somewhere on the planet ?
Are we to rely on torture alone to save us from a ticking nano - thermite bomb ?
Well , if this evidence be declared verboten by our commissars of permissible discourse , we may safely add to the flourishing Bush / Cheney legacy another element : the willful suppression of science , as we continue marching in blind faith - based amnesia over more cliffs .
We now know unequivocally that the FAA and NORAD lied about the national defense failures on that fateful day , much like the Warren Commission was bamboozled by Hoover ’s corrupt FBI ( see recent and upcoming books by Commission staffers Richard Ben- Veniste and John Farmer ) .
And we know that Dick Cheney was in complete command ( in an encore self - appointment , he assumed supreme authority over homeland defense four months earlier ; an unprecedented role for an American VP ) , having arranged no less than 6 separate war games on 9/11 ( Vigilant Guardian , Vigilant Warrior , Northern Vigilance , Northern Guardian , Tripod II , and a curiously coincidental NRO exercise ) , including simulated hijackings and airliners smashing into buildings ( which Condi Rice and company could “ never have imagined ” ) that diverted most U.S. defensive aircraft while effectively providing an obfuscating smokescreen for the genuinely hijacked aircraft .
Maybe it was n’t only the Boeings that were hijacked , but the whole war games scenario .
If so , have we identified the al - Qaeda moles in NORAD , the Pentagon , or Dick ’s bunker whose intelligence coordinated this Trojan Horse operation ?
Good God , could they could still be in place , packing nano - thermite laptops and iPods ?
From Level Blackout , we should move at least to Level Orange alert here .
Regarding responsibility for the financial meltdown , economist James K. Galbraith said , “ … as always , you ’ll have incompetence , negligence and conspiracy at various parts of the operation at various times ” — a rare and exemplary apprehension of complexity that could also flesh out a new , unexpurgated , war - disabling narrative of 9/11 .
Whatever the relative proportions of negligence , incompetence and conspiracy , one thing is clear : the election - hijacking cabal ( another feckless failure of our press , with the lone exception of Keith Olbermann ) in power wanted , needed , pined and prayed for a “ new Pearl Harbor ” to kick off the “ New American Century . ”
Individuals and bureaucracies alike filter out dissonant information , or intelligence , in conflict with grasping desires and beliefs ; the best cognitive filter is a numbing ideology masking both inconvenient facts and base ulterior motives , enabling the most barbarous acts in the name of some imagined higher good .
Such as : “ Our white phosphorus is searing democracy into a stubborn , impervious people . ”
Better said by John T. Flynn :
The enemy aggressor is always pursuing a course of larceny , murder , rapine and barbarism .
We are always moving forward with high mission , a destiny imposed by the Deity to regenerate our victims , while incidentally capturing their markets ; to civilize savage and senile and paranoid peoples , while blundering accidentally into their oil wells .
Unlike the first Pearl Harbor , not a single American official has suffered so much as a wrist slap for the loss of 3000 lives on 9/11 , even though very specific foreign intelligence about an impending attack was flooding Washington that summer , while Colleen Rowley ’s , Robert Wright ’s and other diligent FBI agents ’ field investigations were stymied , stubbornly and absurdly , by D.C. headquarters ( the Moussaoui lead , suspected terrorists in Arizona flight training schools , a money trail back to madrassa financiers , all quarantined in a bureaucratic Siberia ) .
The FBI honcho responsible for most of these persistent obstructions , David Frasca , was never reprimanded — incredibly , he was promoted .
Ignore this .
In the secret bunker , Cheney appears to have ordered a stand down as Flight 77 approached the Pentagon , according to the Commission testimony of Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta .
Finally dragged together before the hearings they struggled to abort , Cheney ventriloquized his dummy to insure no slip ups focused on this long train of suspicious behavior .
The warmongering cowboys fought any deeper probing of the disaster , and largely succeeded ; how curious that our champions of the Left now ape them , acting as a mop up crew , blissfully ignorant of recent FBI statements like this :
As with all cases , the FBI will continue to examine the 9/11 investigation from every angle as new evidence develops , utilizing all leads available .
Mr. Gage ( president of Architect and Engineers for 9/11 Truth ) presents an interesting theory , backed by thorough research and analysis .
— Michael Heimbach
Assistant Director , Counterterrorism Division
National Security Branch , FBI
The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden 's Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 .
— Rex Tomb
Chief of Investigative Publicity , FBI
Got that , ye righteous debunkers ?
We ’re spending more billions hunting down a CIA - spawned Frankenstein for a crime we have no evidence that he committed .
All the Taliban demanded before the carpet of bombs in 2002 was submission of that evidence , which Bush and Cheney could n’t cough up .
Sweet .
I think Smedley Butler would call it an autocatalytic racket .
He would also surely gag if asked to swallow one of the lesser known physical absurdities of 9/11 , the Shanksville Gopher Hole , which swallowed Flight 93 and the “ Let ’s roll ! ” heroes whole , leaving no discernible debris larger than a baseball on the surface , before belching up engines and other parts and spewing them 8 miles downstream .
The only comparable feat is that of Messrs .
Cockburn , Chomsky , Raimondo , Moulitsas and company in swallowing this turd without so much as a gag reflex .
But these gentlemen have their off - mainstream reputations to uphold .
And how their screeds are winning the day !
Keep shooting at the tail and tusks , gentlemen ; the beast will succumb…eventually .
I do n’t know how culpable Cheney is for 9/11 — whether he would be indicted for criminal negligence , manslaughter or conspiracy to commit murder , illegal war and torture if not shielded by a vestige of high office .
But I know that any nation that still tolerates this malignant Goering pontificating freely in public has a long way to go in recuperating its sabotaged traditions and hocked soul .
Maybe we should convene a South American presidents ’ summit in Washington or New York .
They would probably advise us : “ Publish the damn facts and indict the sonofabitches already ! ”
Of course , the chances of that happening any time soon are slim .
The shocking candor might demoralize our media ’s corporate overlords , sapping their dynamism that so richly trickles down upon us these days ... it could even wreak unprecedented havoc on Wall Street !
Above all , the supreme virtue , stability of the status quo , must be safeguarded .
We can procrastinate still a little longer ; after all , it has taken the Chileans , and many victims of serial abuse , decades to recover .
The tsunami ’s reflected waves are only now departing the South , to rattle back on the epicenter .
Of course , since this tumor of fanatic - right covert ops sheathed with blind impunity was born on November 1963 , it could be argued that we ’re relatively overdue for making a start .
In many cases , we are not talking “ conspiracy theory ” but simply history — revisionist , radical , uncompromising — and it is no mere academic exercise , as Orwell observed : who controls the past , controls the future .
The reason behind this inertia is obvious : treason has prospered mightily and benefited us all more or less , so none dare call it treason .
That ’s the demon lurking in our national id ; it ’s all about maintaining our sumptuous lifestyle , Rumsfeld proclaimed , and who really wants to live less high on the hog ?
But the credit on these accounts , like our other soaring deficits , is fast approaching the omega point .
Recent bulletins from the Pentagon : we could be squatting in Iraq for at least 10 more years ; the Vatican - sized embassy in Baghdad will be matched by a new diplomatic fortress in Pakistan ; Afghanistan will require another decade as well ; and we can still fight a conventional sequel in Korea , the generals cheerfully promise us .
While the rest of the country founders , it ’s boom time for Daddy Warbucks !
Eisenhower understood this military - industrial coup a decade ago ; we still do n’t get it .
There has been much speculation on what prompted the former general to speak out so bluntly ; the ambiguously authorized Gary Powers U2 flight and sabotage of a peace summit with Khruschev being the most likely candidate .
Another possibility : he became privy to the now declassified Operation Northwoods plans presented by the Joint Chiefs early in JFK ’s presidency .
To galvanize the public for a pre-emptive invasion of Cuba , false - flag attacks on the homeland could be engineered , with bombed airliners and civilian casualties .
JFK spiked this , before he was spiked .
The naive assumption that no Rambos in our corrosive defense establishment could conspire so iniquitously is moot .
The liberation achieved by our former vassals in the South will be elusive to us until we also first liberate our minds .
And it may take a shock to stir us from our lethargy , a shock equal to 9/11 , which would be the whole shocking truth about 9/11 .
But maybe you are pleased with our Siamese twin - party farce of reform .
A little tweaking and tuning of the Bush policies is all we really need and can hope for , as more thousands are destined to perish from inadequate health care , financial rape , and blind drone strikes .
Thankfully , many among us are not so cravenly resigned — like chemistry professor Niels Harrit , co-author of Jone ’s nano - thermite paper , who answered why he was so active in the 9/11 Truth movement :
First , I am opposed to crime , and second , when my 6 grandchildren ask me , ' Grandfather , which side were you on ? '
I will be able to answer them , ' I was on your side . '
For those who would acquiesce , whatever the level of suspicion , and act as if we must ignore , forget , deny and tolerate the crushing of 3000 lives ... soon you may be cheering the glorious nuclear engagements with Tehran and Pyongyang in Eastasia .
Osama bin Goldstein is still miraculously on the loose , no doubt hatching another Axis of Evil sneak attack in one of the aforementioned capitals .
If we just torture sufficiently , perhaps we ’ll finally discover his GPS coordinates .
Ignorance is strength ...
Stubborn ignorance is nuclear !
Do you love fresh , organic , local fruit , but lack the yard space , or even live in an urban environment with little room for growing ?
You might want to consider growing an espalier fruit tree .
No , this is n’t some new exotic type of fruit , rather it is a method for growing trees in a hedge - like manner that enables people with even the smallest yards to be able to grow fruit trees .
The definition of espalier is “ a trellis or framework on which the trunk and branches of fruit trees or shrubs are trained to grow in one plane ” .
Essentially what it means is progressively pruning your tree to grow in a flat plane along a fence , side of a building , or existing hedge .
This approach will take several years of continuous pruning as the tree grows , as well as yearly maintenance when you perform your winter pruning and late summer thinning , but will leave you with a space efficient tree that should produce an abundance of fresh fruit .
Imagine the possibilities !
You can replace the traditional hedge in your front yard with a hedge that produces oranges , lemons , or even seasonal fruit such as peaches , pears or apples .
Keep in mind that if you intend the espaliered fruit trees to be used as a screening or privacy hedge , use evergreen fruit trees such as citrus , not peaches , cherries , or apples which will drop their leaves in winter .
You can utilize just a few feet of space along a fence to have a productive backyard that can potentially provide year round fresh fruit ( in a warm climate anyways ) .
Remember that the best time for heavy and structural pruning is winter ( January and February ) prior to buds forming on the trees .
You can also do light pruning and thinning of small branches after the fruit has been harvested .
Many articles on the web give great specific instructions on how to prune , but just keep in mind that you can trim your espalier fruit tree like any other plant that you are trying to train .
Some of the fantastic side effects from growing your own fruit in your backyard , is that it ca n’t get more local than stepping outside to pick your fruit for the day , and if you ’re growing it , you know exactly whether or not it ’s organic .
For some great advice on growing your espalier fruit tree , check out this article – Mulch : A Gardeners Best Friend .
Or check out more information on growing peach trees for consecutive harvests .

Diesmal liest sich die Aktion aber deutlicher so , dass die breite CDU - Wähler - Bevölkerung noch mehr Informationen braucht .
Ich zitiere mal den Einsender :
Und so verging die erste Stunde : der " Moderator " Dieter Zimmer war eine absolute Katastrophe , der nebenher auch schonmal Verständnis dafür äußerte , daß man den Hartz - IV - Empfängern nicht zuviel Bargeld in die Hand geben dürfe , weil die es ansonsten doch nur für Zigaretten und Alkohol ausgäben .
Auch ansonsten Anbiederung und Schwachsinn auf ganzer Linie , angefangen mit Leyens wohlhabender Kindheit in Brüssel , über die brennende Frage , ob ihr die Politik und ihre Arbeit eigentlich großen Spaß mache bis hin zur feinfühligen Nachfrage , wie es denn ihrem kranken Vater ginge .
Zwischendurch ein wenig bürgernaher Aktionismus , als Leyen einer besorgten Ortsbürgermeisterin versprach , sich persönlich darum kümmern zu wollen , daß bereitgestellte Bundesmittel auch tatsächlich in den notleidenden Kindergärten und Schulen Leipzigs ankommen .
Die Gäste waren zufrieden .
Und wir fürchteten schon , daß der Abend sich im allgemeinen Wohlgefallen auflöste und die wirklich brennenden Themen überhaupt nicht zur Sprache kämen .
Doch dem war nicht so :)
Eine halbe Stunde vor Ende der Veranstaltung trat ein Fragesteller auf , der dann doch das Thema Websperren zur Sprache brachte , und das auch recht gut und allgemeinverständlich .
Kurz darauf traten einige Aktivisten des AK Vorrat Leipzig mit 2 Transparenten auf die Bühne - und die Stimmung wurde lauter und heftiger .
Die üblichen Lügen , völlig substanzlose Zahlen und aus dem Publikum laute , teils wütende Zwischenrufe .
Am bösesten war : " Jetzt kommt der Besenstiel ! "
*eg *
Das Erschreckende war dennoch , daß etwa 80 % der Zuschauer davon nichts hören wollten und sogar regelrecht empört über diese " Störungen " waren .
Leipzig ,
Hut ab !
Sehr gute Aktion !
Update : Ich erkläre hiermit CDU - Wahlkampfveranstaltungen mit Zensursula - Transparenten besuchen zur Trendsportart .
Weitersagen : das ist die perfekte Einleitung für einen Party - Abend .
So begeht man ab jetzt den Feierabend .
Und bitte Fotos machen und mir mailen .
Und kommt dann bitte auch zum diesjährigen CCC - Congress mit euren Transparenten .
Ihr schreibt da gerade Geschichte !
Update : Die sächsischen Piraten haben ein Video der spannenden Stelle auf Youtube gepackt .

Some investors in 401 ( k ) retirement funds who are moving to grab their money are finding they can’t .
Even with recent gains in stocks such as Monday ’s , the months of market turmoil have delivered a blow to some 401 ( k ) participants : freezing their investments in certain plans .
In some cases , individual investors can’t withdraw money from certain retirement - plan options .
In other cases , employers are having trouble getting rid of risky investments in 401 ( k ) plans .
When Ed Dursky was laid off from his job at a manufacturing company in March , he could n’t withdraw $ 40,000 from his 401 ( k ) retirement account invested in the Principal U.S. Property Separate Account .
That fund , which invests directly in office buildings and other properties , had stopped allowing most investors to make withdrawals last fall as many of its holdings became hard to sell .
Now Mr. Dursky , of Ottumwa , Iowa , is looking for work and losing patience .
All he wants , he said , is his money .
“ I hate to be whiny , but it is my money , ” Mr. Dursky said .
The withdrawal restrictions are limiting investment options for plan participants and employers at a key time in the markets .
The timing is inconvenient for the number of workers like Mr. Dursky who are laid off and find their savings inaccessible .

Enjoying a big bounty of herbs from the garden this year ?
Fresh is best when it comes to cooking with them , but here are ten easy ways to preserve them for year - round use ( along with a nifty tip at the bottom of the page for crushing them fast ) .
Air / Hang Dry Method :
If you have the space and the time , you can tie small bunches together ( about 4 or 5 cleaned stems ) and hang them upside down in a dark , warm , well ventilated area .
The drying time is about 2 to 4 weeks – you want the leaves to be crispy and easily crumble between your fingers before you pack them for storage .
If space is tight , here ’s a clever project you can make using old frames , fiberglass screens , chain and S hooks ( for hanging in tiers ) : Hanging Frames Tutorial .
Oven : Arrange cleaned stems in a single layer on a cookie sheet with temperature set at 180° F .
Heat for about 4 hours , keeping the oven door open the entire time ( to let moisture escape ) .
Stir occasionally during this process .
Microwave
Them :
This a quick & easy method if you need them dried fast … but watch while you ’re heating to make sure they do n’t smoke or start on fire .
Since microwaves cook differently , the times may vary for you .
Detailed instructions are found at the bottom of this page .
Cool Air :
Wash then pat with a soft cloth to remove moisture .
Layer a cookie sheet with paper towels and then arrange stems in a single layer .
Place in the refrigerator and remove once they are completely dried ( check daily ) .
Does not work in crisper bins .
Salt or Sugar : Layer fresh leaves between salt or sugar ( covering completely ) and leave them until they are desiccated .
Sift them out and store in airtight containers .
Choose salt or sugar depending on the flavor of the herb and which would be better suited to it .
Ice Cubes : Chop then sprinkle into ice cube trays ( measure into each cube the most common amount you use in cooking , for example 1 tsp ) .
Cover with water and freeze ( can also cover with stock or olive oil ) .
Pop them out once they ’re frozen and then re-pack in bags ( remove as much air as possible from the bags first ) .
When needed for cooking , just take out a cube and toss it in the dish that ’s cooking ( thawing first is optional –remember to account for the extra liquid in your recipe ) .
Nifty trick :
Try mixing your favorite blends first .
You can view a tutorial here ( thegardenerseden.com ) using olive oil and / or melted butter instead of water .
Freezing Whole & Chopped : Wash and dry the leaves then store in bags with as much air removed as possible ( you can also lay them in a single layer on a cookie sheet then pack in bags when frozen ) .
Freeze .
See a handy tip at the bottom of this page for crushing them quickly , you can also chop them first if you prefer .
Bulk Pastes ( Pesto ) : Wash clean then chop in a food processor , add enough oil to make a paste when blended ( approximately 2 cups fresh herbs to 1/3 cup olive oil ) .
Can be frozen in small containers ( remove all air first by shaking and tapping the container then top with a fine layer of olive oil to seal paste against air ) .
Thaw before using .
Spoon out the required amount needed for cooking then store the rest in the refrigerator .
The most common pesto is made from basil , but you can use others too ( and combinations ) .
You ’ll find a few recipes on this page .
Bulk Seasoning Salt :
Have a ready supply of seasonings at your fingertips ( create your own signature blend ) , whipping up batches only once a year and freezing until needed .
Instructions found here : pinkbites.com .
Bulk Butters : Chop leaves and mix with butter to taste .
Can be frozen in single serving butter pats or in cube sizes appropriate for cooking ( just add the butter pat while dish is cooking –remember to account for butter in recipe ) .
Thaw before using .
See this page for more details .

Here ’s a quick method to try if you need them fast … but watch to make sure they do n’t smoke or start on fire .
Keep in mind the times may vary for you .
Wash them well , pat dry and lay aside for an hour .
You want to make sure there is no moisture on them before starting .
Place stems in a single layer on a paper towel , cover with another sheet of paper towel .
Place in microwave and heat for 2 minutes on high .
Turn paper towel and do another minute or reheat in 30 second intervals until they are dry and brittle .
Pack in ziploc bags ( remove all air ) or airtight containers and store in a dark , dry place .
Use as needed .
Can be used for up to one year .
Important :
If you notice any moisture in the airtight containers or sealed plastic bags after storing the dried herbs –this is a sign that moisture was still present when packed .
Mold can develop because of the moisture , so make sure they are done thoroughly and have absolutely no moisture left in them .
One teaspoon of dried herbs is equivalent to 1 tablespoon of fresh .
If you prefer fresh over the long winter months , consider growing them indoors .
Here ’s a kitchen tip Josee Meehan sent in to share with us all : * First published October 17 , 2008
This from my husband ( who is a chef ) : Herbs , like basil and oregano , can be quickly and easily crushed when frozen .
The trick is to take them out of the freezer seconds before use , put your hand in the bag and crinkle them .
No cutting required .
The trick is in the timing .
You ca n’t let them thaw out even a little .
Thanks for sharing Josee !
In the normally surreal atmosphere of US military headquarters in Saddam Hussein 's former palace , a taped appearance by President Obama ordering his top general in Iraq to shave comedian Stephen Colbert 's head did n't even seem that odd .
To the delighted audience of about 250 servicemen and women who were the studio audience of " Operation Iraq Stephen : Going Commando , " the show was part of an hour - long suspension of a war that for many on this vast base has become more drudgery than danger .
Comedy Central 's " Colbert Report " airing Monday night is the first of four episodes of the satirical program to be taped in Iraq , sponsored by the United Service Organization ( USO ) and broadcast this week in a unique collaboration with the military .
In the ballroom of the marble palace at Camp Victory Sunday night , Mr. Colbert bounded onto the stage wearing a business suit made of the same camouflage fabric of Army uniforms .
Swinging a golf club , he told the audience what a thrill it was to bring his show to the men and women in Iraq : " a country so nice we invaded it twice . "
Dark humor
" It must be nice here , because I understand some of you keep coming back again and again and again , " he said to a wave of laughter .
It 's a little - known fact that there is a lot of dark humor in war – soldiers cope by finding things funny that the rest of the world likely would n't appreciate .
Fittingly , one of the biggest laughs was in response to one of the reasons why Colbert said the US should declare victory here :
The US has " eliminated weapons of mass destruction . "
" Easier than we thought " ran the subtext on a giant screen .
" This is not ' Camp Cautiously Optimistic ' ....
This is not ' Camp Obviously We Must Work Towards Sunni Participation in the Upcoming Elections in January 2010 . '
This is Camp Victory ! , " Colbert bellowed behind a set made up of red , white , and blue sandbags .
Holding up a Risk boardgame and saying the rules state it's not over till someone declares victory , he said : " You heard it here first – I , Stephen Colbert , by the power invested in me by basic cable , officially declare : ' We won the Iraq war . ' "
" That 's a little concerning .
We 're not quite ready to declare victory yet , " guest star Gen .
Ray Odierno told him , adding there was still some work they had to do with the government of Iraq .
" It 's about long - term stability .
It 's still dangerous out here . "
General Odierno gives Colbert a shave
When the towering – and bald – general turned to the issue of whether Colbert could succeed as a soldier without a hair cut , he was interrupted by a video message from Mr. Obama .
The commander in chief said he wanted to send his greetings to the servicemen and women in Iraq and then ordered Odierno to cut the comedian 's hair .
The general started the job with an electric razor before a hair stylist took over to give the entertainer something close to a crew cut .
The show also included a taped message from former presidential candidate John McCain : " As a former military man I have a word of advice : ' Make sure to always take the time to clean your musket . ' "
Colbert said he wanted to come to Iraq because in the US , the war had faded out of view .
" I thought the whole thing was over .
I have n't seen any news stories on it in months , " he said .
Colbert lands interviews denied to other journalists
Despite approximately 130,000 US troops still fighting the war in Iraq , as the US hands over security to the Iraqi government , the American military has become increasingly reticent about being covered .
One of the Colbert Report episodes will include an appearance by Lt. Gen. Charles Jacoby , the head of US ground operations here .
His interview with the comedian is the first he 's granted since taking over April .
[ Editor 's note :
The original version misstated the month when Jacoby took command . ]
Bringing the popular comedy show here took months of planning .
In the last few days , Faw Palace , the US military headquarters in what was Saddam Hussein 's huge palace complex near the airport has been overrun with writers and set assistants .
The set was constructed partially of cases of ubiquitous plastic bottles of water cleverly wrapped in clear plastic and lit with red and blue lights to make them look like crystal columns .
USO organizers say it is the first US television program entirely produced and hosted in Iraq to be broadcast from here .
Colbert , whose show was a spinoff from Jon Stewart 's satirical ' The Daily Show ' with its regular feature on the war entitled ' Mess - O - Potamia ' , has been a persistent skeptic of the conflict in Iraq but has supported the troops .
On stage , he spoke into an old - fashioned looking - microphone with the USO logo that harkened back to the days of Bob Hope entertaining US forces abroad .
Almost to a person , the soldiers asked after the program what they thought of it declared it " awesome , " particularly the hair cut .
Journalists were directed by the military not to ask soldiers anything broader than how they felt about the show but given the program 's content , that left the door wide open .
Asked whether he agrees with Colbert that the US should just declare victory in Iraq , Sgt. Charles Williams , from New Orleans , replies : " Did n't somebody already do that ? "
Providing health insurance for US children would be cheaper than expected , study says .
Credit : Rice University / Photos.com
Extending health insurance coverage to all children in the U.S. would be relatively inexpensive and would yield economic benefits that are greater than the costs , according to new research conducted at Rice University 's Baker Institute for Public Policy .
" Providing health insurance to all children in America will yield substantial economic benefits , " wrote Vivian Ho , chair in health economics at the Baker Institute and associate professor of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine .
She co-authored the report with Marah Short , senior staff researcher in health economics at the Baker Institute .
They based their research on recent studies published in peer - reviewed journals to examine the evidence regarding the economic impact of failing to insure all children in the United States .
The children will receive better health care and enjoy better health , thereby improving their productivity as adults , the researchers said .
The cost incurred by providing universal coverage to children " will be offset by the increased value of additional life years and improved health - related quality of life gained from improved health care .
From a societal perspective , universal coverage for children appears to be cost - saving . "
Ho and Short compared the children 's health care in the United States to the care provided in other industrialized countries and found that despite higher per capita spending , " the United States ranks third - highest among 30 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in the percentage of the population lacking health insurance , with one in seven people uninsured . "
They estimate the number of uninsured children in the U.S. to be more than 8 million .
The literature clearly indicates this lack of coverage leads to " lower access to medical care and lower use of health care services , " the authors wrote .
It may even be reflected in relatively high child morbidity rates in the United States , they argued .
Moreover , lack of health care for children has long - term effects as those children become adults .
" The collective body of research that we have reviewed , " Ho and Short said , " provides compelling evidence that covering all children in the United States with health insurance will yield immediate improvements in the health of children , as well as long - term returns of greater health and productivity in adulthood .
The upfront incremental costs of universal health insurance coverage for children are relatively modest , and they will be offset by the value of increased health capital gained in the long term . "

NASA is dithering about whether its future plans should include a Moon base or focus on missions further out into the solar system , New Scientist reports .
Speaking yesterday , the agency 's acting administrator , Chris Scolese , suggested " a shift in the agency 's direction " , from his predecessor Mike Griffin 's commitment to a lunar outpost as part of a slated 2020 manned return to the Moon .
However , Scolese told the Subcommittee on Commerce , Justice , Science , and Related Agencies of the House Committee on Appropriations : " We were looking at an outpost on the Moon , as the basis for that [ 2020 ] estimate and that one is being revisited .
" It will probably be less than an outpost on the Moon , but where it fits between sorties , single trips , to the Moon to various parts and an outpost is really going to be dependent on the studies that we 're going to be doing . "
These " studies " seem to involve largely bypassing the Moon and focusing instead on more ambitious goals .
Sciolese elaborated : " Recall [ that ] the Vision [ for Space Exploration ] was not just to go to the Moon as it was in Apollo , it was to utilise space to go on to Mars and to go to other places .
" We 've demonstrated over the last several years that with multiple flights we can build a very complex system reliably - the space station - involving multiple nations ... and we 'll need something like that if we 're going to go to Mars . "
He further teased : " So what I would like to see from NASA over time is an architecture that ... will give us flexibility for taking humans beyond low - Earth orbit and allowing us to have options for what we can do at the Moon as well as other destinations ... [ like ]
Mars or an asteroid … so that there are options on what we do in 2020 . "
What NASA 's plans finally include is in part dependent on the as - yet - undecided 2010 budget - due to be released as a detailed proposal this month .
Congressman Alan Mollohan , the subcommittee 's chair , was evidently unimpressed with NASA 's vague " flexibility " concept , and demanded : " Does the 2010 budget request impact in any way our target - is this so complicated - our target of getting to the moon by 2020 ?
Is there any consideration being given within the organisation to not attempting to meet the 2020 Moon [ return ] … is there any reconsideration of going there ?
What is going on here ? "
Doug Cooke , NASA 's associate administrator for exploration systems , replied : " The direction that we have is to continue to pursue the 2020 date . "
He did , however , note that the agency was " still assessing how the 2010 budget might affect that . " ®
Just a couple of days ago we reported that the MPAA 's website was vulnerable to an XSS attack , which left it displaying torrents from The Pirate Bay .
This time a flaw has been discovered in the RIAA 's site , which now allows it to display Torrent Freak 's latest articles .
A cross-site scripting ( XSS ) attack is a kind of security vulnerability typically found in web applications which allows code to be injected into web pages .
The ‘ cross site ’ element explains how a malicious website could load another site into a frame , giving the appearance that the data all originates from the target site .
Last year we reported that the RIAA ’s website had suffered an XSS attack and just a couple of days ago we revealed how the MPAA site was vulnerable to an XSS attack too , one which left it embarrassingly displaying torrents from The Pirate Bay .
Now it is the RIAA ’s turn ( again ) to suffer the same fate .
Vektor , who also discovered the MPAA site exploit , told TorrentFreak that he had managed to find a security hole in RIAA.com too .
He demonstrated this by using an iframe – an HTML element which makes it possible to embed an HTML document inside another HTML document – Torrent Freak for example .
RIAA.com featuring TorrentFreak
As with the MPAA site exploit , Vektor explains that his work on the RIAA site is a proof of concept and should be taken as a joke .
We ’re sure the RIAA and MPAA coders will be laughing heartily as they try to plug these holes .
He is for sure a professional dancer and that 's why no one can do what he can do , yes he is none other than the unmatchable " Shane ...

More retailers are accepting food stamps , which can be used to buy breads , cereals , fruits , vegetables , dairy products and fish , meat and poultry .
EBT BENEFITS EBT BENEFITS
Food stamp purchases that are permitted and those that are banned : Eligible food : Breads , cereals
Fruits , vegetables
Meats , fish , poultry
Dairy products
Seeds and plants that produce food for the household to eat Ineligible items :
Beer , wine , liquor , cigarettes or tobacco
Non -food items , such as pet foods , soaps , paper products , household supplies , vitamins and medicines
Hot foods and foods eaten in the store Source : U.S. Department of Agriculture More retailers are accepting food stamps , as a record number of consumers are turning to government aid to pay for groceries .
Nearly 39 million people received food stamps — now known as Electronic Benefit Transfers — in April 2009 , up about 20 % over April 2008 .
Retailers ranging from some Costco ( COST ) stores — yes , quarts of capers do qualify — to 7 - Eleven to Target ( TGT ) are moving quickly to cater to cash - strapped customers .
To accept the debit - card - like EBT cards , stores must meet at least one of the following conditions :
• They regularly sell at least three varieties of foods in each of four categories — breads / cereals ; dairy products ; fruits and vegetables ; and meat , fish or poultry — and at least two of the categories must include perishable foods .
• Or more than half of total gross sales must be in " staple foods , " which means no candy , soft drinks or prepared foods .
In its third - quarter earnings report July 8 , Family Dollar cited EBT as among the reasons for its success in this economy .
Same - store sales were up 6.2 % for the quarter , and food and beverages gained the most .
Food stamps represent " a significant opportunity for us , " said CEO Howard Levine .
EBT spending at Family Dollar ( FDO ) was up 18 % from March 2008 to March 2009 , says spokesman Josh Braverman .
Last month , Target extended its acceptance of EBT benefits from its Super Target and other stores with expanded food selections to all 1,700 stores .
Costco this month started testing its checkout technology at six New York City locations to prepare for EBT acceptance .
Joe Portera , executive vice president and COO of Costco 's Eastern and Canadian divisions , says Costco members began asking to use EBT cards in the last six months .
" This is the right thing to do , " says Portera .
" We 'll ultimately need to expand the program to our other stores , so right now , we 're working out any bugs in the system . "
Other retailers accepting EBT : • BJ's Wholesale Club , ( BJS ) which began accepting food stamps in 1999 in Maine and Upstate New York , began taking EBT in all of its stores in April .
• More than half of the 5,700 7 - Eleven stores in the U.S. now accept EBT .
The chain has seen an increase of about 13 % in such purchases in the last nine months , says Scott Robertson , vice president of field merchandising for 7 - Eleven .
The stores have added private - label products that are up to 20 % cheaper than brand names ; about half of the 200 products can be purchased with EBT cards .
• About 5,000 of the 7,000 CVS ( CVS ) stores accept EBT , and the chain is adding more stores " to meet the needs of customers … in these challenging economic times , " says spokeswoman Erin Pensa .

Repairs to two small helium leaks in the world 's largest atom smasher will delay the restart of the giant machine another month until November , a spokesman for the operator said .
James Gillies said an additional setback to the timing could result if some other problem is found , but the European Organisation for Nuclear Research is taking pains to make sure it avoids another major shutdown like the electrical failure of Sept. 19 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Essentially what 's happening is we 're proceeding with extreme caution , " Gillies said .
" We have to be absolutely certain that when we switch on this time , it stays switched on . "
The organisation , which is known as CERN , has nearly finished examining the 10,000 electrical interconnections like the one that failed in September .
Originally CERN said it expected to start test collisions in April , but that start up date has been pushed back several times already , most recently to October .
" Decisions will be taken as to whether there are more that need repairing or not within the next couple of weeks , and when we know that , we will be in a position to be a little bit more definitive about what we plan to do for the rest of the year , " Gillies said .
If a November start holds , it will still take until December for the accelerator in a 27 - kilometre circular tunnel under the Swiss - French border to start producing collisions of subatomic particles .
Only then will physicists be able to probe deeper into the make - up of matter .
They hope the fragments that come off the collisions will show on a tiny scale what happened one - trillionth of a second after the so - called Big Bang , which many scientists theorise was the massive explosion that formed the universe .
The theory holds that the universe was rapidly cooling at that stage and matter was changing quickly .
The leaks currently being repaired were found in the system that uses liquid helium to bring the temperature inside the accelerator to near absolute zero , colder than outer space .

That low temperature makes it possible to use the massive superconducting electromagnets that control the beams of particles that will fly in both directions around the accelerator at near the speed of light until the scientists make them collide .
CERN expects repairs and additional safety systems to cost about $ 37 million over the course of several years , covered by the organisation 's budget .
The overall Large Hadron Collider project cost $ 10 billion .
Iran / Persia Print This Iran : Some Dots You May Want To Connect By Editorial .
Moon of Alabama .
Axis of Logic Moon of Alabama
Editor 's Comment : Before you start connecting the dots , consider this :
The attempt to discredit the elections and cause instability in Iran look very much like a scheme we 've seen before - directly out of the CIA playbook .
We 've seen this pattern in so many elections in Venezuela , for example , I swear that even the Chavistas would be disappointed if it does n't reappear next time around .
After all , a little drama does add some excitement in elections where consistent landslide victories are won by presidents like Chavez and Ahmadinejad .
So here we go again - the old Langley one , two , three : Groom an opposition candidate to run against the guy you hate , pay him well and line up your media to back him .
During the campaign , sell him as the savior of the bourgeois opposition who lost their money in the revolution .
Use your own pollsters and media propaganda to convince his followers that they are going to win by a wide margin .
When your guy loses , scream " FRAUD ! "
It 's akin to yelling " FIRE ! " in a crowded theatre , inflaming all those disappointed bourgeois counter - revolutionaries .
Get them out on the street , setting fires , playing the victim , waving flags , ready - to - go placards , banners , women crying in front of CNN cameras and men yelling angrily into Christiana Amanpour 's microphone .
Only this time , they 're ready to burn their own flag instead of the U.S. flag .
I tell ya , it makes great TV for a western audience .
( Incidentally , do n't take Christiana 's reports too seriously .
The Amanpours , like many Iranian expats , led a privileged life under the Shah of Iran and lost their ill gotten wealth as a result of the Iranian revolution in ' 79 .
Naturally , Christiana was very upset .
Later , she married James Rubin , an arch - Zionist , and regained her status , good money and even some fame , this time as a CNN reporter in service to the empire . )
Mir Hussein Mousavi followed his script , declared to his followers that the election was invalid instead of graciously accepting defeat .
CIA 's shill , Manuel Rosales , did exactly the same thing in Venezuela when he lost large to President Chavez in 2006 .
The opposition came out and banged their pots and pans , then went home to bed .
When Ahmadinejad reached out to Mousavi and his followers , offering to give them a part in the new government , Mousavi rejected the offer .
Folks , these are not exactly marks of a real statesman , ready to lead a nation .
Yes , they 'll succeed in smearing Iran and marring this election in the minds of those who prejudged them before they took place .
The CIA / Mossad duo can be proud of the pain and confusion they 've caused in Iran and worldwide .
Now they 've got some video of some angry Iranians to show their bosses for a pat on the head .
But if they think that they can destabilise Iran by getting a few thousand Iranians out on the streets of Teheran , they 're even dumber than I thought .
Manucher Ghorbanifar Mir Hussein Mousavi Indeed , connect the dots below , get acquanted with Manucher Ghorbanifar and find out a little more about Hussein Mousavi , the U.S. - backed candidate before you buy the western media line about fraud in the 2009 Iranian election .

Moon of Alabama Editorial ...
In any ordinary business , Manucher Ghorbanifar would cut an implausibly mysterious figure .
Officially , he has been a shipping executive in Tehran and a commodities trader in France .
By his own account he was a refugee from the revolutionary government of Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini , which confiscated his businesses in Iran , yet he later became a trusted friend and kitchen adviser to Mir Hussein Mousavi , Prime Minister in the Khomeini government .
Some U.S. officials who have dealt with Ghorbanifar praise him highly .
Says Michael Ledeen ** , adviser to the Pentagon on counterterrorism : " He is one of the most honest , educated , honorable men I have ever known . "
Others call him a liar who , as one puts it , could not tell the truth about the clothes he is wearing .
The Murky World of Weapons Dealers , Time Magazine , Jan. 19 , 1987 ... On or about November 25 , 1985 , Ledeen received a frantic phone call from Ghorbanifar , asking him to relay a message from the prime minister of Iran to President Reagan regarding the shipment of the wrong type of HAWKs .
United States v. Robert C. McFarlane , Walsh Iran Contra Report , 1985 ... Franklin , along with another colleague from Feith 's office , a polyglot Middle East expert named Harold Rhode , were the two officials involved in the back - channel , which involved on - going meetings and contacts with Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar and other Iranian exiles , dissidents and government officials .
... The administration 's reluctance to disclose these details seems clear : the DoD -Ghorbanifar meetings suggest the possibility that a rogue faction at the Pentagon was trying to work outside normal US foreign policy channels to advance a " regime change " agenda not approved by the president 's foreign policy principals or even the president himself .
Iran-Contra II ? , Washington Monthly , September 2004 ... Late last year , Congress agreed to a request from President Bush to fund a major escalation of covert operations against Iran , according to current and former military , intelligence , and congressional sources .
These operations , for which the President sought up to four hundred million dollars , were described in a Presidential Finding signed by Bush , and are designed to destabilize the country ’s religious leadership .
...
“ The Finding was focused on undermining Iran ’s nuclear ambitions and trying to undermine the government through regime change , ” a person familiar with its contents said , and involved “ working with opposition groups and passing money . ”
Preparing the Battlefield , The New Yorker , July 7 , 2008 ... The Ukrainian Orange phenomenon was modeled quite explicitly on the example of the Rose Revolution , which featured a disputed election , massive youth - oriented street protests , and plenty of subsidies from U.S. government agencies .
The ' Color ' Revolutions : Fade to Black , Antiwar , September 29 , 2006 .
... The Pentagon and US intelligence have refined the art of such soft coups to a fine level .
RAND planners call it ‘ swarming , ’ referring to the swarms of youth , typically linked by SMS and web blogs , who can be mobilized on command to destabilize a target regime .
Color Revolutions , Geopolitics and the Baku Pipeline " , Engdahl , ( no date ) ... Even before the count began , Mousavi declared himself “ definitely the winner ” based on “ all indications from all over Iran . ”
He accused the government of “ manipulating the people ’s vote ” to keep Ahmadinejad in power and suggested the reformist camp would stand up to challenge the results .
...
“ It is our duty to defend people ’s votes .
There is no turning back , ” Mousavi said , alleging widespread irregularities .
Iran declares win for Ahmadinejad in disputed vote , Associated Press , June 13 , 2009 More On The Iran Election
There is a full effort of the " western " media and some expatriate Iranian organizations to de-legitimize the Iranian election despite the absence of any real evidence of voting fraud .
These events show all characteristics of an engineered " color evolution " .
As said before I find the reelection of Ahmadinejad quite plausible .
He has done a lot for the poor and the elections were for a decent part class based .
As Robert Fisk relates from someone not - regime - friendly in Tehran :
But I must repeat what he said .
" The election figures are correct , Robert .
Whatever you saw in Tehran , in the cities and in thousands of towns outside , they voted overwhelmingly for Ahmadinejad .
Tabriz voted 80 per cent for Ahmadinejad .
It was he who opened university courses there for the Azeri people to learn and win degrees in Azeri .
In Mashad , the second city of Iran , there was a huge majority for Ahmadinejad after the imam of the great mosque attacked Rafsanjani of the Expediency Council who had started to ally himself with Mousavi .
They knew what that meant : they had to vote for Ahmadinejad . "
My guest and I drank dookh , the cool Iranian drinking yoghurt so popular here .
The streets of Tehran were a thousand miles away .
" You know why so many poorer women voted for Ahmadinejad ?
There are three million of them who make carpets in their homes .
They had no insurance .
When Ahmadinejad realised this , he immediately brought in a law to give them full insurance .
Ahmadinejad 's supporters were very shrewd .
They got the people out in huge numbers to vote – and then presented this into their vote for Ahmadinejad . "
The myth in the " western " media is that Ahmadinejad is a " right - wing hardliner " .
While he asserts nationalism and sovereignty as any president should do , in interior politics and economics , dominant in elections everywhere , his position is more to the left of the typical " western " right - left scale .
The argument favored by Juan Cole and others that high inflation and high unemployment numbers should have favored Mousavi and the ' reformers ' backed by Iran 's richest man Rafsanjani .
But those numbers , as asserted in the " west " , are not what they are said to be .
Unfortunately the myth that is currently created , will likely be used to favor the agenda of the war mongers .
We will all be in trouble if their argument wins .
This whole issue will do wonders for oil speculators and thereby snuff up any " green shots " .

He is an advisor to Bush advisor and to presidential campaign mastermind Karl Rove .
In 1981 - 86 , Ledeen was a special advisor and consultant to top policy officials in the Reagan administration , including the Secretary of State , National Security Advisor and the Office of the Secretary of Defense .
Ledeen was deeply involved in the Iran - Contra affair while a consultant to National Security Advisor Robert C. McFarlane , and there was much controversy over the intricate details of Ledeen 's role including his involvement with various Israeli figures and with Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar .
He gave his version of the affair in the book Perilous Statecraft : An Insiders Account of the Iran - Contra Affair .
Ledeen 's biographical notes , posted on the AEI website and elsewhere , boast that he is one of the world 's leading authorities on intelligence , contemporary history and international affairs , and that " in a few years in government he carried out some of the most sensitive and dangerous missions in recent American history . "
They quote a profile as saying " this is a man who has helped shape American foreign policy at its highest levels �as Ted Koppel puts it , ' Michael Ledeen is a Renaissance man� in the tradition of Machiavelli . "
Ledeen is the author of 15 books , among them The War Against the Terror Masters ( published in 2002 , highly - praised by Bernard Lewis ) ; Tocqueville on American Character ; Machiavelli of Modern Leadership , and Freedom Betrayed : How American Led a Global Democratic Revolution , Won the Cold War and Walked Away .
Ledeen writes for the Wall Street Journal , The International Economy , the American Spectator , the New York Sun and National Review and so on .
( In addition to promulgating his ultra - hawkish views , he writes about contract bridge for the Wall Street Journal and New York Sun ) .
Following the military campaign in Iraq , Ledeen has been urging that the U.S. take on Iran and Syria , in terms that are worry some observers .
He dubs Iran " the mother of modern terrorism , " and told JINSA on April 30 , 2003 that now is the time for Iranian " liberation . "
He also said it is " clear that Saudi Arabia is the main financier of terrorism , and that mosques and schools built by the Saudis continue to preach the Wahhabi doctrine of global Jihad ( holy war ) against non-believers and urging that arms be taken up against the U.S. , Israel and their allies . "
Ledeen said the Middle East is on the verge of drastic change , and concluded by saying , " the time for diplomacy is at an end ; it is time for a free Iran , free Syria and free Lebanon . "
According to Ledeen , the process by which this should be achieved is a violent one , termed " total war . "
" Total war not only destroyed the enemy 's military forces , but also brings the enemy society to an extremely personal point of decision , so that they are willing to accept a reversal of the cultural trends , " Ledeen writes .
" The sparing of civilians lives cannot be the total war 's first priority �
The purpose of total war is to permanently force your will onto another people . "
He wrote an article in March 2003 in the New York Post about " The story of Iran 's mad dash to develop nuclear weapons . "
He claimed that " the relationship between Iran and North Korea is still under appreciated , " and that " the mullahs are determined to obliterate Israel . "
He suggested that Iran could be like a state suicide bomber , attacking Israel with nuclear weapons even if it knows that Israel would retaliate and wipe Iran off the map .
" Why are we doing nothing to support the Iranian people 's efforts to rid themselves of their monstrous regime ? "
He criticized Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage for saying that Iran is a democracy .
" Why are we making deals with Iranian - sponsored Shiites regarding the future of Iraq ? " Ledeen asked .
" Will we finally move against all the components of the " Axis of Evil , " or must we wait until President Bush 's analysis is confirmed by a new act of horror ? "
In an April 14 , 2003 article in The Australian he called for regime change in Syria and Iran .
" No one I know wants to wage war on Iran and Syria , but there is now a clear recognition that we must defend ourselves against them .
They are an integral part of the terror network that produced 11 September .
Left undisturbed , they will kill us in Iraq and Afghanistan and mount new attacks on our homelands . "
He said unlike Iraq there is no need for a military campaign .
" Our most potent weapons are the peoples of Syria and Iran and they are primed , loaded and ready to fire .
We should now pull the political lanyards and unleash democratic revolution on the terror masters in Damascus and Tehran . "

T here was a massive protest organized in London recently .
More than 1,00,000 people attended it .
At least 10,000 bought the Eelam flag .
Each cost 10 pounds .
In your currency , that is like a total of Rs 1 crore .
Now , will someone tell us where that money went ?
These benamis and operators of the LTTE are worse than termites .
But , will the common Sri Lankan Tamil go back to his homeland if a conducive environment is provided ?
They are all leading a comfortable life here .
Their children are European citizens and speak French , Dutch etc .
They wo n't give all this up and go back .
Most of these people did not flee Sri Lanka because of the war .
It is like people from Kerala go to the Gulf nations .
They came here for a better life and opportunities .
There is nothing for these people back home in Sri Lanka .
Finally , what do you think is Prabhakaran 's biggest mistake ?
I have n't faced a tougher question in my life .
For , he has committed so many mistakes .
But the biggest , in my book , would be the fact that he killed the political dream of the Tamil people .
One anonymous Air France pilot suggested that a bomb could " very well " be the cause of the crash .
He said : " One can very well imagine that a bomb caused the aircraft 's depressurisation and that the plane took time to break up .
It could just as well have been a big bomb that blew up the entire plane , which would explain why the aircraft did n't have time to send an alert signal . "

Ryanair boss , Michael O'Leary , insisted today that it will cost passengers a pound to spend a penny as he confirmed plans to charge for toilets on his aeroplanes within two years .
The chief executive of Europe 's largest budget carrier said the airline would also generate extra revenues by removing two out of the three toilets on its Boeing 737-800 jets and filling the space with up to six seats .
O'Leary first mooted the toilet charges in February , prompting his press officer to warn that the outspoken executive " makes a lot of this stuff up as he goes along " .
However , O'Leary confirmed that he will ask Boeing to look at putting credit card readers on toilet locks for new aircraft .
" We are serious about it , " said O'Leary , who has acquired the nickname Michael O'Really within aviation circles for some of his more outlandish claims .
He added : " We are flying aircraft on an average flight time of one hour around Europe .
What the hell do we need three toilets for ? "
He denied that Ryanair was considering the ploy to make a profit from toilet breaks .
" It 's not because we need to generate money from the jacks .
But ... if you get rid of two [ toilets ] you can get six seats on a 737 .
They will all be scurrying to the toilet before the departure gate . "
Asked if he would be interested in charging £ 5 a toilet visit in order to eliminate the need for the loo altogether , he said : " If someone wanted to pay £ 5 to go to the toilet I would carry them myself .
I would wipe their bums for a fiver . "
O'Leary added that Boeing 's research department would now be able to work on the toilet concept because " war in Iraq and Afghanistan is winding down " .
Ryanair is one of the pioneers of the add - on fees that are a distinctive feature of the low - cost business model and makes huge profits from imposing service charges that would have been unthinkable 20 years ago , such as bag check - in fees .
A poorly judged investment in Irish rival Aer Lingus pushed Ryanair into its first annual loss in 20 years today , but the airline is profitable once those losses are stripped out , helped by a 23 % increase in revenues from add - on charges to € 598 m ( £ 518 m ) .
Those so - called ancillary revenues now play an increasingly important role in underpinning Ryanair 's profits and a loo fee will only increase their profitability .
Arecent report from the Pentagon found that 74 of the 534 men freed from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility were “ confirmed or suspected of re-engaging in terrorist activities . ”
That may be a high number -- other studies have found that only about 4 % of the detainees have returned to terrorism after their release .
But any recidivism raises a crucial question :
Are the United States and its allies doing enough to prevent released detainees from “ returning to the battlefield ” ?
President Obama has said he will close the Guantanamo prison by January 2010 , and it appears likely that a substantial number of the approximately 240 detainees who remain there will be sent home or relocated to third countries .
If the past is any indication , these men are likely to have trouble building new lives .
Last year , we interviewed 62 released Guantanamo detainees from nine countries in Europe , the Middle East and Southern Asia .
We found that although many harbored negative feelings toward the U.S. government , most simply wanted to reintegrate into their families and communities .
But they found it difficult to do so .
Advertisement
Nearly all suffered from what we call the “ Guantanamo stigma , ” a presumption in their communities that they were dangerous men , even though the U.S. had never convicted them of a crime .
Only six of the 62 had been able to find permanent jobs .
Many had lost property , and their families had been driven into debt during their absence .
One released detainee , a highly educated businessman whose family had lived in Europe while he was in captivity , said his children found it complicated to explain why their father was in Guantanamo , so they simply told people he was in jail .
“ You ca n’t express to a child that there is something in this world called ‘ detention without trial , ’ where the rule of law does n’t exist , ” he said , noting that children assume that “ if you ’re in jail , you must be bad , because that ’s what society does to bad people . ”
Other former detainees reported that they were rejected by their families or were shunned and unable to find wives .
The wife of a man from the Middle East left him while he was in Guantanamo and returned to live with her family .
Now , he said , “ I have a plastic bag that I carry with me all the time .
I sleep every night in a different mosque . ”
A detainee from Europe , a shop owner before his detention , returned home to learn that his father had been murdered weeks before and that his estranged wife had taken their children to another part of the country .
No one would hire him or lend him money to open a business .
“ I was living in hell in Guantanamo .
And when I returned home , it was another hell , ” he said .

Yet another man , a highly educated Afghan professional and community leader who , while in Guantanamo , taught many of his countrymen to read and write , expressed frustration that his time in the camp indelibly marred his reputation and career .
He returned home to find that his office had been ransacked and shuttered .
He is demoralized and withdrawn , and he says he no longer feels able to take an active role in his community .
Two - thirds of the former detainees we interviewed reported psychological problems stemming from their confinement .
Memories of being short - shackled in stress positions , subjected to extreme temperatures and exposed to violence by guards remained vivid for many .
Others complained of memory loss , depression and nightmares .
“ I think I ’m still back there , with chains and guards swearing at me , ” said one man .
A man from Europe in his mid-20s said that after being released , he experienced flashbacks to Guantanamo and found it difficult to trust his wife and parents .
“ I went to see a psychiatrist who told me I was suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder , ” he said .
“ But it was expensive .
He charged me around $ 150 .
After that , I simply could n’t afford more visits . ”
Released detainees told us what they wanted most was the opportunity to put Guantanamo behind them and get on with their lives .
Yet 45 of the 62 former detainees said they received no significant support from their governments or private charities to help them start anew .
“ I lost everything as a result of being detained in Guantanamo .
I ’ve lost my property .
I ’ve lost my job .
I ’ve lost my will , ” said one Afghan detainee , a former medical professional who claims he was sent to Guantanamo because a rival tribe falsely denounced him to the Americans .

The reports are alarming .
Without social and psychological support , former detainees often find themselves destitute , which puts them at risk of drifting to radical mosques where , in addition to receiving food and a place to sleep , they listen to anti-American diatribes .
As the U.S. prepares to close Guantanamo , it also needs to plan for post - release services to help detainees reintegrate into their communities .
U.S. - supported programs should provide former detainees with job training and psychological support and help them secure stable employment .
Such programs are very much in our interest .
By helping to re-anchor released detainees in their communities , we will reduce the risk of terrorist attacks against the United States .
The night that Who drummer Keith Moon smashed his Rolls - Royce into the side wall of the Royal Court Theatre and broke into Helen Mirren 's dressing room , demanding to join her on stage , is a rare anecdote shared by both the theatre and rock fraternities .
By 1974 , " Moon the Loon " was infamous for his toilet pyrotechnics and creative assaults on hotel rooms .
Some might say he invented the genre .
The incident was more notable for throwing light on the play in question – David Hare 's Teeth 'n ' Smiles – in which a heavy - rock band on the point of implosion turn up to play an Oxbridge May Ball .
Despite a cast including Mirren , Cherie Lunghi and Antony Sher , Hare 's third play was not his best .
A recent revival at the Sheffield Crucible received lukewarm reviews .
The problem ?
Real rock 'n 'roll invariably trumps its fictional counterpart , as Moon 's theatrics during the original run seemed to prove .
Can theatre and rock music ever mix ?
It 's a question that rears its poodle - haired head every few years or so .
Whether the answer is to be found in anything other than a greatest - hits medley hung on a paint - by - numbers plot is another matter .
The new play this time is Nevermind , a fringe piece at the Old Red Lion Theatre in Islington , North London about a manic depressive music journalist visited by the ghost of Kurt Cobain .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" I 've always been interested in writing about music , " says its author Martin Sadofski , erstwhile vocalist in Bradford - based indie band The Passmore Sisters , who recorded two Peel sessions back in the 1980s .
" But Nevermind is a play about failure .
The main character , John , is facing a battle of whether to take his life , or to make something of it .
And Cobain appears as his alter ego : a success who could n't deal with it , as opposed to John , a failure who can't deal with it . "
For Sadofski , who also has a BBC4 film about Marvin Gaye in the works , musical heroes are ripe for characterisation .
" The thing with musicians is that they put on a front .
People get into bands not to be themselves but to be someone else .
And when it all starts to crumble , due to drink , drugs or simply because their music has become passé , the submerged personality tends to come out .
I think that 's their appeal for writers . "
Why then do so few playwrights manage to convert the subject into something meaningful on stage ?
Many have tried , not least Hollywood actor Christopher Walken , whose surreal exploration of the afterlife of Elvis Presley , Him , debuted at the 1995 New York Shakespeare Festival with its author in the lead role .
A cult hero in his own right , Walken got mixed reviews .
While the New York Times praised " the sharpness and wit of the writing " , other critics called his play " a farrago of nonsense " , " garbage " or worse , " maudlin masturbation " .
Similarly , British reviewers deemed David Harrower 's 2000 play Presence , which dramatised The Beatles ' early residency at the Star Club in Hamburg , a limp affair in comparison to the rest of his oeuvre .
Their main criticism ?
That Harrower had mislaid half the Fab Four from his script .
Whatever happened to creative licence ?
Perhaps , suggests Robert Graham , author , playwright and lecturer in creative writing at Manchester Metropolitan University , adulation is simply not a good starting point for writing .
We talk of fan literature but rarely use the term to denote quality .
Graham 's own Smiths - inspired drama , If You Have Five Seconds to Spare , played a short sell - out run at Manchester 's Contact Theatre in 1989 , but , significantly , Morrissey did not feature .
Instead , the play revolved around your typical angst - ridden Smiths obsessive holed up in a bedsit .
" Most of us , " says Graham , " no matter how big a fan of music we may be , do n't know that much about the reality of life in the music biz , or what Morrissey or Lennon or Elvis are really like as people .
What we do know about is the experience of listening to a song and completely empathising with the feeling that the words and music together make .
And that , to me , is where imaginative writing and popular music may have a fruitful relationship . "
Except perhaps for old Moz. Graham and the singer shared a hairdresser at the time and thanks to Dave the Demon Barber , Morrissey received a copy of the Five Seconds script to read .
" At my next haircut , Dave reported his reaction , which was ' What made me think he would like it ? ' , " says Graham .
" I can laugh now I 've got no hair and Morrissey is losing his . "
" Reminiscences of rock heroes can be tedious , " wrote one reviewer of The Ballad of Crazy Paola , Flemish playwright Arne Sierens ' tribute to one couple 's hedonistic music past , which played in translation at London 's Arcola Theatre last autumn .
The same could be said of reunions .
Few can forget ( though writer Andrew Upton , aka Mr Cate Blanchett , may wish to ) the recent London run of Riflemind , a clumsy comeback tale about a once - great band that even director Philip Seymour Hoffman could not save from early closure at the Trafalgar Studios .
In the words of The Independent 's Paul Taylor : " God knows , the deliberations that must have dragged on in order to bring the no-longer - boyish boyband Take That back ...
I would prefer , though , to sit through a dramatisation of the minutes of those meetings than take another look at this show . "
Like real rock reunions , the boredom and / or cringe factor of watching a bunch of old codgers on stage can be too much to take .
But there are exceptions .
Mike Packer 's 2007 hit , tHe dYsFUnCKshOnalZ ! , at the Bush Theatre brilliantly satirised a fictional punk band re-recording their anarchic anthem " Plastic People " for a credit card advert .
Critics praised the sub -Spinal Tap knowingness of the piece , but also – rare for such a play – the music , which was performed live in front of a wall that crashed down in a cloud of dry ice ( with no Keith Moon to help it ) .
And talking of Plastic People , there 's Tom Stoppard 's Rock 'n ' Roll , an epic mash of pop and politics that , perhaps more than any other play about music , laid adequate claim to its own title .
During years of political and social upheaval in Czechoslovakia , The Plastic People of the Universe were a band who refused to compromise either their music or their morals .
That Stoppard did not compromise them in turn is perhaps why Rock 'n ' Roll is his best play since Arcadia .
When the final scene cuts to a live track from the Rolling Stones ' album No Security , it 's not laziness on the playwright 's part , but because the music says all that needs to be said .
" Rock 'n ' roll does n't necessarily mean a band , " Malcolm Maclaren once announced .
" It does n't mean a singer , and it does n't mean a lyric , really .
It 's that question of trying to be immortal . "
Or in the words of Kurt Cobain : " If it 's illegal to rock and roll , throw my ass in jail . "

MOSCOW  Russian military forces began large - scale war games on Monday in the Caucasus region , not far from the Georgian border , raising tensions between the countries less than a year after they went to war .
In a series of news conferences on Monday , military officials said that about 8,500 troops from all branches of the armed services would take part in a week of exercises , the largest such war games since the fall of the Soviet Union .
The officials noted that the exercises were intended in part to incorporate lessons learned from the war last August .
Russia easily won , but the military officials said the war exposed deficiencies in training and equipment .
Military exercises in the Caucasus have been held before , and similar maneuvers there last year ended days before the war broke out on Aug .
7 . The war games this year are scheduled to end next Monday , the day that President Obama arrives in Moscow for a summit meeting .
Results of the trials are due to be published in July but , in response to a freedom of information request , the Government has admitted that " there are not success criteria as such " .
" This exposes a major shortcoming in the Government 's approach , " Opposition communications spokesman Nick Minchin said .
Greens senator Scott Ludlam said : " It sounds as though we 'll filter as many sites as the technology allows us to ... that 's the reason I think people are so concerned about this in that it seems to be really open - ended . "
EFA spokesman Colin Jacobs said : " The pilot seems to have been a political exercise in deflecting criticism .
Without any benchmarks , the Government can claim it was a success regardless of the cost or performance issues that ISPs encounter . "
ISP engineer and filtering critic Mark Newton said : " If I spent several hundred thousand dollars on a technology trial at work without having any idea about what the trial was attempting to test , I 'd probably be out of a job . "
The ACMA blacklist of prohibited URLs , which forms the basis of the Government 's censorship policy , contained 977 web addresses as at April 30 , according to ACMA .
The Government initially planned to censor the entire blacklist but , after widespread complaints that the list included a slew of legal R18 + and X18 + sites , the Communications Minister , Stephen Conroy , backtracked , saying he would only block the " refused classification " ( RC ) portion of the blacklist .
According to ACMA , 51 per cent of the blacklist , or 499 URLs , is RC content .
Based on the Government 's budgeting of $ 44.5 million to implement the filtering scheme , this means the policy will cost $ 90,000 per URL .
" For the cost involved with implementing a mandatory filter , you could perhaps get far more powerful results in relation to striking at the actual heart of the problem , by increasing law enforcement resources to assist with the actual targeting of the producers and distributors of abhorrent content , " Senator Minchin said .
Although the new Government plan to block just RC content will not prevent adults from surfing for porn , it is still fraught with difficulty as the RC category includes not just child pornography but anti-abortion sites , fetish sites and sites containing pro-euthanasia material such as The Peaceful Pill Handbook by Dr Philip Nitschke .
Sites added to the blacklist in error were also classified as RC , such as one containing PG - rated photographs by Bill Henson .
Senator Ludlam is concerned that the Government is testing an expanded blacklist of 10,000 sites - a 20 - fold increase on what it intends to block - despite having not defined the objectives of the policy .
He said that , if the objective was to stop the flow of child porn , filtering sites on a blacklist would not achieve this goal because the blacklist would never capture even close to all of the child - porn sites on the web and would be ineffective against peer - to - peer file sharing .
" It 's like trying to stop the drug trade by blocking one set of traffic lights , " Senator Ludlam said .
He noted that this week 's arrest of 16 Australian men for accessing a web video of an eight - year - old Russian girl being raped was the result of " people booting down doors , not a net filtering outcome " .
Senator Conroy 's spokesman , Tim Marshall , did not respond to a request for comment .
The Next iPhone
In the summer of 1994 , I landed a college internship as a programmer at a DOS / Windows development shop .
There were maybe 20 full - time programmers on the team , and , when I joined , they were nearing the end of a two - year - long project to port their flagship DOS app to Windows .
Several of the programmers were quite good , but one guy in particular had a genuine superpower : he could fix five times more bugs per day than anyone else .
At the end of a major development project , pretty much all that ’s left to do is fix bugs .
So , that guy was the first one on the team to get a Pentium - based machine , running at , if I recall correctly , 90 MHz .
( The rest of us all had 486 - based machines . )
A few hours after he ’d started using the new machine , word started to spread about just how fast it was .
“ You should see him do a build . ”
Soon there were a dozen of us crowded into his office , marveling , maybe even slobbering , at the speed of his C compiler ’s progress bar .
A new computer almost always feels faster than the one it replaces .
In the old days , though , every few years you ’d get a computer with not just a faster processor but a next - generation processor , and the resulting performance increase was dramatic .
For the Mac , those were bumps like the first 68030s and 68040s , or the first batch of PowerPCs .
For the PC , the 386 , 486 , and Pentium .
Based on information from informed sources , I believe the processor in the next - generation iPhone is going to be that kind of upgrade .
The original EDGE iPhone and iPhone 3G use the same 400 MHz processor .
Let ’s say the rumors are right — and I believe they are — that the next - generation iPhone ’s CPU will be running at 600 MHz .
In the same way that , say , a 90 MHz Pentium was more than 1.5 times as fast as a 60 MHz 486 , the 600 MHz CPU in the next iPhone will be more than 1.5 times as fast as the current 400 MHz iPhone CPU .
Much of what the iPhone does now is constrained by its CPU .
App launching speed , for one thing — faster app launching should make it feel more like switching between apps and less like quitting / relaunching them .
Web page rendering is also significantly constrained by the CPU .
When I first used NetShare I was amazed at how fast Safari on my MacBook Pro could render web pages using the iPhone ’s cell network connection .
Web page rendering on current iPhones is hindered at least as much , if not more , by the CPU than by the speed of the 3G network .
More RAM will significantly help performance , too , and I believe the new iPhones will sport 256 MB of memory , up from the 128 MB in all current models .
Prices will stay the same — $ 199 and $ 299 — but storage will increase to 16 and 32 GB .
The improved performance will be one of the major new features that Apple will tout , but the only tech specs Apple will publish will be the storage capacities — just as with previous iPhones and iPod Touches Apple wo n’t publish any specific technical information regarding RAM or the CPU .
( The CPU in particular , I believe , is something Apple regards as secret sauce . )
Industrial design changes will be subtle , perhaps very subtle .
I expect that cases designed for the iPhone 3G will continue to fit the new iPhone , and that the only colors will remain black and white .
Two other significant internal additions frequently mentioned in rumors are indeed accurate : a magnetometer ( a.k.a. a compass ) and an improved camera that will shoot video ( and improved still images , thanks to an auto - focus lens ; the existing iPhone camera lens is fixed - focus ) .
Video , in fact , will be one of the major features Apple plans to tout regarding the new model .
Last week when I linked to Cabel Sasser ’s review of the Canon SD960 , I wrote this regarding his praise for the camera ’s HD video capability :
I like my Flip , but I think the whole Flip class of pocket video cameras is ultimately doomed — the distinction between “ still ” and “ video ” cameras is quickly disappearing .
Soon they ’ll just be “ cameras ” that do both .
It occurs to me now that Flip - style dedicated video cameras are in fact getting pinched on two sides : on the high end by video - capable “ still ” cameras , and on the low end by video - capable mobile phones .
The next generation iPhone is going make this trend clear .
What the new iPhone ’s video capabilities might lack in terms of image and sound quality will be made up for by two things : convenience and software .
Convenience in that the best camera is the one you have with you , and if you ’ve always got your iPhone , you ’ve always got a camera ; software in that iPhone OS 3.0 is set to include basic video editing ( think : selecting just the good parts ) and uploading features that regular cameras , which are n’t computers and which are n’t networked , just ca n’t match .
For many casual use cases , being able to upload short clips to the web directly from your iPhone immediately after shooting the footage trumps whatever image quality advantages a camera like a Flip might hold .
So if I were a betting man , here ’s how I ’d handicap expectations for the WWDC keynote :
Would Wager Heavily Upon : A next - generation iPhone to be released in July , with roughly double the CPU horsepower and an improved video - capable camera , with 16 and 32 GB storage capacities .
Would Wager a Small Amount Upon : New iPhone prices at $ 199/299 for 16/32 GB ; 256 MB RAM on new iPhones ; existing stock of current iPhone 3Gs sold at a discount through Apple ’s web site .
( Also , in Mac news , I ’d bet a small amount on a refresh to Apple ’s notebook lineup , with a branding change where the “ MacBook Pro ” designation is used for all aluminum models , 1 and just plain non-Pro “ MacBook ” is used for plastic models . )
Would Wager a Sandwich Upon : Improved battery life for the new iPhone , despite the beefier CPU .
Would Wager Heavily Against : Anything at all related to the in - the - works tablet thingmajig .
Not going to happen at WWDC .
Would Not Wager Upon , But , Well , I ’ve Heard Things :
An “ iPhone Mini ” , with hardware roughly three - fourths the height and width of existing iPhones .
I expect to see something along these lines sooner than later , but I do not believe it ’s going to debut this July alongside the new flagship iPhones .

The buck stops with me , " she said at the time , silencing some of her critics with her characteristic bluntness .
Sacred bond
The bitter battle for custody over Elian , the six - year - old shipwreck survivor , is also one in which she has become intensely involved .
She has personally held meetings with Elian and his Miami relatives - who want to keep the boy in the United States - and with Elian 's father , who has come from Cuba to take him home .
She also met Elian 's grandmothers when they came to plead for his return to Cuba in January .
Ms Reno has never wavered from the position that Elian belongs with his father , citing the " sacred bond " that exists between father and son .
The Elian case is also close to her heart because the drama is taking place in Miami , where she grew up and served as a prosecutor .
" It is a community I was born in , raised in .
It is a community I love .
And when it 's hurting , it hurts me , " she said .
As in the Waco instance , however , her handling of the case has been questioned , following her continued failure to get the family to hand over the child .
" I am prepared to enforce the law .
But I want to be clear , if we are compelled to enforce our order we intend to do so in a reasonable , measured way , " she said at a Miami news conference .
Role models Janet Reno's path from her childhood home on the edge of the Everglades in Florida to the highest law enforcement office in the US demonstrated her drive and determination .

It 's a dog 's life , Beverly Hills style : Paris Hilton reveals her pampered pooches ' kennel mansion
Puppy love : Paris Hilton cuddles one of her dogs
It 's not quite the Hilton , but to the pampered pooches belonging to Paris Hilton , it must seem like it .
The heiress has revealed how her 13 dogs live in luxury in a miniature version of her own Beverly Hills mansion .
She posted pictures of the lavish kennel , which Paris describes as a ' Mini Doggie Mansion ' , on her Twitter micro-blogging site .
The 28 - year - old not only had a replica of her house designed , but filled it with miniature versions of her furniture .
Inside the kennel is a spiral staircase , a wardrobe for the designer dog coats , a chandelier , and ' Chewy Vuitton ' beds .
Should the dogs start feeling the California heat , the house is also air conditioned .
Writing on her Twitter page about the house , Paris enthused : ' I love and treat my puppies as if they were my own children .
' I have to admit , I may have spoiled them a little too much .
But how can I not ?
Just look at those sweet lil ' faces , they deserve to be treated like my lil ' prince and princesses :)
I love my babies . '
Home sweet home :
Three of Paris 's dogs live in a luxury garden kennel Stunning views ...
The kennel has a clear view of the pool area and greenery
Among the numerous handbag - sized dogs who live in the house are Marilyn Monroe , Dolce , Harajuku Bitch and , Prince , and the most famous of all her pooches , her Chihuahua Tinkerbell , who starred alongside her in reality TV show The Simple Life .
Amongst her Pomeranian collection is a glamorous white one named Marilyn Monroe , while Dolce is black and brown .
She also owns a bulldog named Max .

Police said the model helicopter was equipped with nine mobile phones
Police in Brazil have foiled a plot to smuggle mobile phones into a high - security prison using a remotely - controlled model helicopter .
Four people were arrested and the high - tech toy was recovered after police stopped a car near to the jail .
Mobile phones are widely used by prisoners inside jails in Brazil to continue directing criminal activities .
Earlier this year prison guards in the same state discovered that pigeons were being used to carry mobile phone parts .
It seems the plot to smuggle the mobile phones into the Presidente Venceslau high security jail in Sao Paulo state was only stymied when police stopped a car as part of a routine check .
In the boot of the vehicle they found the one - metre long model helicopter with a basket - like container attached to its base .
Inside were nine mobile phones wrapped in a disposable nappy , while another five phones were also discovered in the vehicle .
Four suspects were arrested , and the youngest , who was aged just 17 , is reported to have confessed they had been given $ 5,000 to buy and prepare the helicopter .
They were apparently to be paid the same amount if they had successfully landed the model inside the prison walls .
Prisoners in Brazilian jails routinely use mobile phones to carry on with criminal activity , and the police say the ones they recovered were probably intended to go to gang leaders inside the jail .
It is not the first time that the authorities have foiled an innovative attempt to smuggle material into a jail in Brazil .
Earlier this year Sao Paulo state prison guards uncovered a plot using pigeons to carry mobile phone parts over the walls of a jail .
Indeed , if there was a defining moment in Friday ’s debate , it was the declaration by Representative Paul Broun of Georgia that climate change is nothing but a " hoax " that has been " perpetrated out of the scientific community . "
Paul Krugman , NY Times , Betraying the Planet
Science is a " hoax " to these idiots .
The Republican Party is full of those who betray America for political contributions .
A political party that makes war against science is bound for obsolescence .
Krugman concludes with a comparison of Bush 's GWOT , which was a false metaphor , with the Republican Party 's actual war on the planet , a war against the American people .
Do you remember the days when Bush administration officials claimed that terrorism posed an " existential threat " to America , a threat in whose face normal rules no longer applied ?
That was hyperbole — but the existential threat from climate change is all too real .
Yet the deniers are choosing , willfully , to ignore that threat , placing future generations of Americans in grave danger , simply because it ’s in their political interest to pretend that there ’s nothing to worry about .
If that ’s not betrayal , I do n’t know what is .
Paul Krugman , NY Times , Betraying the Planet
America can no longer afford ignorance in Congress .
It is betrayal .
Update I : Minister of Truth has an excellent analysis of Krugman 's column and many of these issues in his diary :
" Unfair to Crazy Conspiracy Theories "
It is well worth reading and recommending .

LOS ANGELES -- A disintegrating city budget will not stand in the way of the Lakers ' victory parade , which is scheduled to follow a two - mile route from the Staples Center to the Coliseum on Wednesday .
Despite some grumbling about the cost of the celebration as city workers face layoffs and furloughs , fervent basketball fans demanded an opportunity to salute their hometown heroes .
The NBA champions and city will split the cost , each kicking in about $ 1 million for the festivities , which for the first time includes the significant expense of renting the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum .
The city will pay for police , transportation and general staff , said Mark Szabo , spokesman for Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa .
The mayor said that it was " untenable " not to have a parade , even though city officials had been meeting behind closed doors to find hundreds of millions of dollars in budget cuts .

Offer of Employment { Getting Hired} By Matthew C. Keegan
So , you�ve made it through the interview process and have received an offer of an employment .
Congratulations !
However , there are some things to consider before accepting or rejecting an offer of employment .
How you reply to these questions will determine whether the job offer is really worth it :
Is this a full time , part time , temporary , or contract position ?
As obvious as it seems , you may be getting an offer different from what you originally applied .
Try to get in writing the official offer -- if it involves heavy - duty legal language consider contacting an employment specialist or an attorney for guidance .
Will you be paid hourly , per diem , by the job , or by an hourly salary ?
How many hours are you expected to work ?
Does the company pay overtime ?
Bonuses ?
Profit Sharing ?
Is this position with a � 91 � operator [ meaning lengthy crew duty days ] or with a 135 operator [ with limited duty days ] ?
Will you be a flight attendant ?
A cabin attendant ?
A host / hostess ?
Titles make a difference because the level of pay and training will depend on how high the position is .
Will your new company pay for initial and recurrent training , i.e. , FACTS or FlightSafety ?
Do they even require it ?
What other training is offered ?
What will your benefits be ?
Will you have full health and dental coverage ?
Will you be covered under an HMO , PPO , POS , or some other plan ?
Is your company self insured , i.e. they aren�t utilizing the services of a health care provider , but paying as they go ?
What portion of the insurance costs will you pay ?
What are the caps on insurance ?
Are prescriptions covered ?
How about family members � are they covered ?
What sort of retirement plan is offered ?
401(k ) ?
Traditional pension plan ?
No plan ?
Can you afford to work for the salary offered and be responsible for your own retirement ?
How much vacation days will you receive ?
Paid holidays ?
Hard days vs. soft days ?
Personal and sick days ?
Will the company reimburse you for education expenses ?
Eyeglasses ?
Out of pocket expenses ?
Will they provide a cellular phone , laptop computer , or PDA ?
What other miscellaneous benefits are offered ?
How is catering handled ?
Aircraft supplies ?
Uniforms ?
Will you have to pay for it and seek reimbursement ?
How long does it take to be reimbursed ?
Does the company offer cash advances ?
Will you be given a company credit card ?
What types of hotels do crewmembers stay in ?
Be prepared to seek an upward adjustment in the salary offer if you believe that the offer is too low or if you will have to pay more out of your own pocket for benefits than what is customary .
Other considerations : Exactly whom will you be reporting to ?
What is the company�s policy on promotions ?
On layoffs ( severance , notice , etc. )
To whom can you go to if a problem arises ?

GLOBAL military expenditure rose by 4 % in 2008 to a record $ 1.46 trillion , according to a new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute .
Israel spends most on defence relative to its population , shelling out over $ 2,300 a person , over $ 300 more than America .
Small and rich countries , and notably Gulf states , feature prominently by this measure .
Saudi Arabia ranks ninth in absolute spending , but sixth by population .
China has increased spending by 10 % to $ 85 billion to become the world 's second largest spender .
But it is still dwarfed by America , whose outlay of $ 607 billion is higher than that of the next 14 biggest spenders combined .

In the last IΞ post , I introduced the calculus and sketched the construction of some standard mathematical objects .
In this post , I will dive a little deeper and construct of all the positive recursive types .
The proof will be in an informal style ( in particular , omitting the H constraints ) , but I have little doubt that the proof will go through .
Only a superficial familiarity with IΞ is needed to understand this proof ; I adopt a set - theoretic style notation , so the proof should be approachable .
Here ’s a quick refresher of the primitives of IΞ .
Membership is application , so when I write , this is translated into IΞ as .
Thus sets , unary predicates , and types are all the same thing .
, this is translated into IΞ as .
Thus sets , unary predicates , and types are all the same thing .
Because membership and application are identified , universal quantification and the subset relation are also .
means “ A is a subset of B ” , or “ x in A implies x in B ” .
In particular , the pattern can be interpreted as “ for every a in A , P a ” .

lead to a contradiction in this system ! ) .
I will give its definition at the end of the article .
Other symbols have their usual interpretation , and I ’ll include an appendix which gives them all precise definitions at the end .
Definition : A function is called monotone if .
Intuitively , the monotone functions correspond roughly to the functors in Haskell ; they use their parameter in a positive way ( appear to the left of an even number of arrows ) .
Definition :
The type recursion combinator μ is defined as : .
We are allowed to define things simply by giving a condition for membership like this .
Formally , this definition starts out :
This definition intuitively says , x is in μ F if x is in every type closed under F .
We will see that this definition corresponds to a type recursion combinator .
Lemma 1 : If F is monotone , then .
Proof .
Given ; show .
Expanding the definition of μ above : Given ; show .
Observe : Suppose , show .
Since , we have by definition of μ.
Letting , we have from above , so .
Therefore , ( by the monotonicity of F and ) .
QED .
Now for the easy direction :
Lemma 2 : If F is monotone , then .
Proof .
Given ; show .
By the definition of μ , we have .
Let .
We have by monotonicity of F and Lemma 1 , therefore .
QED .
Which leads us to the recursion equation .
Theorem :
If F is monotone , .
( Proof trivial by the two lemmas )
I ’m using set equality here , i.e. mutual containment , which is probably a bit weaker than Leibniz equality .
It is obvious from the definition that this fixed point is minimal .
Monotonicity is easy to prove for any of the standard positive types ( products , coproducts , functions ) .
So we can model a good variety of Haskell data types already ; however these are standard inductive ( least fixed point ) types , no infinite structures allowed .
I ’m still working on the encoding and analogous proofs for ν ( greatest fixed point ) , which is closer to Haskell .
Hopefully I ’ll be able to port many libraries ( maybe after a few totality annotations ) without having to worry about partiality .
But there are more pressing matters , such as finishing my interactive proof assistant for IΞ .

In the original version of my Optimizing Lisp Some More article , I did a bad comparison between SBCL and Clozure .
SBCL supports two different ways to declare the arguments to a function .
Clozure only supports one of those ways .
As such , my declarations did n’t matter at all to Clozure .
I updated that post with new numbers after putting in both types of declarations .
Clozure was much closer to SBCL .
I then decided to expand the list to include CMUCL , Allegro ( Personal ) , Lispworks ( Personal ) , ECL , and CLISP .
I failed to get GCL or ABCL up and running on my Mac , and Scieneer CL is n’t available for the Mac .
As it turns out , the Allegro and LispWorks versions that I have are heap limited .
Thus , they spent a great deal of time cleaning up garbage .
To try to even the playing field , I reworked the function to take the ret buffer as a third argument so that allocation is no longer inside the timing loop .
( declaim ( ftype ( function ( ( simple - array single - float ( 12 ) )
( simple - array single - float ( 3 ) )
( simple - array single - float ( 3 ) ) )
( simple - array single - float ( 3 ) ) ) mvl*-na ) )
( defun mvl *- na ( matrix vec ret )
( declare ( type ( simple - array single - float ( 12 ) ) matrix )
( type ( simple - array single - float ( 3 ) ) vec )
( type ( simple - array single - float ( 3 ) ) ret )
( optimize ( speed 3 ) ( safety 0 ) ) )
( loop for jj fixnum from 0 below 3
do ( let ( ( offset ( * jj 4 ) ) )
( declare ( type fixnum offset ) )
( setf ( aref ret jj )
( + ( aref matrix ( + offset 3 ) )
( loop for ii fixnum from 0 below 3
for kk fixnum from offset below ( + offset 3 )
summing ( * ( aref vec ii )
( aref matrix kk ) )
of - type single - float ) ) ) ) )
ret )
( let ( ( matrixes ( make - ring - of - matrixes ' ( 12 ) 4096 ) )
( vectors ( make - ring - of - matrixes ' ( 3 ) 4095 ) )
( ret ( make - array 3 : element - type ' single - float
: initial - element 0 . 0f0 ) ) )
( time ( loop for jj fixnum from 1 to 10000000
for mm in matrixes
for vv in vectors
do ( mvl *- na mm vv ret ) ) ) )
Here are the results in terms of total user time , non -GC time , and bytes allocated :
wall non-GC alloced SBCL 1.0.29 0.444s 0.444s 0 CMUCL 19f 0.567s 0.567s 0 Clozure - 64bit 1.3-r11936 1.272s 1.272s ??
0 Clozure - 32bit 1.3-r11936 5.009s 4.418s 1,200,000,000 Allegro 8.1 ( Personal ) 6.131s 2.120s 1,440,000,000 LispWorks 5.1 ( Personal ) 14.054s ??
3,360,000,480 ECL 9.6.2 33.009s ??
18,240,000,256 GNU CLISP 2.47 93.190s 77.356s 2,520,000,000
As you can see , I failed to keep most of the implementations from allocating things ( especially , ECL ) .
Intriguingly , the 32 - bit Clozure allocates a bunch where the 64 - bit Clozure does n’t seem to do so .
It looks like Allegro would be pretty competitive if it were n’t using all of this extra memory .
I ’m not sure why any of them are allocating with this code .
Do they allocate loop counters ?
loop sums ?
function parameters ?
I may delve into the assembly of some of them at a later time .
But , at this point , I ’m just going to focus on those that do n’t cons when I ’m not looking .
US law forbids private citizens from possessing any of the 842 pounds of moon rocks collected by astronauts and brought back to Earth .
Nevertheless , the allure of moon rocks is strong enough to have created a black market where moon rock fragments and dust are sold for astronomical prices .
One way to obtain a moon rock is by purchasing a plaque that the US government sometimes gives to famous people and to politicians from other countries .
They contain tiny slivers of moon rock .
Some of these gifts have drifted into the collectors ' market .
A 1998 CNN article , " Customs agents seize 4 - billion - year - old moon rock , " reported that a Florida man was arrested for trying to sell a " fingernail - sized moon rock , weighing barely more than a gram " for $ 5 million .
The rock was originally given to the Honduran government in 1973 by then - President Richard Nixon :
Customs agents , postal inspectors and NASA launched " Operation Lunar Eclipse " in September with an advertisement in USA Today seeking moon rocks , officials said .
A Florida man identified as Alan Rosen called to offer a moon rock for sale .
He told undercover agents he had bought the rock from the retired Honduran military officer , officials said .
Agents viewed the rock at a suburban Miami bank and seized it on November 18 , officials said .
Walter Cronkite got one of these plaques in 2004 .
Now that he is dead , I wonder where it will end up ?
There 's also an underground market in moon dust taken from dirty spacesuits .
From a 1993 Omni article :
Upon the Apollo astronauts ' return from each mission , NASA shipped the spacesuits to their manufacturer for inspection .
According to unpublished accounts , workers sometimes ran loops of scotch tape across them , picking up small amounts of moon dust .
One of those moon - dust tapes , purportedly made off of an Apollo 14 lunar spacesuit , showed up in a for - sale newspaper ad early in 1992 .
A man named Steve Goodman had found the tape among the papers of his late father , whose company manufactured spacesuits .
After consultation with Goodman and his lawyer , NASA decided it was n't worth the effort–or the bad publicity –to confiscate the contraband moon - dust sample .
According to Antiques Roadshow , Christie 's sold a moondust - on - tape sample for $ 300,000 .
Also from Antiques Roadshow :
At a Superior Galleries sale in Beverly Hills in October 2000 , one lucky collector named Florian Noller spotted a bag used to store artifacts collected on the moon that was taken from the Apollo 15 command module Endeavor .
He bought the bag for $ 2,300 .
When Noller looked inside the bag , he found a previously unnoticed sprinkling of moon dust along its seams .
He put scatterings of dust on little thumb - sized white cards and placed them on photos of astronaut James Irwin saluting the American flag , and then sold them in 2001 through Spaceflori , the German space memorabilia dealer he formed .
Compared to the Irwin patch , this serendipitous moon dust was a bargain : the 12 larger cards sold for $ 2,495 , the 50 smaller ones for $ 995 .
One perfectly legal way to own a moon rock is by finding or buying a lunar meteorite .
Here 's a New Scientist video ( and article ) on how to tell if a rock is from the moon :
e Bay currently has five auctions offering moon rock meteoritese .
The one shown here has a Buy It Now price of $ 34.90 and is guaranteed by the International Meteorite Collectors Association to be authentic .
My favorite is this " Rare Moon Rock ' Metal ' Piece " selling for $ 2000 :
Author and ex-Fed chair Alan Greenspan believes the US housing is on the verge of recovery despite the NAR reporting yesterday that seized properties and foreclosures continue to dominate sales ( see below ) .
If anything his comments provide Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœcopyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ at least !
Companies have entered the race of survival , the one to obtain funds .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s important to be leading the pack as resources Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcould be limitedÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ .
Their actions will dilute future earnings , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s no wonder analysts have been dragging their feet on earnings revisions !
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 15 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœvolatileÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
The USD has been the subject de jour ; various pieces appearing in both the FT and on BBC have been capable of pushing the currency to new lows .
Firstly , an opinion article in the FT once again questions the USÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ability to retain its Triple A rating and the second piece claims that Japanese government is no longer interested in buying USD denominated treasuries in favor of JPY denominated bonds .
Will certainly throw the cat amongst the pigeons when North American opens !
Other data yesterday showed that the US trade gap grew + 5.5 % to a smaller - than - forecasted $ - 27.6 b vs. - 26.1 % .
This is the first time in 8 - months that the gap widened as exports slumped to a 2 - year low , overshadowing the demand for imports .
There were some positive spins in the report , US shipments to China in the last 2 - months of the 1stQ has climbed the most in 3 - years !
The sub-categories revealed that exports declined - 2.4 % to $ 123.6 b , while demand in imports decreased - 1 % to $ 151.2 b , the fewest in 5 - years .
The IMF expects the world economy to contract - 1.3 % this year , the first time since WWII , despite the sketchy improvement in some geographical regions to global growth .
The NAR reveled yesterday that US Home prices fell the most on record in the 1stQ , y/y , ( - 14 % ) as banks ramped up the sales of seized properties and foreclosures dominating these sales .
Dominated by distress selling ( normally sold for - 20 % less ) has reduced the inventory of previously owned homes on the market ( +3.7 m vs. +3.8 m , m / m ) .
Sales are down - 3.2 % from the 4th Q and - 6.8 % , y/y .
Nonconformity amongst ECB policy makers remains .
Council member Weber said yesterday that there was Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœno needÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ for the Cbank to buy further private assets to support lending .
He believes that there is Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœno credit crunch in the euro area and therefore , there is no reason why we should surpass the banking system with our monetary - policy instrumentsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
It was only last week that the ECB cut its interest rate to 1 % ( a record low ) and announced it will also buy $ 80 b of covered bonds , a quantitative easing approach , similar to printing money .
He said that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœhistory shows that a too - generous liquidity provision of global financial markets associated with very low interest rates supported the emergence of asset - price bubblesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Dissension can only weigh on the EUR !
The USD $ currently is lower against the EUR +0.45 % , GBP +0.00 % , CHF +0.38 % and higher against JPY - 0.08 % .
The commodity currencies are higher this morning , CAD +0.40 % and AUD +0.59 % .
Despite a stronger than anticipated Canadian trade number yesterday ( +1.1 b vs. +0.5 ) , where imports fell faster than exports , the loonie managed to remain close to home .
The retreat in Canadian equities outweighed commodities plight and ended up close to a zero-sum game for the currency yesterday afternoon .
But , this morning once again the currency has continued on its merry way as both equities and commodities advance combined with the general malaise of the USD .
After last weeks violent move on the back of Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœeye - popping and questionableÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ employment numbers , it came as no surprise that there was a bias towards more advantageous levels to own the currency .
Earlier this week when the greenback clawed back some of its multi- month lows and commodities struggled , it was only natural to see some of last weeks CAD gains to be given up and hence the opportunity to own the currency .
The countryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s fundamentals are strong when compared to other G7 partners , but it exports 70 % + of its goods and services down south and 50 % of that revenue is commodity based .
With the aggressive run up over the past 5 - trading sessions , speculators would be happier to once again revisit the 1.1800 - 1900 handle .
The AUD advanced as investors speculated that this global equity market rally since Mar. continues to have legs , thus boosting demand for the higher - yielding commodity assets ( AUD , NZD and CAD ) .
Despite looking attractive , all high yielderÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s moves are aggressively overdone and itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s only natural that the market will want to consolidate sometime soon .
Fundamentals look good , the currency managed to print another 7 - month high in the O/N session as deep recession fears subside ( 0.7670 ) .
Crude is higher in the O/N session ( $ 59.53 up +68 c ) .
Oil prices stayed close to home yesterday as the market digested last weeks +10 % rally and underperforming equity markets convinced some investors that fuel consumption may not recover anytime soon .
The Chinese announcing ( the worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 2nd - biggest energy consumer ) that they increased their crude imports by +14 % last month did manage to temporarily push prices to their highest print in 6 - months .
The commodity market certainly has got ahead of its fundamentals and profit taking is probably warranted .
Dealers anticipate that US inventory levels will continue its record climb , resulting in further demand destruction .
Fundamentals show that supplies are high and rising and demand is low and falling .
Last weeks EIA crude reports revealed that inventory numbers climbed less than forecasted , but once again managed to print a new 19 - year record high .
This morning we anticipate the upward trend to be maintained .
Crude supplies rose +605 k barrels to +375.3 m , but less than the forecasted + 2.5 m gain .
Meanwhile gas supplies fell - 167 k to +212.4 m vs. a +500 k gain and distillate fuel ( heating oil and diesel ) , rose + 2.43 m barrels to +146.5 m , the highest print in 32 - months .
One should expect OPEC rhetoric to intensify ahead of this months meeting .
Gold rose as a weaker dollar and higher oil prices boosted demand for the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ as a hedge against inflation ( $ 927 ) .
The Nikkei closed 9,340 up +40 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,873 up +19 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,424 down - 1 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s eased 2 bp yesterday ( 3.18 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Treasury prices remain range bound as the Fed executed the 2nd of its buy - back program yesterday .
By weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s end we will have witnessed a total of 3 - buy - backs of varying maturities ( it will be the 17 - 19 occasion since conception in Mar . ) .
With stocks struggling to duplicate last weeks moves and the government taking a 2 - week pause in its record sale of debt has provided a small bid for the FI class .
Dealers continue to speculate that the Fed must increase its purchase program as higher yields have sent mortgage rates above the 5 % mark .
Rising long term yields will inhibit economic growth .
We are witnessing the clash of their buy - back program and the US governments borrowing requirements .

Study , it has included more than 14,000 people aged 65 and older , and more than 1,000 aged 90 or older .
Such studies can take years to bear fruit , and the results of this study are starting to alter the way scientists understand the aging brain .
The evidence suggests that people who spend long stretches of their days , three hours and more , engrossed in some mental activities like cards may be at reduced risk of developing dementia .
Researchers are trying to tease apart cause from effect :
Are they active because they are sharp , or sharp because they are active ?
The researchers have also demonstrated that the percentage of people with dementia after 90 does not plateau or taper off , as some experts had suspected .
It continues to increase , so that for the one in 600 people who make it to 95 , nearly 40 percent of the men and 60 percent of the women qualify for a diagnosis of dementia .
At the same time , findings from this and other continuing studies of the very old have provided hints that some genes may help people remain lucid even with brains that show all the biological ravages of Alzheimer ’s disease .
In the 90 +
Study here , now a joint project run by U.S.C. and the University of California , Irvine , researchers regularly run genetic tests , test residents ’ memory , track their activities , take blood samples , and in some cases do postmortem analyses of their brains .
Researchers at Irvine maintain a brain bank of more than 100 specimens .
To move into the gated Laguna Woods Village , a tidy array of bungalows and condominiums that blends easily into southern Orange County , people must meet several requirements , one of which is that they do not need full - time care .
Their minds are sharp when they arrive , whether they are 65 or 95 .
Nearly 30 Boston firefighters with pending disability claims filed for retirement yesterday , just two days before a new state law ends a controversial benefit that allows them to significantly enhance their pensions if they claim career - ending injuries occurred while filling in for a superior at a higher pay grade .
Of the 29 who filed yesterday , 25 said they were filling in for a superior at the time of their injuries , according to city officials , which makes them eligible for a pension benefit at the higher salary scale .
That perk , which can add hundreds of thousands of dollars over a retiree ’s lifetime and cost taxpayers millions , will not be available to anyone filing after today .
“ This is highly unusual , ’’ said Kathleen Kiely - Becchetti , executive director of the Boston Retirement Board , of the number of firefighters who filed for retirement yesterday while their disability claims were still pending .
The race to file yesterday is the first obvious reaction to the sweeping pension law that was passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Deval Patrick earlier this month .
The claims filed by the firefighters yesterday - and an expected rash of new claims today - could cost Boston taxpayers millions in additional payouts at a time of major budget constraints , fire officials said .
Boston Fire Commissioner Roderick J. Fraser Jr. said firefighters are clearly taking advantage of the final days before the new clampdown on enhanced pensions goes into effect .
“ The old system provided a financial incentive for people to file for accidental disability while they were filling in for supervisors , ’’ he said .
“ This illustrates that fact . ’’
Suspected disability retirement abuses and pension excesses have been a chronic problem at the Boston Fire Department , prompting an inquiry by the FBI .
A Globe review of city retirement and payroll records last year found that , over the prior six years , 102 Boston firefighters had substantially enhanced their tax - free disability pensions by claiming career - ending injuries while they were filling in for superiors at higher pay grades .
Some firefighters have sought the enhanced benefit after filling in for a superior for just one day , leading critics to call it the “ king - for - a - day ’’ provision .
Boston retirement officials said that there are 68 firefighters with pending disability pension claims .
Starting tomorrow , firefighters who file for disability pensions would see their retirement checks based on their average salary from the 12 months prior to their injury .
State fire union officials have been working hard to warn members about the new law , blasting e-mails and holding meetings with them , to make sure they understand that they will lose the opportunity to file for enhanced pension benefits if they do not file for retirement by today .

Thirteen killed at an immigration center in New York .
Eight at a nursing home in North Carolina .
Five in a house in California .
These were among the 57 people killed in mass shootings in a 30 - day period this spring in the U.S.
Meanwhile , new laws are easing restrictions on guns .
Congress recently approved a bill to allow guns in national parks .
Tennessee has passed similar measures for its state parks .
In South Carolina , a bill under debate would allow weapons on school grounds .
Texas may welcome guns into bars .
In Montana , a new law requires landlords and hotel owners to allow firearms on their premises .
The bills ’ supporters say these measures may actually help head off greater violence .
“ Crime can happen anywhere , ” says Andrew Arulanandam of the National Rifle Association .
“ The only thing that can stop a bad person with a gun is a good person with a gun .
Law enforcement ca n’t be everywhere , so law - abiding people should have as many options as possible if and when they are attacked . ”
Gun-control advocates argue that weakening laws is disastrous .
While it would n’t necessarily lead to more mass shootings , they say , it would almost certainly increase the number of gun-related murders in the U.S.
There are currently more than 11,500 each year , and America has one of the world ’s highest firearm homicide rates .
Per capita , our rate is 39 times greater than that of England , 13 times Australia ’s , and
6 times Canada’s .
“ We have the equivalent of a Virginia Tech massacre every day in this country .
It ’s just not all in one place , ” says Daniel Webster of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research .
“ It ’s what happens when a person gets mad and has easy access to a gun .
Someone is shot over a game of dice .
Had the gun not been in their hands , no one would have died . ”

( Adds comments on level 6 alert , drugs , World Health Assembly )
GENEVA , May 2 ( Reuters ) -
There has not yet been a sustained spread of H1N1 flu outside North America but a pandemic is still " imminent " , a World Health Organisation official said on Saturday .
Michael Ryan , WHO Director of Global Alert and Response , said it remained probable that the alert level would be raised from its current level of 5 to the top of the 6 - stage scale .
" We have no evidence of sustained community spread outside of North America , " he told a news briefing at the U.N. agency 's Geneva headquarters .
" We are still at Phase 5 .
" At the present time I would still propose that a pandemic is imminent , because we are seeing the disease spread , " Ryan said .
" At this point we have to expect that phase 6 will be reached , we have to hope that it is not reached . "
WHO Director - General Margaret Chan raised the pandemic alert level from 4 to 5 on Wednesday , a move that triggered pharmaceutical efforts to produce antiviral drugs and find a vaccine to fight the new strain widely known as swine flu .
Level 5 indicates that a pandemic is " imminent " .
Ryan said the WHO would send more than 2 million treatment courses of antiviral drugs to the world 's poorest countries to help them prepare for the continued spread of the virus that could expose HIV - positive patients to extra risks .
While the WHO has warned against major public events and gatherings in flu - affected areas , it still plans to go ahead with its annual World Health Assembly this month , which will draw health ministers and officials worldwide to Geneva .
" There are no plans to cancel or postpone or curtail or limit the World Health Assembly , " Ryan said .

Those who believe in the virtues of passive indexing will generally pooh - pooh the idea that one can beat the market .
But the truth is , a small percentage of people do beat the market over the long term .
Putting aside the statistical flukes ( retail investors who get lucky ) , you can still observe a group of people who have managed to beat the market over a long period of time , with a very large amount of money .
Besides Warren Buffett , several Ivy League endowment managers have consistently beat the market by a large margin , with billions of dollars at stake .
Of course , this is made possible partly because many investing instruments are available to larger institutional investors that retail investors cannot access .
But according to these managers , the trick for individual investors is n’t active trading : it ’s better asset allocation .
Here ’s how you can build your own “ Ivy League endowment fund ” using ETFs .
Mebane Faber : It ’s the Beta , Stupid !
Mebane Faber is the author of The Ivy Portfolio : How to Invest Like the Top Endowments and Avoid Bear Markets .
In an interview with Hard Assets Investor , Mr. Faber explains that individual investors wo n’t be able to replicate the alpha that endowment managers achieve , simply because they wo n’t have access to the same opportunities ( e.g. , hedge funds ) .
According to Mr. Faber , investors should instead take a cue from the allocation formula traditionally utilized by by endowment fund managers .
He believes that by allocating less to equities , individuals can reduce their beta–volatility –and thus achieve higher returns in the long run .
[ Without hedge funds , you 're left with ] five asset classes : U.S. stocks , foreign stocks , real estate , bonds and commodities .
There are a lot of caveats , but the allocation that endowments have historically made to these is approximately 20 % in each …
And you can do that using major indexes for each asset class , each of which is investable with an ETF : S&P 500 ( U.S. equities ) , MSCI EAFE ( foreign equities ) , NAREIT ( real estate ) , 10 - year Treasuries ( bonds ) and S&P GSCI ( commodities ) .
According to the article , that model portfolio has a 0.8 correlation to the endowment portfolios , so you ’re basically getting their beta but not their alpha .
Such a portfolio would be less susceptible to the wild market swings we ’ve seen in the past few years , indeed .

The Tiger Woods of Endowment Management : David Swensen
Yale ’s Money Guru Shares Wisdom with Masses at NPR.org details the model portfolio recommended by Yale ’s endowment manager , David Swensen .
( Incidentally , the portfolio also got a mention in the recent bestseller , I Will Teach You to Be Rich . )
Why is Mr. Swensen ’s recommendation so appealing ?
Well , for starters , he ’s beat the market by a wide margin over a long period of time .
( The article , written in 2006 , refers to an average 16 percent annual return over 21 years . )
He ’s also considered the top university endowment manager in the world .
For individual investors , he recommends the following model portfolio .
Note that his portfolio allocation implies that by going light on equities , but having significant bond and real estate holdings , you can get strong returns with less overall risk than you can with a stock - heavy allocation .
Swensen ’s Model Portfolio ( Using Vanguard ETFs ) :
Domestic Equity ( 30 percent ) : Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ( VTSMX )
: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ( VTSMX ) Emerging Market Equity ( 5 percent ) : Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund ( VGTSX )
: Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund ( VGTSX ) Foreign Developed Equity ( 15 percent ) : Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund ( VEIEX )
: Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund ( VEIEX ) Real Estate Investment Trusts ( 20 percent ) : Vanguard REIT Index Fund ( VGSIX )
: Vanguard REIT Index Fund ( VGSIX ) U.S. Treasury Notes and Bonds ( 15 percent ) : Vanguard Treasury Funds ( VFISX , VFITX , VUSTX )
: Vanguard Treasury Funds ( VFISX , VFITX , VUSTX ) U.S. Treasury Inflation - Protection Securities , or TIPS ( 15 percent ) : Vanguard Inflation - Protected Securities Fund ( VIPSX )

An undercover Iredell County Sheriff 's Office deputy recently purchased drugs from undercover Statesville police officers , raising questions about communications between the two agencies .
Statesville Police Chief Tom Anderson said undercover officers from his department were working a week - long case when they met with someone interested in selling a small amount of marijuana .
…
After the arrest , investigators from the sheriff 's office arrived and confirmed the seller was an undercover deputy and he was released , Anderson said .
[ Statesville Record & Landmark ]
Good thing they were able to stop that small amount of marijuana they were selling from reaching the streets .
In yet another perfect illustration of the colossal stupidity of modern drug enforcement , here 's the story of a drug transaction in which both parties turned out to be police :
Pete Guither gets it right Seriously , this is what happens when you have police posing as perps at every level of the drug business .
Drug enforcement is all about creating crimes that would never otherwise have occurred , and there are about a million ways that it can go wrong .
As funny as this story is , the harsh reality is that frequently when police sell drugs , it 's not part of a planned operation .
It 's because they are actually just straight - up selling drugs

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Forty - eight states and the District of Columbia recorded unemployment rate increases in May , the government reported Friday .
One state registered a rate decrease , and one state had no rate change .
Several states and regions posted their highest unemployment rate since the report debuted in 1976 .
Over the year , jobless rates were higher in all 50 states and the District of Columbia .
Michigan once again led the nation with a 14.1 % jobless rate , up from 12.9 % a month earlier , followed again by Oregon at 12.4 % , up from 12 % in April .
Thirteen states have rates above 10 % .
Michigan 's 1.2 percentage point increase from April was also the largest jump in the country , followed by Rhode Island 's 1 percentage point hike .
Both states are suffering from the devastation in the manufacturing sector .
Michigan , in particular , was hit by Chrysler 's plant shutdown early in the month and a series of GM plant closings .
The California , Nevada , North Carolina , Oregon , Rhode Island , South Carolina , Florida and Georgia rates were the highest for those states since the report was first issued .
Vermont recorded no change in its rate , while Nebraska 's rate declined by 0.1 percentage point to 4.4 % .
Nebraska and North Dakota tied for the lowest unemployment rates in the nation .
The national unemployment rate rose to a 26 - year high of 9.4 % in May , up from 8.9 % in April .
Nonfarm payroll employment decreased in 39 states and increased in 11 states and the District of Columbia in May .
The largest over - the - month decrease in jobs occurred in California , followed by Florida , Texas , and Michigan .
The West reported the highest regional jobless rate , 10.1 % , followed by the Midwest , 9.8 % .
The last time any region had a rate of at least 10 % was September 1983 , when the Midwest posted a rate of 10.1 % .
The Pacific and South Atlantic regions posted record highs .
The Northeast recorded the lowest rate in May , at 8.3 % .
The spike comes a month after the unemployment rate declined in more states -- 21 -- in April , which bureau officials called an aberration .
" Generally the states are going to follow what 's happening on the national level , " said Brian Hannon , economist in the local area unemployment statistics division .
NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) -
With stylish sunglasses on her head , brightly painted nails and dressed in black designer gear , the woman sitting at a trendy New Delhi cafe might not look like a battered wife .
A victim of domestic violence poses for a picture outside a district court in New Delhi March 4 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Vijay Mathur
But the woman , who asked that her name be withheld to protect her identity and that of her children , was abused for years by her husband , a lawyer .
“ He strangled me , he spat on me , he slapped me , ” the woman , a 37 - year - old mother of two who grew up in a wealthy London - based Indian family , told Reuters in an interview .
She is among millions of Indian women , from all classes , who are abused by their husbands .
A recent government survey said one in three Indian women were victims of domestic violence .
Her education and status among India ’s elite gave little protection against her well - heeled and well - connected spouse .
After years of abuse , she took her husband to court under a landmark domestic violence act meant to protect battered wives and give stiff penalties to abusers , but so far to no avail .
“ This law , which is enacted by the parliament in 2006 , has not been taken seriously , ” her lawyer , K.K. Manan , told Reuters .
“ On one pretext or another , the case is being adjourned . ”
A total of 185,312 crimes against women were reported in India in 2007 , compared to 164,765 in 2006 .
Rights groups say many more cases go unreported .
Domestic violence has long been in the public eye and the media regularly features cases of wife - beating over issues such as dowry , as well as torture and killings of women , especially in poorer households .
India ’s economic boom has brought a rise in affluent women , often with careers , who enjoy greater freedom than their parents ’ generation .
They dress in Western clothes and visit restaurants , bars and night clubs .
These changes sometimes clash with hardline elements of what remains a largely conservative society .
Even among India ’s upper crust , women ’s freedom can be superficial .
MONEY AND POWER
The domestic violence act was meant for the first time to give protection and compensation for all kinds of abuse in the home , including physical , sexual , verbal , emotional or economic .
Previously , for example , husbands could not be prosecuted for raping their wives , unless the wife was under the age of 15 .
The new law aims to pass sentence within 60 days of the first hearing .
But more than a year later , the woman ’s case is still bogged down and in early March she had to make yet another appearance at a special Delhi women ’s court .
From her lawyer ’s cramped chambers , she walked past a low colonnade of clerks who still use typewriters , up a grimy staircase to a crowded , tiny courtroom for her case to be heard .
“ Women are not being safeguarded from this act , ” she said .
“ Any woman who is a victim of domestic violence has to face lengthy court cases , hence exorbitant lawyers ’ fees ...
It ’s all about money and power in this country .
You can buy anyone . ”
Once more , her husband and his legal counsel did not turn up at court , but the judge hears the case in their absence .
Come June , she is still waiting for the next court appearance .
Often cases are adjourned if the accused is not present .
One member of her legal team says few sentences have been passed against abusive husbands , partly because of such delays .
Long - held attitudes toward domestic violence in India are slow to change and justice can be murky and remote .
A recent government survey found 54 percent of women , against 51 percent of men , say wife - beating is justified in some circumstances .
Also , there is a still a commonly held opinion in Indian society that women lodge false complaints of abuse , Manan said .
“ There is always a stigma attached ... to a divorcee , to a woman who goes and reports against the family , ” said Kumud Sharma , vice chair of the Center for Women ’s Studies .
“ This notion of family integrity or not speaking against the family or family members , prevents many women from going and reporting about it . ”
BRIBE AND LIE
One of the woman ’s friends has tried to divorce her abusive husband , a wealthy developer whom she wed in an arranged marriage when she was aged 19 even though she had major doubts .
When she tried to leave him after 11 years of physical abuse and after he had an affair , his family dragged her back .
“ I was physically forced back into a car .
They then locked me in a room when I got to his house , ” the friend told Reuters , as her young daughter , whom the husband refuses to help take care of , quietly doodles with crayons next to her .
The woman , who also asked for her name to be withheld to protect her and her daughter ’s identity , eventually managed to leave her husband .
Her legal case has barely moved forward because , she said , the system is “ slow like a snail . ”
The battered wives of Delhi ’s rich say husbands use their wealth and influence to delay court cases and muddy proceedings .
Bribery is a common trick , they say , another is to hire private detectives to follow wives around and get false evidence of the wife ’s ‘ adultery ’ by photographing them near random men .
“ Initially ( her ) husband was roaming around with some other lady , ” lawyer K.K. Manan said of his client .
“ To come out of that situation he is now making false allegations . ”
Poor women suffer most as they often do n’t have the means to leave their abusive husbands , but activists say domestic abuse can affect any home , rich or poor .
“ I would think it ’s pretty much rampant across classes , ” said Nandita Bhatla of the International Center for Research on Women .
Should marijuana be legalized ?
We 'll look at both sides of the debate tonight on 360° .
Maureen Miller
AC360° Writer
All this week we 'll look at the battle over legalizing marijuana .
Tonight , we focus on the medical angle , in part through the eyes of award - winning singer / songwriter Melissa Etheridge .
She used medical marijuana during her battle against breast cancer .
Currently , medical marijuana is available in 13 states ( we 'll show which ones during the program ) .
Do you think it should be an option nationwide ?
Sound off below .
We 'll also have the latest from Iran where a protest over Friday 's presidential election turned deadly today .
There are reports at least one person was killed while marching against the re-election of Pres. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
They protesters are supporters of his leading opponent , moderate Mir Hossein Moussavi .
They say the election was stolen from him .
Here 's what makes this story so important : these are the largest anti-government protests in Iran since the revolution 30 years ago .
Join us for these stories and much more starting at the top of the hour .
See you then !
She is also emphatic about the importance of female sexual pleasure , and the inequity of many Arab marriages in that respect .
One of the cases that impelled her to write the book , she said , was a 52 - year - old client who had grandchildren but had never known sexual pleasure with her husband .
“ Finally , she discovered orgasm ! ” Ms. Lootah said .
“ Imagine , all that time she did not know . ”
Another important theme of the book is infidelity .
The prevalence of foreign women in Dubai and the ease of e-mail and text - message communication has made cheating easier ( and easier to detect ) , Ms. Lootah said , helping push the divorce rate to 30 percent .
The Gulf ’s oil - fueled modernization in recent decades has also shattered some old Arab social structures .
At the same time , the rise of political Islam has undermined traditional authorities , leaving many Arabs confused about moral issues .
“ Before , people lived in one place and the community was like one big family , ” Ms. Lootah said .
“ Now , people have spread to different areas , everything ’s mixed up and traditions have changed . ”
ONE result is the Family Guidance section in the Dubai Courthouse , which opened in 2001 with Ms. Lootah as its first counselor ( there are now six others , all men ) .
Kuwait ’s government has had a similar social - services wing since the 1990s , and other Persian Gulf countries are following suit .
Private psychologists and marriage counselors also exist throughout the Arab world , though they are still rare .
“ We ’re making a lot of progress , ” said Heba Kotb , who runs an Islam - oriented sex therapy clinic in Cairo , and ran a satellite television talk show on sexual and marital issues from 2006 until 2008 .
“ Ten years ago we were unable to even mention the subject , and now people are getting used to hearing it . ”
There are still formidable obstacles .
In a region where “ honor killings ” of women who have sex outside marriage remain fairly common , sex education is widely viewed as a portal to sin .
Genital cutting of women still takes place in Egypt , though it is now illegal .
Arab writers and artists have begun to tackle these subjects .

When I was invited to give this speech , I was asked if I could give a simple short talk that was " direct , naked , taut , honest , passionate , lean , shivering , startling , and graceful . "
No pressure there .
Let 's begin with the startling part .
Class of 2009 : you are going to have to figure out what it means to be a human being on earth at a time when every living system is declining , and the rate of decline is accelerating .
Kind of a mind - boggling situation ... but not one peer - reviewed paper published in the last thirty years can refute that statement .
Basically , civilization needs a new operating system , you are the programmers , and we need it within a few decades .
This planet came with a set of instructions , but we seem to have misplaced them .
Important rules like do n't poison the water , soil , or air , do n't let the earth get overcrowded , and do n't touch the thermostat have been broken .
Buckminster Fuller said that spaceship earth was so ingeniously designed that no one has a clue that we are on one , flying through the universe at a million miles per hour , with no need for seatbelts , lots of room in coach , and really good food - but all that is changing .
There is invisible writing on the back of the diploma you will receive , and in case you did n't bring lemon juice to decode it , I can tell you what it says :
You are Brilliant , and the Earth is Hiring .
The earth could n't afford to send recruiters or limos to your school .
It sent you rain , sunsets , ripe cherries , night blooming jasmine , and that unbelievably cute person you are dating .
Take the hint .
And here 's the deal : Forget that this task of planet - saving is not possible in the time required .
Do n't be put off by people who know what is not possible .
Do what needs to be done , and check to see if it was impossible only after you are done .
When asked if I am pessimistic or optimistic about the future , my answer is always the same :
If you look at the science about what is happening on earth and are n't pessimistic , you do n't understand the data .
But if you meet the people who are working to restore this earth and the lives of the poor , and you are n't optimistic , you have n't got a pulse .
What I see everywhere in the world are ordinary people willing to confront despair , power , and incalculable odds in order to restore some semblance of grace , justice , and beauty to this world .
The poet Adrienne Rich wrote , " So much has been destroyed I have cast my lot with those who , age after age , perversely , with no extraordinary power , reconstitute the world . "
There could be no better description .
Humanity is coalescing .
It is reconstituting the world , and the action is taking place in schoolrooms , farms , jungles , villages , campuses , companies , refuge camps , deserts , fisheries , and slums .
You join a multitude of caring people .
No one knows how many groups and organizations are working on the most salient issues of our day : climate change , poverty , deforestation , peace , water , hunger , conservation , human rights , and more .
This is the largest movement the world has ever seen .
Rather than control , it seeks connection .
Rather than dominance , it strives to disperse concentrations of power .
Like Mercy Corps , it works behind the scenes and gets the job done .
Large as it is , no one knows the true size of this movement .
It provides hope , support , and meaning to billions of people in the world .
Its clout resides in idea , not in force .
It is made up of teachers , children , peasants , businesspeople , rappers , organic farmers , nuns , artists , government workers , fisherfolk , engineers , students , incorrigible writers , weeping Muslims , concerned mothers , poets , doctors without borders , grieving Christians , street musicians , the President of the United States of America , and as the writer David James Duncan would say , the Creator , the One who loves us all in such a huge way .
There is a rabbinical teaching that says if the world is ending and the Messiah arrives , first plant a tree , and then see if the story is true .
Inspiration is not garnered from the litanies of what may befall us ; it resides in humanity 's willingness to restore , redress , reform , rebuild , recover , reimagine , and reconsider .
" One day you finally knew what you had to do , and began , though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice , " is Mary Oliver 's description of moving away from the profane toward a deep sense of connectedness to the living world .

Millions of people are working on behalf of strangers , even if the evening news is usually about the death of strangers .
This kindness of strangers has religious , even mythic origins , and very specific eighteenth - century roots .
Abolitionists were the first people to create a national and global movement to defend the rights of those they did not know .
Until that time , no group had filed a grievance except on behalf of itself .
The founders of this movement were largely unknown - Granville Clark , Thomas Clarkson , Josiah Wedgwood - and their goal was ridiculous on the face of it : at that time three out of four people in the world were enslaved .
Enslaving each other was what human beings had done for ages .
And the abolitionist movement was greeted with incredulity .
Conservative spokesmen ridiculed the abolitionists as liberals , progressives , do - gooders , meddlers , and activists .
They were told they would ruin the economy and drive England into poverty .
But forthe first time in history a group of people organized themselves to help people they would never know , from whom they would never receive direct or indirect benefit .
And today tens of millions of people do this every day .
It is called the world of non-profits , civil society , schools , social entrepreneurship , non-governmental organizations , and companies who place social and environmental justice at the top of their strategic goals .
The scope and scale of this effort is unparalleled in history .
The living world is not " out there " somewhere , but in your heart .
What do we know about life ?
In the words of biologist Janine Benyus , life creates the conditions that are conducive to life .
I can think of no better motto for a future economy .
We have tens of thousands of abandoned homes without people and tens of thousands of abandoned people without homes .
We have failed bankers advising failed regulators on how to save failed assets .
We are the only species on the planet without full employment .
Brilliant .
We have an economy that tells us that it is cheaper to destroy earth in real time rather than renew , restore , and sustain it .
You can print money to bail out a bank but you can't print life to bail out a planet .
At present we are stealing the future , selling it in the present , and calling it gross domestic product .
We can just as easily have an economy that is based on healing the future instead of stealing it .
We can either create assets for the future or take the assets of the future .
One is called restoration and the other exploitation .
And whenever we exploit the earth we exploit people and cause untold suffering .
Working for the earth is not a way to get rich , it is a way to be rich .
The first living cell came into being nearly 40 million centuries ago , and its direct descendants are in all of our bloodstreams .
Literally you are breathing molecules this very second that were inhaled by Moses , Mother Teresa , and Bono .
We are vastly interconnected .
Our fates are inseparable .
We are here because the dream of every cell is to become two cells .
And dreams come true .
In each of you are one quadrillion cells , 90 percent of which are not human cells .
Your body is a community , and without those other microorganisms you would perish in hours .
Each human cell has 400 billion molecules conducting millions of processes between trillions of atoms .
The total cellular activity in one human body is staggering : one septillion actions at any one moment , a one with twenty - four zeros after it .
In a millisecond , our body has undergone ten times more processes than there are stars in the universe , which is exactly what Charles Darwin foretold when he said science would discover that each living creature was a " little universe , formed of a host of self - propagating organisms , inconceivably minute and as numerous as the stars of heaven . "
So I have two questions for you all : First , can you feel your body ?
Stop for a moment .
Feel your body .
One septillion activities going on simultaneously , and your body does this so well you are free to ignore it , and wonder instead when this speech will end .
You can feel it .
It is called life .
This is who you are .
Second question : who is in charge of your body ?
Who is managing those molecules ?
Hopefully not a political party .
Life is creating the conditions that are conducive to life inside you , just as in all of nature .
Our innate nature is to create the conditions that are conducive to life .
What I want you to imagine is that collectively humanity is evincing a deep innate wisdom in coming together to heal the wounds and insults of the past .
Ralph Waldo Emerson once asked what we would do if the stars only came out once every thousand years .
No one would sleep that night , of course .
The world would create new religions overnight .
We would be ecstatic , delirious , made rapturous by the glory of God.
Instead , the stars come out every night and we watch television .
This extraordinary time when we are globally aware of each other and the multiple dangers that threaten civilization has never happened , not in a thousand years , not in ten thousand years .
Each of us is as complex and beautiful as all the stars in the universe .
We have done great things and we have gone way off course in terms of honoring creation .
You are graduating to the most amazing , stupefying challenge ever bequested to any generation .
The generations before you failed .
They did n't stay up all night .
They got distracted and lost sight of the fact that life is a miracle every moment of your existence .
Nature beckons you to be on her side .
You could n't ask for a better boss .
The most unrealistic person in the world is the cynic , not the dreamer .
Hope only makes sense when it does n't make sense to be hopeful .
This is your century .
Take it and run as if your life depends on it .
The Linux wc command counts the total number of words in a file .
This command only works on plain - text files .
More complex files , like documents saved in Rich Text Format , contain additional command codes that , although you do n't see them when you open the file in an RTF - capable word processor , are nevertheless embedded in the document .
How to Use the ' wc ' Command
The basic usage of the wc command is as follows :
wc filename
For example , a text file titled declaration .
txt contains a key line from the Declaration of Independence .
Executing the command :
wc declaration .
txt
reveals data about the text within that file :
The command displays three numbers — 2 35 211 — plus the filename .
Those values indicate three contextual data points :
The first number counts the number of new lines of characters
The second number counts the number of words
The third number counts the number of bytes ( i.e. , the number of characters , visible or not )
Get the Total Word Count From Several Files
The wc command supports several filename arguments .
For example , if we duplicate the declaration .
txt as declaration2.txt , then run the wc command on both files , we 'll see the totals for each and then the totals for both :
Command Switches
Adding a command switch refines the results of the wc command .
It supports :
-c : Displays only the number of bytes and the filename
: Displays only the number of bytes and the filename -m : Displays only the number of characters
: Displays only the number of characters -l : Displays only the number of lines
: Displays only the number of lines -w : Displays only the number of words
Introduction
Imagine if you told everybody you were going to throw this awesome , mind - altering , uberlicious party .
But the day of the party , the first people in the door discovered that the plumbing was backed up , and everybody left , which was fine because the live band had been killed by freak tornado while en route .
Five months later , you try to throw the same party again .
The difference is that now you have a Fisher boom box instead of a live band , and , thanks to some duct tape , the plumbing works .
Meanwhile , another guy down the block has already started throwing his own party .
The invitations look a lot like yours .
He ’s serving the same drinks .
You ’re throwing in a free party favor , but no one seems to care , in part because the people who might care are already bustin ’ moves down the block .
Several people have RSVPed for your soiree , but only two or three have showed up so far .
You ’re AMD , and the name of your party is “ ATI Stream . ”
If you caught our recent coverage of Nvidia ’s CUDA platform , then you ’re up to speed on the state of GPGPU processing , or GPU computing , or whatever you want to call it these days , and you know that ATI Stream stands alongside CUDA as one of the two most prevalent GPU computing platforms available today .
The idea with GPU computing is to take highly parallelized tasks typically run in the CPU and offload them to the GPU , where they can run more quickly and efficiently .
Programmable shaders are exceptionally well - suited for floating point - intensive tasks .
Each shader operates as its own sort of processor core , so instead of having four or eight threads crunching on a parallelized task in the CPU , you could have 64 or 320 or however many stream processors tackling the same work in the GPU .
Naturally , the program has to be coded to take advantage of this architecture , and the operations need to involve a relatively heavy amount of arithmetic per memory fetch in order to see decent results .
When Stream launched last December , AMD had only enabled it to accelerate encoding into MPEG - 2 and H.264 formats .
The acceleration part was fine .
What AMD had n’t counted on was that it would be deluged with criticisms over its encoding quality .
With the May ’s Catalyst 9.5 driver update , though , we finally have bug fixes for the quality issues and a fuller acceleration pipeline that now includes MPEG - 2 and H.264 decoding , as well as resolution scaling .
You can see this represented in the high - level illustration shown here .
The burning question , of course , is how does Stream stack up ?
Was it worth the wait ?
We ’ve got some preliminary answers and more besides , but first , let ’s step back for some perspective ...
VANCOUVER — A man wanted for the decades - old double murder of a young hippie couple camping on a beach near Tofino was involved in a gun fight late last week with New Mexico police that left both him and a police officer dead .
Joseph Henry Burgess was the prime suspect in the 1972 murders of Ann Barbara Durrant , 20 , and Leif Bertil Carlsson , 19 .
The couple was camping together at Radar Beach , just south of Tofino on Vancouver Island , B.C. , when they were shot and killed .
Their bodies were found together in a sleeping bag on June 21 .
At the time , Burgess was a 25 - year - old draft dodger from New Jersey living on the beach .
He had a reputation for being a “ Jesus freak ” and after the murder , left all his possessions behind at his nearby campsite , including a Bible with the name Job Weeks on an inside page .
The only item missing was his rifle .
Burgess had reportedly complained to people before the murder that he did n’t approve of a young unwed Christian couple living on the beach together .
Fast forward more than 25 years and Burgess — known only as the “ Cookie Bandit ” — was wanted by police in New Mexico for breaking into cabins in a mountainous area near Albuquerque .
For the past 10 years , the Cookie Bandit had been breaking into rural homes to steal snacks , canned goods , rain gear and other items needed for survival in the outdoors .
Last Thursday morning , though , he broke into the wrong cabin .
His chosen target was the same cabin from which two police officers from the Sandoval County Sheriff ’s Department were staking him out .
“ The police were inside when he broke in , ” said Lieut .
Eric Garcia of the New Mexico Department of Public Safety .
The two officers confronted Burgess , knocked him down and tried to arrest him , but Burgess fired a gun , fatally shooting one of the officers .
At some point during the struggle , the officers returned Burgess ’s gunfire , striking and killing him .
He was 62 .
Police did not identify the Cookie Bandit as Joseph Henry Burgess until after his death .
Evidence linking Burgess to the 1972 Tofino double murder includes fingerprints found on torn and discarded documents belonging to the victims , Garcia said .
The RCMP did not respond Monday to an interview request , but Dan Creally , the initial RCMP investigator assigned to the Tofino - area double murder in 1972 , spoke to Vancouver Sun reporter Neal Hall in 2007 .
Creally said it was his only murder left unsolved when he retired in 1981 .
“ This was in the hippie days , ” he recalled of Long Beach in 1972 .
At that time , it was populated by about 1,000 young people from all over the world living in lean - tos constructed of driftwood and plastic tarps .
“ They occupied about 29 miles of beach , ” he said of Long Beach , which became part of a national park in 1970 .
Durrant had been a student at the University of B.C. and Carlsson was a visiting student from Sweden .
Between the comments
Burgess reportedly made about his disapproval of an unwed couple living together on the beach , and the fact he had been seen cleaning a semi-automatic . 22 - calibre rifle — the same type of weapon used in the double murder — only days before the murder , police were quite sure they had the right man .
I was reading about some php performance tips at work today and decided to throw together some of the ways to make your php site faster .
Here ’s a couple of short tips to avoid making your site lag for the user :
Unset your variables .
This frees up a surprising amount of memory Use memcache Turn on apache ’s mod_deflate
If your database is local then close your connections when you ’re done with them If your database is remote then use persistant connections
Do n’t use functions inside of a for loop control expression unless absolutely necessary .
Example :
for ( $i=0 ;$i<some_big_calculation ( 20 ) ;$i++)
The some_big_calculation function will be called every iteration .
Use string concatenation instead of embedding variables in strings .
$ some_string = " asdf $ asdf2 asdf " ; // bad $ some_string = ' asdf '.$asdf2 . ' asdf ' ; //good
When including files , use at least a relative path so PHP does n’t have to look in the entire path .
include ( "./some_file.php " ) ; // looks in the current directory include ( " wrong.php " ) ; // searches every directory in the path Try not to use include_once or require_once .
They are more expensive and it really is n’t that hard to only include files once
Not everything needs to be an object .
There is a fair amount of overhead when doing everything OOP .
Use output buffering to make everything seem faster .
Hopefully I did n’t miss any of the big ones .
Hot on the heels of the dust - up surrounding Last . fm 's decision to charge International users and kill off third party mobile apps , Pandora 's announcing a welcome and positive change that Last . fm 's had for a few months - song lyrics .
According to their post on the matter , Pandora has been quietly integrating fully licensed lyrics into the site with the help of their lyrics partner , Gracenote , for about a week .
Pandora 's also tweaked the interface to add more song variety options , introduced station gifting ( think mixtapes you can color - up and exchange with friends ) , and now supports bulk purchases .
So even though you can't expect lyrics for every song in Pandora 's collection , you should start to see lyrics for a myriad of songs when using the Web interface .
To view lyrics just select " About This Music " below the station / music pane .
You 'll notice a new lyrics tab where the first four lines of currently playing songs will be displayed .
To view full lyrics just click the designated link which opens a new window and also includes the ability to share or buy the song , as well as view other people who are listing to the same artist .
Pandora 's relatively new " add variety " button is also pretty nifty , and it 's easily selectable when a particular station is playing .
You should see the tiny add variety link next to options , and clicking on it will open up a pop - up where you can type in artists or song names to add new music , or choose from musically similar songs recommend by Pandora .
And if you 're the type that woos with mixtapes or you 're just in a giving mood , you might enjoy the new station gifting feature .
Unfortunately , even though you can share your existing stations with friends you can't gift them yet , so for now you 'll need to visit the station gift page and select up to 5 different artists or songs , select your station skin of choice , add a personal message , and send it off to an acquaintance or love interest .
We think the add variety and station gift features are fun , but we 're most excited about the lyrics .
Now one of our favorite sites for listening away the day while working just feels more complete .
What do you think of the new additions ?

Profiling Ruby With Google 's Perftools
Benchmarking , profiling and debugging are all areas where better tool support could really benefit the Ruby community .
Built in benchmark library and extensions such as ruby - prof provide us with a minimal level of introspection to help identify the common bottlenecks , but they still fall short of the available tools for the JVM , or other dynamic runtimes .
If you ’re working with Rails , the story is better , as within the past year companies such as FiveRuns and New Relic have built a number of great performance and monitoring applications .
However , if you ’re working on the bowels of the framework itself , or attempting to optimize a codepath in any other Ruby application , you ’re out of luck .
For that reason , one interesting project to explore is perftools.rb , an adaptation of Google ’s perftools library to the Ruby land by Aman Gupta .
Google ’s perftools library , which recently reached 1.0 status is largely known for its fast TCMalloc which offers impressive drop in speed improvements over the regular malloc ( memory allocation ) .
However , also hidden inside is a set of heap and CPU performance analysis and visualizations tools that are all too often overlooked .
At the moment perftools.rb only supports the CPU profiler , but the heap profiler is next on the agenda and offers a lot of promise .
To get started , simply download and install the gem ( gem install perftools.rb ) , the installer will download Google ’s perftools library , patch it on the fly to enable Ruby instrumentation and install it on your system .
From here , you have two options on how to perform the profiling : explicitly instrument your code , or include the perftools library on the fly .
# instrument your code require ' perftools '
PerfTools :: CpuProfiler . start ( " /tmp/add_numbers_profile " ) do 5_000_000 .
times { 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 } end # profile existing application CPUPROFILE = /tmp / m y_app_profile RUBYOPT
= " - r`gem which perftools | tail - 1` " ruby my_app .
rb
The actual profiling of your code is done via a sampling process where the interpreter is interrupted on a periodic interval , the state is frozen for a few milliseconds and a snapshot of the stack is taken .
This does mean that your process has to run for long enough for the profiler to collect a few samples ( be careful with short scripts ) .
Once the process is complete you can extract a quick text summary .
For example , here is sample output for a simple Sinatra application :
$ CPUPROFILE = /tmp/sinatra RUBYOPT
= " - r`gem which perftools | tail - 1` " ruby hello.rb $ ab -c 10 -n 2000 localhost : 4567 / $ pprof.rb -- text -- ignore = Gem /tmp/sinatra # Total : 502 samples # 180 35.9 % 35.9 % 412 82.1 % EventMachine.run_machine # 150 29.9 % 65.7 % 150 29.9 % Time#initialize # 38 7.6 % 73.3 % 38 7.6 % garbage_collector # 24 4.8 % 78.1 % 24 4.8 % Time #- # 17 3.4 % 81.5 % 17 3.4 % String#split # 10 2.0 % 83.5 % 10 2.0 % IO # write # 6 1.2 % 84.7 % 6 1.2 % StringIO#size # generate a visualization of the callstack $ pprof.rb -- gif /tmp/sinatra >
/tmp/sinatra.gif
Visualizing Performance & Bottlenecks With pprof.rb
However , while the text analysis is definitely useful , the real gold nugget in Google ’s perftools library is its ability to visualize the profiling information .
By converting our profiler output into GIF or PDF formats , we immediately find several interesting codepaths in our Sinatra application ( click on preview ) : majority of the time is spent in EventMachine ( as expected ) , about 8 % of time is taken up by the GC , and 30 % of time is spent in the logging code calling Time.new !
Armed with that information we now know where the bottlenecks are , their associated codepaths , and we can now work on optimizing our application !
In similar fashion , Aman produced visualizations for rubygems , Merb , Rails , and EventMachine - tons of insights in each graph !
Definitely a nice library to add to your debug and performance optimization toolkit !
( CNN ) --
Like thousands of other Iranian women , Parisa took to Tehran 's streets this week , her heart brimming with hope .
" Change , " said the placards around her .
Iranian women demonstrate Thursday in the streets of Tehran , the capital city .

The young Iranian woman eyed the crowd and pondered the possibility that the rest of her life might be different from her mother's .
She could see glimmers of a future free from discrimination -- and all the symbols of it , including the head - covering the government requires her to wear every day .
Women , regarded as second - class citizens under Iranian law , have been noticeably front and center of the massive demonstrations that have unfolded since the presidential election a week ago .
Iranians are protesting what they consider a fraudulent vote count favoring hardline incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , but for many women like Parisa , the demonstrations are just as much about taking Iran one step closer to democracy .
" Women have become primary agents of change in Iran , " said Nayereh Tohidi , chairwoman of the Gender and Women 's Studies Department at California State University , Northridge .
The remarkable images show women with uncovered heads who are unafraid to speak their minds and crowds that are not segregated -- both the opposite of the norm in Iran , Tohidi said .
She said a long - brewing women 's movement may finally be manifesting itself on the streets and empowering women like Parisa .
" This regime is against all humanity , more specifically against all women , " said Parisa , whom CNN is not fully identifying for security reasons .
" From the Streets of Iran " Christiane Amanpour shares her first - hand look at the explosive Iran election , Saturday and Sunday night .
7 ET see full schedule »
" I see lots of girls and women in these demonstrations , " she said .
" They are all angry , ready to explode , scream out and let the world hear their voice .
I want the world to know that as a woman in this country , I have no freedom . "
Though 63 percent of all Iranian college students are women , the law of the land does not see men and women as equal .
In cases of divorce , child custody , inheritance and crime , women do not have the same legal rights as men .
In the past four years , Ahmadinejad has made it easier for men to practice polygamy and harder for women to access public sector jobs , according to CNN 's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour .
Amanpour , who has reported extensively from Iran , describes Iranian women as " very strong . "
In 1997 , it was women who came out along with young people to put reformist candidate Mohammed Khatami into the presidency , Amanpour said .
Increasingly , women 's voices are gaining power as their numbers rise and their demands grow louder .
Even the granddaughter of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , the architect of the Islamic republic , voiced frustration at the way women are treated .
" Women are just living things , " Zahra Eshraghi told Amanpour .
" A woman is there to fill her husband 's stomach and raise children . "
For the first time , women were allowed to register for the presidential race , though none , including Eshraghi , were deemed fit to run by the religious body that vets candidates .
But women 's issues surfaced in the campaign .
That was partly the result of a women 's movement comprised of educated , urban , middle - class women that has grown in recent years with the addition of more conservative and poorer women , said Tohidi , a longtime observer of women 's rights in Iran .
Ironically , traditional women first gained voice under the clerics .
" Khomeini needed their votes , so he encouraged them to be publicly active , " Tohidi said .
The middle - class women who enjoyed certain freedoms in prerevolutionary days refused to turn back , while a new generation of conservatives were awakened to feminism .
In 2003 , lawyer and women 's rights activist Shirin Ebadi won the Nobel Peace Prize , providing a " big boost " for Iranian women , Tohidi said .
At the same time , private organizations and charities that deal with women 's issues blossomed under the presidency of reformist Mohammed Khatami , growing by as much as 700 percent , Tohidi said .
Marriage age increased as more women opted to marry for love , instead of entering arranged marriages .
The One Million Signatures Campaign officially launched in 2006 sprouted new discourse and attention with a petition that asks the parliament to reform gender discriminatory laws .
In this year 's presidential campaign , Iranian women pressured candidates to agree to ratify the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women .
The 1979 treaty has been ratified by 186 nations , including several Islamic states .
Two opposition candidates , Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi , vowed to look into parts of the Iranian constitution that defer women 's rights to what is regarded as an outdated version of sharia , or Islamic , law .
Moussavi had even promised to appoint women as cabinet ministers for the first time .
Some women in Iran looked to Moussavi to carry their banner , perhaps because they were inspired by his wife , Zahra Rahnavard , a much - admired academic who told CNN's Amanpour that Iran 's 34 million women want civil laws and family laws revised .
Author and journalist Azadeh Moaveni , who spent several years working in Iran , said Ahmadinejad 's fundamentalism has pushed Iranian women to the edge .
" He has been a catastrophe for women , " said Moaveni , who wrote " Lipstick Jihad " and co-authored " Iran Awakening " with Nobel laureate Ebadi .
The weight of discrimination against women is felt most profoundly through Iran 's legal system , but Moaveni said Ahmadinejad added to the hardship by clamping down on women 's lifestyles .
He mandated the way women dress and even censored Web sites that dealt with women 's health , Moaveni said .
A woman would be hard - pressed to conduct a Google search for something as simple as breast cancer .
Moaveni was almost arrested because her coat sleeves were too short and exposed too much skin .
In that setting , she said , it 's striking to see women protesting , especially without their hijabs , or head coverings .
" While it 's not at the top of women 's grievances , the hijab is symbolic .
Taking it off is like waving a red flag , " Moaveni said .
" Women are saying they are a force to be reckoned with . "
Azar Nafisi , a professor at Johns Hopkins University 's School of Advanced International Studies and author of " Reading Lolita in Tehran , " said she has been watching the footage from Iran with " inordinate pride . "
She marched on the streets during the 1979 revolution because she believed in greater freedoms for her people , only to see her dreams shattered as hardline clerics took hold of Iran .
" Reading Lolita " is largely a memoir of her harrowing days in Iran until 1997 , when she immigrated to the United States .
" The way I walked down the street became a political statement , " Nafisi said .
She recalled her own mother being a devout Muslim who chose not to wear a veil .
Her grandmother , like more traditional women in Iran , wore a veil but resented the government ordering her to do so .
Covering up , Nafisi said , was a matter of faith , not politics .
Nafisi believes that women have become a symbolic statement of the power of the Islamic state .
She called Iranian women canaries of the mind -- barometers of how free society is .
It 's impossible to predict what will transpire in Iran in the coming days .
Nafisi believes a regime change will not be enough ; that only a change in mindset can lead to greater freedoms for women .
Moaveni said the sheer scale of the demonstrations assures her that the political and social climate will never again be the same in Iran .
Tohidi is keeping her fingers crossed that the protests wo n't prompt Iran 's hardliners to clamp down and rule by repression .
But all of them shared the hopes of the women -- like Parisa -- who are marching on the streets .
" Today , we were wearing black , " Parisa said , referring to the day of mourning to remember those who have died in post-election violence .
" We were holding signs .
We said , ' We are not sheep .
We are human beings , ' " she said .
Parisa was thankful for all the images being transmitted out of Iran despite the government 's crackdown on international journalists .
She was thankful , too , that the world cared .
" Today , " she said , " I had this feeling of hope that things will finally change . "

The microscope is under high vacuum and kept exceptionally cold
The amount of electric charge on single atoms has been measured by researchers reporting in Science .
While individual atoms ' charges have been measured before , the prior method required that the atoms be on the surface of a conducting material .
The new approach used a tiny tuning fork - like device that was deflected minuscule amounts by the attraction or repulsion of the atoms .
The approach will aid in the design of devices such as solar cells .
Gerhard Meyer of IBM's Zurich research laboratory first showed in 2004 that individual atoms ' charge could be measured using a device known as a scanning tunnelling microscope ( STM ) .
An STM has a tiny metallic tip - ending in one or a few atoms - which measures physical properties of microscopic - scale samples by passing a small current through them and measuring how this current varies across a sample .
However , an STM requires that the samples be at the surface of a conducting material , so that charges can move around or be lost entirely to this conducting substrate .
Good as gold
The new work hinges on the use of a research tool called an atomic force microscope , or AFM , which as its name implies can measure forces at the atomic level .
Molecular electronics , like this transistor , require atomic precision
An AFM employs a similar tiny tip , suspended from a cantilever - a beam just a few billionths of a metre across that acts like a diving board .
The researchers attach a small voltage to the diving board and set it vibrating near its natural resonant frequency .
When the tip comes close to a charged sample , the vibration 's frequency changes slightly as the " opposite charges attract " principle gets to work on the single - atom level , changing the force acting on the tip and the cantilever .
The deviations of the cantilever are less than an atom 's diameter , and the team can measure whether a gold or silver atom has a single extra electron or lack of one .
' The basics '
It is an unthinkably precise measure ; more than a billion billion electrons pass through a 60 W light bulb every second .
Yet the fine details of the movement of individual charges are critically important , both for existing pursuits such as solar cells and for the nascent field of " molecular electronics " , in which molecules act as circuit elements .
The charge transfer processes that ultimately determine a solar cell 's efficiency will be easier to optimise knowing the exact movements of charge within materials .
" That is what makes this technique so important ; it 's not only the charge state of an atom but we want to go further and investigate molecules and measure distribution of charges , " IBM 's Leo Gross told the BBC .
The approach will also allow researchers to see at the most fundamental level how electric charge transfers in catalysts , or how charges get separated in molecular complexes such as some of the machinery of photosynthesis .
" We 're not directly aiming at making a photovoltaic cell or a computer in our system , " Dr Gross said .
" We 're trying to understand the basics of the processes in such devices . "

June 15 , 2009 - L4D Team
When it came time to photograph the box art of L4D1 , our art staff had three goals .
One , there should be a hand in it somehow .
Two , the hand should have a thumb bitten off , so customers would look at the four fingers remaining on the hand and think , " Hey , four . "
Three , under no circumstances would we use Photoshop .
L4D is a visceral experience , and its box art deserved the same approach .
Valve artist and L4D1 hand model Andrea Wicklund was more than happy to help .
Sadly , the ESRB got wind of this , and cited some fake - sounding legal loophole about it being illegal to take pictures of people biting off parts of their hands .
So for L4D2 , Andrea used state - of - the - art eye - tricking techniques ( tucking two of her fingers behind her hand ) to create the illusion that her fingers were missing :
We 're sure you 'll agree : Pretty convincing .
Granted , it took lopping the fingers off two staff members ' hands to get the lighting reference perfect , but since those did n't appear on the box , we think we 're legally in the clear .
Following a request from the entertainment industries , a French court has ordered the P2P news site Numerama to cover the cases of 27 convicted file - sharers .
For their efforts the site receives 10,000 euros which they promise to spend wisely by supporting a pro file - sharing cause .
Numerama is a French news site dedicated to file - sharing and copyright issues , much like TorrentFreak .
They have openly criticized the Hadopi anti-piracy legislation and everything else spawned from the entertainment industries ‘ war on piracy ’ .
In their reporting they try to counterbalance the propaganda being spread by the various anti-piracy outlets .
This has n’t gone unnoticed by the major movie and music studios who have asked the court of Nanterre to order the site to publish extracts of convictions of 27 copyright infringers .
The convictions are all related to copyright infringement and Numerama has published the first of three batches this Friday .
The abstracts contain personal information such as the names , addresses , and birth dates of the convicted , as well as the sentence and the crime they ’ve committed .
( example )
Even though Numerama is not involved in these cases in any way , they have been selected by the court to publish the convictions as part of the sentence of the copyright infringers .
The complainants in the 27 cases are likely to have picked Numerama in an attempt to ‘ educate ’ their readers .
It is quite shocking that a court can simply order an independent news site to publish something , but apparently that ’s perfectly fine in the French legal system .
Interestingly enough , the court will pay the site 10,000 euros ( $ 14,000 ) for their cooperation .
Since Numerama does n’t want to take money ( indirectly ) from the pro-copyright lobby they have asked their readers to come up with some ideas on how to spend the money .
Their plan is to invest it in projects that promote free - sharing and online privacy .
Some of the suggestions include giving it to a Pirate Party , investing in privacy solutions such as a VPN service or buying servers to support a file - sharing network .
Numerama are encouraging their readers to come up with more ideas and they have until June 28 to do so .
Let ’s hope something good comes out of it .
A British - made iPhone program has been banned by Apple - because it could allow people to read the Kama Sutra .
Eucalyptus , a book reading application developed by Edinburgh programmer James Montgomerie , allows users to download and read thousands of classic titles from the library of Project Gutenberg , the respected website that hosts out of copyright books .
But after repeated attempts to get Eucalyptus onto the iPhone 's popular App Store , Montgomerie was told that his application was being rejected because one of Gutenberg 's books happens to be Sir Richard Burton 's 1883 translation of the famous guide to sex .
In a series of emails , Apple told Montgomerie that allowing access to the Kama Sutra meant that the program " contains inappropriate sexual content " , in violation of the rules for iPhone software .
However , not only does Eucalyptus not actually contain the book itself - users would have to actively find it and then download it - but the same title is already accessible through a number of other popular ebook applications for the iPhone , and even through the handset 's web browser .
" I 'm frustrated that they would want to censor that , especially because there are so many other ways of getting the same content , " Montgomerie told the Guardian .
" I would n't call it a mistake , because it was quite deliberate obviously , but I think it was just a misinterpretation of what should happen . "
The 29 - year - old - who used to work for Apple as a software developer - says he did not even realise the Kama Sutra was part of the Gutenberg project .
Indeed , it is so buried in the library 's 28,000 titles that he was surprised that an Apple employee managed to find it before deeming it unsuitable .
" I 'd never even thought about searching for it before , " he said .
" You have to type either " kama ' or ' sutra ' before it appears .
It does n't seem likely that they were searching for something else and yet it seems absurd that they were searching for that . "
The news comes just weeks after Apple was forced into an embarrassing U - turn when it had to ban the controversial " Baby Shaker ' application after approving it .
The 99 - cent game , which simulated shaking a baby to death , highlighted growing concern over Apple 's inconsistent policies .
Montgomerie told the Guardian that although the situation has left him frustrated , it will not put him off developing for the iPhone .
As a temporary solution to the problem , he has submitted a new version of Eucalyptus to Apple which specifically blocks the Kama Sutra - and says he hopes that bureaucracy will not get in the way this time .
" I would like to think that someone , somewhere at Apple would realise just how flawed the whole approval process is , and do something to change it , " he said .
" It does seem like it could be a lot better without having to spend too much extra money on it .
They could make the whole thing a lot more pleasant . "
Apple did not respond to a request for comment .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Senior officials in the Obama administration said late Sunday the U.S. government will provide $ 30 billion in financing to General Motors Corp. to allow it to continue to operate through a historic Chapter 11 bankruptcy , expected to last an estimated 60 to 90 days .
Officials confirmed that a majority of GM GM , +2.45 % bond holders approved the deal to allow the ailing car maker to restructure $ 27 billion in debt .
See full story on GM bondholders .
" For the better part of a century , the General Motors Corporation has been one of the most recognizable and largest businesses in the world , " one senior U.S. official said in a prepared statement to reporters .
" Today will rank as another historic day for the company -- the end of an old General Motors , and the beginning of a new one . "
Describing the process as " painful but necessary , " officials said GM will move ahead with plans to close 11 facilities will idle three more .
Specific numbers of layoffs will come from GM , officials said .
The U.S. government will own 60 % of equity in the new General Motors , with little or no control over day - to - day affairs .
The U.S. government will receive approximately $ 8.8 billion in debt and preferred stock and will name some of the new company 's board members .
Officials did not confirm or deny reports that Al Koch , a turnaround specialist , will serve as chief restructuring officer .
An additional $ 9.5 billion will be lent to GM by Canada and the Province of Ontario , with the Canadian government in line to own 12 % of the new GM and receive approximately $ 1.7 billion in debt and preferred stock .
The Canadian government will also have the right to select one initial director .
President Barack Obama is expected to speak about the GM bankruptcy on Monday , with the company also planning a formal announcement before the stock market opens .
Government says it 's done lending to GM
Officials said the government would eventually sell its stake in General Motors , but did not lay out a target date .
On the conference call with reporters , the officials said they did n't expect GM to require any more funding from the government .
" The government has no desire to own stakes in companies and will actively seek to dispose ownership interest , " an official said .
" The goal is to promote strong companies that can become profitable quickly . "
As a result of this restructuring , GM will lower its break - even point to sales of 10 million cars per year .
Before the restructuring , GM needed to sell about 16 million car sales a year to turn a profit .
The UAW made " important concessions " on compensation and retirees health care , Obama administration officials said .
The new GM will establish an independent trust , known as a voluntary employee beneficiary association ( VEBA ) , to provide health - care benefits for GM 's retirees .
The VEBA will be funded by a note of $ 2.5 billion , payable in thee installments ending in 2017 and $ 6.5 billion in perpetual preferred stock .
The independent trust will also receive 17.5 % of the new GM and warrants to purchase an additional 2.5 % stake in the company .
The UAW 's existing $ 20 billion pension obligations will disappear as part of the bankruptcy .
The new GM will pursue a commitment to build a new small car in an idled UAW factory , which , when in place , will increase the domestic - sales share of U.S. - produced vehicles from its current level of about 66 % to over 70 % .
Officials confirm $ 27 billion debt deal
The steering committee for a portion of GM creditors has confirmed that bondholders representing at least 54 % of GM 's unsecured debt have agreed to exchange their portion of the company 's $ 27.1 billion unsecured paper for their pro-rata share of 10 % of equity in the new GM , plus warrants for an additional 15 % of the new company .
" The bankruptcy court process will be used to confirm this treatment for those bondholders and other unsecured creditors that failed to accept or did not participate in the offer that was accepted by the aforementioned majority , " the U.S. officials said .
GM will continue to honor its consumer warranties .
This past week , the U.S. Treasury made available the Warranty Support Program to GM , with $ 361 million in funding to provide a backstop for the orderly payment of warranties for cars sold during the restructuring period .
Employees will continue to receive regular compensation , including salary , wages and ordinary benefits .
GM will seek authority at its first - day hearing to continue to pay suppliers as normal .

Sometimes you even forgot Barack Obama was the President of the United States of America .
Will his lecture to a carefully chosen audience at Cairo University " re-imagine the world " and heal the wounds of centuries between Muslims and Christians ?
Will it resolve the Arab - Israeli tragedy after more than 60 years ?
If words could do the job , perhaps ...
It was a clever speech we heard from Obama yesterday , as gentle and as ruthless as any audience could wish for – and we were all his audience .
He praised Islam .
He loved Islam .
He admired Islam .
He loved Christianity .
And he admired America .
Did we know that there were seven million Muslims in America , that there were mosques in every state of the Union , that Morocco was the first nation to recognise the United States and that our duty is to fight against stereotypes of Muslims just as Muslims must fight against stereotypes of America ?

But much of the truth was there , albeit softened to avoid hurting feelings in Israel .
To deny the facts of the Jewish Holocaust was " baseless , ignorant and hateful " , he said , a remark obviously aimed at Iran .
And Israel deserved security and " Palestinians must abandon violence ... "
The United States demanded a two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
He told the Israelis there had to be a total end to their colonisation in the West Bank .
" The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements . "
The Palestinians had suffered without a homeland .
" The situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable , " Obama said and the US would not turn its back on the " legitimate Palestinian aspiration for a state of their own " .
Israel had to take " concrete steps " to give the Palestinians progress in their daily lives as part of a road to peace .
Israel needed to acknowledge Palestinian suffering and the Palestinian right to exist .
Wow .
Not for a generation has Israel had to take this kind of criticism from a US President .
It sounded like the end of the Zionist dream .
Did George Bush ever exist ?
Alas , he did .
Indeed , at times , the Obama address sounded like the Bush General Repair Company , visiting the Muslim world to sweep up mountains of broken chandeliers and shredded flesh .
The President of the United States – and this was awesome – admitted his country 's failures , its over - reaction to 9/11 , its creation of Guantanamo which , Obama reminded us all again , he is closing down .
Not bad , Obama ...
We got to Iran .
One state trying to acquire nuclear weapons would lead to a " dangerous path " for all of us , especially in the Middle East .
We must prevent a nuclear arms race .
But Iran as a nation must be treated with dignity .
More extraordinarily , Obama reminded us that the US had connived to overthrow the democratically elected Mossadeq government of Iran in the Fifties .
It was " hard to overcome decades of distrust " .
There was more ; democracy , women 's rights , the economy , a few good quotes from the Koran ( " Whoever kills an innocent , it is as if he has killed all mankind " . )
Governments must respect " all their people " and their minorities .
He mentioned the Christian Copts of Egypt ; even the Christian Maronites of Lebanon got a look in .
And when Obama said that some governments , " once in power , are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others " , there was a roar of applause from the supposedly obedient audience .
No wonder the Egyptian government wanted to select which bits of Obama 's speech would be suitable for the Egyptian people .
They were clearly very , very unhappy with the police - state regime of Hosni Mubarak .
Indeed , Obama did not once mention Mubarak 's name .
Over and again , one kept saying to oneself : Obama has n't mentioned Iraq – and then he did ( " a war of choice ... our combat brigades will be leaving " ) .
But he has n't mentioned Afghanistan – and then he did ( " we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan ... we will gladly bring every one of our troops home " ) .
When he started talking about the " coalition of 46 countries " in Afghanistan – a very dodgy statistic – he began to sound like his predecessor .
And here , of course , we encountered an inevitable problem .
As the Palestinian intellectual Marwan Bishara pointed out yesterday , it is easy to be " dazzled " by presidents .
This was a dazzling performance .
But if one searched the text , there were things missing .
There was no mention – during or after his kindly excoriation of Iran – of Israel 's estimated 264 nuclear warheads .
He admonished the Palestinians for their violence – for " shooting rockets at sleeping children or blowing up old women in a bus " .
But there was no mention of Israel 's violence in Gaza , just of the " continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza " .
Nor was there a mention of Israel 's bombing of civilians in Lebanon , of its repeated invasions of Lebanon ( 17,500 dead in the 1982 invasion alone ) .
Obama told Muslims not to live in the past , but cut the Israelis out of this .
The Holocaust loomed out of his speech and he reminded us that he was going to the site of the Buchenwald concentration camp today .
For a man who is sending thousands more US troops into Afghanistan – a certain disaster - to - come in the eyes of Arabs and Westerners – there was something brazen about all this .
When he talked about the debt that all Westerners owed to Islam – the " light of learning " in Andalusia , algebra , the magnetic compass , religious tolerance , it was like a cat being gently stroked before a visit to the vet .
And the vet , of course , lectured the Muslims on the dangers of extremism , on " cycles of suspicion and discord " – even if America and Islam shared " common principles " which turned out to be " justice , progress and the dignity of all human beings " .
There was one merciful omission : a speech of nearly 6,000 words did not include the lethal word " terror " .
" Terror " or " terrorism " have become punctuation marks for every Israeli government and became part of the obscene grammar of the Bush era .
An intelligent guy , then , Obama .
Not exactly Gettysburg .
Not exactly Churchill , but not bad .
One could only remember Churchill 's observations : " Words are easy and many , while great deeds are difficult and rare . "
The EPA declared a public health emergency in Libby , Mont. , after decades of asbestos - related diseases and deaths in the tiny community .
Hundreds of people there have died and thousands have been sickened by a poisonous legacy of mining .
W.R. Grace & Co. and its officials were acquitted in May of charges that officials knowingly concealed the dangers of mining asbestos - contaminated vermiculite .
The company supplied more than 70 % of U.S. vermiculite , a mineral used for insulation , from 1919 to 1990 .
The announcement marks the first time the EPA has declared a public health emergency under the Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) , commonly known as Superfund , which took effect in 1980 .
EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson made the announcement at a joint news conference with Montana Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius .
Sebelius announced a grant for short - term medical care in the towns of Libby and Troy .
The EPA will also continue its efforts to remove asbestos from the area .
“ This is a tragic public health situation that has not received the recognition it deserves by the federal government for far too long , ” Jackson said .
“ We ’re making a long - delayed commitment to the people of Libby and Troy .
Based on a rigorous re-evaluation of the situation on the ground , we will continue to move aggressively on the cleanup efforts and protect the health of the people . ”

Washington , DC - A team of U.S. investigators led by neuroscientists at Georgetown University Medical Center ( GUMC ) are steadily uncovering the role that amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) - the protein implicated in development of Alzheimer 's disease - plays in normal brain function .
In the June 10 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience , they discovered that APP interacts with another protein known as Reelin to promote development of abundant connections between brain neurons .
Reelin , named for mice that " reel " around when they do n't have the protein , has been thought to be involved in stimulating growth of neuronal dendrites - the branching projections that transmit signals to other neurons .
It also has been implicated in some brain disorders , but up until now , little was known about how Reelin interacts with APP .
Researchers say that showing that APP and Reelin work together does n't have immediate implications for therapeutic treatment of Alzheimer 's disease in humans , but they say the work helps provide the background necessary to understand finally why a brain veers toward the progressive memory loss seen in this devastating disease , which impacts 5.3 million people yearly in the U.S. .
" In the last 20 years we have made tremendous progress in understanding how APP can become toxic .
But I think the flip side is equally interesting :
Why does APP even exist in the brain ?
We are only now just beginning to figure that out , " says the study 's senior author , G. William Rebeck , PhD , associate professor in the Department of Neuroscience at GUMC .
What has long been known is that mutations in the gene that produces APP causes an inherited form of Alzheimer 's disease , and that APP is cut by enzymes into shorter pieces of protein known as amyloid beta ( A - beta ) when it is presumably no longer needed in neurons .
But certain forms of A - beta - those that are cut to one particular length - stick to one another to form the plaque found in the disease .
A - beta cut into other sizes do n't bind to one another .
" We understand how the protein is cut to make A - beta and we are even testing drugs to counteract this errant slicing , " Rebeck says .
" But it might be more efficient to know what APP is doing in the brain , and approach therapy from that standpoint . "
Rebeck and his GUMC collaborator , Hyang - Sook Hoe , PhD , the first author of this study , have performed experiments in which they over - expressed APP in neurons in laboratory culture or reduced their levels .
They then measured changes in the normal functioning of the neurons .
Those results suggested that APP actually acts like a structural bridge to stabilize the synaptic space between two dendrites in neurons .
Neurons , aligned in circuits , send chemical signals to each other via axons and dendrites to control systems in the body .
The presynaptic neuron releases neurotransmitters to the postsynaptic neuron , and APP appears to promote the structure of these synapses , Rebeck says .
" APP is important to keep synapses stable and to have the receptors in the right place and working .
When communication between these dendrites is n't necessary anymore , APP is cut into fragments to sever the connection . "
In this study , Rebeck , Hoe and their collaborators looked at Reelin and APP , because Reelin had previously been shown to be important in growth of the dendrites .
In laboratory neurons , they found that adding Reelin increased the number of neurite connections ( dendrites and axons ) that these cells send out from the cell body in order to communicate with each other , but they also discovered that these branches did not grow if APP was not available .
And in mice experiments , they found that animals born without APP had increased levels of Reelin , and mice that overproduced APP had less Reelin .
" This suggests that two molecules are necessary for a single function , and if you get rid of one of them , the other increases in order to drive that function , " Rebeck says .
Along with his other findings , Rebeck says this study now suggests that APP is not only important in stability of dendrites but also in their formation and maintenance .

N ine skills that separate good and great designers
~ 29 September 2006 ~
Last Friday
I had the pleasure of presenting “ Essential Web Skills ” at Webmaster Jam Session in Dallas , Texas .
It was a veritable blast , and the conference organizers were certainly a pleasure to work with .
I wo n’t delve into a lengthy play - by - play coverage of the proceedings ; Andy Budd seems to have done so nicely .
Without blatant disregard to humility , I ’d like to think I delivered the most effective presentation I ’ve given to date , but one never knows for sure just how well a topic resonates with the audience .
On that note , available for your perusal ( and judgement ) are audio / slide files from the presentation .
NOTE : There ’s a lot of silence on the audio , like 10 mins worth , at the beginning .
The crux of the session were comparisons of good and great designers , structured along the lines of previous articles I ’ve written : Good designers ( blank ) , Great designers ( blank ) .
Following is a recap of the 9 skills presented .
Good designers :
Decorate
Believe “ less ” is more
Fix problems
Are inspired within a genre
Macrodesign
Treat text as content
Use good typefaces
Code for one instance
Redesign
Great designers :
Communicate
Believe “ less ” and “ more ” co-exist
Prevent problems
Are inspired by their total environment
Microdesign
Treat text as UI
Use good typography
Code for many instances
Realign

I make ballistic gel often as I work with lots of sharp tools ( knives , axes , machetes , etc. ) and I like to test them .
When I make mine I still use the 1 cup of water to 1 oz of powder ratio , but I put the pot in the fridge when it is all mixed together and heated .
Once this has solidified , I put the pot back on the stove and melt it again .
Once this second melting is done , I then pour it into my mold ( sprayed with non stick already ) .
This then goes in the fridge until it is ready to use .
Once you ’re done using it , you can rinse it with cold water ( so it does n’t melt ) and then remelt , and remold until next time .
This second heat ( in my opinion ) produces a more realistic representation of flesh in that it holds together better and is less like jello .
The arms trade has expanded by more than 20 % worldwide in the past five years , with the Middle East and Asian countries accounting for most of the increase , according to figures to be released today by the authoritative Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ( Sipri ) .
The US was by far the largest arms supplier , accounting for 31 % of global weapons exports over the past five years , with over a third going to the Middle East .
The US also supplied 40 % of Pakistan 's major conventional weapons systems .
The five biggest suppliers of conventional arms were the US , Russia , Germany , France and the UK .
China was the biggest recipient , followed by India , though China has recently cut its imports dramatically as it builds up its indigenous arms industry , Sipri says .
Arms sales to Middle Eastern countries rose by 38 % , with their purchases including more than 200 US combat aircraft and more than 5,000 guided bombs .
Britain 's biggest markets for its arms were the US and India , which is receiving 66 Hawk - 100 trainer aircraft and 20 Jaguar - S fighter aircraft from the UK .
Delivery of 72 Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft to Saudi Arabia is due to begin this year , Sipri says .
According to government figures , in the last quarter of last year Whitehall approved arms exports to Sri Lanka worth £ 1.4 m , mainly components for communications equipment .
This compares with under £ 1 m - worth of UK arms exports to the country for the whole of 2007 .
" When the world needs co-operative solutions to global problems , the thriving international arms market points to a squandering of resources which the international community can ill afford , " said Paul Holtom , head of Sipri 's arms transfer programme .
By now it ought to be clear that the U.S. must get off oil .
We can no longer afford the dangers that our dependence on petroleum poses for our national security , our economic security or our environmental security .
Yet civilization is not about to stop moving , and so we must invent a new way to power the world ’s transportation fleet .
Cellulosic biofuels — liquid fuels made from inedible parts of plants — offer the most environmentally attractive and technologically feasible near - term alternative to oil .
Los Angeles , London , New Delhi , Singapore and Washington DC ( May 29 , 2009 ) - Those in the United States living with HIV / AIDS are more likely to use marijuana than those in Kenya , South Africa or Puerto Rica to alleviate their symptoms , according to a new study published in Clinical Nursing Research , published by SAGE .
Those who did use marijuana rate it as effective as prescribed or over the counter ( OTC ) medicines for the majority of common symptoms , once again raising the issue that therapeutic marijuana use merits further study and consideration among policy makers .
A significant percentage of those with HIV / AIDS use marijuana as a symptom management approach for anxiety , depression , fatigue , diarrhoea , nausea , and peripheral neuropathy .
Members of the University of California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) International HIV / AIDS Nursing Research Network examined symptom management and quality of life experiences among those with HIV / AIDS in the US , Africa , and Puerto Rico , to gain a fuller picture of marijuana 's effectiveness and use in this population .
With data from a longitudinal , multi-country , multi-site , randomised control clinical trial , the researchers used four different evaluation tools to survey demographics , self - care management strategies for six common symptoms experienced by those living with HIV / AIDS , quality of life instrument and reasons for non-adherence to medications .
Either marijuana use for symptom management is vastly higher in the US , or participants elsewhere chose not to disclose that they use it : nine tenths of study participants who said they used marijuana live in the US .
No African participants said they used it , and the remaining ten percent were from Puerto Rico .
The researchers found no differences between marijuana users and nonusers in age , race , and education level , income adequacy , having an AIDS diagnosis , taking ARV medications , or years on ARV medications .
But the two groups did differ in that marijuana users had been HIV positive longer , and were more likely to have other medical conditions .
Transgender participants were also more likely to use marijuana .
Participants using marijuana as a management strategy were spread fairly consistent across all six symptoms , ranging from a low of 20 % for fatigue to a high of 27 % for nausea .
Prescribed medications were used by 45 % of those with fatigue , ranging down to almost 18 % of those with neuropathy .
The findings contained nuances when comparing marijuana to other medications .
Those who used marijuana rated their anxiety significantly lower than those who did not , and women who used marijuana had more intense nausea symptoms .
For those who use both marijuana and medications for symptom management , antidepressants were considered more effective than marijuana for anxiety and depression , but marijuana was rated more highly than anti-anxiety medications .
Immodium was better for diarrhoea than marijuana , as were prescribed medications for fatigue .
However , marijuana was perceived to be more effective than either prescribed or OTC medications for nausea and neuropathy .
However , the differenced in perceived efficacy in all these results were slight .
As found in previous studies , those who used marijuana were less likely to comply with their regime of ARV medications .
But perhaps counter - intuitively of the many reasons given for skipping pills , ' forgetfulness ' was no different in this group than among those who did not use marijuana .
Marijuana use is known to contribute to patients ' lack of compliance with ARV drugs , however those who use marijuana to target a particular symptom are actually more likely to stick closely to their ARV regimen too .
The researchers point out that of those who used marijuana for their symptoms , it is not known whether they also used the drug for recreation .
Patterns of how marijuana use interferes with patients ' adherence to medication regimens , along with other drugs , warrant further study .
The 775 participants were recruited from Kenya , South Africa , two sites in Puerto Rico , and ten sites in the United States .
They had on average been diagnosed for a decade - the majority ( 70 % ) were taking anti-retroviral ( ARV ) medications and more than half had other medical conditions alongside HIV / AIDS .
It is hard to pinpoint the marijuana use targeted to alleviate symptoms of those other illnesses as distinct from those relating solely to HIV / AIDS .
Data suggest that marijuana is a trigger among those susceptible to psychosis , and is also associated with the risk of suicidal thoughts .
However it is not linked to an increased risk of lung cancer ( over and above risks associated with smoking it along with tobacco ) .
The question of the use of marijuana for symptom management when legal drugs are available remains a practice and policy issue .
" Given that marijuana may have other pleasant side effects and may be less costly than prescribed or OTC drugs , is there a reason to make it available ? " asks study leader Inge Corless .
" These are the political ramifications of our findings .
Our data indicate that the use of marijuana merits further inquiry . "

On his first trip outside Washington since assuming his new role , Kerlikowske told a law enforcement crowd Wednesday that marijuana should remain illegal , but public health officials — not police — should lead efforts to reduce illegal drug use .
" Legalization is n't in the president 's vocabulary , and it certainly is n't in mine , " he told 300 police , federal agents and law enforcement officials .
[ USA Today ]
What better way to blow off the debate over legalization than to pretend there 's no such thing ?
As supremely lame as it is to find the drug czar sucking up to law enforcement by sneering at the legalization debate , there 's something interesting happening here .
He says legalization is a foreign concept to him , butSounds like somebody 's feeling the pressure .

The APRON library is intended to be a common interface to various underlying libraries / abstract domains and to provide additional services that can be implemented independently from the underlying library / abstract domain , as shown by the poster on the right ( presented at the SAS 2007 conference .
You may also look at :
the associated flyer ;
a 15 minutes presentation made at CAV 2009 conference in Grenoble [ JM09 ] ;
a detailed presentation by Antoine Miné .
Currently , APRON provides a C interface and an OCaml interface .
There also exists a C++ interface , which is more experimental .
The version 0.9.10 ( 10th septembre 2009 ) contains 3 libraries and 4 abstract domains :
The BOX intervals library
The OCT octagon library
The NEWPOLKA Convex Polyhedra and Linear Equalities library
It also provides an optional interface to the Parma Polyhedra Library , which adds
the Convex Polyhedra and Linear Congruences ( grid ) domains
the reduced product of NewPolka convex polyhedra and PPL linear congruences
The online Interproc static analyzer illustrates the use of the APRON library in static analysis .
APRON is a free software under LGPL license , except the wrappers related to the PPL library , which follows the GPL license of the PPL library .
An ANSI C compiler ( only gcc with ansi option has been tested )
The GMP library , version 4.2 or up , and the MPFR library , version 2.2 or up ;
Optionally , Parma Polyhedra Library , and GMP compiled with - enable - cxx configuration option )
configuration option )
If you want the C++ interface ( still experimental ) , GCC 4.1.2 or up
If you want to use the OCaml interface , you need the OCaml system , version 3.09 or up , the CamlIDL 1.05 stub code generator for the OCaml interface , as well as GNU SED 4.1 or up , and GNU m4 ( if you download from subversion repository ) .
You also need MLGMPIDL , but it can be included if you opt for the " distribution " version of APRON ( see below ) .
Changes
The best way is to access to the SUBVERSION REPOSITORY , by typing something like svn list svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svnroot/apron svn co svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svnroot/apron/apron/trunk apron svn co svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svnroot/apron/apron-dist/trunk apron-dist http://svn.cri.ensmp.fr/svn/apron/ is obsolete )
As the library may still contain subtle bugs , we strongly suggest to be up - to - date with the most recent version .

I have been reading the Catalyst mailing list for a while .
I ’m also subscribed to the DBIx : : Class mailing list .
These are reasonably busy lists where converstations range from incredibly techincal arguments about ways to refactor the cor to new and confused people sticking their head in and asking questions .
Usually they ’re polite and well thought posts from intelligent people .
This is a little different from a lot of Open Source projects !
There are intelligent people helping , unlike the last time I was on the Rails public mailing list .
It apparently consisted of complete newbies who could n’t get Rails installed asking “ experts ” who had been around all of two weeks how to get unstuck .
My question there got dead silence , until someone finally said , “ Gosh .
That ’s hard . ”
The Perl folks do n’t seem to consist of angry people who ’ll tear you up if you ask a question that ’s referred to obliquiely in one of the documents .
That behavior always reminds me of the openbsd - users list , where you ’d better have read every possibly useful man page before you ask a question .
( Save yourself the trouble ; just read them all . )
Last time I asked a question there , I got snarked at to , “ RTFM ! ” and then they got slammed with , “ They did .
Read the OP . ”
The final result was , “ Gosh .
Should n’t ought to do that .
Dunno . ”
I have n’t seen thoughtless idiots shouting , “ Read the FAQ ! ” yet , either .
That whole phenomenon explains why I stayed away from Linux for as long as I did ; I had a problem and tried to ask if anyone knew a solution .
I asked if anyone could help me debug it .
I was willing to trace code as far as it took ; I had time , I was a C programmer , I could help .
All I got ( dozens of copies of , from different jerks across the world ) , “ Read the FAQ ! ” Guess what ?
I had , and it was n’t there .
Three years later I found it was an actual kernel bug .
I asked a question on the Catalyst list the day before yesterday .
I was n’t expecting it to be painful because I ’ve read the list for a while and know that is n’t their style .
I was n’t expecting what I got , though .
I got not one , but several clear and helpful replies .
In fact , the response has been fantastic .
They were of varying lengths , but all made interesting suggestions .
They were from the authors of the modules Iam using , core organizers of the project as a whole , and other interested list members who had suggestions to make .
They pointed out techniques that could work with the current code , discussed some improvements they would like to see to some modules to make things easier , and made many useful suggestions .
Now , they did mention that the cost for excellent advice like tihs is to turn the advice in to documentation .
I think that ’s great , for a number of reasons .
If it happens on a regular basis , it clearly explains why Catalyst some of the better documentation of an Open Source project .
That sounds like topic for an entierly different post .
After they were so helpful and kind , how could I not want to follow up and write down a bunch of the things that were discussed ?
In addition to asking a question , and getting a lot of fantastic help , I followed up on a prior suggestion here on this very blog , that I update the documents for a component of Catalyst .
I took the time and did so .
The response to that was also good .
They did n’t snark about every possible little thing that could be different .
They accepted the patch , and were pleased about it .
They said “ Thank you ! ” and it sounded like they meant it .
I know that saying “ Thank you ” is something we try to teach every little child … but somewhere along the way it seems to get lost .
It ’s so very nice .
In addition to these friendly mailing lists , there are the Perl Monks .
That ’s another big batch of folks who ’ll talk on their forums and write messages and answer questions and be helpful .
As well as silly , friendly , goofy , and encouraging .
There are only two hard parts to talking to them ; one is figuring out their slightly odd forums , and the other is getting up the gumption to post .
Seems to be worthwhile .
One of the points Matt Trout wrote about was to get people out of the mailing lists and on to blogs where they ’d be easier to see .
I think that ’s great .
I also thought I ’d take a moment to tell someone who might find this to go to the mailing lists !
They ’re great too !
I ’ll end with this :
Thank you for the responses .
They ’ve helped me solve a techinical problem , and learn how the system works , and learn new techniques to finding things , and understand the libraries and Perl better .
You really do form a community , and it ’s a great thing .
" As Comcast has grown from a small regional cable company to one of the nation 's largest media and telecommunications companies , the regulatory and legislative issues confronting us have become increasingly more complex , " said Sena Fitzmaurice , an executive director of corporate communications .
" At any given time , there are a variety of topics in multiple forums that can affect our customers , our employees , and the competitive environment .
It is important for us to be engaged and a part of these discussions . "
I guess by now most of you have already seen the supposedly leaked Nikon roadmap .
Let me tell you that if even half of that is true , we ’re fucked here at Canon at least up until 2014 .
Already we ’re having a hard time trying to top the D300 , D700 and D3( x ) Nikon camera models .
Based on where things stand right now , I ’m projecting our products in the same categories to catch up to those models sometime in 2011 .
The problem is that all of those Nikon models will be updated in 2010 already , setting us back to catch up at least until 2014 .
This is quite depressing to say the least .
I ’ve been coming home drunk at night for the last few days because of this , and I ’m seriously thinking about a career switch .
I ’m still hopeful that the 1D Mark 4 will do something for us , but the 60D is not going to come anywhere close to the D300s Nikon is going to release soon from what I see .
And as far as I ’m concerned , we can just stop manufacturing the 5D Mark II when the D700 x gets released by the end of this year .
It simply wo n’t stand a chance .
Hell , the 5D Mark II is having a difficult time right now already .
You ca n’t even begin to imagine the support nightmare it is causing us at Canon USA .
But more on this later .
As if all this is not enough , the marketing morons at Canon Inc. have been busy again trying to improve public opinion of the 1D Mark III autofocus ( AF ) .
The last time they tried this was with the 1D Mark III autofocus manual website , where they also enlightened photographers worldwide about the “ Autofocus Philosophy ” ( Autofocus Joke is more like it ) at Canon Inc .
The 1D Mark III , as we all know , has been a complete fiasco for us ever since Galbraith sold out to Nikon and showed everyone how crappy its autofocus system really is .
Canon Inc. has tried to fix the AF issues a few times , without much luck , according to Galbraith .
We ’re now up to Silver dots on the 1D Mark III boxes .
Who knows how many more colored dots it will need to finally deliver a working AF system with the 1D Mark III .
They may have to go beyond the color spectrum of visible light with those dots .
I for one have stopped keeping track .
But anyway , now those marketing morons at Canon Inc. somehow managed to get funding for another one of their boneheaded marketing ideas .
They went out and interviewed photographer Takahito Mizutani so he could tell all of you how good the 1D3 autofocus really is .
Now when I saw this , the first thing that went through my mind was who the fuck is Takahito Mizutani and why should people care about what he says ?
Seriously ?
If you watch the interview with Mizutani , he mentions the “ excellent AF ” of the 1D3 so many times it becomes very obvious what the purpose of the whole interview really is .
Heck , the interview begins with Mizutani claiming the “ excellent AF ” is the biggest advantage of the 1D3 .
You simply ca n’t be more obvious than that .
Even if this was n’t a problem , there ’s still the issue of why people should listen to some Japanese guy named Takahito Mizutani who likely got paid ( or possibly threatened ) to do the interview .
I mean for Christ ’s sake , could n’t they find someone better ?
At Nikon they have Ashton Kutcher !
The guy probably never actually uses a Nikon camera longer than 2 minutes a month , and that ’s when he ’s able to figure out how to turn it on .
But when he tells people he ’s using a Nikon DSLR , millions of people who know and like him listen .
And that ’s marketing .
But at Canon Inc.?
There they have the great Mr. Mizutani .
Could n’t they pay someone better to talk about the 1D3 ?
How about Arnold Schwarzenegger ?
Nikon has Ashton Kutcher , why ca n’t we have Schwarzenegger ?
Can you imagine Arnold dressed like the T - 800 on his Harley looking very serious , pulling out a 1D3 and going “ I require excellent AF . ”
That clip would have moved some serious inventory .
Instead , we have this :
This is not the first time I complained about our marketing efforts .
A while ago Nikon released the D90 and had photographer Chase Jarvis talk about it on his blog which created a lot of publicity .
I ’m willing to bet that a crapload more people know who Chase Jarvis is compared to Mr. Mizutani .
And this is another thing , you see .
Why is it that almost all the cool , fun , edgy and vocal photographers on the Internet use Nikon gear ?
These guys have entire communities of fans and followers , unlike Mr. Mizutani .
So you know when they talk about the gear they ’re using , people are going to notice .
Take Chase Jarvis for example .
He ’s been hit by a car , hosed down , fell from a bridge and exploded into flames .
And he ’s using Nikon gear .
How cool is that ?
Then you have people like Joe McNally who get attacked by midgets on tricycles , also a Nikon user .
I ca n’t imagine Canon Inc. funding such a project for me .
I ’m stuck answering technical questions on the Internet in my Tech Tips columns in such a boring way .
I can barely keep myself awake when I read my own Tech Tips .
Can you imagine me in such a video , getting hit by a midget on a moped in the middle of explaining custom function settings for the 1D3 ?
One can always dream .
At least I have this blog , right ?
And then you have even more people using Nikon gear with entire communities , like the Lord of the Speedlights , showing thousands of people on the Internet how he lights stuff with his preciouses .
Even Scott Kelby uses Nikon gear .
But at Canon Inc. :
To be fair , I have to admit that we did have our moment at Canon USA when Vincent Laforet , God bless his soul , created the short movie Reverie with the 5D Mark II .
But that was entirely his initiative and thank God we were able to give him a 5D2 for a few days to do it .
And you ’d think the morons at Canon Inc. would have noticed the success and try to do more of this , but instead they ’re doing crap like interviewing Mr. Mizutani .
This is what I ca n’t stand about Canon Inc. , their sheer arrogance .
Nikon appears to be listening to photographers worldwide , contacting them and asking them what they need , actively participating in the community in various ways .
Canon Inc. does n’t appear to be interested in what anyone thinks .
Years of feedback I ’ve been sending them keeps getting ignored .
They keep kissing eachother ’s asses in upper management and pretend all is well .
You ca n’t imagine how frustrated and tired I am of this .
The result of all this are the mediocre products we ’re releasing lately , compared to the competition .
For example , Nikon is far ahead with their flash system compared to ours .
It did n’t surprise me one bit when one frustrated user wrote down his complaints about our flash system this week and published it on the Internet .
Now everyone knows how much we suck .
The only thing that seems to be missing in his list is the addition of a small beep sound to the flash head so you can hear if the flash went off or not without having to look at it and blind yourself in the process .
I ’ve been sending a lot of the feedback in that list to Canon Inc. for years now , and they keep ignoring it .
One reason is their absurd mentality of just refusing to release certain features for ‘ marketing ’ reasons , and another is their lazy engineering attitude .
The EOS 50D is still crippled with a laughable 9 point AF system while Nikon ’s D300 has a whopping 51 - point AF system .
Our 5D Mark II has a pathetic 9 - point AF system that ’s inferior even to the 50D , while Nikon ’s D700 has an asskicking 51 - point professional level AF system .
In the case of the 5D2 , the pathetic AF system has practically ruined what could have been a great product .
Let me give you an example of what I call lazy - ass engineering at Canon Inc. in Japan :
The viewfinder closing ‘ mechanism . ’
First , let us observe the Nikon solution :
That ’s a simple and elegant solution , right ?
Now let us look at the solution the schmart engineers at Canon Inc. in Japan came up with :
See that ?
Now that is some state of the art engineering if I ever saw it !
You look at this and you start to wonder if maybe somehow they managed to recover a crashed UFO disc in Japan , reverse engineered the advanced Alien technology and used it to create this marvelous piece of engineering .
I mean , this is high tech .
Future generations are going to look back at us and mention how we were so ahead of our time with this technology .
I look at this and I wonder if it would n’t have been easier for Canon to just supply users with a roll of black electrical tape so they could use it to cover the eyepiece .
This example clearly illustrates the problem with Canon Inc. Lazy and mediocre engineering .
That ’s why our DSLR bodies are beginning to look pre-historic and seriously lacking features compared to the competition .
So is our flash system , and soon even our lenses .
This is the attitude that crippled the 5D Mark II , and is now causing me to get loads of emails every week from people complaining about the autofocus system on the camera .
Now can you understand how the 5D2 ended up with a pathetic 9 point AF system that is struggling to do the job ?
Remember , Canon Inc. had 3 whole years after the release of the first 5D to come up with a better AF system for the 5D Mark II .
And yet , they had the nerve to release the 5D2 with what they claim to be the same AF system of the 3 - year old 5D .
The 5D Mark II bodies might be flying off of the shelves , but they ’re flying into our service centers just as fast .
Just look at some of the comments on this website :
http://www.jenniferphotography.com/
I was glad I stumbled on this post .
I have been having some major focus issues lately and starting googling it , and found this .
Describes exactly what I have been experiencing at recent portrait shoots and my last wedding , which forced me to focus all of my lenses manually not to miss any shots .
The problem is that I do not have perfect eyes and while the diopter compensates , it is not perfect either , and it can still be very difficult in low light , such as the reception , to tell what it actually in focus .
Im going through this wedding now and am very disappointed by missing several shots due to the focus issue !
Many are just very soft or off the mark .
The focus just hunts and hunts , even in GREAT light and had a hard time deciding between the brides white dress or the grooms black tux , thus taking way to long to focus .
Even in a couple shots where I had time to play with the live view zoom , in an effort to zero in on a specific part of the image and know exactly where the tack sharp point should be , some of the images still came out soft , despite what appeared on the LCD .
I ’m sending it in to Canon to see what they can do to fix or replace , but for a $ 3000 camera and as a wedding photographer where I cannot miss moments , I find this unacceptable .

WOW !!!
I am glad I finally discovered what has been going on with my new 5D MII !!!!!
I ’ve only had it for about a month and have become VERY unhappy with the focusing issues .
At first I thought it was me ….. but I have been a professional photographer for over 24 years , so to question my skills at this stage of the game , really gave me cause to scratch my head .
I am missing key moments .
I am primarily a wedding photographer and when you miss things like the bride coming down the aisle , Daddy giving her away , the final kiss , or mom wiping away tears as she dances with her son on the dance floor ….. this is UNACCEPTABLE !!!!!!!
This past weekend , I even had moments where the camera would not focus at all !
I had to reach up and throw it into manual focus just to get them cutting the cake .
And then go back to Auto - focus when the moment was over .
Not to mention … low light situations with weddings is pretty standard .
I enjoy the high ISO ’s and they rock ….. when you can get it to focus .
What is the point in having the new high ISO ’s , if the damn thing wo n’t focus in low light ???
Not to mention I had to do a little “ Creative Financing ” just to be able to afford the price tag in this economy .

Well , all I can start off the say is , it ’s a great video camera but I cant get that thing to focus properly for the life of me .
I have done everything I can to make sure it is not me .
I have owned 10D , 20D , 30D and the 40D .
My 40 D can kick my 5D ’s butt any day of the week when it comes the image being in focus .
I had two big projects that went down last month and I had to reshoot everything practically and still could n’t get a super sharp shot .
So two days ago I went to the local camera shop and told them my story - I have a new camera coming no questions asked .

DO NOT PURCHASE A CANON 5D MkII !
I am a full time photographer and I have sent my 5d mark II back 2 times !
Canon acts like I am crazy when I tell them I am getting soft images !
What the hell !
They said that they can not find anything wrong with my camera .
I guess their testing does not include taking pictures because this thing is bad .
And to top it all off my shutter locked up and I had to have them replace the mirror and the shutter .
Wish that would have helped the soft images !
Did a shoot yesterday , took 140 images and only ( your gona love this ) 6 were in sharp focus !
Purchased a 50D last year as a back up , shot with it for a week to test it out and sold it the next , very soft images and the ISO ’s were worse than the 40D .
My old 5D has been a camp , giving me great images all the time but it is getting old , wish there was a Canon camera I could purchase to replace it .
Canon must be forking out major money for all these reviews to be so good on most media outlets .
I have been using Canon for 14 years and the only thing they can do is act like it is a user problem !
Well , that was the last straw , I have contacted my local camera store and I am changing all my equipment out to Nikon before the end of the year .
It sucks that I have to change out all this equipment and spend all this money ( $ 20,000.00 to replace all my lens , bodies , etc… ) for something as fundamental as focus on a camera !

And these are just the last 4 comments , there ’s plenty more where that came from .
And the noise and banding in dark tones at low ISO on the 5D2 are just plain ugly .
If you look at my blog ’s homepage on the right side , you ’ll see the post titled “ Banding and Pattern Noise – EOS 5D Mark II and EOS 50D ” as the top post .
If you wonder why , it ’s all thanks to Google .
People are seeing these problems on the camera and searching for solutions on Google .
They sure as hell are n’t going to find it at Canon .
Looking at the search keyword statistics of my blog , every day there are quite some people looking for solutions to the noise , banding and autofocus issues with the 5D2 .
Really , just look at the top posts on my homepage , it says it all .
I do n’t know anymore what to say to people that are emailing me about this either .
I really do n’t know how much more of this I can take .
Anyway , I ’m going to get me a nice cup of Irish coffee right now and try to relax .
The Iran nuclear deal is done .
And the world ’s biggest companies have already visited Tehran ready to strike a deal when sanctions end .
These businesses will add even more to Iran ’s bottom line .
And that means continued development of nuclear technologies and more cash for Hamas and Hezbollah .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Bankrupt automaker General Motors Corp. announced Friday that it will sell its Saturn unit to car dealership operator Penske Automotive Group .
Penske ( PAG , Fortune 500 ) is owned by former race car driver Roger Penske , who owns NASCAR and IndyCar racing teams .
The deal gives Penske the rights to the 19 - year old brand including its five different models .
GM would continue production of only the three highest - selling models : the Aura sedan , and the Vue and Outlook cross -over SUVs , for the next two years .
The Saturn Sky and Astra models will be discontinued .
Penske , which has no Saturn dealerships in its network , will act only as a distributor for Saturn cars and parts to the brand 's dealer network .
Like almost all car dealerships in the U.S. , Saturn dealerships are independently owned businesses .
Penske has no plans to open any Saturn dealerships , said Anthony Pordon , senior vice president at Penske Automotive .
The arrangement is similar to the deal under which Penske distributes Daimler AG 's tiny Smart car in the United States .
Penske does operate a small number of its own Smart dealerships , however , in addition to handling wholesale deliveries of the car to other dealerships .
The deal , which GM expects to be completed in October , would save more than 13,000 jobs at Saturn and its roughly 350 dealers nationwide .
All of Saturn 's dealerships sell only Saturn vehicles , so they are reliant on the brand 's continuation for their survival .
" There has been a groundswell of support for Saturn , with our retailers and owners urging us to save the brand , " said Jill Lajdziak , Saturn 's general manager .
" We heard their call loud and clear , and it inspired us as we worked to secure Saturn 's future . "
Saturn 's 51 Canadian dealerships are not part of the deal .
The sale is part of GM 's strategy to shed its four " non-core " U.S. brands -- Saturn , Hummer , Pontiac and Saab -- as it restructures the company .
On Tuesday , GM ( GMGMQ ) announced a deal to sell its Hummer line to China 's Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd .
In search for a maker : GM has said it would stop producing Saturn vehicles by 2011 .
To replace GM as the brand 's manufacturer , Penske is in discussions with several global automakers .
One likely replacement is Renault Samsung Motors of Korea , Automotive News reported .
" We have been in discussions on a worldwide basis with many people that have an interest in this marketplace , " Penske said .
Penske indicated that the post - GM brand will focus on fuel economy .
An expert said that move would likely return Saturn to its more successful roots of a lower - end , competitive - priced car company .
Still , much will depend on the quality of cars that it sells .
" It 's really going to depend on who Penske partners up with , " said Jeremy Anwyl , CEO of Edmunds.com .
" Even if it sells good , global - standard vehicles , Saturn will need to stand for more than just the retail experience . "
Anwyl said Saturn had not been hitting its sales targets as it moved to better - quality -- but more expensive -- cars over the past few years .
He said the no-haggle pricing turned off many potential buyers who thought that they could get a better deal elsewhere .
Saturn 's new management : Penske said he wants Lajdziak to stay on at the company , and he also offered former Chrysler President Tom LaSorda a top spot at Saturn .
Penske hired LaSorda in May as a consultant for the Saturn deal .
Lajdziak would not yet say if she would accept the position .
" My total focus every waking minute has been to get to this point , to get a memorandum of understanding , " she told CNNMoney.com .
The Saturn brand has been highly rated in customer satisfaction surveys for its no -haggle policy .
Though Saturn sales have slumped badly this year , the brand actually far outsold Buick and Cadillac in 2008 , when it was GM 's fourth highest - selling unit .
GM has sold more than 4 million Saturns since 1990 .
Roger Penske told CNNMoney.com that he 's " happy " to get Saturn 's 3.5 million customer base , though it 's too soon to start talking about global growth for the company .
Penske Automotive is the nation 's second largest auto dealer and currently sells over 40 brands at its 310 dealerships , half of which are in the United States .
Shares of Penske rose 3 % in afternoon trading .
For nearly 100 years , we have maintained a thesaurus to tag The New York Times .
The thesaurus consists of more than a million terms organized into five controlled vocabularies : subjects , personal names , organizations , geographic locations and the titles of creative works ( books , movies , plays , etc ) .
At last week ’s Semantic Technology Conference , we announced our intention to publish The New York Times thesaurus under a license that will allow the community to both use it and contribute back to it .
The results will , in time , prepare The Times to enter the linked data cloud .
Evan Sandhaus
Releasing the Times thesaurus is consistent with our Times Open strategy .
We want to facilitate access to slices of our data for those who want to include Times content in their applications .
Our TimesTags API already makes available our most frequently used tags , the 27,000 that power our topics pages .
But the new effort will go well beyond that .
We plan to release hundreds of thousands of tags from the corpus back to 1980 , and later , in a second phase , hundreds of thousands more going back to 1851 .
Our hope is that the community will link our thesaurus to existing taxonomies and , when we release the tags for the deep archive , help normalize the terms .
Many details need to be ironed out , including format , location and the license .
At the conference , we asked the audience for input and received some good ideas .
We would love to have more .

We recently had the opportunity to again dine at Teppan Edo , a teppanyaki - style restaurant in Epcot ’s Japan pavilion .
We always have a great time here , as CMs are friendly and engaging , and sitting family style with 6 other people is usually an interesting experience .
We also love the food !
Most everything is cooked teppanyaki - style , meaning foods , usually steak , other meats , and vegetables in the Western version of teppanyaki , are grilled using a hot plate in the middle of the table .
Japanese restaurant chain , Misono , was the first to introduce Western - influenced teppanyaki - style dining in Japan back in 1945 .
Since then , the “ Japanese Steakhouse ” genre has been more popular with tourists than locals in Japan ; locals tend to prefer fish , noodle dishes ( like Yakisoba ) , and flour - and vegetable - based dishes for their teppanyaki .
At Teppan Edo , you and your table mates are brought to and seated at your table , soon to be welcomed by a CM taking drink and food orders .
You ’re then welcomed by your table ’s chef , who explains the process of teppanyaki and confirms the orders .
Me ?
I had to try a Sake - rita !
It came highly recommended by our waiter , and who am I to turn down an opportunity to imbibe a sake - based margarita ?
And then , the show begins !
Our chef expertly delivered on the standard teppan chef tricks –the onion volcano , the shrimp tail throw - and - catch , the knife tricks .
She did a great job .
The appetizers we ’d ordered soon came out of the kitchen ( these are n’t the table chef ’s job , luckily ! ) , and we enjoyed a tempura selection , miso soup , and a salad while watching the show .
Wondering about the name , Teppan Edo , I did a bit of reasearch and found the following :
According to Wikipedia : The Edo period ( 江戸時代 , Edo jidai ? ) , or Tokugawa period ( 徳川時代 , Tokugawa jidai ? ) , is a division of Japanese history running from 1603 to 1868 and is the premodern era .
The period marks the governance of the Edo or Tokugawa shogunate , which was officially established in 1603 by the first Edo shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu .
The Edo period is also known as the beginning of the early modern period of Japan .
The Teppan Edo menu also sports a map of Japan during the Edo period , and the main dishes are named after cities in the country .
We orderded the Nihonbashi , which included both steak and chicken , with noodles .
The meal was delicious , as usual , and I ’m always amazed by the relative healthiness of these dishes .
Soybean oil is used to grill , so although there is some fat , it ’s not exactly artery - clogging stuff .
Do n’t be fooled , however –the portions are large !
You can find Teppan Edo in the large building on the right - hand side of the Japan pavilion in Epcot–just head up the stairs and you ’ll come across the entry for both Teppan Edo and Tokyo Dining .

One of the coolest features of the Sony PlayStation 3 is a Bluetooth remote control .
If you spring for the reasonably priced optional remote there ’s no need to point it at the device like any old IR remote .
You can gleefully pause , play or rewind movies played back on your PS3 from the bathroom .
But , that brings us to one the PS3 ’s fattest shortcomings , its lack of an IR remote option .
So , your big fancy universal remote control can’t provide you a PS3 option .
Suddenly Sony ’s big - bad convergent media device is looking rather short on convenience .
Take heart couch potatoes - all ’s not lost !
It seems Logitech has heard your pain and has produced the Logitech Harmony PS3 Adapter .
This is no budget IR - to - USB , PS3 command center .
USB is a popular low - cost method for working around Sony ’s IR prejudice but it suffers serious shortcomings .
An IR - to - USB adaptor is laggier than a VoIP call from Mars .
But the biggest problem with an IR receiver that plugs into PS3 ’s USB port is that it ’s not a complete control solution .
You ’ll have to , Lord forbid , get up off the couch to power up the PS3 .
And that seems to defeat the purpose of having a universal remote control in the first place .
Powering the system down requires stepping through several steps within the operating system .
Sadly , this is just a shortcoming inherent in the PS3 and cannot be overcome with any fancy adapter .
You ’ll have to setup macros that carefully navigate the PS3 system and find the shut down option .
Logitech Harmony PS3 Bluetooth Adapter
Any adapter that can speak to the PS3 through Bluetooth is the more powerful yet costlier option .
IR - to - Bluetooth control options can receive IR commands from your universal remote and the adapter translates them to Bluetooth for the PS3 : Presto , now you can instantly power up Sony ’s entertainment hub – and your universal remote ’s macros can handle powering it down .
Logitech ’s adapter currently retails at $ 60 .
The price seems a bit costly for now but it ’s reasonable compared to similar devices – remember , this one combines both the USB and Bluetooth options .
One strike against the adapter it ’s only compatible with Logitech universal remotes .
Sure , Logitech makes a fine universal remote :
But what if you already have another brand ?
You ’ll be happy to know that you can find Harmony PS3 Adapter IR codes online so you can include non-Harmony universal remotes to your repertoire of potential PS3 controls .
“ In our book , Logitech 's PS3 Adapter is a success . ” – Stephen Kim EngadgetHD
If a reasonably priced IR adapter for PS3 , made by a respected name like Logitech , is something you ’ve been craving there ’s more information online .
EngadgetHD has a detailed review of the Logitech Harmony PS3 Adapter .
The review is all around quite positive about the product and these guys would know .
By reading the review you get the idea that the boys at EngadgetHD are the dedicated couch potatoes you can trust to kick the tires on a media universal remote control system .
Some members chafe at the perception that Yellowstone was a billionaires - only club .
While many arrive via private jet , others fly commercial and everyone ends up at the same airport in Bozeman , about an hour north of the club .
This helps explain why the Credit Suisse loan  the spending spree it enabled , the myriad legal actions it prompted , the bitter divorce it helped fuel  has been such a resounding bummer for members .
“ The promise of the Yellowstone Club was somehow sacrificed to the madness of Yellowstone Club World .
The plan that worked was held hostage to the ever more grandiose plan that didn’t , ” Mr. Hill says .
“ There is more than enough material to create a roman à clef that would make ‘ Dallas ’ or ‘ Dynasty ’ seem mild in comparison . ”
LIKE every good drama , this one has an intriguing setup .
The son of Norwegian immigrants , Mr. Blixseth grew up poor in Oregon and , he said in a magazine interview , executed his first deal when he was about 13  buying three donkeys for $ 75 and reselling them as pack mules for $ 225 .
He briefly attended college , according to earlier profiles , but dropped out .
Later came his timber deals .
Mr. Blixseth met Edra Crocker in Oregon , where she was living , unhappily , with her first husband and their two children .
Later , she would write a book , called “ Uncharged Battery , ” which described the alleged abuse she suffered in that marriage , which ended in the early ’ 80s .
Back then she was the breadwinner , she says , turning a graveyard waitressing shift into a managerial job for a restaurant chain and then into her own venture : a partnership in a small hotel and restaurant company .
She sold her stake after getting involved with Mr. Blixseth , and they married in 1983 .
Three years later , after one of Mr. Blixseth ’s timber transactions failed , the couple filed for bankruptcy , claiming $ 15.4 million in debt and $ 4,400 in assets , according to court records .
Then yet another timber deal set the stage for what would become the Yellowstone Club .
Mr. Blixseth swapped 100,000 acres that he and two partners had bought in Montana with the federal government for the land that now encompasses the club .
His partners took the timberland , and Mr. Blixseth took the acreage that could be developed .
At first , the Blixseths thought they would build a family compound .
But they began hearing from wealthy friends who wanted in .
“ Sometimes you have to pay to play , ” the Yellowstone Club ’s Web site said in its early years .
That message would be massaged over time to stress family values , not net worth .
Yes , to qualify for membership , you had to have money : a minimum of $ 3 million in liquid assets .
But the Blixseths eventually realized that they were selling something more valuable than exclusivity , something that eluded the moneyed classes : a sort of hometown normalcy .
Soon , the club had a new catchphrase : “ Where Families Gather . ”
Deja Vu All Over Again .
Once More .
Rarely has The Daily Reckoning been criticized for understating trouble .
But trouble keeps getting ahead of us .
We can barely keep up with it .
So often have we anticipated ‘ disaster ’ or ‘ catastrophe ’ that the words now fall like empty shells .
We light the fuses ; they do n’t go off .
Alas , we have become alarmists with no bell or siren .
We break the glass and pull the lever every week , but no sound is heard … except the familiar words whispered with in a hoarse , weary voice … watch out !
So today we turn to the dead for eyewitness accounts :
Otto Freidrich described the period of German hyperinflation and its effects : “…
People carried wages home in huge crates ; by the time they could spend even their trillion - mark notes they were practically worthless …
There was not a single girl in the entire middle class who could get married without her father paying a dowry …
They saved and saved so that they could get married , and so it destroyed the whole idea of remaining chaste until marriage … the girls learned that virginity did n’t matter anymore . ”
“ Against my will , ” wrote author Stefan Zweig “ I have witnessed the most terrible defeat of reason and wildest triumph of brutality in the chronicles of history . ”
Zweig lived through the hyperinflation in Germany during the ’ 20s and sold stories to survive .
Later , he moved to Brazil and blew his brains out .
Brutality triumphed because civilized life was smothered by inflation .
The Treaty of Versailles condemned the Huns to pay more than 47,000 tonnes of gold in reparations .
Taking that amount of real money out of the economy left the Germans with no choice .
They had no money left .
They had to create it .
Result : hyperinflation .
The size of the banknotes rose with the crisis .
In 1922 , the highest denomination was 50,000 Mark .
By 1923 , the highest denomination was 100,000,000,000,000 Mark .
By December 1923 the exchange rate was 4,200,000,000,000 Marks to 1 US dollar . ”
The German middle class was wiped out .
More importantly , the handrails and guideposts wobbled , so there was nothing to hold onto and no way to know where you were going .
Businesses , banks , military , police , even the government itself – everything tottered and fell down .
In the tumult , war - hardened rabble rolled towards Herr Hitler like loose nuts .
“ In economics , ” begins the Wikipedia description , “ hyperinflation is inflation that is very high or out of control …
Hyperinflation is often associated with wars ( or their aftermath ) , economic depressions , and political or social upheavals .
In both classical economics and monetarism , it is always the result of the monetary authority irresponsibly borrowing money to pay all its expenses . ”
Who ’s the biggest borrower today ?
The United States of America .
At 12 % of GDP , its deficit is more than twice as large as that of France .
It already owes Japan and China as much as Germany owed its former enemies in reparations – adjusted to today ’s money .
But America ’s debts are far grander than those of Germany in 1923 – even relative to the size of the US economy .
Where Germany owed a little over $ 1 trillion ; America – if you include private debt , official government debt , off - budget obligations and internal commitments – owes 100 times as much .
And the United States keeps borrowing more .
In a single year – 2009 – it will borrow $ 1.3 trillion , again , just shy of the debt that sank the Weimar Republic .
While the private sector during the bubble years brought U.S. debts to a record 3.7 times the entire nation ’s output , now it ’s the public sector that does the borrowing .
The Obama Administration is adding to the accumulated U.S. debt at a suicidal pace – four times faster than the record set just last year .
And America ’s central bank hands the borrower a loaded pistol ; it is adding bank reserves – which allow the money supply to expand geometrically – at a 4,500 % rate .
That last number is not a typo .
It ’s an alarm .
If the Federal Reserve were a heart patient , the defibrillators would be on already .
If it were a normal bank , it would be closed down immediately .
But neither Karl Helferich nor Ben Bernanke set out to ruin their economies .
Central bankers do n’t do it intentionally ; they do it inevitably .
Not because they want to , but because they have to .
Like the Germans in the ’ 20s , America has no politically acceptable way to pay her growing debts – except by printing more money .
And now , her leading intellectuals urge her on .
Cometh the hour when the feds begin to think about cutting back on their program of inflation , cometh the experts who will tell them to keep at it .
“ The crisis seems to be easing , and a chorus of critics is already demanding that the Federal Reserve and the Obama administration abandon their rescue efforts , ” writes Nobel winning economist Paul Krugman in the New York Times this week .
“ Those demands should be ignored .
It ’s much too soon to give up on policies that have …pulled us a few inches back from the abyss . ”
“ It ’s déjà vu all over again , ” he concludes , referring to the Japanese in the ’90s and the Americans in the ’30s .
In both cases , he thinks their economies died because they turned off the juice too soon .
But people come to think what they must think when they must think it :
“ To follow the good counsel of stopping [ the inflation machine ] would mean … that in a very short time the entire public , factories , mines , railways and post office , national and local government , in short , all national and economic life would be stopped . ”
Karl Helferich , Chairman , Central Bank of Germany , 1923 .
Déjà vu , all over again .
Once more .
Enjoy your weekend ,

The Daily Reckoning
Furious Seasons has alerted me to an interesting article in the Boston Globe about street dealing of the antipsychotic drug quetiapine – interesting because it reveals some of our prejudices about the neuroscience of recreational drug use .
One of the mantras of neuroscience is that drugs of abuse boost the dopamine system .
This led to the somewhat bizarre headlines earlier this year that modafinil may be ‘ addictive ’ because it was found to increase dopamine function in the nucleus accumbens , a key part of the reward system .
The reason this was bizarre is because while there are many reports of people illicitly using the drug to avoid sleep and maintain focus , there are none about ‘ modafinil addicts ’ .
In fact , I could n’t find a single case in the literature .
However , the ‘ all drugs of abuse boost dopamine ’ mantra trumped the fact that there are n’t any actual addicts to make people warn about its potential for addiction .
And by people I do n’t just mean the press , I mean the neuroscientists who carried out the research , including Nora Volkow , head of the US ’s National Institute on Drug Abuse .
And this is why the reports of the abuse of quetiapine ( trade name Seroquel ) , both in the popular press and in the medical literature , are so interesting , because quetiapine is a dopamine blocker .
In fact , it reduces function at the same D 2 dopamine receptors in exactly the same ‘ reward circuits ’ that are supposedly always stimulated by drugs of abuse .
In other words , it does exactly the opposite of what the received wisdom tell us , and yet , it is being widely abused to the point where people are getting gunned down over shady quetiapine deals .
As scientists one of our greatest vices is fitting the world into our theories , rather than fitting our theories to the world .
For neuroscientists , this is especially tempting because society has come to the popular but false conclusion that brain - based explanations trump behavioural or psychological observations .
There is more to drug abuse and addiction than dopamine and our clich√©s about the ‘ reward system ’ are hampering our efforts to make sense of it all .

PRAGUE — The Oklahoma Highway Patrol released a dashboard camera video late Friday that was recorded during an altercation between a patrol trooper and an emergency medical technician .
The patrol said the move is contrary to what the agency normally does but decided to release the video because of the high level of public interest and the fact that the release " would not affect the administrative review ” of the patrol ’s investigation of the incident , according to a statement released late Friday .
" We ’ve been well aware of the fact that this incident has drawn enormous attention , but made the decision to protect the integrity of the investigation , any and all relevant evidence , as well as the rights of the department employees during the course of the investigation as required by law , ” said patrol spokesman Capt .
Chris West .
The move came after the patrol received sharp criticism by the attorney representing the technician , who questioned the patrol ’s initial decision not to release the video .
The patrol has completed its internal investigation into the actions of trooper Daniel Martin , who has been placed on administrative leave with pay , West said .
The investigation is now under review .
Martin , a patrolman with two years experience , has been cleared of criminal wrongdoing by Okfuskee County District Attorney Max Cook .
He also said he would not file charges against Creek Nation EMT Maurice White Jr. , who is the person involved in the altercation with Martin .
Richard O’Carroll ,
White ’s attorney , had earlier criticized the patrol for not releasing the video .
" Why would n’t they release the video ? ” said O’Carroll of Tulsa .
West initially defended his agency ’s decision to withhold the dashboard video , adding that Martin is entitled to his " due process ” as a state employee .
Martin claims the ambulance driver , Paul Franks , rolled down his window and made an obscene gesture at him .
Franks denies making such a gesture .
" This investigation is to determine whether any disciplinary actions should be taken or not , ” West said .
" We ’re trying to take the high road here .
One video of the incident has reached the public domain .
The video was taken by the ambulance patient ’s son on his cell phone camera and posted on YouTube .
Martin is shown choking
White outside the ambulance with another patrolman , Brian Iker , urging everyone to remain calm .
" Thank God there was a camera , or else my client would have been prosecuted by now , ” O’Carroll said .
The invention of the umbrella can be traced back thousands of years , but never to one absolute source .
It ’s use has been depicted in historical texts , images and carvings dating back millennia– to ancient Rome , Egypt , China and the Middle East .
Today , we may take this handy tool for granted .
On the rainiest of days , what would you do if this tool was never created ?
To celebrate the value of the umbrella in modern life , here is TheCoolist ’s list of 20 amazing , creative and futuristic umbrellas that have taken this classic invention into wild new frontiers .
The Pileus Internet Umbrella Projects the Web
Ever noticed that the common texture of your typical umbrella canopy is not unlike a projector screen ?
Designers Takashi Matsumoto and Sho Hashimoto once noticed the same similarity – and upon that realization they created the Pileus Internet Umbrella .
Pileus is an umbrella that includes a mobile PC and a projector to display live internet content while keeping its user dry in the rain .
While you ’re singing in the rain , Pileus can play a Flickr slideshow , show a weather map update , watch YouTube videos and even check out updates here on TheCoolist.com …
Do n’t plan on getting your hands on a Pileus any time soon , as this umbrella is still in prototype stages .
The “ Umbuster ” Brass Knuckles Umbrella
Are YOU talking to ME ?
The Umbuster umbrella by Birkiland is one part rain gear and one part deadly weapon .
Umbuster ’s handle is a classic set of brass knuckles , or a “ knuckle duster ” as they call them across the pond .
Weave your fingers through these knuckles , you ’ll be protected from both the rain and the dodgy blokes stupid enough to step to you .
“ But being as this is an Umbuster , the most powerful umbrella in the world , and would knock your head clean off , you ’ve got to ask yourself one question :
Do I feel lucky ?
Well , do ya , punk ? ”
The LightDrops Rain- Powered Electric Umbrella
The LightDrops umbrella does precisely what it ’s name implies – it turns drops of rain into light .
How , you ask ?
LightDrops employs a conductive membrane called PDVF that converts the kinetic energy of the falling water into electricity in trace amounts .
Conceptually , this electricity will be enough to power LEDs within the inside of this umbrella ’s canopy .
So while you ’re walking through the rain , you ’re generating renewable energy that yields a stunning , stylish appearance .
The Multi-Unit Superbrella
Even the largest traditional umbrellas can’t keep you dry in rains mixed with heavy winds .
In cities like Chicago , the rain comes at you sideways– and the designer of the Superbrella has an idea that ’ll keep you dry in the toughest of rainy climates .
The Superbrella is made of five clear umbrellas– one on top and four in each cardinal direction .
In the four corner triangles that were not covered by the umbrellas , the designer has inserted a patch with a rain - proof hole that allows for aeration .
Grab yourself a Superbrella and a pair of tall rain boots – you ’ll stay dry in the toughest of rains .
Special Note– if you ’re not a cute , trendy girl as shown above , exect to look like kind of a toolbox with this thing .
The Hydro - Chromatic Umbrella
In your closet , this umbrella wo n’t look any different from your standard unit .
Once this baby is put to use in at least a mild rain , its canopy will transform and take on new colors in a vibrant fashion .
The Hydro - Chromatic Umbrella changes colors when wet , going from classic black to multi-colored and patterned .
As it dries , the colors will fade to black– awaiting its next task when the clouds bring rain again .
The Bluetooth Mobile Messenger Umbrella
We ’ve all been there – you ’re walking in the rain and wind , struggling to control your umbrella and then your phone rings .
Can you spare a free hand ?
With the Bluetooth Umbrella , you can .
The handle of the Bluetooth Umbrella features a touchscreen display with a caller ID , a speaker and mic to communicate with your caller and a radio receiver .
While Bluetooth mobile accessories have become a fashion faux pas , this one is functional enough to justify a few of your hard - earned dollars .
Or you could just wait until you arrive at your destination and then take the call …
The Senz Smart Umbrella
The Senz smart umbrella does n’t include any high technology , it does n’t tweet the level of incoming rain ( whoa , good idea , actually ! ) – it just works better than your average umbrella .
The Senz smart umbrella does n’t blow out in high winds like your traditional umbrella .
Like a windsock , this umbrella moves its tail in the direction of the wind , adjusting to maintain its structure and keep you dry .
No frills — just simple and smart .
The Home - Made Electric Umbrella
While you could splurge on the rare light umbrella , you could also just make one yourself .
The people at Instructables have a guide on how to turn your basic umbrella into an LED - lit masterpiece .
Grab yourself an umbrella , some LEDs and a working understanding of electronics , you can wire up one hell of a cool umbrella on the cheap .
The Contracting “ Polite Umbrella ”
Designer Jooyoun
Paek might have been poked in the eye by a passing umbrella or two in his day .
To solve this problem , and protect the eyes of others , Paek invented the Polite Umbrella , an umbrella that contracts to allow space ( and safety ) for passers by .
As another pedestrian approaches , simply pull the drawstring below the handle and the canopy ( and its stabby points ) contracts .
Nice idea , Jooyoun — any luck with mass production ?
The Hands - Free Nubrella
The Nubrella offers one primary and unique function– hands - free rain protection .
The cost , of course , is looking a bit goofy , but at least you ’ll remain dry .
Nubrella features a strap system that fits over your shoulders , holding the umbrella in place even in heavy rains and wind .
The Nubrella collapses and folds together for easy storage and carry , ready to pop open again as needed .
Unlike many of the other items on this list , Nubrella is more than a concept– it is in production and purchaseable today .
The Tandem Umbrella
The Tandem Umbrella design brings about a classic case of “ why did n’t we think of that sooner ” ?
If you ’ve tried to fit two people under an umbrella before , you know that somebody is going to get wet .
The Tandem Umbrella solves this by adding two shafts and two canopies , woven together to allow a rain - bound couple to have equal protection .
We ’re curious , though– how does the Tandem Umbrella collapse ?
The Stand Umbrella
Like the Senz Smart Umbrella above , the Stand Umbrella is a true case of simple brilliance .
No frills , no fancy tech , just ingenious functionality .
When not in use , the Stand Umbrella rests upon itself , using a tiny tip - based tripod to keep itself upright .
It does n’t get any simpler ( or smarter ) than that !
The Sword Umbrellas
The Sword Umbrellas can be summed up in just two words : bad ass .
While the canopy here is the same as your traditional umbrella , the handle sets these apart in a fun , rather violent way .
While they ca n’t be used as weapons like the Umbuster above can , these Sword Umbrellas certainly look the fit .
Buy one of these , and I ’ll dare you to try and not swing it around making sword fight noises with your mouth .
The Inside - Out Umbrella
The Inside - Out Umbrella does n’t leave a watery mess behind as it dries , it brings the remaining water with it .
Once you ’ve ended your rainy day commute , this umbrella wo n’t soak the floor where it rests – it folds into itself and creates a bag which carries the rain water that once covered it .
At work or at home , this remaining water dries without leaving a mess .
The Gunbrella
Continuing the theme of weaponized umbrella design , the Gunbrella features a toy gun as its handle .
While the rest of this design is 100 % traditional , the gun gives it a fresh , fun look for you to battle the rains .
Personally , we ’re a little leary about this design– if a passer by ( or police officer ) is n’t in on the joke , they might take you a bit too seriously for your own good .
Be careful with this one !
The Lightstick Umbrella
Fans of the cult classic film Bladerunner will instantly recognize these .
The LightStick Umbrella features a luminous shaft– from handle to canopy , this umbrella gives off radiant light to keep you company ( and looking stylish ) during a night time rain .
Surprisingly cheap , the LightStick Umbrella costs around $ 30 US , but presently only available in South Korea .
We ’ll take two– red , white or blue .
The Weather Forecasting Umbrella
Would n’t it be nice if your umbrella could warn you not to leave home without it ?
This one can .
The weather forecasting umbrella connects to your home ( or office ’s ) wi-fi connection to deliver real - time weather data .
This data is displayed by an illuminated translucent handle that glows blue when rain is approaching .
When you ’re on your way out the door , just glance at this umbrella and you ’ll be forewarned whether or not you ’ll need to bring this baby with you .
The Cloud Umbrella
While perhaps not as functional as the others on this list , we included the Cloud Umbrella for it ’s sheer thoughtful enthusiasm .
This umbrella delivers the same functionality as your classic umbrella , but it is styled to stand out from the crowd by mimicking a cloud .
The canopy on the Cloud Umbrella is actually a series of inflated spheres that deflect the rain away from you , keeping your torso dry while the sky falls around you .
The EcoBrolly “ Unbrella ”
If you do n’t have room for a mini-umbrella but have a green heart that desires to reuse , reuse , reuse , this little tool might be your type .
The Eco Brolly or “ unbrella ” is a plastic frame , shaft and handle that attaches to a newspaper to provide temporary coverage from the rain .
Hard or long rains may cut through this one pretty easily , but we still admire this designer ’s resourcefulness .
Brigg Malacca Flask – Gentleman ’s Umbrella
There ’s nothing worse than being dry in the rain– or so believe the producers of the Flask Umbrella .
Visually , this puppy may not stand up to the rest of the umbrellas on this list , but its ’ unassuming appearance is what makes it so effective .
Twist away the handle on this umbrella to reveal a tube flask , in which you can pour any matter of libation from whisky to wine .
This one is n’t bad to have around on a rainy day …
Share , if you love these !
[ Item - collecting has been a staple of video games for many years .
What is it inside gamers ' heads that makes us want to accumulate items and chase after Achievements ?
Gamasutra 's Kris Graft speaks with the experts ... ]
You may recall the eccentric Collyer Brothers .
Homer and Langley , heirs of one of New York 's oldest families , lived in a Manhattan mansion in the first half of the 1900s .
There , the two became reclusive , boarding up their windows and accumulating over 100 tons of what most would classify as " junk " until the entire house was packed to the ceiling - anything from bundles of newspapers to the chassis of a Model T to 14 full - sized pianos .
They were compulsive hoarders , and I think there 's a little bit of Collyer in all of us gamers .
The Obsessive Compulsive Foundation explains that in compulsive hoarders :
" Acquiring is often associated with positive emotions , such as pleasure and excitement , motivating individuals who experience these emotions while acquiring to keep acquiring , despite negative consequences . "
Sound familiar ?
The " negative consequences " of chasing after the 120th star in Mario 64 or all 100 hidden packages in Grand Theft Auto III may be more subdued than those of filling your entire house with orange peels and old cans of refried beans .
But game designers know that it 's pretty damn easy to tap into this deep - rooted need to collect and accumulate .
And like happy suckers we buy into it all the time , some to a greater degree than others .
Item collection has been a staple of video games since Pac - Man swallowed his first cherry .
Since then , we 've collected stars , coins , rings , nuts , bolts , packages , armor , weapons , Achievements and so on .
Games like Call of Duty 4 take exploration out of the collection equation , and use experience points and graphs to indicate how close we are to obtaining that next weapon or Perk .
False Sense Of Accomplishment ?
All of this " stuff " is tied to the player , whether it 's a high score with your initials beside it , your Gamertag with its high gamerscore , your PlayStation 3 Trophy Room , your save file that says you recruited all 108 Suikoden characters , or your World of Warcraft or CoD4 account that 's filled with the best weapons and items .
Such accomplishments , as frivolous and intangible as they may seem to outsiders , are meaningful to gamers .
One of the aspects of gaming today that most obviously appeals to our inner hoarder are Achievements .
We joke around that video game " Achievements " are a misnomer , because what is it exactly that you 're achieving , other than sitting on your ass all day trying to kill 100,000 Locusts in Gears of War 2 ?
In collecting these digital gems , are we just filling ourselves with an empty sense of accomplishment when , in fact , we 've accomplished nothing ?
Not necessarily , says Dr. Cheryl K. Olson , co-director at the Center for Mental Health and Media at Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Psychiatry , and author of the 2007 book , Grand Theft Childhood .
" People work for intangible rewards all the time , " she says .
" Money and love , for example .
A paycheck may seem ' solid , ' but it represents an abstraction .
And what 's more abstract than earning an ' A ' in philosophy ?...
Small things can be quite rewarding .
A smile from a cute girl may be a small thing , but it can make a teenage boy 's week . "
And the months ( for some , maybe weeks ) it took you to earn the Seriously 2.0 Achievement in Gears of War 2 ?
" Delayed rewards are often more valued .
Over years of formal schooling , we learn to delay gratification , " Olson says .
If you really need more encouragement or justification for your compulsive digital item - collecting or video gaming in general , there 's Chicago - based psychologist Dr. Kourosh Dini , who authored the book Video Game Play and Addiction : A Guide for Parents to give you that extra push :
" If you 're trying hard to do something complex [ such as video game play ] - that is essentially a brain exercise .
�While others may see you as just sitting on a couch , learning is happening .
�Lessons like how to communicate with teammates , being empathic with other players in trying to understand their next moves , exercising logic skills to solve puzzles , among others are learned . "
He adds , " We do have a need for feelings of success .
Achievements are unique and difficult enough that most players will choose a small handful and distinguish themselves that way .
This is the same sort of process that happens in deciding who want to be as we grow . "
" I'm Better Than You "
The proliferation of item collecting or Achievement hoarding is n't necessarily because we have an obsessive compulsive demon lurking under our skins .
Whereas many real compulsive hoarders accumulate real - world items such as old newspapers or lists because they believe they 'll need them at a certain point in the future , many gamers chase after the item carrot for bragging rights .
Olson said in a survey on young teens and video games , she found that over half of boys ( 57 percent ) and more than one in four girls ( 28 percent ) strongly agreed that that " to compete and win " was a reason they played electronic games .
Gamerscores and Achievement lists that are connected to a community of millions facilitate this need to point out that " I 'm better than you " .
Ultimately , it all plays into chasing that sense of fulfillment .
But for others , it really is about accumulating , accumulating , accumulating , sometimes to the detriment , or even the demise , of the hoarder .
Within the walls of his fortress of trash , a paranoid Langley Collyer had booby - trapped a maze of tunnels created from junk throughout his and Homer 's mansion .
Langley set off one of his own tripwires , sending a mountain of papers on top of him , burying him alive as he was bringing food to Homer , who was blind and unable to take care of himself .
Homer died of starvation -- authorities did n't find Langley 's body until three weeks later , just ten feet away from his brother , covered in garbage .
So do n't feel too bad if you 're jonesing for that next sword , star , or Achievement .
I suppose you could be worse off .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China ’s manufacturing sector continued to expand moderately in May as new export orders improved , two surveys showed on Monday , adding to tentative signs that the world ’s third - largest economy is stabilizing .
“ Weak external demand is still hurting China ’s manufacturers , but conditions are gradually improving in response to stimulus spending ...
China remains on track for a moderate recovery after the sharp slowdown seen late last year , ” said Brian Jackson , an analyst with Royal Bank of Canada in Hong Kong .
The official purchasing managers ’ index ( PMI ) fell slightly to 53.1 from 53.5 in April , its third straight month above the mark of 50 that separates expansion from contraction .
A separate PMI published by Hong Kong - based brokerage CLSA rose to a 10 - month high of 51.2 from 50.1 in April , its second month above 50 .
Asian stocks and the Australian dollar shot to eight - month highs after the release of the data , fueling optimism that the worst of the global downturn may be over .
Both surveys showed a slight improvement in new export orders .
The new export orders sub-index in the official PMI breached 50 for the first time since June 2008 , rising to 50.1 , while the equivalent index in the CLSA PMI reached 49.2 , the sixth straight month of improvement .
The official survey , conducted by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing ( CFLP ) , canvasses a bigger sample of mainly state - owned firms , while the CLSA survey covers more smaller , privately owned firms , although it is regarded as a better leading indicator particularly for the export sector .

The surveys also showed that the Chinese manufacturing sector is faring much better than in the West , where a number of similar indicators due later on Monday are expected to show further deep contractions in Western economies which are major consumers of Asian goods .

Russia ’s manufacturing sector contracted at its slowest pace in seven months in May , a further sign that the worst of the slowdown may have passed for major emerging economies .
South Korea ’s daily export value in May rose for the fourth straight month , a further sign of improvement in the global economy , though economists said it did not mean a lasting recovery had arrived .
Chinese and Hong Kong stocks rose in tandem on the better - than - expected PMI data .
The Hang Seng Index .HSI was up 2.8 percent , its highest level since September 2008 , while the Shanghai Composite Index .
SSEC was up 3.2 percent in mid-afternoon trade .
NOT GETTING WORSE
“ The Chinese economy is recovering , and the May PMIs have further proven that this argument is correct , ” said Feng Yuming , an analyst with Orient Securities in Shanghai .
But Feng said the export sector remained weak despite the slight improvement in the export orders sub-indexes .
“ We can only say the situation is not getting worse , ” he said .
Chinese appliance and top TV maker TCL Corp 000100 .SZ said on Monday it expects its sales to grow by at least 7 percent this year to more than 40 billion yuan ( $ 5.9 billion ) as it targets the country 's increasingly rich consumers .
The government ’s policy of encouraging home appliance purchases in rural areas is helping domestic sales , but overseas demand continues to sputter , TCL vice president He Cheng Ming told Reuters while in Taiwan for a PC trade fair .
The CLSA survey showed few signals of weakness and signaled that the industrial sector is on track for a sustainable recovery , said Andy Rothman , an economist with CLSA in Shanghai .
Rothman noted that the overall new orders sub - index rose strongly for the second straight month in May , to 53.4 from 50.9 , driven mainly by healthy domestic demand .
Companies also continued to draw down their inventories of finished goods , suggesting that output growth could be maintained in the months ahead .
“ But we want to repeat one point we made last month : it is unrealistic to expect the recovery to continue on an uninterrupted path upwards , ” he said in a note to clients .
“ Anticipate some volatility in the coming couple of quarters , but dips in the data should be seen as buying opportunities . ”
UPDATED UPDATE : Eric
Weiss contacted me and says he was contacted directly by Rob Zombie , who did not know his lawyers were going after Weiss , and has agreed to coexist with Zombie ! ( aka Weiss ) .
I had a feeling he did n’t know what his legal team was up to , and kudos to him for being a man and a human being and doing the right thing .
Rob Zombie , zombie lovers everywhere salute you !
UPDATE : Opinion from my lawyer friend added !
I ’ve seen a copy of the letter referenced in today ’s news post from Rob Zombie ’s trademark lawyers and it ’s alarming .
They seem to be claiming he owns the right to the word zombie in any musical context , which is just utter bullshit .
I can think of a half a dozen band names that use the word in addition to the band Zombie !
who they are going after ( who , it ’s worth noting , is a small , unsigned independent guy who is n’t a great position to fight a legal war ) .
And since zombies are probably the second most popular movie monster ever , it is n’t like he staked out some far - out undiscovered territory with the name Rob Zombie — I guess John Vampire would be slightly less original , but just slightly .
I ’ve askedÂ a lawyer friend if there ’s any legal merit to the case and I will update when I hear back from him .
I will also be attempting to contact the law firm tomorrow for comment .
If you know of any bands that use the word zombie in their name , please leave them in the comments .
I ’d like to point out to these lawyers how futile and misguided this attempt really is .
My lawyer friend , who first points out that , “ trademark law is a branch of Intellectual Property law and is its own unique thing with its own bar exam , etc. Â
If you really want a completely accurate legal opinion about this you would need to consult a Patent Attorney in all likelihood , ” goes on to offer the following :
Without constituting an actual legal opinion but merely being my best guess , you are correct that this is bullshit .
Â
The name “ Zombie ! ” is distinct enough from “ Rob Zombie ” – the trademarked term – that it is unlikely to be confused and , therefore , unlikely to infringe upon Rob Zombie ’s rights or capitalize on the goodwill his name generates .
Â
There are numerous examples ( The Mission and The Mission U.K. , The Charlatans and The Charlatans U.K. , Verve Records and The Verve , Dinosaur and Dinosaur Jr. , etc. ) where substantially more minor variations have been sufficient to differentiate between two distinct musical entities .
Â
If the mere mention of the word “ zombie ” in a band name were enough to constitute infringement than Rob Zombie better be prepared to disgorge all of his lifetime earnings to the sixties band The Zombies .
Furthermore , it is unlikely that Rob Zombie ’s birth name is Zombie .
Â
He , like any number of others , is capitalizing on a horror creature / genre to give his audience an impression of what he and his work are about before they ever hear a note he has played .
Â
One can not at this point trademark the idea of zombies .
Â
This is why hundreds of people have made zombie movies without being sued to hell and back while nobody except George Lucas and those who have purchased the rights from George Lucas have made films about Wookies .
Â Wookies are exclusive to the Star Wars universe and are the intellectual property of George Lucas .
Â Zombies are an idea in the public domain and available to anyone to use .
Â
It is the zombie genre that your friends , Rob Zombie and The Zombies have all capitalized on for their musical names – Rob Zombie did n’t come up with the idea and cannot lay claim to it .
He goes on to say that Zombie ’s lawyers probably will be able to sue Weiss out of business — unless enough unfavorable publicity is shed on the whole affair to convince them to back off .
That ’s where you all come in — please spread this far and wide , for Weiss and anyone else that ever wants to use the word zombie in their band or musical project without fear of Rob Zombie ’s army of undead lawyers .
After the break , you can find scanned images of the cease - and - desist notice sent to Eric Weiss of Zombie !
The BNP is facing the threat of an injunction from the official body on race discrimination , in what is believed to be the first such action against a political party .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission , the independent watchdog on discrimination , wrote to the BNP today stating that it believes the party is in breach of the Race Relations
Act on three counts .
" The legal advice we have received indicates that the British National party 's constitution and membership criteria , employment practices and provision of services to constituents and the public may breach discrimination laws which all political parties are legally obliged to uphold , " said the commission 's legal director , John Wadham .
The letter gives the BNP until 20 July to provide written undertakings in response to the allegations , including a statement that it will not discriminate in party recruitment .
Currently , BNP recruitment is open to members of the party who , according to its constitution , are of … " ' indigenous Caucasian ' and defined ' ethnic groups ' emanating from that Race " .
" The commission thinks that this requirement is contrary to the Race Relations Act , which outlaws the refusal or deliberate omission to offer employment on the basis of non-membership of an organisation , " a statement released by the commission says .
" The commission is therefore concerned that the BNP may have acted , and be acting , illegally . "
Other potential breaches of the law raised in the letter include concerns that the BNP 's elected representatives may not intend to offer or provide services on an equal basis to all their constituents irrespective of race and their membership criteria .
After the BNP won two seats in the European parliament earlier this month , the Guardian reported numerous grounds for legal challenge against the party .
Lawyers said the BNP 's rise in public office would have increasing legal significance , including a possible investigation by the commission .
The action by the commission is likely to have serious implications , and could lead to further measures , including an injunction against the party and possible legal challenges in court .
" We await a response from the BNP to our letter before deciding what further action we may take , " Wadham said .
" Litigation or enforcement action can be avoided by the BNP giving a satisfactory response to our letter . "
The controversial move is the first time the commission has used against a political party new enforcement powers it obtained after taking over from the former race watchdog , the Commission for Racial Equality , in 2007 .
The BNP said it had passed the letter on to its legal team .
" We were expecting something like this but we are not too bothered .
We are quite happy with our position , " a spokesman said .
A couple of days ago I presented a " emulator " of sorts to run Google Wave gadgets without sandbox access because Google had n't started giving out access yet .
They have now , to Google IO attendees at least but not to the rest of us ( or have they ? )
so I still do n't have mine ( Anyway , what good would it do to write that gadget emulator without using it , so I 've put together a very rough proof of concept for a shared graphics editor gadget using SVG .
I did n't write all of it myself , mind you .
Jayesh Salvi started a discussion about SVG in Wave , and during that discussion he pointed us to an existing open source browser based SVG editor by Narendra Sisodiya and Pavol Rusnak
That made my job reasonably easy .
I chopped their editor to pieces and stripped out a lot of stuff , partially to reduce the amount of work to make it work with Wave , partially to remove features that are n't quite finished yet .
The result is still buggy ( clearing the canvas does n't work ; deletion is shaky ) , not as efficient as it could be ( at the moment it re-sends all attributes of modified elements instead of just the changed ones , but that 's easily fixed ) , lacks lots of features ( like moving objects , saving , loading external SVG's etc . ) .
More importantly , It is possible or even likely that it wo n't work in the real client , but any issues should be reasonable simple to fix .
It 's been tested - somewhat - on Firefox and Safari .
It is highly unlikely to work on Internet Explorer ( it 's possible it could work if you have an SVG plugin installed , but I doubt it ) .
It could be made to work on IE via a shim layer to use VML instead of SVG , but that 's not very high on my priority list at the moment - especially as Google looks set to introduce a suitable shim layer
You can test it now by going to my gadget emulator , and entering the filename " svg-edit.xml " .
If you want to experiment with the code on your own , get the latest version of my gadget emulator from the Github repository and the SVG editor gadget also from Github
Not that while I welcome patches / suggestions , this is a proof of concept and I 'm not sure how far I 'll take it - I also have not talked to Narendra or Pavol about whether it 's possible or desirable to fold any of the ( fairly extensive ) changes I made back into the original editor .
If you 'd like to see this turn into something more , let me hear about it in the comments .
I will be working with the SVG Edit guys to combined the two projects .
Also see this post at The Next Web ( And if you 're with the Google Wave team and want to give me sandbox access , e-mail me at [ email protected ] or [ email protected ] - I promise I 'll use it to make sure this gadget runs properly in the actual client ;) )
Doctors should be taught to hypnotise patients not to feel pain instead of using general anaesthetics during some operations , the Royal Society of Medicine will be told today .
In what he has described as a " clarion call to the British medical profession " , Professor David Spiegel , of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences at Stanford University in the US , will also call on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( Nice ) to add hypnotherapy to its list of approved therapeutic techniques for the treatment of conditions ranging from allergies and high blood pressure to the pain associated with bone marrow transplantation , cancer treatment and anaesthesia for liver biopsy .
Nice has already approved the technique for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome .
" It is time for hypnosis to work its way into the mainstream of British medicine , " Spiegel will say at the joint conference of the Royal Society of Medicine , the British Society of Clinical and Academic Hypnosis and the British Society of Medical and Dental Hypnosis .
" There is solid science behind what sounds like mysticism and we need to get that message across to the bodies that influence this area .
Hypnosis has no negative side - effects .
It makes operations quicker , as the patient is able to talk to the surgeon as the operation proceeds , and it is cheaper than conventional pain relief .
Since it does not interfere with the workings of the body , the patient recovers faster , too .
" It is also extremely powerful as a means of pain relief .
Hypnosis has been accepted and rejected because people are nervous of it .
They think it 's either too powerful or not powerful enough , but , although the public are sceptical , the hardest part of the procedure is getting other doctors to accept it . "
Professor Marie - Elisabeth Faymonville , head of the Pain Clinic at Liege University Hospital in Belgium , who has operated on more than 6,000 patients using hypnosis combined with a light local anaesthetic , said : " The local anaesthetic is used only to deaden the surface of the skin while a scalpel slices through it .
It has no effect inside the body .
" The patient is conscious throughout the operation and this helps the doctor and patient work together .
The patient may have to move during an operation and it's simple to get them to do so if they remain conscious .
We 've even done a hysterectomy using the procedure . "
The theory behind medical hypnosis is that the body 's brain and nervous system can't always distinguish an imagined situation from a real occurrence .
This means the brain can act on any image or verbal suggestion as if it were reality .
Hypnosis puts patients into a state of deep relaxation that is very susceptible to imagery .
The more vivid this imagery , the greater the effect on the body .
Dr Martin Wall , president of the Section Hypnosis and Psychosomatic Medicine at the Royal Society of Medicine , said hypnosis fundamentally alters a subject 's state of mind .
Hypnosis is not , he said , simply a matter of suggestibility and relaxation .
Nice said it would welcome submissions for hypnotherapy to be considered as an approved therapeutic technique on the NHS if it could be cost - effective , and consistent delivery could be guaranteed .
But Professor Steve Field , who chairs the Royal College of General Practitioners , said he was sceptical as to whether hypnotherapy could meet these standards .
" It is a useful tool used by some GPs and patients for relaxation , but I do n't think it is something that we should support being rolled out to all medical students and all doctors , " he said .
" We can't call on the NHS to support it without there being a firm medical and economic basis , and I 'm not convinced those have been proved to exist . "

In a novel advertising move , Walmart has partnered with hit lolcat site I Can Haz Cheezburger ?
( ICHC ) .
Walmart and ICHC have an addictive online game called NOM NOM NOM 4 FUD !
in which players direct a rotund marmalade tabby around a house .
Players get points for making the cat “ nom ” Iams brand cat food , cheezburgers , and balls of yarn .
The more Iams kitty eats , the faster it runs around the house .
This , as anyone who has a cat knows ( cough ! Kevin Drum ! ) , is totally bogus .
After eating , my cats promptly retreat to the nearest soft surface and fall blissfully unconscious .
Real - life cat behavior aside , Walmart ’s corporate sponsorship of ICHC looks like a canny move : the site has a 60 % female demographic , and gets up to 50 million page views per month .
Likely , many users are pet - owners .
However , the partnership may not be as good for the lolcat site .
Some commenters have asked ICHC to not associate themselves with a company that has a history of abusing employees ( Walmart ) or a corporation that tests on animals ( Iams ) .
I doubt there will be any concerted boycott of the site , but this may not be the last time you see Walmart blogvertising .
Dear Cecil :
This is in reference to your column " Can the candirú fish swim upstream into your urethra ? " ( May 19 , 2000 ) .
I recently heard a talk by a visiting scholar who was researching the candirú .
The speaker was collaborating with a South American medical doctor who completed a candirú removal operation in 1997 .
The fish had entered the ( male ) patient 's urethra , had been stopped by the urethral sphincter ( if that 's the right term ) , and had turned at a right angle and burrowed into the scrotum .
The fish had died , and the subsequent relaxation of its spines facilitated removal .
A photograph of the removed fish and part of the affected area (! ) was presented .
According to the speaker , the patient claimed the fish had swum out of the water up his urine stream .
I thought this might be of interest .
zut , via the Straight Dope Message Board
Cecil replies :
I ’ll say it ’s of interest .
In my original column I expressed skepticism about Willy - in - the - willy , noting an absence of firsthand or even secondhand accounts .
And now here ’s a guy with eight - by - ten glossy photographs !
I ’ve been in contact with Paulo Petry , the scientist you heard , who related the following astonishing tale .
Warning — gross - out quotient : high .
Petry is an expert in neotropical ichthyology and vice president of Bio-Amazonia Conservation International , a not - for - profit conservation group .
While working in the Amazon city of Manaus , Brazil , he noticed a hubbub in the press about Anoar Samad , a urogenital surgeon who ’d performed the world ’s first confirmed removal of a candirú from a human penis .
What ’s more , Samad had a live patient and a dead fish to prove it .
Petry decided the world needed to know about this .
Here ’s an except from an article the two are coauthoring with fish physiologist Stephen Spotte :
On 28 October 1997 , one of us ( Samad ) attended a 23 - year - old man from the town of Itacoatiara on the Amazon River who sought medical attention with obstruction of the urethra , having been attacked by a candirú .
Prior to being attended , the patient remained untreated for three days and was only administered medication for pain .
By the fourth day the patient presented with fever , intense pain , scrotal edema [ swelling of the scrotum ] , and extreme abdomen distention from urine retention .
Surgical removal of the fish was considered , but rejected in favor of endoscopy [ insertion of a TV - equipped tube into the urethra ] .
The patient was anesthetized with 5 % lidocain and the procedure was performed .
The fish was grasped using an alligator - clip attachment on the endoscope and removed in one piece .
Fortunately the fish was dead , and decay was beginning to soften its tissues .
Tension on the spines had relaxed in death , and they no longer gripped .
Had the candirú been alive , its removal would have been more difficult and resulted in greater trauma to the patient .
The fish penetrated the victim ’s urethra while he was standing in the river urinating , actually emerging from the water and entering his penis , filling the entire anterior urethra [ emphasis added ] .
He reported trying to grab hold of the fish , but it was very slippery , and it forced its way inside with alarming speed .
The candirú ’s forward progress was blocked by the sphincter separating the penile urethra from the bulbar urethra .
With the passage blocked , the fish had made a lateral turn and bitten through the tissue into the corpus spongiosum , creating an opening into the scrotum .
Perfusion [ flushing ] of the urethra with sterile distilled water prior to endoscopy induced further immediate and pronounced scrotal edema , making it evident that the opening had allowed the perfusate to enter the scrotum .
Although the patient had remembered the fish as being small , after extraction it measured 134 mm ( 5 ½ in ) [ long ] , with a head width of 11.5 mm ( 7/16 in ) …
Some coagulated material was removed , revealing a wound on the bulbar urethra of 1 cm in diameter and associated with a small amount of local bleeding .
Although the patient suffered immediate trauma , no long term effects of the attack were noticed 1 year after the incident .
Petry insists this is no joke .
The operation is well documented , with photos , a videotape of the procedure , medical reports , and of course the fish , which was donated to an Amazon research institute .
( The species could n’t be identified precisely due to decay .
I ca n’t decide what ’s worse : having a live fish inside your penis or a rotting dead one . )
“ The description of the case follows exactly what the patient said , ” Petry tells me .
“ According to him , he was standing in the water thigh deep , urinating with his penis out of the water yet close to it .
The fish jumped and entered his urethra .
He repeated the same version more than once when asked to describe the incident to Dr. Samad . ”
Research by Petry and Spotte found no indication that the fish is particularly attracted to urine .
Petry adds ,
“ The only way that the fish could enter the urethra is while it is expanded during urination , otherwise I do n’t think it could move in . ”
One shudders , but I thought you ’d want to know .

There are few journalistic standards left these days as we have proven on this broadcast again and again .
New screenshots supposedly reveal that Apple is in the process of readying the iTunes Store interface for the iPhone to allow direct download access to movies , TV shows , and music videos .
The new capability would be an added convenience for the increasing number of people who watch video on a mobile device , but holes in the story have us holding off on the excitement for now .
The screenshots , posted by Kwame Jones and supposedly sourced from an anonymous " geeky friend , " show a toolbar for accessing a list of featured TV shows , movies , and music videos .
It also shows places to add artwork for featured movies and TV shows .
A progression of UI details added throughout the day suggests the feature is still being developed by iTunes Store developers .
The anonymous friend allegedly discovered the iTunes Store links from an ad that appeared in the Twitter client Twitterfon , which apparently advertised the ability to access the content .
Apple may be limiting access to devices running iPhone OS 3.0 beta , as we were unable to verify any of the content shown by the sceenshots in iTunes.app on iPhone OS 2.2.1 .
It may also explain why Jones ' friend feared " the powerful arms of the Apple legal department . "
The main reason we are skeptical of this story is because of how this content was discovered .
It 's highly unlikely that Apple would run ads for such a feature through a network like AdMob — since when does Apple advertise its TV and movie services in anything less than premium spots online ?
Also , it 's unlikely that Apple would create an ad like that this far in advance , knowing that non-Apple - employees have a high likelihood of seeing it .
This behavior seems extremely un -Apple - like .
Suspending our disbelief for a moment , having access to movies and TV directly from the iPhone would be an added convenience for users .
Currently , the only way to get iTunes Store video content on an iPhone or iPod touch is by downloading it via iTunes on your computer and syncing with your device .
This on - the - go access would come in handy , for instance , when you find yourself in a long wait and want to catch up on the latest episode of Dollhouse .
Carlo Ancelotti has pledged to secure Chelsea 's first European Cup after finally being confirmed as the club's new manager , with the importance placed by Roman Abramovich on success in the Champions League demonstrated by the £ 1 m bonus the Italian would earn should he break the Londoners ' duck in the competition .
The 49 - year - old , who left Milan by mutual consent on Sunday after eight years at San Siro , has signed a three - year contract at Stamford Bridge worth a basic £ 6.5 m a year and will set about creating a squad who " work together to build a dream " over the next few months .
He is likely to be accompanied to England by his assistant coach with the Rossoneri , the English - speaking Filippo Galli , with negotiations ongoing , and will benefit from considerable transfer funds made available by Abramovich .
Ancelotti would like to bring one of his most trusted playmakers at Milan , Andrea Pirlo , with him , though it remains to be seen whether Chelsea can prise the Italy international away for a price considered reasonable for a 30 - year - old midfielder .
Certainly , the initial £ 20 m valuation is too steep .
The Milan general manager , ­Adriano Galliani , claimed he would also resist any attempts by the Londoners to tempt Kaka away , though the likes of Franck Ribéry and David Villa , of Bayern Munich and Valencia respectively , could yet join CSKA Moscow 's Yuri Zhirkov at Chelsea next season with the onus very much on Ancelotti to mount a title challenge and secure the European Cup .
" For me the Champions League is a beautiful sensation because , when I played , I won it twice – in 1989 and 1990 – and those were fantastic moments , " the new manager said .
" It was the same when I was a coach at Milan , when we won it in 2003 and 2007 .
The Champions League , for me , is the best competition in the world and we all want to win it .
Chelsea has a great record , with five semi-finals in six years , and that is a beautiful record .
But now we have to win .
I hope this will happen .
" I like to be close with the players , I like to be close with the company [ the club ] , and I like to speak with people .
I believe in teamwork .
It 's the most important thing , to create a group that work together to build a dream .
The players and the company have to have a strong organisation , to have a very strong discipline , to have the right motivation .
I hope to do this together because this is the right way to arrive to success . "
His approach proved successful with the Rossoneri , particularly in European competition , and he inherits a side who claimed the FA Cup during Guus Hiddink 's brief if resurgent spell in charge .
Yet the captain , John Terry , was still moved to send an open letter to supporters last night reiterating that the club 's final league position was unsatisfactory .
" He [ Hiddink ] came at a difficult time when things looked like they were slipping away from us , so to lead us to an FA Cup final and within a whisker of the Champions League final is a great achievement , " wrote Terry .
" That said , third place in the league is n't good enough for Chelsea anymore .
It 's our worst finish since Mr Abramovich bought the club and we all know we need to do better . "
There is an eagerness within the Chelsea squad to work with the new ­manager , whose first game in charge will be a friendly against the Seattle Sounders on the club 's pre-season tour of the United States on 18 July .
Intriguingly , he will then play Internazionale – coached by Chelsea 's former manager , Jose Mourinho – in Pasadena and his former club , Milan , in Baltimore .
He is hopeful his English will be more proficient by then , despite a relatively impressive performance on his first televised interview with the club 's website , filmed in Italy .
" I want to learn and improve , " added Ancelotti on his English , aware that previous incumbents Claudio Ranieri and Luiz Felipe Scolari had struggled at times with the language barrier .
" I have the time to do that .
When we start the season I will speak well because it 's important for me to speak with the players , the team , the assistants and all the operators who will work with me .
I had eight great years at Milan , but this is the right moment for a new challenge , and I want to put all my energy into Chelsea .
This is a great opportunity , a great team , and a new experience .
" I want to bring my experience , I want to bring my individual quality .
I think to win is important , and to work together is the most important thing to win .
You need great motivation and have to have the right objective .
But in Chelsea it 's easy to find objectives : to win the Champions League , win the Premier League , win the FA Cup , win the Carling Cup .
To win all is naturally not easy , but the right way is to create a group of people that work well together . "
Reader comments are still pouring in regarding Sacha Baron Cohen 's in - your - face crash - landing on Eminem at the MTV Movie Awards on Sunday night , with a debate still raging as to whether or not Eminem was in on the joke .
" Mr. Show With Bob and David " writing vet Scott Aukerman has thankfully cleared up the issue -- and stole a bit of thunder from MTV in the process .
He writes on his Tumblr :
Yes , the Bruno / Eminem incident was staged .
That ’s all anyone wants to talk about , so let ’s get it out of the way .
They rehearsed it at dress and yes , it went as far as it did on the live show then .
Okay , you can stop reading this blog now !
But you should n't , as Aukerman provides a nice behind - the - scenes account of working with Andy Samberg and Akiva Shaffer , who tapped Aukerman to be their head writer for the MTV Movie Awards .
He details an opening that was scrapped at the last minute , as well as the challenge of bringing Samberg 's sketch - heavy comedy stylings to the MTV Movie Awards .
Feel free to pass doubt on trusting social - networking sites on the Web .
But Pop &
Hiss is using this as our moment to tip our hat to Cohen , Eminen and the entire writing team for offering a much - discussed bit , and moving on from discussing / debating the award show bit .

Gawd , how I love when someone interviews this woman .
From Pajamas TV *:
* Is that the best she could do ?
“ I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the swine flu broke out then under another Democrat president Jimmy Carter .
And I ’m not blaming this on President Obama , I just think it ’s an interesting coincidence . ”
Does she also find it interesting that that ’s totally famously completely untrue ?
That Ford booted the response to said outbreak , lost the election maybe kinda sorta because of that , and THEN Carter was POTUS ?
Prolly not .
Dublin will soon be home to a space for hackers to congregate and get creative , write LENNY ANTONELLIand JASON WALSH
IT ’S NOT a word that ’s used much in polite company – mention the term “ hacker ” and it conjures up nothing but negative images .
But in today ’s wired world of interconnected computer networks , e-mail , SMS messages , social networking and online banking , the stereotype of the computer hacker has n’t kept up with the times .
At best , the outdated image from the 1983 film War Games comes to mind : intelligent kids getting into serious trouble while attempting mischievous pranks .
At worst , hackers are only a step away from terrorists , intent on destroying important computer networks and collecting enough personal data to make Google blush .
The reality is , as always , rather different .
The personal computer as we know it today would not exist without the work of hackers .
Mainframe computers share less DNA with a typical PC or Mac than a pocket calculator does and , famously , Apple Computers was founded by a pair of hackers , Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs , in a Californian garage .
More recently , the Linux operating system currently revolutionising the business world is entirely the work of hackers .
So much for tabloid visions of “ cyber crime ” .
Dublin will soon be home to a permanent space for computer hackers to congregate and get creative .
Named Tóg ( Irish for build ) , it will be Ireland ’s contribution to the growing international movement of “ hackerspaces ” .
Sitting in the elegant , if incongruous , surroundings of Dublin ’s Westin Hotel and explaining their plans , Tóg ’s Jeff Rowe and Robert Fitzsimons emphasise that hacking is about curiosity : the desire to understand how technology works and the creative urge to build and modify gadgets .
The only legal issue at stake here is the rather prosaic one of voiding warranties .
Fitzsimons is perfectly comfortable with the word hacker : “ I ’ll use ‘ hacker ’ and somebody else will use it , and there ’ll be a completely different interpretation , ” he says .
“ My hacking is out in the open .
I have the 2600 .ie domain – if anybody wants to find out who the hackers in Ireland are , my name is plastered on the site . ”
Hacking , Fitzsimons says , is a form of self - education in a fast - moving world : “ It ’s about learning things about the electronic environment we live in . ”
Perhaps unsurprisingly , given the omnipresence of technology today , talk among the group does turn to political issues .
Hackers tend to be opposed to technology for technology ’s sake if it does n’t bring anything to the table .
E-voting , for example , has been roundly rejected by hackers as needlessly complex and fundamentally unsafe .
“ The thing that gets me about e-voting is that these computers are essentially black boxes , but a vote is n’t a black box .
Physical voting is a very transparent process , ” says Rowe .
Technology consultant Colin Sweetman believes the term “ hacker ” needs to be approached with caution .
“ The prehistory of even some Microsoft products shows they were developed by hackers working for fun in garages and then bought out , ” he says .
“ A lot of the actual malicious ‘ hacking ’ is done by what are called ‘ script kiddies ’ messing around with software they did n’t write and do n’t really understand . ”
Sweetman also poses an interesting question about the source of malicious computer viruses and scams : “ Nobody knows how many ‘ black - hat ’ hackers in former Soviet states and in China are actually , at least tacitly , supported by their governments , ” he says .
Scams , industrial espionage and schemes for geopolitical domination are a world away from the reality of computer hacking as practised in Ireland .
Tóg ’s Rowe , who spends his days researching devices for the visually impaired at Dublin City University , is a walking , talking example of the kind of hacker who engages in self - motivated learning and playing .
Rowe ’s work is important , interesting , technical and difficult .
His play may be less important , but it shares all of the other characteristics : he is currently designing an exact replica of a 1980s arcade machine to play old video games .
“ I want it to look and feel authentic , ” he says .
“ There ’s no point in just having a desktop unit .
Half of the fun is two people standing up against the unit . ”
An avid cyclist , Fitzsimons , a computer programmer by profession , is working on gadgets for his bike : “ Because I cycle and there ’s potholes everywhere , I ’m interested in putting sensors on my bike so you can measure the road surface and how closely cars overtake you , ”
Fitzsimons and Rowe are among 16 technology enthusiasts , many of them supporters of 2600 magazine , the technology underground ’s premier periodical , planning to open the Tóg hackerspace in Dublin – a home for hackers to work on projects , collaborate and socialise .
Similar spaces have sprung up across Europe and the US in recent years .
For Fitzsimons , Rowe and the rest of the group , it was a trip to the 25th congress of Germany ’s Chaos Computer Club hacker group that crystallised the idea .
“ It really gave us the final push , ” says Rowe “ We decided to get a group and start planning and get it in motion . ”
Fitzsimons hopes the space will be conducive to technological creativity and collaboration , while also being a place for hackers to relax : “ I ’d like to see an area with couches and TVs and X - boxes or whatever , and you would n’t necessarily have computers in there , and then you ’d have another room with computers ; people [ will ] have somewhere to go and get away from computers . ”
Fitzsimons would also like to have woodwork and kitchen facilities in the space , allowing members to engage in other creative , hands - on activities unrelated to computers .
“ Some of us like cooking and some of the hackerspaces even have a Sunday dinner , ” says Fitzsimons .
“ I hope it would n’t be the case where people would just hang out and play computer games and not actually participate in the idea of making something or doing something slightly creative with their time and space . ”
In terms of technological projects , Rowe says it will be a learning curve for everyone .
“ Maybe just one or two people know how to do complex projects , [ so ] it ’ll start off with making an LED display that flashes different lights and you can program different messages , and then it ’ll slowly build up and up . ”
For now , the group will have to settle for “ booting up ” in a single room .
With 16 members paying € 50 a month towards rent , the group is hoping to find a suitable space in central Dublin by May .
Once the space is up and running , the group will hold weekly public meetings for prospective members .
The group is confident it will attract new members quickly – and enough income to start looking for larger premises .
At a time when communication is increasingly moving online , it is ironic that a group of technology enthusiasts are so anxious to find a physical space in which to communicate , but Tóg has a rationale : “ The highest bandwidth [ mode of communication ] is obviously face - to - face , ” says Rowe .
“ It ’s all about the community .
It ’s the community that drives all these sorts of things .
We ’d be nothing if it was just a space and there was no community , and no one knew each other in the space . ”
Fitzsimons agrees : “ It ’s about the community , and about that community building and making and creating .
If that involves technology , brilliant .
If it does n’t , brilliant . ”
If the information economy means anything at all , it requires motivated , intelligent and creative players – just what Tóg and the hackerspaces movement are intent on creating .

Dutch MP formally petitions PM Jan-Peter Balkenende and Minister for European Affairs over involvement with globalist cabal
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , May 15 , 2009
A Dutch Member of Parliament has formally petitioned Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende and his European Affairs Minister Frans Timmermans concerning their involvement with the Bilderberg Group , citing an article released by Prison Planet last week .
“ In his web log on May 13 , Member of Parliament of the Socialist Party , Harry van Bommel , refers to , and footnotes , ( Paul Joseph ) Watson ’s article on information confided to Bilderberg researcher Daniel Estulin concerning the agenda of the secretive meeting , ” writes Jurriaan Maessen .
Prime Minister Balkenende attended the Bilderberg Group conference in Washington DC last year , before meeting with President Bush , along with Queen Beatrix and her son William - Alexander .
Queen Beatrix is a regular attendee of the elitist confab and was photographed by our reporters arriving at Bilderberg last year .
In our original May 6 article , we reported on Bilderberg ’s leaked agenda for 2009 , which according to investigative journalist Estulin was weighted heavily around the economy and whether Bilderberg would pursue , “ Either a prolonged , agonizing depression that dooms the world to decades of stagnation , decline and poverty … or an intense - but - shorter depression that paves the way for a new sustainable economic world order , with less sovereignty but more efficiency . ”
The agenda also spoke of efforts to be made to discredit anti-EU activists in anticipation of another Irish referendum on the Lisbon Treaty later this year .
According to Estulin , “ One of their concerns is addressing and neutralizing the anti-Lisbon treaty movement called “ Libertas ” led by Declan Ganley .
One of the Bilderberger planned moves is to use a whispering campaign in the US media suggesting that Ganley is being funded by arms dealers in the US linked to the US military . ”
Dutch Member of Parliament Henry van Bommel .
In his written request , van Bommel demands answers on the Dutch cabinet ’s position regarding Bilderberg as well as a clarification of their stance on the purported plans to discredit Ganley .
According to Maessen ’s translation , van Bommel writes , “ From the leaked agenda we learn that there will be discussed how to deal with the anti-Lisbon movement ‘ Libertas ’ through a slander campaign against its leader Declan Ganley .
It remains a serious setback for the elite , not just the European elite , that the treaty has still not been ratified ’ , Van Bommel explains .
‘ They wish for a more powerful European Union , even it is realised through undemocratic games .
Considering the regularly attendance of our royal house and ministers , I have asked Prime Minister Balkenende and Minister for European Affairs Timmermans to have the political participants withstand such a slander campaign . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Van Bommel follows this with a full list of questions for Balkenende and Timmermans .
1- Are you aware that from May 14 to 17 2009 in Vouliagmeni , Greece , the Bilderberg conference is gathering ?
2 - Is it correct that Queen Beatrix will attend ?
3 - Are there members of the cabinet who will participate in the conference ?
If so , which members ?
4 - Is there a consensus in the cabinet on the participation of this conference or is this left to individual members ?
Is there deliberation between the Prime Minister and the queen in regards to participation ?
5 - Will you make public the items that will be discussed as well as a list of the participants ?
If not , why not ?
6 - Is it correct that the Lisbon - treaty will be prominent on the agenda of this Bilderberg - conference ?
7 - Are you familiar with the report that speaks of the planned discrediting of anti-Lisbon movement ‘ Libertas ’ with the help of a slander campaign against its leader Declan Ganley ?
Are you willing to request of Queen Beatrix or political participants from the Netherlands to withstand any such slander campaign ?
This is another example of how the Internet can pierce through the international media blackout on Bilderberg and lead to hard questions being asked of world leaders in major European parliaments like the Netherlands .
We wait with anticipation as to whether or not the Dutch Prime Minister will be forced to answer van Bommel ’s questions regarding his involvement with Bilderberg .
Previous questions in the British House of Commons directed towards MP ’s as well as former Prime Minister Tony Blair have led to little more than half - truths and lies .
In 1999 , responding to a question about if he planned to attend the Bilderberg meeting in Portugal that year , Tony Blair claimed that , “ There is no formal representation by the UK Government , ” at Bilderberg Group meetings despite the fact that MP ’s for both major political parties in Britain routinely attend Bilderberg .
Blair brazenly lied in front of Parliament again in October 2006 when , in response to a question regarding Bilderberg by MP Norman Baker , he stated , “ I have not attended any such meetings , ” despite the fact that he attended the 1993 Bilderberg meeting in Greece .
A full list of question regarding Bilderberg asked in the House of Commons can be found via this link .
“ If the Member of Parliament will receive any answers from the Prime Minister remains to be seen .
But it is an encouraging sign that some in the political playing field will take their jobs seriously and do what every public servant should do when confronted with a plethora of the most powerful people in the world meeting in secret with no questions asked , ” writes Maessen .

A " national plan " for Britain will be unveiled by Gordon Brown as he tries to fight back after Labour 's expected elections rout next month , The Independent has learnt .
The Prime Minister wants the blueprint to be a route map for how the Government will lead the country out of recession and extend its public service reforms .
It will cover the economy , industry , health , education and crime .
Mr Brown intends to " hit the ground running " immediately after the European Parliament election results are announced on 7 June .
His " national plan " is also bound to be seen as his personal survival plan as some Labour backbenchers are expected to call for him to stand down if Labour performs badly .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
There are growing fears in the Labour Party that the scandal over MPs ' expenses could boost the prospects of the UK Independence Party in the Euro elections , and that it could push Labour into a humiliating fourth place .
Mr Brown is also expected to reshuffle his Cabinet shortly after the elections .
Despite growing speculation in Westminster and Whitehall that Lord Mandelson will achieve his long - standing ambition to become Foreign Secretary , he is expected to remain as Business Secretary .
That would allow him to oversee Labour 's general election strategy , which would be difficult to do with the programme of overseas travel involved as Foreign Secretary .
Jacqui Smith , the Home Secretary , is expected to stand down from her post .
There is speculation that Hazel Blears will lose her position as Communities Secretary and that Margaret Beckett the Housing minister and former foreign secretary dropped by Mr Brown , could be recalled to the Cabinet .
The Prime Minister hopes that freshening up his Government and unveiling policies will enable him to draw a line under the expenses controversy .
The aim of the " national plan " is to show that Labour has not run out of steam after 12 years in office and has a more detailed prospectus than the Tories .
Despite Labour 's perilous position in opinion polls , Mr Brown is convinced Labour can still hold on to power if the general election could be turned into a choice between the rival policies of the two main parties .
" Gordon Brown has a plan , David Cameron does not , " one of Mr Brown 's aides said .
" When the voters realise that , we think they will look at things differently . "
Labour strategists hope that publication of Mr Brown 's plan may " flush out " more Tory policies .
They suspect Mr Cameron has decided to try to coast to victory without spelling out his programme .
The Tories insist they will unveil more policies in the autumn but say they would have to leave some details until they see the nation 's books after an election .
A Populus poll for ITV's News at Ten last night found that 54 per cent of the public want an immediate general election , while 38 per cent do not .
The survey put the Tories on 39 per cent , Labour on 27 per cent , the Liberal Democrats on 17 per cent and other parties on 18 per cent .
One cabinet minister said : " We can't contemplate a general election while it would be a referendum on Parliament or our record .
We have got to make it a choice between two sets of policies .
We hope the document will mark the start of that process . "
The Cabinet will consider whether to accompany the document with a renewed commitment to constitutional reform .
This follows calls for wider changes on top of reforms to the MPs ' expenses regime to rebuild the public 's trust in politics .
Mr Brown has signalled that he has an open mind to reform and that he wants to engage the public in the debate .
In the Commons on Thursday , he did not rule out the idea of a constitutional convention , the method used to reach a consensus on Scottish devolution .
But he told Nick Clegg , the Liberal Democrat leader , that the introduction of proportional representation was not the only way to reform the constitution .
But ministers admit that big changes such as an elected House of Lords and electoral reform could not be completed before the general election .
" You can't overhaul the constitution by next week , " one said .
The Inamo restaurant in London 's fashionable SoHo district is n't known for its splendid food or outstandingly accommodating waitresses .
Instead , the new Asian fusion eatery is getting raves for its use of a touch pad-projection system that allows diners to send food orders directly to the chefs and makes the dining experience fully interactive .
Every table at Inamo has its own image projector above ( see pic at right ) , meaning every person essentially gets to eat off a giant computer screen .
This allows the restaurant to offer several interesting experiences , like selecting the mood of the table by choosing between different ' place mat ' images and videos .
According to a recent diner , the rig is based on a flash / actionscript system .
When you 're waiting for your meal to arrive , you can click on a kitchen camera that let 's you see your food being prepared , play different types of computer board games ( like Battleship ) , and when you 're done , you can separate bills and boot up a map to figure out your next move around town .
But for me , the best part seems to be that when you 're choosing through potential dining options , a picture of the food appears on the plate where you 'll be eating it .
I 'm not sure if the size of the picture approximates the size of the actual meal , but I think this is better than just the syrupy , dramatized meal explanation one usually gets .
As for the circular touch pad , it seems pretty basic , though I do worry about whether the restaurant changes its surface once in awhile to clean it .
Otherwise , you have to rely on other people 's hand - washing abilities or dip your hand in a tub of Purella before taking a bite .
Even though your ordering experience is pretty much automated , every table does have a waiter that brings over the meal and answers questions about the system .
Check out a few more pictures of the Inamo restaurant after the jump .

Kanas Lake , which means " beautiful , mysterious lake " in Mongolian , is China 's deepest freshwater lake with a maximum depth of 188.5 meters , and 24 kilometers long from north to south .
It 's located in the Kanas Nature Reserve in the Aletai mountain area of northern Xinjiang and has been the source of numerous monster sightings , similar to Scotland 's Loch Ness ( or
" Nessie " ) monster for decades – particularly since the 1980s when more visitors and settlers came to the area .
Scientists have carried out investigations , though no conclusive evidence has been found of the creature .

Some scientists believe , however , that the monsters may be taimen trout , one of the world 's largest and most ferocious freshwater fish which can grow as long as 10 meters .

Ten tourists from Guangdong and Hubei provinces were the latest to report a " water monster " sighting in Kanas Lake , Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region .
They told local media that they saw a giant black creature on July 5 that stirred waves over 1 meter high and left a wake over 10 meters long for 20 seconds about 100 meters away from their boat .

House Democrats on Friday answered President Obama ’s call for a sweeping overhaul of the health care system by putting forward a 852 - page draft bill that would require all Americans to obtain health insurance , force employers to provide benefits or help pay for them , and create a new public insurance program to compete with private insurers — a move that Republicans will bitterly oppose .
The bill was unveiled by a trio of committee chairman , George Miller of Education and Labor , Henry Waxman of Energy and Commerce , and Charles B. Rangel of Ways and Means , who have worked jointly for months to develop a seamless proposal .
But the chairmen said they still did not know how much the plan would cost , even as they pledged to pay for it by cutting Medicare spending and imposing new , unspecified taxes .
The three chairmen described their bill as a starting point in a weeks - long legislative endeavor that they said would dominate Congress for the summer and ultimately involve the full panorama of stakeholders in the health care industry , which accounts for about one - sixth of the nation ’s economy .
They described their efforts as the historic culmination of a half - century of failed attempts across the tenure of a dozen presidents .
Mr. Miller , a Democrat of California , said that completing a bill would require extraordinary cooperation among lawmakers .
“ In order to change American ’s health care system , ” he declared , “ Congress itself must change . ”
House Republicans , who have had no involvement in the development of the health legislation so far , quickly denounced the Democrats ’ proposal as a thinly disguised plan for an eventual government takeover of the health care system .
“ Families and small businesses who are already footing the bill for Washington ’s reckless spending binge will not support it , ” the Republican leader , John A. Boehner of Ohio , said in a statement .
“ Raising taxes , rationing care , and empowering government bureaucrats — not patients and doctors — to make key medical decisions is not reform . ”
The House Democrats ’ plan is one of three distinct efforts underway on Capitol Hill to draft the health overhaul legislation .
In the Senate , both the Finance Committee and the health committee have separate bills in the works , and in recent days those efforts seem to have stumbled .
The health committee , led by Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut , in the absence of the panel ’s Democratic chairman , Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , began its public drafting sessions earlier this week .
But the process was hampered by a much higher - than - expected cost projection from the Congressional Budget Office , which gave Republican critics ready artillery to fire at the bill .
In the Finance Committee , the chairman , Max Baucus , Democrat of Montana , announced that he had postponed his drafting process , expected to begin on Tuesday , until the week after July Fourth , to give him time to try to reduce the cost of his measure .
The Finance Committee bill , being developed jointly with Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , the senior Republican on the panel , may have the best chance of winning bipartisan support .
The House proposal unveiled on Friday was a decidedly progressive measure , which reflected many of the ideas championed by the White House , including such initiatives as the creation of public insurance plan , which Republicans have said they will never support .
In the Senate , lawmakers have been working on a number of potential compromise proposals , including the creation of nonprofit health care cooperatives that could compete with private insurers but would be regulated rather than controlled by the federal government .
The House proposal also included a requirement that employers either provide health insurance or pay a fee equal to 8 percent of their payroll .
The House chairmen said that the 8 percent figure , along with virtually every other aspect of the draft legislation , was negotiable and intended as a starting point for deliberations .
But Republicans have voiced opposition to imposing any such requirement on employers , arguing that it would effectively lead to the elimination of jobs .
Apple on Tuesday detailed changes to its unparalleled retail - based personal training service designed to help customers get set up , get trained , and get going with new Macs purchased from the company 's direct sales channels .
Priced at $ 99 , the new year - long One to One membership is available at the time of purchase to those customers who buy their new Mac in an Apple retail store , from the Apple online store , or through Apple Telesales .
Apple says the âtime of purchaseâ may extend from the day of a purchase until the end of its 14 - day return period .
Personal Setup
One to One is broken down into four distinct services , the first of which is called Personal Setup , entitling members to the configuration of one new Mac during the duration of their membership .
This includes the data transfer of files from an old computer ( PC or Mac ) to a new Mac , granted the old computer is able to start up properly , has a working Ethernet , USB 2.0 , or FireWire port , and runs Windows XP or later or Mac OS X 10.2 or later .
Upon request , Apple retail staffers will install any Apple hardware and software that was purchased in conjunction the Mac .
They 'll also transfer and integrate email , contacts , calendars , music , photos , bookmarks , and documents from the customer 's personal user account , but not the accounts of others that might be stored on the old computer .
Training Options
Once a customer is up and running on their new Mac , they 'll be able to pick and choose from three distinct training sessions throughout the course of their membership : Personal Training Sessions , Personal Projects , and One to One Workshops .
Customers can participate in these sessions using their new Mac or a Mac in their local Apple retail store if they choose not to bring their own .
Personal Training sessions are individual sessions between the One to One member and an Apple employee , while Personal Projects sessions occur in a group environment , with a trainer available to provide assistance and answer questions as each member works on an individual project .
One to One Workshops also occur in a group environment , with each member focused on the same topic , as education or information is provided to the entire group on specific applications or technology .
Scheduling Sessions
Reservations for Personal Training , Personal Projects , and One to One Workshops are subject to availability on a first - come , first - served basis .
Members can book their reservations up to 14 days in advance using the Apple Store online Concierge scheduling system .
Apple says that members can choose to book an upcoming reservation for either one Personal Training or one Personal Projects session at a time , but may immediately schedule their next sessions after the completion of the preceding session .
In addition , members are allowed one upcoming reservation for One to One Workshops at any given time even if they also have an existing reservation for a Personal Training or Personal Projects session .
Personal Training and Personal Projects sessions cover all of Apple 's consumer applications but Personal Training sessions for certain Apple pro applications may also be available in select Apple retail stores .
After purchasing a subscription to One to One , customers can activate their membership through this online form .
Apple has also posted a guided video tour of the new program and a list of available sessions that include everything from movie making and website design to iPhone and iPod training .

You can't quite make out the face of the Bilderberg delegate on the waterskis , but I 'm pretty sure from his shape that it is n't Ken Clarke .
Is it the US deputy secretary of state , James Steinberg ?
No , Steinberg prefers a shorter rope .
" Next year I bring a bigger lens , " says Paul Dorneanu , the young Romanian Bilderberg hunter who took the photo .
He shows me another : a long - range shot of two happy globalists in an inflatable doughnut ring and Speedos , skidding about behind a powerboat .
If only the image was sharper we might see Peter Mandelson snatching a chat with Jean - Claude Trichet , the president of the European Central Bank .
" So how do we sell ... splooosh ! ... wooo ! ... the abolition of the pound to the ... sploosh ! ... electorate ?
Again !
Again !
Once more round the bay ! "
The names of this year 's delegates are starting to drip in : the prime minister of Greece , Kostas Karamanlis , is a definite .
Jim
Tucker tells me that the former Swedish prime minister and thinktank whore , Carl Bildt , gave an important speech .
" He spoke about the need for a worldwide department of the treasury and a worldwide department of health , brought in on the back of economic meltdown and global warming .
Swine flu being the first trick they tried ... "
I ask Jim how he knows this .
" I have my sources , " he chuckles , his cigarette ash quivering improbably .
" They 've never once let me down . "
People on the inside .
Maybe Jim and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands had a thing back in the 60s .
Anyone who takes a " fair enough they should meet in private " position on Bilderberg should at least find it odd that we do n't properly know who " they " are .
We know some of them , thanks in no small part to Tucker 's sources , but should publicly elected officials be meeting in armed privacy to discuss global policy with unnamed private individuals ?
What would you say to that , George Osborne , MP for Tatton - would you say it's " fair enough " ?
One of the nastiest ironies of Bilderberg is that , while every effort in the world is done to ensure the anonymity of the delegates , if you turn up to report on the conference you spend your days dipping for your driving licence and being asked your date of birth , your father 's first name and whether you are staying here alone .
Which hotel ?
Why you come here ?
It is n't just me who 's been hauled into police custody for daring to hang around half a mile from the hotel gates .
The few journalists who've made the trip to Vouliagmeni this year have all been harassed and harried and felt the business end of a Greek walkie - talkie .
Many have been arrested .
Bernie , from the American Free Press , and Gerhard the documentarian ( sounds like a Dungeons and Dragons character ) chartered a boat from a nearby marina to try to get photos from the sea .
They were stopped three miles from the resort .
By the Greek navy .
This chimes with what a police officer told the Associated Press ( on condition of anonymity ) :
" The resort was being protected by hundreds of police , navy commandos , coast guard speedboatsand two F - 16 fighter planes . "
That 's right .
Two F - 16 fighter planes .
Now , if you 're wondering why this event is n't being covered properly by the world 's media when the Greek navy are turning around boats three miles from an F - 16 - encircled waterski paradise , keep wondering .
If you 're grinding your teeth at the paucity of information about Bilderberg , grind harder .
Grind louder .
Go online .
See what Paul Dorneanu has seen .
Listen to the Corbett Report .
Peek behind the bars of Prison Planet .
As for me , there 's not much more I can tell you .
I can tell you that ( according to a policeman ) many of the delegates zipped up the hill between 2 am and 4 am on Thursday night , to avoid being noticed .
( Is it just me or is that a bit lame ? )
Was Baron Mandelson , the prince of darkness , one of them ?
How about he tell us where he 's been this weekend .
And whether or not he went twice on the doughnut .
And if so , did he jump the queue in front of Eric Schmidt ?
I can tell you that every so often coaches with blacked - out windows made their way up and down the hill .
Changes of staff ?
Fresh hookers ?
I can tell you that one night I happened upon a delegate nipping out to the pharmacy in his gunproof Mercedes , bodyguard watching the pavements .
I 'd have gone for my camera but I remembered what Jon Ronson wrote in a kind comment to one of my earlier pieces : " no sudden moves " .
He was n't kidding .
I wandered off .
Me and my various tails .
The thing is , I never really came here to " cover " Bilderberg .
I just thought it would be funny to hang out at the cordon and wear T - shirts saying things like " NOBILIZATION ! " .
It 's really very peculiar to look back at my first report and watch myself pretending to dodge spooks on dark streets .
Ha ha ha .
And now ?
I 've hidden twice in the same stairwell in Athens to try to shake off the men following me .
I have a favourite bolthole in Athens city centre .
That 's how much my life has changed .
I 've grappled with men in a Metro station ; I 've screamed for help in Omonoia Square ; I 've shouted " You 're lying to me ! " at detectives in an Athens police station ; I 've grabbed a man riding off on a motorbike and begged him – almost in tears – to " leave me alone " ; I 've been yelled at , arrested , followed , searched , shoved , maligned , intimidated , doubted and lied to .
So many lies .
I 've told the truth about what has happened to me this week .
I wonder if the various British politicians who have attended Bilderberg 2009 could bring themselves to tell the truth about how they spent their time .
I wonder if someone better than me , a better reporter , a more powerful voice , a politician even , could ask them .
Anyone ?
My dispatches on the 2009 conference , if they mean anything at all , represent nothing more acutely than the absence of thorough mainstream reporting .
I am pretty much the opposite of what 's needed .
I am a joke .
These dispatches are a travesty .
A travesty of a mockery of a sham of a mockery of a travesty of two mockeries of a sham .
A disgrace to the good name of journalism .
I should be ashamed .
That said , I 'm actually doing a proper bit of reporting today .
I 've got an early meeting with the head of Athens CID .
We 've got some things to discuss ...
Microsoft and Asus have teamed up to present a new advertising smarm - storm intended to extol the virtues of Windows on netbooks - and smear Linux .
The joint effort 's spawn is a website entitled " It 's Better with Windows . "
It 's a simple site with a simple message : Windows can prevent poor , unsuspecting non-techies from " dealing with an unfamiliar environment or major compatibility issues . "
And , yes , that 's their emphasis , not ours .
The Asus - hosted site features a teeth - grindingly vapid video showcasing happy multiculties as they enrich their lives by using Asus Eee PCs running Windows , complete with a soundtrack of some of the most jejune tunes you may ever have the misfortune to endure .
Watch it if you dare .
Netbooks were once a happy hunting ground for Linux , but Microsoft has steadily gained ground on the open sorcery of that freely available OS - so much so that an NPD report last month stated that the Windows installation rate on netbooks has grown from 10 per cent in the first half of 2008 to 96 per cent in February 2009 .
And now it appears that 96 per cent is n't enough for Microsoft .
They want it all .
Why ?
Well , as the site proudly proclaims , Windows is trusted , familiar , and compatible .
And , by implication , Linux is n't .
Those nice folks in Redmond and their co-conspirators at Asus are just trying to help . ®

The oldest man-made musical instrument , a 35,000 - year - old carved bird - bone flute , has been unearthed in a German cave .
Archaeologists assembled the flute from 12 pieces of griffon vulture bone scattered in a small plot of the Hohle Fels cave .
Together , the pieces comprise a 8.6 - inch instrument with five holes and a notched end .
" It 's unambiguously the oldest instrument in the world , " University of Tuebingen archaeologist Nicholas Conard said as his findings were published today by the journal Nature .
The Hohle Fels flute is more complete and appears slightly older than bone and ivory fragments from seven other flutes recovered in southern German caves and documented by Dr Conard and his colleagues in recent years .
Another flute excavated in Austria is believed to be 19,000 years old , and a group of 22 flutes found in the French Pyrenees has been dated at up to 30,000 years ago .
Dr Conard 's team excavated the flute in September 2008 , the same month they recovered six ivory fragments from the Hohle Fels cave that form a female figurine they believe is the oldest known sculpture of the human form .
Together , the flute and the figure - found in the same layer of sediment - suggest that modern humans had established an advanced culture in Europe 35,000 years ago , said Wil Roebroeks , an archaeologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands .
He said it was difficult to tell how socially advanced these people were .
But the physical trappings of their lives - including musical instruments , personal decorations and figurative art - match the objects we associate with modern human behaviour .
" It shows that from the moment that modern humans enter Europe ... it is as modern in terms of material culture as it can get , " he said , agreeing with Dr Conard 's assertion that the flute appears to be the earliest known musical instrument in the world .
Neanderthals also lived in Europe around the time the flute and sculpture were made , and frequented the Hohle Fels cave .
Both scientists believe , however , that layered deposits left by both species over thousands of years suggest the artefacts were crafted by early modern humans .
" The material record is so completely different from what happened in these hundreds of thousands of years before with the Neanderthals , " Dr Roebroeks said .
" I would put my money on modern humans having created and played these flutes . "
In 1995 , archaeologist Ivan Turk excavated a bear bone artefact from a cave in Slovenia , known as the Divje Babe flute , that he has dated at around 43,000 years ago and suggested was made by Neanderthals .
But other archaeologists have challenged that theory , suggesting instead that the twin holes on the 4.3 - inch - long bone were made by a carnivore 's bite .

In a previous post about taco burgers , I mentioned I had struck up a conversation with Ricky Craig , owner of Hubcap Grill , and offered my services as a taste - tester for any new burgers he might be working on .
This week I got the call .
Craig invited me and several other Houston food adventurers to join him for a complimentary sampling of his newest burger creations .
If you are not familiar with Hubcap Grill , it 's a hole - in - the - wall burger joint right in the middle of downtown at 1111 Prairie .
I 'd say most Houston burger lovers have it listed as one of their top three burgers in Houston .
It 's garnered a lot of accolades and good press .
I currently have it as my top Houston burger .
Even with his current success , Craig is not resting on his laurels .
He 'll be opening a new location on South Main in a few weeks with a bigger dining room and later hours .
And he is constantly experimenting with new items to add to an already eclectic menu that includes muffaletta burgers , Greek burgers , and the infamous Quadruple Bypass burger .
On a recent Saturday , our group sampled four new creations from the mad scientist of Houston burger makers .
The burgers are described below .
Note that they 're not on the menu ... yet .
Frito pie burger .
This burger concept seems so obvious , I did a quick Google search to see who else is doing it .
Surprisingly , not a lot of Frito pie burgers are out there .
This version included the traditional Frito pie ingredients : canned chili , melted Velveeta cheese , and Fritos right out of the bag .
This was easily the best burger of the day .
It does n't need further development and could be added to the menu immediately .
The chili and cheese are traditional burger toppings , but when combined with the crunchy Fritos , it 's like a Little League baseball game broke out in your mouth .
Add some chopped onions and fresh jalapeños on the side , and this could be Hubcap 's signature burger .
Tamale burger .
This burger looks good on paper : Toppings include whole chunks of tamales , grilled onions , black beans and enchilada sauce .
However , we all agreed that it was the least successful of the burgers .
The textures and flavors were muddled ; nothing really " snapped . "
Jay Francis recommended frying the tamales first to provide some textural differentiation .
This burger still has potential , but more experimentation is required .
Sticky burger .
The toppings for this burger were crunchy peanut butter and bacon .
Sandwiches made from peanut butter and bacon are quite common .
Of course , Elvis Presley made the peanut butter , bacon and banana sandwich famous .
Opinions on this burger varied : Some loved it , some thought it was okay , some ( like me ) liked it better the more we ate it .
In the end we agreed that there should be less peanut butter to let the flavor of the bacon come forward .
We also suggested that a sweet flavor be added -- jalapeño jelly being one candidate .
No one recommended adding bananas .
Summer sausage burger .
Summertime .
Backyard barbecue .
Grillin ' burgers and sausage .
Condiments include spicy mustard , pickles and onions .
That 's the essence of this burger .
You really can't go wrong with these ingredients , and this is another burger that could go on the menu immediately .
Our only recommendations were to go lighter on the spicy mustard and to slice the sausage on the diagonal rather than lengthwise .
Give people knowledge and they really eat it up and they appreciate it a lot and the more that knowledge is made available to people , the more they will utilize it and let it be a part of them .

The US made a secret deal with Bermuda - a British overseas territory - to accept the Uighur detainees
A senior US official has told the BBC Washington decided not to tell London beforehand about a deal to resettle four Guantanamo detainees in Bermuda .
A diplomatic row blew up over Bermuda 's decision to accept the four Chinese Muslim Uighurs on a US request .
Bermuda is a British overseas territory but the US official said Washington had acted secretly to ensure success .
Meanwhile the US said on Friday three Saudis at Guantanamo Bay had been transferred back to Saudi Arabia .
The transfers are part of US President Barack Obama 's strategy to close down the Guantanamo detention centre before next January .
Hostility
The unnamed senior official also told the BBC that Washington was attempting to shield the UK from Chinese anger .
Beijing has demanded the return to China of all 17 Uighurs held by US forces but Washington says they could face persecution in China .
The US has faced a conundrum of what to do with the Uighurs Most of the Guantanamo detainees have not been convicted of any crime and yet the US fears they may face persecution or torture if they are repatriated .
Meanwhile many Americans regard them with hostility .
It was revealed earlier in the week that the tiny Pacific island of Palau had agreed to take some of the 17 Chinese Uighurs at the camp .
But the four remaining , it later emerged , had been accepted by the Bermuda government .
They arrived in Bermuda on Thursday .
Pressed on whether the US had told the British government , an unnamed state department official was quoted as saying : " We did talk to them before the Uighurs got on the plane . "
We have underlined to the Bermuda government that it should have consulted the UK on whether this falls within their competence
British Foreign Office
Now a senior US official has told the BBC it was a deliberate decision not to consult London on the resettlement , after other countries came under pressure from China not to accept the Uighurs .
In a highly unusual move , a senior US official said Washington opted to keep details of the deal from London until the last minute to enable Britain to deny all knowledge of the deal and thus avoid China 's anger , says the BBC's Washington correspondent Kim Ghattas .
The official said they expected London to be upset but added he felt the deal was made on solid ground , in direct talks with the Bermuda government , who accepted the men as part of guest worker programme .
Bermuda blamed Britain , meanwhile , has expressed anger that it was not consulted , saying in a Foreign Office statement : " The Bermuda government consider this to be a matter regarding their day - to - day responsibility for immigration .
CHINA'S UIGHURS Ethnically Turkic Muslims , mainly in Xinjiang Made bid for independent state in 1940s Sporadic violence in Xinjiang since 1991 Uighurs worried about Chinese immigration and erosion of traditional culture
China demands US return Uighurs " We have underlined to the Bermuda government that it should have consulted the UK on whether this falls within their competence or is a foreign affairs or security issue for which the Bermuda government do not have delegated responsibility . "
For the time being London has reserved its expressions of ire for Bermuda , with a spokesman for the UK prime minister insisting Bermuda bore " the primary responsibility for ensuring that the constitutional requirements on the Bermudan government were adhered to " .
Britain is supposed to handle Bermuda 's defence , security and foreign affairs , but it delegates the authority to make decisions on immigration to Bermuda .
The Foreign Office said it would " also be looking at the operation of the ' General Entrustment ' which gives Bermuda the authority to conduct certain external relations on our behalf " .
Britain is also now helping Bermuda carry out a security assessment of the resettled detainees .
But the US official pointed out that the Uighurs were cleared four years ago of any wrongdoing .
On Friday , the US justice department said three Saudis - Khalid Saad Mohammed , Abdalaziz Kareem Salim al - Noofayaee and Ahmed Zaid Salim Zuhair had been approved for transfer back to Saudi Arabia .
It said they had been cleared by the previous administration and would undergo a " rehabilitation programme " in Saudi Arabia .

" If we can't get enough other countries to come along with us to do that , then we 've got to go with regime change by bolstering opposition groups and the like , because that 's the circumstance most likely for an Iranian government to decide that it 's safer not to pursue nuclear weapons than to continue to do so .
And if all else fails , if the choice is between a nuclear - capable Iran and the use of force , then I think we need to look at the use of force . "

PERHAPS the surest sign that newspapers are doomed is that politicians , so often their targets , are beginning to feel sorry for them .
On May 9th Barack Obama ended an otherwise comic speech with an earnest defence of an embattled business .
House and Senate committees have held hearings in the past month .
John Kerry , the junior senator from Massachusetts , called the newspaper “ an endangered species ” .
Indeed it is .
According to the American Society of News Editors , employment in the country 's newsrooms has fallen by 15 % in the past two years .
Paul Zwillenberg of OC&C , a firm of consultants , reckons that almost 70 British local newspapers have shut since the beginning of 2008 .
The Independent and the London Evening Standard depend on the largesse of foreign investors .
The strain is not confined to English - speaking countries : French newspapers have avoided the same fate only by securing an increase in their already hefty government subsidies .
Broadcast television news is struggling too .
Audiences have split and eroded : the share of Americans who watch the early evening news on the old “ big three ” broadcast networks ( ABC , CBS and NBC ) has fallen from about 30 % in the early 1990s to about 16 % .
Local - news outfits are ailing as car dealers and shops trim their advertising .
ITV , Britain 's biggest commercial broadcaster , is pleading to be excused from its obligation to produce local news .
All this has provoked much hand - wringing .
Yet the plight of the news business does not presage the end of news .
As large branches of the industry wither , new shoots are rising .
The result is a business that is smaller and less profitable , but also more efficient and innovative .
The clearest picture of how news consumption is changing comes from surveys by the Pew Research Centre .
Since 1994 the share of Americans saying they had listened to a radio news broadcast the previous day has fallen from 47 % to 35 % .
The share reading a newspaper has dropped from 58 % to 34 % .
Meanwhile cable and internet audiences have grown .
In 2008 , for the first time , more people said they got their national and international news from the internet than from newspapers ( see chart 1 ) .
Deeper but not broader
It is not only a matter of people switching from one medium to another .
Nearly everybody who obtains news from the internet also commonly watches it on television or reads a newspaper .
Only 5 % of Americans regularly get their news from the internet alone .
Technology has enabled well - informed people to become even better informed but has not broadened the audience for news .
The Pew Centre 's most alarming finding , for anybody who works in the trade , is that the share of 18 - to 24 - year - olds who got no news at all the previous day has risen from 25 % to 34 % in the past ten years .
Those who do seek news obtain it in a different way .
Rather than plodding through a morning paper and an evening broadcast , they increasingly seek the kind of information they want , when they want .
Few pay .
Robert Thomson , editor - in - chief of the Wall Street Journal , says many have come to view online news as “ an all - you - can - eat buffet for which you pay a cable company the only charge . ”
The main victim of this trend is not so much the newspaper ( although it is certainly declining ) as the conventional news package .
Open almost any leading metropolitan newspaper , or look at its website , and you will find the same things .
There will be a mixture of local , national , international , business and sports news .
There will be weather forecasts .
There will be display and classified advertisements .
There will be leaders , letters from readers , and probably a crossword .
This package , which was emulated first by broadcasters and then by internet pioneers such as AOL.com and MSN.com , works rather like an old - fashioned department store .
It provides a fair selection of useful information of dependable quality in a single place .
And the fate of the news package is similar to that of the department store .
Some customers have been lured away by discount chains ; others have been drawn to boutiques .
The Wal - Marts of the news world are online portals like Yahoo ! and Google News , which collect tens of thousands of stories .
Some are licensed from wire services like Reuters and the Associated Press .
But most consist simply of a headline , a sentence and a link to a newspaper or television website where the full story can be read .
The aggregators make money by funnelling readers past advertisements , which may be tailored to their presumed interests .
They are cheap to run : Google News does not even employ an editor .
Although they are convenient , these news warehouses can feel impersonal .
So another kind of aggregator has emerged , which offers a selection of news and commentary .
Some are eclectic , like the Daily Beast and the Drudge Report — the grandfather of the boutique aggregators .
Others are more specific , like Perlentaucher , a German cultural website .
The most successful of the lot , and the template for many newly unemployed journalists who have tried to launch websites of their own , is the Huffington Post .
HuffPo , as it is broadly known , employs just four reporters among a total staff of about 60 .
Much of its news is second - hand .
But it boasts an unpaid army of some 3,000 mostly left - wing bloggers .
The website feels like a cross between a university common room and a Beverly Hills restaurant ( your attitude to HuffPo will depend largely on whether you find this prospect appealing ) .
Arianna Huffington , who runs it , calls it a “ community around news ” .
It now has 4.2 m unique monthly visitors , according to comScore , an internet market - research company — almost twice as many as the New York Post .
Old - fashioned news folk increasingly complain that aggregators are “ parasites ” that profit from their work .
They are , in a sense ; but parasites can be useful .
As the quality of journalism becomes more erratic , the job of sifting stories is increasingly vital .
And aggregators drive readers , hence advertising , to original - news websites .
Hitwise , another market - research firm , estimates that in March 22 % of referrals to news sites came from search engines like Google , whereas 21 % came from other news sites .
“ Reporters send us their stories all the time , ” notes Tina Brown , a magazine veteran who runs the Daily Beast .
The rise of the aggregators reveals an uncomfortable fact about the news business .
The standard system of reporting , in which a journalist files a story that is broadcast or printed once and then put on a single proprietary website , is inefficient .
The marginal cost of distributing the story more widely is close to nil , but the marginal benefit can be considerable .
Interest in a story about Iraq in , say , the Los Angeles Times extends far beyond that city .
Before the aggregators appeared , a reader in Seville or even San Francisco probably would not have known it existed .
The inherent benefit of spreading stories around helps explain why some established news outfits are coming to resemble aggregators .
The Associated Press has a popular iPhone application which combines national stories with local ones from 1,100 partner news outlets .
News Corporation set up a website , Fox Nation , which mixes news stories with right - wing commentary .
It is intended to become a conservative Huffington Post .
Indeed , one of the great successes in both British and American news publishing is the Week , in effect an aggregator that is printed on paper .
With their stories roaming widely , English - language news outlets in particular are taking on broader identities .
The Guardian 's website , visited by twice as many people outside Britain as inside , aims to become the international voice of liberal opinion .
The Daily Mail has built a reputation for celebrity news .
New contests are being joined .
The BBC , which has set up a wire service and sells advertisements on its foreign websites , now competes with the Associated Press , which has moved beyond the business of supplying stories to American newspapers .
Up go the walls
General news is likely to remain free on the internet .
The crush of similar stories is too great , the temptation of piracy is too strong and the aggregators are too good at sniffing out decent free reports .
Yet it has become clear that online advertising alone cannot support good original journalism .
Until recently many print news executives believed that advertising revenues would follow their readers from print to the web .
Between 2004 and 2007 online advertising revenues doubled from $ 1.5 billion to $ 3.2 billion , according to the Newspaper Association of America .
But in the second quarter of 2008 they began to fall , just as the loss of print and classified advertisements accelerated ( see chart 2 ) .
Worryingly , this cannot be blamed entirely on the recession .
Online advertising money has moved to search — ie , Google — and excess supply has depressed prices of display advertisements .
As a result , executives are looking hungrily at the few online outfits that dare ask readers for money .
One is the Financial Times ( part - owner of The Economist ) which demands registration of anybody wishing to view more than three articles per month and payment from anybody wanting to see more than ten .
About 1 m people are registered , of whom 109,000 pay .
By going easy on casual readers , the Financial Times keeps a foot in what John Ridding , the company 's chief executive , calls the “ giant wave machines ” of the internet , such as Google and Yahoo ! , which drive traffic to the site .
Registered readers are served targeted advertisements , which are more lucrative .
It is an attempt to fuse a subscription model with one supported by advertising .
The Wall Street Journal takes a shrewd route to a similar destination .
Rather than charging certain types of user , it charges for certain types of news .
Earlier this week , it offered for nothing a story about swine flu , a review of the new “ Star Trek ” film and a report on looming cuts at car dealerships .
It charged for pieces on Cigna Corporation 's pension plan , Lockheed Martin 's quarterly lobbying expenditures and a lawsuit against a bottling company which alleges that a board meeting was held improperly .
In short , the fun articles are free .
The dry , obscure stuff costs money .
The thinking is that broadly appealing articles draw readers to the website , where they can be tempted by advertisers and by the Journal 's more selective wares .
Most people do not care about pensions in a Philadelphia health - insurance company .
But those who are interested in such information are very interested , so much so that they will probably pay a monthly subscription for it .
Just over 1 m do — even though the specialised articles can be read for nothing via Google .
And those who cross the main pay wall may be persuaded to purchase more premium content .
The paper is also exploring a “ micro- payments ” model for individual articles .
Financial news is not the only kind for which people appear prepared to pay .
ESPN , a cable sports channel , has erected several pay walls on its website .
They protect information that only the most rabid fan would want to know , adhering to the Wall Street Journal 's dictum that people 's willingness to pay for a story is inversely correlated with the size of its potential audience .
The number of profitable news niches may grow as rivals close bureaus or go out of business altogether .
Newspapers and magazines are more likely to be rescued by a careful combination of free and paid - for content than by new technology .
Portable news readers such as the Kindle DX , which some have hailed as potential saviours , will help only to the extent that they lure readers from the web , where news is mostly free .
At the moment they seem to be doing something else .
Ken Doctor of Outsell , a research firm , reckons that the Kindle appeals to baby - boomers who would otherwise read a paper magazine or newspaper .
The young prefer their iPhones and their aggregators .
Indeed , the top four magazines on Kindle , according to Amazon 's website , are the New Yorker , Newsweek , Time and Reader 's Digest .
Not much of a youth market there .
King comment
On cable television , a different kind of niche product is cleaning up .
The right - wing Fox News Channel has become by far the most popular specialist provider of news .
This is not surprising .
The channel 's newscasts and opinion shows are well - produced , and the crumbling of the Republican Party has left conservatives seeking a voice .
Rather more surprising is that the left - wing MSNBC now draws more prime - time viewers aged 25 to 54 than the much more established CNN .
Rex Features
Fox and MSNBC provide a mixture of news , interviews and occasionally furious commentary .
Phil Griffin , the chief executive of MSNBC , calls it “ news - plus ” .
The aim is to complement and give meaning to the mass of disconnected information that viewers pick up during the day .
Viewers know what they are getting ; indeed , they rate cable shows as more reliable than newspapers .
Against the common charge of partisanship , Mr Griffin offers what could be the slogan of the cable news industry : “ We 're not trying to be all things to all people . ”
Hot talk may be popular at the moment because Americans are politically polarised .
The calmer CNN won the battle for cable viewers on election night and may well do so again in 2012 .
Yet , as in so much of the news business , a return to normal is improbable .
The market for news is likely to remain unstable , favouring different providers at different points in political , economic and even sporting cycles .
Take Real Clear Politics , an American political website , which aggregates news , commentary and opinion polls .
It became essential reading during last year 's presidential race .
At its peak , shortly before the election , it attracted 1.4 m unique visitors a month , according to comScore .
Since then its popularity has plunged by 75 % .
Rivals like Fivethirtyeight.com and Talking Points Memo have lost many readers too .
For newspapers , magazines and television programmes , with their high fixed costs , such fluctuations would be ruinous .
Not so long ago , news was a highly profitable business .
Regional newspapers cultivated cosy monopolies and routinely enjoyed annual profit margins of more than 20 % .
In America local television stations sometimes had margins approaching 50 % .
Yet news does not always have to be profitable in order to survive .
Even in their diminished state , large newspapers attract rich men who seek political or business clout , or who believe that there is money to be made after all .
Tony O'Reilly , who ran Independent News & Media until this year , used to describe the Independent newspaper as a calling card .
He tolerated its losses , although the company 's shareholders have been less patient .
Rupert Murdoch 's fondness for printer 's ink has sometimes baffled Wall Street analysts .
Still , last month David Geffen , a media mogul , reportedly tried to buy a stake in the parent company of the New York Times .
Less glamorous outfits can also attract benefactors .
San Diego has a small , scrappy news website that was paid for at first largely by a local businessman .
The Voice of San Diego concentrates on nitty - gritty issues such as water , crime and health care — the sort of stories that local newspapers used to cover extensively .
Indeed , America long ago proved that radio news can be supplied by non-profit organisations .
In the absence of profitable alternatives , it may be that expensive , worthy journalism on subjects like the war in Iraq will increasingly be supported by charity .
The spread of digital cameras has also enabled ordinary people to file pictures and news reports directly .
They are encouraged in this by established news outlets like CNN , which have come to view citizen journalists as a source of both content and page views .
Citizens have proved excellent reporters of dramatic , obvious news , such as terrorist attacks and sightings of Britney Spears .
Leonard Brody , the head of NowPublic , a large Canadian news - gatherer , believes that amateurs will eventually liberate journalists from the tedious business of reporting , leaving them free to concentrate on analysis .
He means it kindly .
Just now journalists have less competition from crowds than from governments .
In Britain local authorities have created newsletters that carry advertising .
The annual budget for the websites of the ( state - owned ) BBC was recently raised to £ 145 m ( $ 220 m ) .
According to Mr Zwillenberg , the total online spending of the country 's national newspapers is only £ 100m .
America 's president has proved an especially prolific citizen journalist .
People who let Barack Obama 's campaign team have their e-mail address last year still receive the occasional missive .
The White House posts videos on YouTube that are often more polished than those produced by the news networks .
In case the intention to bypass the news filter were not clear , during his second press conference on March 24th the president did not take a single question from a leading daily newspaper .
Clearly , he knows where the future lies .
The decline of once - great newspapers and news programmes is not without cost .
It means the end of a certain kind of civic sensibility that was built on broad agreement about what is important and what is not .
But it was once difficult to imagine city centres without the unifying presence of department stores .
Many of them went , yet people carried on shopping .

The current global recession is likely to be " unusually long and severe , and the recovery sluggish , " the International Monetary Fund has warned .
Slowdowns linked with financial crises tend to be severe , while synchronised slowdowns last longer , it said .
The current global crisis has also been strongly felt in emerging economies , it said in its World Economic Outlook .
The global links between financial sectors have intensified the speed the downturn has spread across the world .
The recession will be less severe if government spending increases , the IMF says , with fiscal policies seen as more effective than monetary policy Detailed forecasts for individual countries are set to be released next week , ahead of the IMF 's spring meeting in Washington .
In March , the organisation predicted that the world economy would suffer its first global recession in 60 years , declining by between 0.5 % and 1.0 % in 2009 .
Synchronised
The IMF have helped Hungary , whose currency has come under pressure Since World War II , the typical recession lasts for a year , with a recovery lasting five years .
But , the report says , recessions linked to financial crises , such as the current one , tend to last much longer .
The recoveries following these slowdowns are then often held back by weak private demand , as households try to save more .
A synchronised slowdown - where many of the world 's economies are in recession at the same time - lasts one and a half times longer than a typical recession .
The current recession is likely to be unusually long and severe , and the recovery sluggish
IMF " This combination is historically rare , " the report said , but these two factors do suggest that this current downturn will be " persistent " with a " weaker - than - average recovery " .
Aggressive monetary and fiscal policy measures are needed to support demand in the short term , adding that restoring confidence in the financial sector is critically important if policies are to be effective .
The problems in the financial sector have quickly spread from the US and the UK to other countries .
The IMF has expressed scepticism that enough is being done to restore the financial system to health in the advanced economies .
Emerging blow
The IMF also warned that the financial crisis is having far - reaching effect on emerging economies , particularly in Eastern Europe .
Millions of workers in China have lost their jobs
It says that globalisation has strengthened the transmission mechanisms which will deepen the crisis .
The strong presence of Western European banks in emerging Europe has meant that banks ' liquidity problems are being felt in these countries .
" Given their large exposure , emerging European economies might be heavily affected , " it said .
This may mean there will be a protracted decline in capital flows to these countries , it added .
And the IMF says it could be a long time before such flows return to developing and emerging market countries .
With the financial crisis intensifying , more countries are coming to the IMF for help and its supply of funds to loan may run out .
Poland has recently asked for a $ 20bn loan , joining a number of other Eastern European countries , including Ukraine , Hungary and Latvia .
At the recent London summit , the G20 agreed that the IMF should triple its available resources to $ 750bn , to ensure that it had enough money to offer loans .
Other IMF countries are pledging this money .
Japan , for example , has already offered to loan the IMF $ 100bn and the EU says it will put in $ 100bn .

New research findings published today by Dr Metin Başoğlu , Head of Section of Trauma Studies at King 's College London and the Istanbul Centre for Behaviour Research and Therapy , examines the psychological impact of war captivity , ' cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment ' ( CIDT ) and physical torture .
Findings revealed that being held captive in a hostile and life - threatening environment , deprivation of basic needs , sexual torture , psychological manipulations , humiliation , exposure to extreme temperatures , isolation , and forced stress positions appear to cause more psychological damage than physical torture .
This study at its essence concerns the question of what constitutes torture , is published on line in the June issue of the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry .
Başoğlu writes that a priori assumptions of a distinction between torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatments have led some to argue that the latter are associated with less mental suffering than torture and therefore more acceptable in exceptional circumstances .
The research looks at the different risk factors associated with PTSD in former detainees , reporting that captivity experience in a war setting was associated with 2.8 times greater risk of PTSD in comparison to being detained by state authorities in someone 's own country , possibly due to the greater perceived threat to life in a war setting .
Additionally , being held captive by an enemy was a stronger risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) than the actual experience of torture itself .
PTSD was also associated with CIDT and sexual abuse but not with physical torture .
Background on the study
Dr Başoğlu has examined the psychological impact of the captivity experience in 432 individuals who were held captive and tortured in two different contexts .
The group included 230 survivors in former Yugoslavia countries who were tortured during the war and 202 survivors who were detained and tortured for political and other reasons after the military coup d'état in Turkey in the early 1980s .
Information was taken on 46 different forms of torture , each rated by participants on a 0 to 4 perceived distress scale ( where 0 was not all distressing and 4 was extremely distressing ) .
Participants rated the stressfulness of their overall torture experience using the same scale .
They were also assessed for PTSD .
The survivors reported an average of 21 stressor events during detention or captivity .
Survivors who rated CIDT events ( deprivation of food , water , sleep , urination / defecation , and medical care , forced stress positions , isolation , fear - inducing psychological manipulations , humiliating treatment , exposure to hot / cold temperatures and exposure to extreme sensory discomfort ) as more distressing were also likely to report their overall torture experience as more stressful .
Perceived severity of physical torture ( e.g. electrical torture , hanging by the hands , beating the soles of the feet , genital / anal torture and stretching of extremities ) on the other hand , was not associated with perceived severity of overall torture experience .
Thus , it was CIDT and not physical torture that determined perception of overall torture experience as more distressing .
CIDT was also associated with higher rates of PTSD than physical torture .
In response to views that a broad definition of torture downplays the importance of the problem of torture , the author noted that the definition of torture implied by these findings cannot be deemed overly inclusive without denying the reality of torture as it is practised in real life situations .
Dr Metin Başoğlu of King 's College London concludes , " Such views reflect a rather stereotypical image of torture as involving only certain atrocious acts of physical violence .
While such disturbing images might be useful in channelling public reactions against torture , they also foster a skewed image of torture , reinforcing the perception in some people that ' cruel , inhuman , and degrading ' treatments do not amount to torture .
Far from downplaying the problem of torture , our studies highlight the fact that the reality of torture is far more serious than people generally believe . "
Next Steps
The study 's researcher will be turning his attention to the implications of these findings for an evidence - based contextual definition of torture taking into account the psychological mechanisms by which torture exerts its impact on people .
The findings imply that the distinction between torture and CIDT in international conventions against torture need to be abolished to prevent its abuse .
Future research will also focus on the implications of the findings for an effective intervention for torture survivors .
Dr. Basoglu has already developed a brief and highly effective behavioural intervention for posttraumatic stress , which will be tested in torture survivors .

IA leader Mr Kleist said Greenlanders deserved the election result
The left - wing Inuit Ataqatigiit ( Community of the People , IA ) party has won Greenland 's parliamentary elections , official results show .
The party ousted the Social Democratic Siumut Party , which has governed the territory for 30 years .
With all districts counted , the IA had nearly 44 % of the vote and Siumut just over 26 % , the election commission said .
IA will be the first party to govern the semi-autonomous Danish territory under an expanded home - rule agreement .
IA leader Kuupik Kleist told supporters celebrating in the capital , Nuuk : " Greenland deserves this . "
Current Prime Minister Hans Enoksen had called the election early , after Greenland voters approved plans in November to give their government more powers .
He said he had wanted to give islanders the chance to decide who would be leading them into the " new era " .
Under the new status , Greenlanders will be able to make decisions on most issues .
But the authorities will continue to negotiate with Denmark on defence and foreign affairs .
Correspondents say the polls were seen as a turning point in Greenland 's path to partial independence from Denmark .
From the world 's tallest woman to Germany 's hottest giant here 's a list of ladies that reached new heights in life .
What ’s that line from “ Big ? ”
Oh , yeah , “ I wish I were big . ”
Well , wished or not , it came true — and then some — for a few select women around the world .
Traditionally , women do n’t grow as much as men , but there are some notable exceptions that make it a literal pain in the neck for people to look at ladies because they ’re just so high up .
Here ’s a look at some of the women who ’ve probably heard all the lamest jokes , from “ How ’s the weather up there ? ” to “ Get your head out of the clouds . ”
Good thing they ’re tall because they need to have a high tolerance for the inane comments that have come their way .

Through the eyepiece of Michael Backes ’s small Celestron telescope , the 18 - point letters on the laptop screen at the end of the hall look nearly as clear as if the notebook computer were on my lap .
I do a double take .
Not only is the laptop 10 meters ( 33 feet ) down the corridor , it faces away from the telescope .
The image that seems so legible is a reflection off a glass teapot on a nearby table .
In experiments here at his laboratory at Saarland University in Germany , Backes has discovered that an alarmingly wide range of objects can bounce secrets right off our screens and into an eavesdropper ’s camera .
Spectacles work just fine , as do coffee cups , plastic bottles , metal jewelry — even , in his most recent work , the eyeballs of the computer user .
The mere act of viewing information can give it away .
ON THE campaign trail , Barack Obama famously claimed that blue - collar workers in Pennsylvania clung to religion because of bitterness over lost jobs .
Americans are now truly fearful , as unemployment has mounted and house prices fallen .
Yet the theory that church attendance grows in times of economic crisis seems to be a myth .
Last year David Beckworth , an assistant professor of Economics at Texas State University , examined historic patterns in the size of evangelical congregations and found that , during each recession cycle between 1968 and 2004 , membership of evangelical churches jumped by 50 % .
This report filled the newspapers and TV news - shows at the height of the depression panic just before Christmas ; but the report 's findings focused on evangelicals , and do not apply to Americans at large .
According to Frank Newport , the editor - in - chief of Gallup Poll , which interviews 30,000 Americans every month , “ to guess that attendance would increase [ in recessions ] is a common - sense assumption with no basis in data . ”
John Green , a senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , which recently published a study on the correlation between church attendance and economics , has found no link in the past 20 years .
Interestingly , says Gallup , the percentage of Americans who tick the “ no religious preference ” box has steadily grown , from 0 - 3 % 40 years ago to 12 - 15 % now , while church attendance has remained steady .
Mr Green says that real spikes in attendance have occurred only in times of national disaster , such as September 11th 2001 , or the Cuban missile crisis .
Mr Newport goes even further , noting that , after September 11th , there was only a short - term blip in attendance .
Evidently , this recession is “ not providing a society - wide worry about the future . ”
Mr Green explains that economic problems are uneven in their effects : “ Perhaps the unemployed are going to church more , but others may be going less . ”
The financial crisis , then , may not seem as terrible to God- fearing Americans as the hype has suggested .
As Mr Green concludes , “ We 've had recessions before , and we always come out of them . ”
Or could it be that Mr Obama 's victory has produced a sense that help is on the way ?
DUBAI
The Iranian government is seeking greater assistance from international NGOs to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of refugees , according to the UN Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) .
Some international NGOs already work with refugees in Iran , but several left the country earlier this decade because of difficult working conditions .
At a conference staged earlier this week in Tehran by Iran ’s interior ministry , UNHCR and the International Consortium for Refugees in Iran , the government urged NGOs to return or establish a presence for the first time .
Deputy Interior Minister Abbas Mohtaj said at the event that some of the refugees had been in Iran for more than 30 years .
Mohtaj added that finding a solution had taken too long " and we therefore believe that today , when repatriation is becoming more and more problematic , we should work with NGOs to find solutions to assist voluntary repatriation ” .
With 968,000 refugees – mostly Afghans – Iran hosts the second largest refugee population in the world after Pakistan , according to UNHCR .
According to a World Food Programme report issued in December 2008 , only a few thousand Afghan refugees live in refugee camps .
Their incomes are low and the average family spends about 77 percent of its income on rent .

Frye looks like an old west sheriff , and Takayama looks like Japan tried to make their own Hulk Hogan out of juiced grapes .
When they faced off , the two of them somehow , without speaking , managed to come to some kind of gentleman 's agreement .
They decided the only move each of them would use is grabbing the opponent 's head with one hand , and punching it over and over with the other .
Within seconds , it turned into a sublime combination of ultra violence and slapstick .
As they pound , pound , pounded each other 's skulls , you could see all the faces in the crowd light up with joy .

POTTSVILLE , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) --
A fomer Pennsylvania high school football player was acquitted of murder Friday in the beating death of a Mexican immigrant last summer .
Luis Ramirez died of blunt force injuries after a confrontation with a group of Pennsylania teens .
However , a Schuylkill County jury found Brandon Piekarsky and Derrick Donchak guilty of simple assault stemming from the death of Luis Ramirez , who died of blunt force injuries to the head after a fight with the defendants and their friends .
Donchak , 19 , was also found guilty of providing alcohol to the group of teens that encountered Ramirez the night of July 12 on a residential street in the rural mining town of Shenandoah .
Both teens were acquitted of ethnic intimidation charges .
Prosecutors alleged the teens baited the undocumented Mexican immigrant into a fight with racial epithets , provoking an exchange of punches and kicks that ended with Ramirez convulsing in the street , foaming from the mouth .
He died two days later in a hospital in Danville .
Piekarsky , 17 , had faced a charge of third - degree murder for allegedly delivering a fatal kick to Ramirez 's head after he was knocked to the ground .
He also was found not guilty of ethnic intimidation , aggravated assault and attempting to solicit a cover-up .
An all - white jury of six men and six women heard from several prosecution witnesses , including a juvenile co-defendant and another teen who pleaded guilty in federal court for his role in the fight .
While the jury heard conflicting accounts about who initiated the encounter or delivered the final kick to Ramirez 's head , defense lawyers attempted to place the blame on another co-defendant , who is facing charges in juvenile court , and Colin Walsh , who has pleaded guilty to violating Ramirez 's civil rights .
The juvenile admitted on the stand to shouting " go home you Mexican [ expletive ] " after the first fight dispersed , prompting Ramirez to turn back and attack him .
The juvenile 's testimony was corroborated by Walsh , who admitted to punching Ramirez and knocking him to the ground after he charged the juvenile .
Both witnesses said Piekarsky delivered the final blow to Ramirez 's head while he was on the ground , but others testified that they could n't be certain who had actually kicked him .
The incident drew national attention to the small town of Shenandoah , highlighting issues of race relations .
CNN 's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report .

Hey Maine :
Do you really want to lend your name to gay ' conversion ' ?
by Jeremy Hooper
The Bangor Daily News is reporting that the campaign to roll back marriage equality in Maine has begun in earnest :
The Rev. Bob Emrich , a spokesman for a coalition of groups that support traditional marriage , traveled the state last week distributing petitions and explaining the rules circulators must follow to ensure the signatures they collect are valid .
Petitioners begin seeking signatures to repeal gay marriage [ bangor Daily News ]
So that being the case , we want to show Mainers the sort of mindset to which the Bob Emrichs of the world are asking you to sing on .
For it's not really just a campaign to " protect the sanctity of marriage , " as they will surely say .
Underneath that rhetoric is an overall campaign to " change " gays .
Think we 're being alarmist ?
Well , here are three of the eight videos that Pastor Emrich has posted to his official YouTube channel :
Pastor Emerich 's channel [ YT ]
The anti-gay side is right about one thing : Political action around the issue of marriage has consequences for children .
Unfortunately it is gay children who are truly affected , with accurate , scientific assessments of their realities being the victimized concept !
Maine families deserve much better .
Your thoughts
You know what really should be taken polical action against ?
Conversion " therapy . "
Not only is it ineffective and unscientific , but also potentially - harmful to the individual .
Posted by : ---- | Jun 1 , 2009 12:33:58 PM
It 's funny how the people in the videos stress that there is no reliable proof that gays are born that way and can't change , yet there is no talk on how successful their ministries and therapy are .
Randy Thomas and Chambers have even clarified that ' change ' is n't necessarily going from gay to completely straight .
Posted by : KZ | Jun 1 , 2009 4:23:41 PM
They do n't even have the scriptures right !
Anyway , at least they are n't saying we have to love gays , which is better than Fred Phelps .
But not by much ... I have some articles on scripture at http://www.sokatie.com
... especially if you scroll to my links .
Posted by : Katie | Jun 2 , 2009 5:50:02 AM
So , these ex-gays ... I always have to ask myself if they are for real , or what their real story is .
Would you mind doing some more coverage on that ?
Like , the girl in the second video does n't seem like a liar , but based on the stats that I 've seen ... IDK ... know what I mean ?
Plus , the founders of Exodus are now married to each other and the last guy running the show was caught in a gay bar .
Thoughts ?

A group of investors and engineers based in Britain has unveiled a hydrogen city car they hope will revolutionize the auto industry with its innovative leasing structure and open source development – even though it looks like a Converse Chuck Taylor .
Riversimple pulled the sheet off its ultra- lightweight fuel cell Urban Car today in London and said it delivers a 50 - mph top speed , a 200 - mile range and fuel economy equivalent to 300 mpg .
The company claims it also emits a paltry 30 grams per kilometer of CO2 .
The car features a 6 - kilowatt fuel cell , which is miniscule compared to the 100 - kW unit in the Honda FCX Clarity , but the developers say that 's plenty for a vehicle that weighs just 770 pounds .
" This next generation hydrogen - electric car brings electric vehicles into a new stage where range , charge - time and cost are no longer commercial barriers , " said Taras Wankewycz of Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies .
The company provided the fuel cell that powers the car .
Porsche scion Sebastian Piëch is a partner in the firm .
His family helped finance the project , which was been in the works for nine years and was developed with help from Oxford and Cranfield universities .
Many major automakers have relegated hydrogen cars to the back burner – Honda , BMW and Mazda are notable exceptions – and the Obama Administration wants to cut hydrogen vehicle R&D funding .
But Spowers believes hydrogen is the fuel of the future .
He says the problem is automakers are focusing too much on science in a search for big breakthroughs when the basic technology already exists .
The Riversimple uses four in - wheel motors with regenerative braking and ultracapacitors to store the energy .
Small components and a composite body minimize weight down to maximize efficiency .
The composite body also gives the car its , ahem , unusual matte finish .
" I think that the auto industry is focusing a lot of money on research and development at a basic science level on hydrogen storage and fuel cell technology .
We do n't think it 's necessary to do that , " Spowers told CNN .
" We can use existing technology and integrate it into a whole system design approach – that is where the breakthrough has come . "
Piëch is equally bullish on the technology and says the Urban Car " represents a major step toward practical twenty - first century personal transport and toward the fulfillment of my great - grandfather ’s ambitions for accessible personal transport . "
His great - grandfather is Ferdinand Porsche .
Yes , that Porsche .
Piëch says the Riversimple embodies Ferdinand Porsche 's " other passions : light weight and high efficiency . "
While the engineering is interesting enough , consider the sales pitch :
The car is available only for lease and only in Britain , but the 200 - pound monthly payment ( about $ 330 ) includes the hydrogen .
That 's about half what you 'd spend leasing the FXC Clarity .
Riversimple says the leasing revenue will help finance the creation of a local hydrogen infrastructure , which is , of course , one of the great stumbling blocks to the adoption of hydrogen .
The company says it has brokered a deal with the British gas company BOC Gases to develop a pilot fueling program " in a small UK city . "
The company plans to post the Urban Car 's design specs online in an open source environment that Piech says will hasten the car 's development and allow people to tailor the vehicle to local needs and desires .
We 'd like ours to look a little less like a dragonfly and a little more like a Porsche Cayman , thank you .
Spowers still needs to line up more funding to continue testing the car but he believes it could be available as early as 2013 .
" I 'm absolutely convinced that we 're offering a better solution for a segment of the transport problem and we'd be crazy not to pursue it , " he told CNN .

Ever since PSN cards have made their release in the United States , the Canadian neighbors up north have been clamoring for them as well .
According to a post on the PSU forums , it looks like gaming retailers , such as EB Games and Gamestop , in Canada are finally starting to receive distribution of the coveted PSN cards .
As shown in the image above , the top of the card ’s back reads “ Valid in Canada only .
Terms of use listed below , ” meaning Canadians with US accounts will not be able to use their newfound wealth to exploit the US video store .
Hopefully SCE will grace the video store upon our Canadian friends soon .

San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom and Twitter co-founder Biz Stone announced at a press conference this week that residents can make 311 customer service requests or complaints to the city 's call center using Twitter , a social networking platform that lets users share messages called " tweets " of no more than 140 characters .
Residents can tweet into the city 's call center about various services like graffiti removal , potholes , garbage maintenance and street cleaning .
Mobile users can also send messages and pictures using a third - party application .
" I think , and [ Biz Stone ] can correct me if I 'm wrong , we are the first city in the country , if not in the world , to actually combine this new two - way communication technology with a 311 call center as a new way to communicate directly and through mobile devices with the citizens of the city and county of San Francisco , " said Chris Vein , the city / county CIO and executive director of San Francisco 's Department of Technology .
Vein oversaw the project along with Nancy Alfaro , director of the San Francisco 311 Customer Service Center .
" We 're just excited to be first in the nation to use a social networking platform to handle service requests this way , " said Alfaro .
San Francisco is using CoTweet , a Twitter enterprise platform , to manage and track messages .
In its first day of operation , CoTweet effectively provided a clear , clean presentation while archiving the city 's tweets , said Andy Maimoni , deputy director of the center .
Since Tuesday 's launch , Alfaro said there have been approximately 89 requests .
The city now has nearly 1,400 followers and has made 39 updates .
The city 's site also features a list of sample tweets .
How Tweeting 311 Works
To make service requests , residents who have Twitter accounts must follow San Francisco 's account at SF311 .
Once a service request is submitted , it 's logged by a call taker into a customer relationship management database .
The resident is then given a tracking number so he or she can follow up on the issue .
Users can send direct messages to the call center by appending the letter " D " before SF311 , which allows them to receive real - time responses .
However , users with general inquiries usually receive a link with the information they need .
The pilot program comes as an extension of city services and it's a learning tool to better serve citizens , said Alfaro .
" We think that people will be more aware of this other means of communicating with 311 , and word will get out and you 'll just have more and more people using this as an option to communicate with 311 , " she said .
" We thought this might be an interesting way to see if we can open up this channel using spare resources , spare time , using customer service staff , " Maimoni said .
Maimoni and Alfaro agree Twitter is a supplemental avenue for contacting 311 and that the 140 - character restriction has n't created any communication problems so far .
Maimoni said most 311 queries can be handled via Twitter , but more complicated cases are dealt with over the phone .
" If you have some large complaint that you want to do , then we 'll say , ' Hey , why do n't you call us . '
There are things you 're probably not going want to do in a messaging format , " he said .
The Future
Though San Francisco might be starting a new trend , it 's yet to be seen what the future will be using Twitter .
City officials are hopeful .
" We 're not going to stop with just 311 , " said Vein .
" This is a pilot and we 're starting with 311 , but we certainly expect to take this with a little bit of experience , take it to other departments -- and it could be that we take do that with [ the Municipal Transportation Agency ] or the Youth Commission .
There are a number of good examples that we will be working with to build out in the future . "
San Francisco's 24/7 call center was launched in March 2007 , has received more than 5 million calls and serves callers in 176 languages , according to a press release on the mayor 's Web site .

On Friday the 13th , in April 2029 , the asteroid Apophis will pass close enough to the Earth to be viewed with the naked eye .
This will be an exciting event for stargazers , but for a short time in 2004 there was concern that this event would be cataclysmic .
In December 2004 Apophis , named after the Egyptian serpent god who brings darkness to the Earth , was given a 1 in 37 chance of impacting with the Earth based on initial observations of the asteroid 's orbit .
Luckily , additional observations showed that the asteroid would just be a near miss in 2029 , though there is still a slim chance of a collision during a pass in 2036 .
While you breathe a sigh of relief , some people are already making plans for how to deal with any potential armageddons in the future .
One such person is David French , a PhD student in aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University , who has worked out how to stop asteroids from colliding with the Earth by attaching a massive ball and chain ( a large ballast mass connected by a long tether ) .
By attaching the ballast , French explains , " you change the object 's center of mass , effectively changing the object 's orbit and allowing it to pass by the Earth , rather than impacting it . "
Does this all sound a bit far - fetched , and like some movie Bruce Willis or Tea Leoni should be starring in ?
NASA 's Near Earth Object Program has identified more than 1,000 " potentially hazardous asteroids " and they are finding more all the time .
" While none of these objects is currently projected to hit Earth in the near future , slight changes in the orbits of these bodies , which could be caused by the gravitational pull of other objects , push from the solar wind , or some other effect , could cause an intersection , " French explains .
So French , and Andre Mazzoleni , NC State Associate Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering , studied whether an asteroid - tether - ballast system could effectively alter the motion of an asteroid to ensure that it misses the Earth .
And encouragingly the answer seems to be : yes , it can .

Kepler discovered in the 17th century that all the planets , as they move around the Sun , trace a path that is shaped like a squashed circle , an ellipse .
An ellipse has two foci , and is definied by its greatest width , called the major axis , and eccentricity , a measure of how squashed the shape is .
A circle has zero eccentricity , while a very squashed ellipse has eccentricity close to one .
For an orbiting body the Sun is located at one of these two foci .
The Earth travels on an orbit that is quite close to circular — it has eccentricity of 0.0167 and a semimajor ( half the major axis ) of 149,597,887.5 km ( which is the definition of 1 astronomical unit or AU ) .
The distance between the Earth and the Sun varies from around 147 million to 152 million kilometres .
Asteroids also move in elliptical orbits and most known asteroids move in a band between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter .
However , they are defined as Near Earth if their closest pass to the Sun , at a point on their elliptical orbit called the perihelion , is less than 1.3 AU ( so the asteroid passes the Sun a third further out than the Earth ) , and as potentially hazardous if they pass within 0.05 AU of Earth 's orbit ( which is about twice the distance from the Earth to the Moon ) .
Mathematics of an ellipse
An ellipse , which looks like a squashed circle , is uniquely described by the semimajor axis ( half the width ) and the semiminor axis ( half the height ) .
If the centre of the ellipse is placed on the origin , you can describe it by the equation
An ellipse has two points on the major axis called the foci , such that the sum of distances from each focus to any point on the ellipse is equal to .
The eccentricity , , of an ellipse is the amount it differs from a circle ( which has an eccentricity of 0 ) .
Mathematically it is defined as the ratio of the distance between the foci ( say ) and the length of the major axis , .
so the distance between the two foci is .
The Sun is at one of the foci of the elliptical orbit [ Image courtesy NASA ] so the distance between the two foci is The Sun is at one of the foci of an elliptical orbit , so for simplicity let 's put the Sun at the origin , and have the semimajor axis of the orbit lying along the - axis .
Then we can describe the orbit using the equation where is the distance from the sun and is the angle from the - axis .
whereis the distance from the sun andis the angle from the - axis .
The point corresponds to the aphelion , the furthest point from the sun at a distance of When the orbiting body is at a distance of , which you can work out to be .
The point corresponds to the perihelion , the closest point to the sun at a distance of Whenthe orbiting body is at a distance of , which you can work out to be .
The pointcorresponds to the perihelion , the closest point to the sun at a distance of
French and Mazzoleni studied how the elliptical orbits of these hypothetical asteroids would be affected over the 20 years before any impact by attaching a mass to the asteroid via a long tether .
This has an effect of changing the centre of mass of the asteroid , effectively moving the asteroid to another orbit .
Their goal was to divert the trajectory of the an Earth - bound asteroid by one Earth radius , a goal set out in NASA 's report to US Congress on how to deal with such a situation .
Using NASA 's database of potentially hazardous asteroids ( PHAs ) as examples , they solved the equations of motion for hypothetical Earth - bound versions .
They tried many cases to determine the effect of the parameters involved , such as the size of the orbit ( semimajor axis ) , the shape ( eccentricity ) , the tether length ( which ranged from 100 to 100,000 km ) , the ratio of the ballast mass to the asteroid mass ( ballasts from one tenth to one millionth the mass of the asteroid ) , as well as the initial position of the ballast with repect to the asteroid .
French and Mazzoleni found that the system was most effective for smaller asteroids , with smaller and more eccentric ( squashed ) orbits .
But by comparing their results for data for known PHAs , they showed that many similar asteroids could be diverted with tethers of 10,000 km , and over half could be diverted with the longest tethers of 100,000 km .
( The maximum length of 100,000 km was taken from other scientific studies of the use of tether systems in space , such as the space elevator . )
" It 's hard to imagine the scale of both the problem and the potential solutions , " French says .
" The Earth has been hit by objects from space many times before , so we know how bad the effects could be .
For example , about 65 million years ago , a very large asteroid is thought to have hit the Earth in the southern Gulf of Mexico , wiping out the dinosaurs , and , in 1907 , a very small airburst of a comet over Siberia flattened a forest over an area equal in size to New York City .
The scale of our solution is similarly hard to imagine .
" Using a tether somewhere between 1,000 kilometers ( roughly the North - South length of the UK ) to 100,000 kilometers ( which would wrap around the Earth two and a half times ) to divert an asteroid sounds extreme .
But compare it to other schemes , " French says .
" They are all pretty far out .
Other schemes include : a call for painting the asteroids in order to alter how light may influence their orbit ; a plan that would guide a second asteroid into the threatening one ; and of course , there are nukes .
Nuclear weapons are an intriguing possibility , but have considerable political and technical obstacles .
Would the rest of the world trust [ the US ] to nuke an asteroid ?
Would we trust anyone else ?
And would the asteroid break into multiple asteroids , giving us more problems to solve ? "
There is still a lot of work to be done before we could consider sending astronauts up with a very big coil of rope .
At the moment the analysis is simplified and does n't take into account the rotation of the asteroid , or how the tether would be connected to the asteroid .
French says that although some of these questions are challenging , they have some ideas how they could be tackled .
" We have n't answered all the questions that would arise in the course of implementing this technique .
But , having established this concept as viable , we invite the broader scientific community to help us solve such problems . "

Israel wants Russia to dance to its tune
“ Stop supporting terrorist groups and giving weapons to the rogue states , ” Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said during his official visit to Moscow .
The leader of the Yisrael Beiteinu Party , whose electorate mainly consists of immigrants from the former Soviet Union , stated that Israel would otherwise ruin the Middle East regulation conference .
Israel wants Russia to dance to its tune
Lieberman ’s visit to Moscow lasts from June 1 to June 3 .
The Russian - speaking official will have meetings with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev .
What does Lieberman want in Russia ?
Pravda .
Ru asked this question to Israeli political blogger Ilya Dubinsky .
“ Lieberman will try to prove that Moscow ’s ties with Hamas and Hezbollah administrations cause damage to the peaceful regulation of the conflict in the Middle East .
The second question is connected with Russia ’s defense links with the countries that support terrorist groups – Iran and Syria , first and foremost .
Israel is highly concerned about Russia ’s arms deals with these countries because Kornet anti-tank systems , which Russia sold to Syria , were later found in Lebanon in the hands of Hezbollah fighters , ” Dubinsky said .
Lieberman will thus try to convince Russia of the need to put an end to any arms deals with Iran and Syria , which run Israel - unfriendly politics .
First and foremost , it goes about the delivery of Russia ’s S -300 systems to Iran and Iskander missile complexes to Syria .
It is worthy of note that Lieberman will travel to Belarus after he completes his visit to Russia .
He will visit Minks , Belarus ’s capital , for two days to meet the country ’s President Alexander Lukashenko .
It will be the first visit of a top Israeli politician to Belarus in ten years .
Tel Aviv is seriously concerned about the fact that Belarus has been developing ties with the rogue states too .
The Israeli administration believes that Belarus is willing to participate in the transit of the S - 300 and Iskander systems from third world countries .
Lieberman will try to talk Lukashenko out of such an opportunity promising a financial profit and closer ties with the European Union .
Lieberman ’s visit to Russia and Belarus is not likely to be productive for Israel .
Russia receives huge profit from the deals with its partners in the Middle East .
Lieberman ’s visit to the two countries takes place on the threshold of the conference for the regulation of the Mideastern crisis .
The conference will take place in Moscow this year .
Lieberman ’s views make the conference pointless .
Several days prior to his visit in Russia , Lieberman released harsh statements about the meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal , which took place on May 23 in Syria ’s Damascus .
Avigdor Lieberman stated that such meetings were legalizing terrorism .
The Israeli foreign minister said that he would ruin the Moscow - based conference for the regulation of the Mideastern crisis if Hamas or Hezbollah officials were going to be involved in the event either directly or by implication .
He also stressed out his negative views about one of the key conditions , which Arabs set out for the peaceful dialogue .
They want Israel to retreat to the borders , which the nation had in 1967 .
Israel seized a part of the Arab territory during the war of 1967 and still keeps some of those territories claiming that the country needs them for security reasons .
It goes about the Golan Heights , which previously belonged to Syria and the lands on the West Bank of Jordan .
Lieberman says that the precedent with the south of Lebanon and the Gaza Strip is enough .
Terrorists used those territories after Israel pulled out from there .
He emphasized that Israel was ready for the peaceful dialogue with the Palestinians only if the latter strictly abide by the Road Map plan , the idea of which appeared in May of 2003 .
The plan stipulated the co-existence of the two states – the State of Israel and the State of Palestine .
All hopes for peace went up in smoke after a series of bloody terrorist acts , which Palestinian terrorists committed in Israel .

The good news : Bank of America has ousted its chief risk officer .
The bad news : Bank of America has replaced her with Greg Curl , who oversaw the acquisition not only of Merrill Lynch but also of Countrywide , which was run fraudulently ( according to the SEC ) by Angelo Mozilo .
Some risk management there .
Curl is a dealmaker , not a risk - management professional ; he ’s also far too close to senior management , and far too invested in prior strategic decisions , to effectively serve in his new role .
The choice of Curl is an atrocious one , and I hope that BofA ’s regulators are making their displeasure known in no uncertain terms .
Update : Matt Goldstein gets a great quote out of a BofA spokesman :
Robert Stickler , a bank spokesman , says people are more than free to question the promotion of Curl but to refer to him as a crony or confidant of Lewis is silly .
“ This just shows how much you do n’t know .
Greg has been Mr. Outsider at the bank for years , ” he said .
Which only raises the question :
What on earth was Mr Outsider doing being charged with buying Countrywide and Merrill ?
As economic conditions deteriorate and unemployment continues to soar , one in nine Americans are now on food stamps .
Moreover , a staggering one of every six dollars of Americans ' income is now coming in the form of a federal or state check or voucher .
One in Nine Americans on Food Stamps
According to the USDA One in nine Americans on food stamps .
One in nine Americans are using federal food stamps to help buy groceries as the country 's deep recession forced another 591,000 people onto the federal anti-hunger program at latest count .
Enrollment jumped 2 percent to 33.2 million people in March , the fourth consecutive month that rolls hit a record , said the Agriculture Department .
The average monthly benefit was $ 113.87 per person .
" It 's tough out there for struggling families and will be for many months to come , " Jim Weill , president of the Food Research and Action Center , said .
In 20 states , as many as one in eight are on the food stamp program , according to the Food Research Center .
Benefit Spending Accounts for 16.2 % of Personal Income
The recession is driving the safety net of government benefits to a historic high , as one of every six dollars of Americans ' income is now coming in the form of a federal or state check or voucher .
Benefits , such as Social Security , food stamps , unemployment insurance and health care , accounted for 16.2 % of personal income in the first quarter of 2009 , the Bureau of Economic Analysis reports .
That 's the highest percentage since the government began compiling records in 1929 .
In all , government spending on benefits will top $ 2 trillion in 2009 — an average of $ 17,000 provided to each U.S. household , federal data show .
Benefits rose at a 19 % annual rate in the first quarter compared to the last three months of 2008 .
The recession caused about half of the increase , according to the report .
Unemployment insurance nearly tripled in the past year .
The other half is the result of policies enacted during President George W. Bush 's first term .
" The increase in social spending is still relatively modest given the severity of the downturn , " says economist Dean Baker of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research .
" We 're not France . "
Adam Lerrick , economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , says the benefits ' explosion will eventually lead to an economic crisis .
" We 've seen this movie before in many countries .
It always has the same ending , " he says .
Nevada , Michigan and California had the biggest per-capita increase in bankruptcy filings in May , according to AACER .
California Unemployment Fund Short By Billions
California is paying out so much for jobless benefits and collecting so little in payroll taxes that its unemployment insurance fund could be $ 17.8 billion in debt by the end of 2010 , according to a new report from the state Employment Development Department .
This latest fiscal crisis wo n't immediately affect the 1.1 million Californians now collecting benefits because the state is using an interest - free federal loan to cover their checks .
But the state is supposed to repay that loan and restore its unemployment fund to solvency by 2011 - and right now , policymakers are n't sure exactly how to do that , or at what cost .
" The deficit that California looks like it is facing is staggering , " said Bud Bridger , fiscal officer for the unemployment insurance program .
To rebalance the system and pay back the federal loan , lawmakers must raise payroll taxes on employers , reduce benefits for recipients , or both .
In 2009 and 2010 , the state expects to pay out $ 29 billion in benefits .
It will collect just $ 11 billion .
Alicia Trost , spokeswoman for state Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg , D - Sacramento , said legislative leaders met with business and labor officials Monday to discuss the unemployment issue , but it took a back seat to more pressing problems .
" We 're going to have to address it , " Trost said .
" But the most important thing now is to close the current budget shortfall . "

Recently , we visited MSR Cambridge ( UK ) to meet some of the great minds working there .
In this case , we were fortunate enough to get an hour 's time with Simon Peyton - Jones and Tim Harris , who are researchers working on a very hard problem : making it easier ( more predictable , more reliable , more composable ) to write concurrent applications in this the age of Concurrency ( multi - core is a reality , not a dream ) .
