Federal Jury Convicts High Ranking Web Site Administrator in Peer - to - Peer Piracy Crackdown
WASHINGTON - A federal jury in Big Stone Gap , Va. , convicted Daniel Dove , 26 , formerly of Clintwood , Va. , on one count each of conspiracy and felony copyright infringement , Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich announced today .
Dove was an administrator for EliteTorrents.org , an Internet piracy site that , until May 25 , 2005 , was a source of infringing copyrighted works , specifically pre-release movies .
Elite Torrents used BitTorrent peer - to - peer ( P2P ) technology to distribute pirated works to thousands of members around the world .
The jury was presented with evidence that Dove was an administrator of a small group of Elite Torrents members known as " Uploaders , " who were responsible for supplying pirated content to the group .
The evidence showed that Dove recruited members who had very high - speed Internet connections , usually at least 50 times faster than a typical high - speed residential Internet connection , to become Uploaders .
The evidence also showed that Dove operated a high - speed server , which he used to distribute pirated content to the Uploaders .
The case is the first criminal conviction after jury trial for P2P copyright infringement .
Dove ’s conviction is the eighth conviction resulting from Operation D - Elite , a nationwide federal crackdown against the illegal distribution of copyrighted movies , software , games and music over P2P networks employing the BitTorrent file distribution technology .
Operation D - Elite targeted leading members of a technologically sophisticated P2P network known as Elite Torrents .
The jury was presented with evidence that , at its height , the Elite Torrents group attracted more than 125,000 members and facilitated the illegal distribution of approximately 700 movies , which were downloaded more than 1.1 million times .
Evidence presented to the jury also established that massive amounts of high - value software , video games and music were made available to members of the Elite Torrents group .
The wide variety of content selection included illegal copies of copyrighted works before they were available in retail stores or movie theaters .
At sentencing , which is scheduled for Sept. 9 , 2008 , Dove faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison .
The investigation was conducted by the FBI field offices in San Diego and Richmond , Va. , with significant assistance from the CyberCrime Fraud Unit , Cyber Division at FBI Headquarters in Washington , D.C. The Motion Picture Association of America provided substantial assistance to the D - Elite investigation .
The case was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Tyler G. Newby of the Criminal Division ’s Computer Crime & Intellectual Property Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay V. Prabhu for the Eastern District of Virginia , with assistance from the U.S. Attorney ’s Office for the Western District of Virginia .

Not content with torturing us with Tom Cruise bouncing up and down on Oprah ’s couch and also lecturing us on what manic depression is REALLY about ( thanks Tom for giving me the “ truth ” about my illness ) , the Church of Scientology has apparently decided it now needs a bigger platform and so it has set up shop on YouTube .
Oh dear God .
And so starting from now , if you want your daily dose of brainwashing , you can just head on over to the Scientology YouTube Channel .
So far , no sign of Tom , but he ’s probably just hiding in the closet .
But it seems that the Scientologists do n’t tolerate free speech because they have disabled commenting on ALL their YouTube videos .
They also do n’t seem to want their content to be spread around the net because they have also disabled the “ embed ” feature for most of their videos .
A damn shame .
I wonder what they ’re afraid of ?
People ’s real opinions of them perhaps ?
“ I ’m staying in this race until there is a nominee , and obviously I ’m going to work as hard as I can to become that nominee , ” Mrs. Clinton said after an event in Shepherdstown , W.Va .
As adamant as Mrs. Clinton appeared on Wednesday , several advisers said that how long she would stay in the race was an open question .
Some top Clinton fund - raisers said that the campaign was all but over and suggested that she was simply buying time on Wednesday to determine if she could raise enough money and still win over superdelegates , the elected officials and party leaders who could essentially hand Mr. Obama the nomination .
Highlighting the financial woes of Mrs. Clinton ’s expensive battle against Mr. Obama , campaign officials disclosed that the $ 6 million in loans she made to her campaign had come in three installments since April 11 , with the last two since May 1 .
Mrs. Clinton and her husband made a separate $ 5 million loan to the campaign after the Feb. 5 contests .
Mrs. Clinton is willing to put even more money into her campaign , said Terry McAuliffe , her campaign chairman .
“ Senator Clinton has anted up and is fighting on , ” Mr. McAuliffe said .
Other advisers said in interviews that her campaign was nearly out of cash , raising questions about what kind of campaign she can continue to run .
The campaign said , however , that it was running advertisements in West Virginia and in Oregon , which has its primary on May 20 .
Clinton advisers said they were concerned that the candidate ’s online fund - raising , which boomed after her victory in the Ohio primary in March and in Pennsylvania in April , had slowed by comparison on Tuesday night and Wednesday , and that her donor base was either tightening somewhat or playing wait - and - see , despite her public appeal for money on Tuesday night .
Clinton aides did not send out the near - hourly e-mail blasts bragging about online donations that came after previous successes .
Sadly it turned out to be no more than a seven - day wonder .
On April 20 Vera Baird , the solicitor general , appeared entirely definite .
The assumption in our law of succession that a man trumps a woman , that a younger son should take the throne ahead of an older sister , was a " load of rubbish " , and the government was about to sweep it away .
Few declarations by a minister in the course of Gordon Brown 's premiership can have commanded such backing .
A poll for the Daily Telegraph found 78 % in favour of change and a mere 12 % defending the present arrangements - arrangements which may have made sense in times when Henry V stiffened English sinews on the eve of Harfleur , but today are simply a picturesque but indefensible hangover .
It is even known that the Queen is sympathetic - this was ascertained when the Conservative peer Jeffrey Archer introduced a bill to just this effect a decade ago .
It is hardly surprising that the Queen should approve of such a move .
She is no second - best monarch .
Even open - minded republicans acknowledge she has served Britain well .
Yet had she had a brother , she would not have been permitted to do so .
Just as a man trumps a woman in the law of succession , so an attorney general trumps a solicitor general , and last week Ms Baird 's superior , Baroness Scotland , ruled out any immediate change .
There will still be a single equality bill drafted this year , but this reform wo n't be in it .
Not that Lady Scotland ruled out reform altogether ; it was the timescale that worried her .
Changing the law would be complex ; it would mean the repeal or amendment of much other legislation .
And the Commonwealth would have to be asked .
All of which may be true , but one might have thought that only a government exclusively manned by reactionary Tories would have left it at that .
The arguments marshalled against this change endearingly echo those summoned up by diehards in the face of other necessary , belated and soon uncontroversial reforms , from the 1832 reform bill through the battles over votes for women to the end of the all - hereditary and almost all - male House of Lords .
Tamper at your peril , they say .
You risk disturbing that delicate balance on which our national welfare depends .
There are factors here that go beyond the mere dictates of logic .
Warning against such a change , the historian Andrew Roberts quoted Bagehot 's warning against letting daylight in upon magic .
Perhaps that is why such a necessary and healthful change is so feared in such quarters : the more you let in the daylight , they calculate with a shudder , the more people may wonder what logical case can be made for keeping kings and queens in the 21st century .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. gasoline prices will peak at a record average $ 4.10 a gallon later this month thanks to surging world crude oil prices , adding pressure to an already troubled U.S. economy , the government ’s top energy forecaster said on Monday .
Guy Caruso , director of the Office of Market Analysis for U.S. Energy Information Administration , speaks during the Reuters Global Energy Summit in New York June 2 , 2008 .

The price spike will cut into energy consumption in the United States , but not enough to pull back the price of oil below $ 100 a barrel any time soon , Guy Caruso , the head of the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) , told the Reuters Global Energy Summit in New York .
“ We still have some pass - through ( to the gasoline pump ) of the higher crude oil prices that we ’ve seen now over the last number of weeks , ” Caruso said .
“ If the crude oil prices stay around $ 120 , $ 125 , it looks like ( gasoline ) might be somewhere in the $ 4.10 area . ”
The price of crude oil accounts for about 73 percent of the cost of making gasoline .
“ The biggest ( factor ) is the crude oil price , ” he said .
The national pump price jumped almost 4 cents over the last week to $ 3.98 a gallon , up 82 cents from a year ago , the EIA said on Monday in its weekly survey of service stations .
The West Coast has the most expensive gasoline at $ 4.17 a gallon , up 14 cents .
San Francisco had the highest city price at $ 4.24 , also up 14 cents .
The Gulf Coast states had the lowest regional price at $ 3.85 a gallon , up 2 cents .
Houston had the lowest pump price , up 1.4 cents at $ 3.80 .
The higher fuel price will further reduce overall domestic oil demand , according to Caruso .
He said the EIA will lower its estimate for U.S. oil demand this year by 10,000 barrels a day when the agency releases its new monthly energy forecast next week .
“ We ’ll revise it down a little bit , ” he said , just like the EIA has done with every monthly demand forecast so far this year .
However , he cautioned that the numbers for the agency ’s June report are not finalized yet .
The EIA also plans to lower its projection for growth in oil supplies this year from non-OPEC countries .
Caruso said non-OPEC oil levels will be “ very disappointing ” due to a drop in Russian oil production and a “ steeper ” fall in Mexican output .
“ You ’ve got this global market still operating at very low spare ( oil production ) capacity , all of which is in Saudi Arabia , ” he said .
At the same time , demand in developing countries will remain strong , helping to keep oil prices above $ 100 a barrel this year and in 2009 , according to Caruso .
“ We ’re still going to be at this 1.2 million barrels a day growth this year in world demand , all outside of ( industrialized ) countries , ” he said .
“ We ’re ( industrialized nations ) an important part of the world market , but others are increasingly important as well . ”
Caruso said oil demand from Middle East countries should be up by 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day this year due to stronger economies fed by profitable oil exports .
Oil demand in China has been particularly strong and will be even higher after many coal - powered electric plants were damaged by the country ’s recent earthquake and more distillate fuel is used for running portable electric generators , Caruso said .
After this summer ’s Olympics , he said China ’s oil demand should fall .
“ I do n’t think it ’s the kind of thing that ’s going to move the market .
We ’re talking about probably , you know , less than 100,000 barrels a day , ” Caruso said .

Drive to produce injury - proof car
Posted
Apr. 30 - Swedish car giant Volvo sets a target to eliminate death and injury in its vehicles by 2020 .
PR
ソフトウエア開発の経験が全くない素人集団を率いて、100％外注に頼っていた、基幹業務を支えるソフトウエアを内製に切り替えるプロジェクトに取り組んだ。この時の経験から言うと、ゼロからのスタートであっても、5年間真剣に取り組めば、ソフトウエアを自社内で開発・維持する体制を構築できる。現在、本業そのものを支えるソフトウエアに関してまで安易な外注が進んでいる。基幹部分は他人任せにせず、当事者が自らの手で内製できる力を持つべきである。
「 交換機を作っているコンピュータ・メーカーに、交換機のソフトウエアを自分たちの手で作りたいと言ったら、『我々が手を引いたらNTTなんて成り立ちませんよ。お分かりなんですか』と脅されたよ。頭に来たな。石井君、どう思う。今のままでいいのか」
日本電信電話公社の真藤恒総裁は初対面の私にこうまくし立てた。電電公社が民営化され、NTTになる直前のことである。大阪の現場にいた私は総裁室へ呼び出され、民営化と同時にソフトウエアの内製化を進めるように言われた。
電電公社時代、通信サービスの中核を担う交換機のソフトウエア開発や保守は事実上すべてコンピュータ・メーカー任せであった。石川島播磨重工業（IHI）の経営トップを経て電電公社総裁に就任した真藤氏が驚き、怒ったのは、交換機が故障するたびにメーカーの担当者に連絡する公社職員の姿であった。
メーカーへの丸投げについては私も「これでいいのか」と思っていたため、真藤総裁にこう答えた。「現在のところは、メーカーの言う通りかもしれません。しかしソフトウエアの内製に挑戦してみるべきです」。こうして無謀にもソフトウエア内製化を引き受けてしまった。1985年4月、NTTの誕生と同時に、「中央ソフトウェアセンタ」が設置され、私は所長に就任した。
真藤総裁がソフトウエアの内製化を言い出した直接のきっかけは、交換機の故障を自分たちで直せないと知ったことだと思っていた。ただし、民営化後、NTT社長になってから話を聞いてみると「世の中の隅々までにコンピュータが組み込まれ、社会活動すべてが、ある意味でソフトウエアオリエンテッドで動いていくようになる」という考えがあってのことだった。
「 ものづくり」とはおよそ無縁で、組織風土的にみると官業的色彩の強い電気通信運営会社のトップが「通信産業の将来はソフトウエア無くして成り立たない」という強い信念の下に、社内に社業の根幹を担う通信ソフトウエアの完全内製部門を創設したのである。船舶というハードウエアの技術者であった真藤氏だが「NTTの社長なんかよりソフトウエアの方をやりたいよ」と時折漏らすなど、ソフトウエア開発には強い思い入れを持っていた。
筆者は幸運にもソフトウエア内製化の責任を負うポストを与えられた。中央ソフトウェアセンタの発足当時の陣容は78人。ハード設計経験者が一部いたものの、リーダーから担当者にいたる全員がソフトウエア開発という点では全くの素人であり、多難な船出となった。しかし、スタートして5年目に入った1989年には全国6カ所に分散した開発拠点をTCP/IPを搭載したワークステーションで結んだ、その当時としてはユニークな分散型のソフトウエア開発環境を構築し、これらをフル活用した完全内製化体制を築き上げることができた。
最近の情勢などをかんがみながら、かつての経験の中で得た教訓を振り返り、「日本のソフトウエア開発力」の健全な発展を願って、私見を書いてみたい。はじめにお断りしておくがこれはセンチメンタルジャーニーではない。現在にも、いや、アウトソーシングが常態となった現在にこそ通じる教訓と思っている。
私は日本のソフトウエア開発における最大の問題点は安易な外注化にあるとみている。顧客に価値を提供する事業体は、製造業、サービス業、金融業など業種を問わず、本業を支える中核のソフトウエアを内製できる力を持つべきと考える。そしてその力はゼロからであっても築けると信じている。
プロ意識を持って内製化に挑む
真藤総裁からソフトウエア内製化の話を聞いた当時、「これは大変なことになるな」と思ったことを記憶している。それでもやるべきだと思ったのは、入社当時の経験が大きかった。
私はもともとハードウエアの技術者である。電電公社へ入った直後、通信機器の回路設計に携わる部署に配属になった。1958年のことである。当時の電電公社には「技術」があった。それも、ものづくりの技術があった。例えば電話事業に使う機器の回路は自前で設計していた。クロスバー交換機の回路をすべて設計した上で、メーカーに製造を委託した。つまり中身を完全に理解していたのである。
上司にも恵まれた。私の上司は、部下のだれよりも優れた回路設計技術を備えていた。部下が組み立てた電子回路を一目見て、「この抵抗は適切ではない」「コンデンサーは安い電解でよい」などと具体的な指摘をしていた。
この上司は常々 「 回路設計でメシを食っていくなら、プロの技を身につけろ。長嶋茂雄や美空ひばりのように、だれもがさすがと思えるような、回路設計のプロを目指せ」と説いた。これを受けて、技術者は誇りと気概を持って回路設計に臨んでいた。回路の工夫を発表し合う催しもあり、スキルが社内に蓄積していた。「毎日が勉強になる。本当にいいところに入った」と私は充実した日々を過ごしていた。
ところが1969年、電子交換機が登場して以降、こうした良きものづくりの風土が徐々に無くなっていった。電子交換機のLSI設計はメーカー任せになってしまったし、ソフトウエアの開発には全くといってよいほど手を出さなかった。
それまで公社の一部であったのかもしれないが、動く回路を作れる技術者、手を動かせる技術者を評価する文化が確かにあった。それがむしろ、メーカーをうまく使いこなして仕事をさせる、手配上手の技術者を評価するようになっていった。私はこうした風潮に疑問を感じていたので、真藤氏のソフトウエア内製志向に大いに賛同した。
真藤氏が交換機を制御するソフトウエアを自分達の手で開発しようと言い出したときの反応はどうであったか。正直に当時の状況を言えば、社内外から一斉に反発の声が上がった。それも猛反発といってよかった。冒頭で述べたように、コンピュータ・メーカーはNTTに対し、半ば脅かしに近い圧力をかけてきた。メーカーとしては、交換機のソフトウエアの主導権をNTTに取られてしまうと、仕事がやりにくくなると思ったのであろう。
もともと真藤氏と国産メーカーの関係は良好ではなかった。真藤氏が電話交換機の調達についてメスを入れたからだ。従来は電電ファミリーが開発した製品を購入して使うのが当然だったが、いきなり外国製の安価な交換機の導入を決めたりした。「外国の回し者」と産業界や政界から反発の声が上がったが、本人はまったくお構いなしであった。
真藤氏の真意は 「コスト重視型の効率経営に変えていかなければNTTは生き残れない」というものだったように思う。公社時代は規制に守られて、まともな競争を経験したことがなかったものの、将来、通信事業にも規制緩和による競争の波が押し寄せる。そのとき強い企業であるためには、コストを度外視した他社依存型の事業形態ではダメだと考えていたのである。
ソフトウエア内製化への敵はメーカーだけではなかった。20年以上も前の過去の出来事なので書いてもよいだろう。NTT内部の反発も相当なものであった。幹部の多くは「ソフトウエアの内製なんてできるはずがない」「メーカーに頼んで何が悪いのか」と真藤氏の方針に否定的だったのである。とりわけ幹部候補とされる本社採用のエリート社員たちはほぼ一様に、ソフトウエアの内製化に興味を示さなかった。おそらく、失敗したときに責任を取らされるのが怖かったのであろう。
Excerpts from article : No ' reset ' with Ebola outbreak , WHO official says Today the DRC ministry of health confirmed :.. raising ebola ) outbreak totals to 2,031 cases and 1,367 deaths ...
A total of 293 suspected cases are still under investigation , and 130,711 have been vaccinated .
The number of infected healthcare workers remained at 110 .
Vaccine predicted to run out
Yesterday Robert Redfield , MD , the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , told Congress that the world must be prepared for this outbreak to spread internationally , and for vaccine supplies to dwindle , according to a Devex story .
Redfield said vaccine production is being held up by plant validation .
Merck had manufactured the vaccine ..
There are currently about 145,000 doses of the vaccine , too few for a planned broader vaccination campaign ..

The US has ships with aid standing by in the Gulf of Thailand UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has warned of dire consequences if Burma continues to ban most foreign aid workers from its cyclone relief work .
Speaking before the UN launched its $ 187 m ( £ 96 m ) appeal to help those hit by the cyclone , he said early action was needed to prevent catastrophe .
Burma , where the UN fears the death toll could reach 100,000 , says it will accept aid from any quarter .
A Burmese constitutional referendum scheduled for Saturday is going ahead .
Polls opened early on Saturday in all but the worst - affected areas , which will vote on 24 May , and are due to close at 1600 ( 0930 GMT ) .
The country 's ruling generals say the referendum will pave the way for democratic elections in 2010 , while the opposition says it is intended to tighten the generals ' rule .
People were voting in small numbers , correspondents say
They have been criticised for their handling of the crisis in which officially 23,335 people were killed and 37,019 are missing .
The cyclone left towns flattened , infrastructure destroyed and 5,000 sq km ( 1,930 sq miles ) of farmland in the Irrawaddy delta under water and littered with dead bodies .
There are reports that a senior general over - rode requests from his officers to divert army resources to help the cyclone victims - in order to maintain security for the poll .
Reporting on the referendum from Hlegu , a town 48 km ( 30 miles ) north of Rangoon , the Associated Press says turnout has been very light , with people coming to polling stations in small groups and no sign of long queues .
One voter , retired soldier Nyo Aye , said he had voted Yes even though he had not read the constitution .
" The government would not do anything inappropriate or bad for the country , " the 65 - year - old said .
Groups involved in last year 's pro-democracy protests accused the junta of concentrating on a " sham constitutional referendum " instead of " putting all resources toward saving the lives " of cyclone victims .
No contact Aid agencies already in Burma say they have been doing what they can but are frustrated by the government 's reluctance to allow international aid teams into the country and its insistence on distributing aid itself .
The sheer survival of the affected people is at stake

World wrestles with aid issue
Why vote trumps storm for junta
The UN believes as many as 1.5 million people could have been affected by Cyclone Nargis , which struck on 3 May , and many say Burma does not have the capacity to respond adequately on its own .
Two BBC correspondents who have travelled to the Irrawaddy delta say tens of thousands of bodies are strewn across the landscape , with houses toppled and trees uprooted .
They say diseases like dysentery are already starting to take hold , and although some aid has arrived there is still no relief effort to match the size of the catastrophe .

Advertisement Mr Ban warned that lives of the survivors could be at risk if the military leaders refused international aid .
" If early action is not taken and relief measures put in place , the medium - term effect of this tragedy could be truly catastrophic , " he said .
" The sheer survival of the affected people is at stake .
"
Mr Ban says he has not been able to get through to the country 's leaders to speak to them directly .
Obstacles The World Food Programme says it is in talks with the government after tonnes of aid it flew into Burma was impounded by the military authorities who wanted to control its distribution .

The UN agency threatened to suspend relief flights , but later said they would resume on Saturday , while negotiations continued .
The Burmese UN envoy , Ambassador Kyaw Tint Swe , said the first US relief flight was expected to arrive on Monday .
He said that his country was ready to accept help from any quarter .
Other aid has been flown in from Burma 's allies , such as China and Thailand , and Burma - based aid workers have been distributing food and emergency aid where possible .

BOSTON ( AP ) -- Jon Lester has survived cancer and pitched a World Series clincher for the Boston Red Sox .
Now he can add a no-hitter to his already amazing list of accomplishments .
The 24 - year - old lefty shut down Kansas City 7 - 0 Monday night for the first no-hitter in the majors since Red Sox rookie Clay Buchholz threw one last September .
It was Lester 's first major league complete game .
And what a way to do it .
" You do n't feel tired in that situation .
You 've got so much adrenaline going , " he said .
" I 'm sure it will hit me in the morning . "
Lester ( 3 - 2 ) allowed just two baserunners , walking Billy Butler in the second inning and Esteban German to open the ninth ; he also had an error when he threw away a pickoff attempt .
Lester struck out nine , fanning Alberto Callaspo to end the game before pumping both fists in the air .
Catcher Jason Varitek , who has been behind the plate for a record four no-hitters , lifted his pitcher into the air .
Manager Terry Francona gave a long , hard embrace to Lester , who missed the end of the 2006 season after he was diagnosed with a rare form of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
" I 've been through a lot the last couple of years .
He 's been like a second dad to me , " Lester said .
" It was just a special moment right there . "
Center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury made a diving catch of Jose Guillen 's line drive to end the fourth -- the best defensive play of the night .
Lester also got help from first baseman Kevin Youkilis , who made a nice scoop on shortstop Julio Lugo 's throw after David DeJesus hit a grounder in the third .
The fans at sold - out Fenway Park held their enthusiasm until the final out of the seventh , rising to their feet when Lester fanned Guillen on a 93 mph fastball .
They remained standing for the entire ninth inning , even as German walked and moved around to third base when Tony Pena and DeJesus grounded out .
With cameras flashing and the fans screaming at full throat , Callaspo fell behind 0 - 2 .
He took a ball and fouled one off before reaching for a high and outside 1 - 2 fastball to end the game .
" I was trying to do what I could do , " Callaspo said .
" You had to ... try to get the bat on the ball . "
Lester and Varitek were mobbed by teammates running out of the dugout as the speakers played " Tessie , " the victory anthem the Red Sox adopted through two World Series titles in four seasons .
Lester was instrumental in the second , less than a year after chemotherapy cured his cancer , when he earned the victory in Game 4 at Colorado to complete the Red Sox sweep .
Gun rights equals gay rights - who knew ?
From the Times :
SAN FRANCISCO — Using the new judicial muscle provided by the Supreme Court ’s affirmation of the right to bear arms , the National Rifle Association and another pro-gun group sued San Francisco and its housing authority on Friday to invalidate a ban on handguns in public housing .
... In an interesting turn in a city known for its embrace of gay rights , the chief plaintiff in the suit against the city is a gay man living in a public housing development , owned by the federal government , who wants to have a gun to protect himself from potential hate crimes .
...
A city of about 725,000 , San Francisco has 12,000 residents living in public housing , all of whom are required to sign a lease that forbids a broad variety of weapons , including pistols , revolvers , rifles , shotguns , automatic rifles , BB guns , as well as nunchucks , brass knuckles and stun guns .
This blanket ban was begun in 2006 , and the penalty for violation of the lease is eviction .
In the case filed on Friday , an anonymous gay man said that stipulation had deprived him of “ any effective means of self - defense . ”
Shortly after coming aboard here one of the first things I did was set up a filter to capture and set aside Jack Thompson 's bullshit from all the tips cc'd to me .
After the preamble to his professional obituary two weeks ago , I went back looking through the " Crazy Fucker " queue to see if I could find some kicking - and - screaming ravings that , even if they did n't deserve to run under the Kotaku nameplate , would at least be fun to read .
Instead , I found something unexpected .
Advertisement
It was a news release from mid-May , and in it , Jack was up to his usual schtick of making hay off others ' misery - in this case claiming a murder defendant in North Carolina was motivated by Grand Theft Auto of course .
But the story Thompson was citing was published in Fayetteville , by a paper I interned for 15 years ago .
And it was written by my housemate that year , a friend and a guy who introduced me to some excellent video games himself .
So I emailed the writer , Paul Woolverton of The Fayetteville ( N.C. )
Observer , to dig deeper into this story .

Here 's the backstory : James Christopher Stitt , 22 , shot to death a soldier and his girlfriend in 2005 .
There was apparently little trouble proving his culpability .
The defense put its efforts into sparing Stitt from the death penalty , focusing on Stitt 's emotionally disturbed past , such as the fact his father kicked him out at age 16 , putting him in the kind of drifter 's life that led him to move in with this unfortunate couple .
During the sentencing phase , the psychiatrist the defense team hired testified Stitt claimed he was in a state where he was not in control of his actions at the time .
Stitt claimed to have played Grand Theft Auto for four hours prior to the murder .
Before his arrest , Stitt told a different version to his girlfriend that did not mention video games at all .
Stitt said the murders stemmed from an argument he'd had that turned violent , and was watching television right before the killings .
I 'm sure we 'll find out later it was an infomercial for a Manhunt 2 - themed timeshare .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
This was enough for Thompson , of course , who littered our inbox with a release claiming a video - game defense won the day .
It almost reads like an exoneration .
" Part of Stitt 's defense was his obsessive play of the Grand Theft Auto video games , and it worked , " Thompson crowed .
" It was put before the jury in a very clever fashion , and it worked . "
Is that really what did it ?
" [ The psychiatrist ] never said there was a connection between the game playing and the shootings .
No one asked her if there was a connection , and no one suggested or implied it , " Paul wrote me .
" In the course of the trial , her statement of the midnight to 4 a .m. hours was the only evidence of Stitt ever playing any video game in his entire life .
Had he played video games before ?
Probably .
But if video games were being offered as a defense or mitigator , I think we would have heard a lot more . "
Advertisement
That means whatever Stitt told his professional examiner - again , hired by his own defense - about video games , she did not find enough basis that they were a credibile mitigator for his actions .
In their closing arguments to the jury , Stitt 's lawyers never mentioned video games .
The psychiatrist herself never said she believed the games put Stitt into a state where he was not in control of his actions .
She testified that she even questioned whether Stitt was telling the truth in that version of the killings .
As for the jurors , many left the court in tears .
The lawyers spoke to them , but not the journalists .
The lawyers did n't ask what the reasons were for sparing Stitt the death penalty .
Advertisement
So here 's the scorecard :
Stitt : Convicted double murderer .
Invoked video games and a feeling he was not in control of his actions to save his ass from the death penalty .
Honestly , I think he said Grand Theft Auto because it was the first thing that popped into his mind , in a setting where he knew he was trying for a psychiatric defense .
Had he actually played , he would have specified the version .
I 'm serious .
Anyway , he 's going to do life and die behind the walls of Raleigh 's Central Prison .

Thompson : Moral opportunist who portrays the fact a jury put a murderer away for life but did not sentence him to death as equivalent to an exoneration and miscarriage of justice .
That 's classy .
Death or nothing for the anti-( virtual ) violence crusader .
Completely ignores what has and has not been established by evidence and testimony - in other words , basic law .
No wonder he can't file a motion without adult supervision .
One blames video games to save his ass ; the other to further a nutball agenda .
They deserve each other .

As for Paul , he no longer games as much since his girlfriend moved in .
He and I played X - Wing and Red Baron on his PC when I lived in his house in 1993 .
After that summer he played Thief 1 , Thief 2 , Tanarus and Duke Nukem 3D .
He 's never owned a game console and does n't care to ; he 's waiting to get a decent Windows PC to get back into gaming seriously .
Paul also noted , dryly , that a recent survey rated Fayetteville the third - worst place in the U.S. to raise a child .
So you could blame that , or you could blame Grand Theft Auto .
Or you could blame the fact that we are a fucked - up ultraviolent society with easy access to deadly weapons , and while violent video games are a part of that stew , we 've had senseless killings well before their arrival .

Fear And Loathing
In Iraq , Halliburton Style Posted by Pile ( 12015 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Beating Dead Horses ]
Theft , hookers , melting down Iraqi gold to make cowboy spurs — all in a day 's work for private military contractors in Iraq ?
Allegations of widespread mismanagement and corruption among private contractors in Iraq are nothing new ; if anything , tales of cronyism , over - billing , and embezzlement have become so frequent that our national tolerance for them seems only to have increased as the Iraq War has drawn on .
Even so , the testimony earlier this week of three whistleblowers before the Senate 's Democratic Policy Committee ( DPC ) stands out for the sheer outrageousness of their accusations — namely that U.S. private contractors looted Iraqi palaces and ministries , stole military equipment , fenced supplies destined for U.S. troops , and even operated a prostitution ring that may have contributed to the death of fellow contractor .
Yet despite its focus on such salacious matters as sex and corruption , the session earned little media attention .
The first to testify was Frank Cassaday , a former KBR employee who worked as an ice plant operator in Fallujah in 2004 and 2005 .
" Ice was a very valuable commodity in Iraq that was regularly stolen and bartered for other goods , " he told the committee .
He recalled how a convoy of U.S. Marines , in preparation for an operation that would take them outside the wire for several days , requested 28 bags of ice to keep their food fresh in the desert heat .
They received only three .
" The ice foreman was cheating the troops out of ice at the same time that he was trading the ice for DVDs , CDs , food , and other items at the Iraqi shops across the street , " Cassaday said .
" This foreman would change the ice tally sheets at the distribution area I worked in to make it seem as though we had handed out more ice to the Marines than we actually did . "
Cassaday said he later observed his colleagues returning to KBR 's camp with equipment they had stolen from the U.S. military , including refrigerators , artillery round detonators , two rocket launchers , and about 800 rounds of small arms ammunition .
After he informed the KBR camp manager of the thefts , Marines searched the camp with dogs to recover the stolen property .
For his trouble , Cassaday said , KBR security officers jailed him in his tent for two days .
He then spent another four days in " protective custody " before being transferred , against his will , to work in a laundry .
The practice of stealing equipment and supplies destined for the U.S. military was so pervasive that KBR employees invented a slang term to describe it : " drug deals . "
But thefts were not limited to military supplies , said Linda Warren , another former KBR employee who testified at the hearing .
Upon her arrival in Baghdad in 2004 , she was shocked by the number of contractors involved in criminal activity .
" KBR employees who were contracted to perform construction duties inside palaces and municipal buildings were looting , " she said .
" Not only were they looting , but they had a system in place to get contraband out of the country so it could be sold on eBay .
They stole artwork , rugs , crystal , and even melted down gold to make spurs for cowboy boots . "
Like Cassaday , when she complained to her superiors about the thefts , she was punished .
She said her vehicle was taken away , her movements were closely monitored , and her access to phones and the Internet were cut off .
Eventually , she was transferred out of Baghdad .

Surveillance cameras make TTC riders feel safer and the plan to dramatically expand their numbers is okay with Ann Cavoukian , Ontario 's privacy commissioner .
Installing 11,000 cameras on buses , streetcars , subway cars and in stations complies with privacy standards , Cavoukian said yesterday when she released the results of her investigation .
But the TTC must make some changes to ensure the network of seeing eyes is used only for legitimate purposes and never for voyeurism , as has happened in other cities , she said .
Cavoukian urged that the TTC :
The recommendations are meant to balance the legitimate needs for transit system safety and passenger privacy , Cavoukian stated .
TTC chair Adam Giambrone endorsed her findings and said his staff will be coming back with a plan for implementing them .
Privacy International , the London - based organization whose complaint trigged Cavoukian 's investigation , was less pleased .
" It is clear ... the Commissioner has given up the ghost of privacy and become resigned to the inevitability of video surveillance technology , " the group said on its website .
The group argues there is no public - interest justification for the $ 21 million security system .
The TTC now has cameras operating in all stations and 300 buses .
By 2011 , there will be more than 11,000 blanketing the system .
Privacy International should worry less about Toronto and more about the 4.2 million cameras in its own backyard , Cavoukian said .
In London , as in New York and Washington , the video feed is monitored live by an operator who can move the camera as needed .
The TTC 's cameras are fixed in one position , and while ticket - takers have monitors in their booths , there is no one dedicated to watching the screen full - time , Giambrone said .

U.K. camera operators " have entertained themselves by zooming in on certain physical attributes of young women , " Cavoukian noted .
She is backing the U of T research into a video surveillance system that would automatically encrypt , or blur , the faces of individuals unless a crime is committed and the visual details are needed .
Foods are often genetically modified to make them more resistant to disease , improve their nutritional value , or increase their ability to grow in different climate conditions .
The Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) and regulates their use .
There are some studies that show that these foods can be harmful to your health and our environment but there is a general scientific agreement that food from genetically modified crops is not inherently riskier to human health than conventional food [ 1 ] .
Many foods we eat may contain ingredients derived from GMOs , and you should decide how comfortable you are with consuming them .
If you live in Europe , avoiding GM foods is easier , since laws require labeling .
In the U.S. and Canada , however , food manufacturers are not required to label their food as genetically modified or not .

This Friday , I ’ll be speaking at the Webvisions conference in Portland about Internet memes , how they spread , and how their distribution ’s changed over time .
As part of that research , I ’ve been digging into my original server logs from the Star Wars Kid debacle , five years after I played a major role in what some say is the biggest viral video of all - time .
Be warned , this is more detail than you ’ll ever want about the origins of the Star Wars Kid meme and how it spread .
You do n’t care about this level of detail , but I ’m writing this all down so that I never have to think about it again .
In addition , I ’ve decided to release the first six months of server logs from the meme ’s spread into the public domain — with dates , times , IP addresses , user agents , and referer information .
( Download it below . )
Early Origins
Like I mentioned in my original entry , the video was first released by Ghyslain ’s schoolmates to Kazaa on April 19 , 2003 with the original filename “ ghyslain_razaa.wmv . ”
Within three days , it was being passed around in the offices of Raven Software in Madison , Wisconsin , where a game developer named Bryan Dube posted it on his personal website on April 22 .
Two days later , he created the first Star Wars Kid remix , adding lightsabers and sound effects in a new video titled “ TheLastHope.avi . ”
On April 27 , a mostly - NSFW online community called Sensible Erection linked to the video on Bryan ’s website .
Later that evening , an SE user cross-posted it to a private file - sharing community I belong to with the new filename “ star_wars_guy.wmv . ”
It quickly became the most popular file on the site , which is where I found it the following day , April 28 at 7:52 pm .
On April 29 , I renamed it Star_Wars_Kid.wmv and posted it to my site at 4:49 pm — inadvertently giving the meme its permanent name .
( Yes , I coined the term “ Star Wars Kid . ”
It ’s strange to think it would ’ve been “ Star Wars Guy ” if I was any lazier . )
An hour later , Scott Gowell becomes the first person to link to the video .
From there , for the first week , it spread quickly through news site , blogs and message boards , mostly oriented around technology , gaming , and movies .
Throughout the life of the meme , most of the referers are blank , suggesting people were primarily sending the links by email or instant message .
The chart below shows the distinct top - level domains that appeared in the referral logs grouped by day .
It ’s worth noting that the majority of sites sent less than 10 referers in that first month , and 21 % of domains referred only one user .
( Note : The chart below is on a logarithmic scale for both axes . )
Mainstream News Coverage
Here ’s some of the highlights from the mainstream media coverage .
The New York Times was the first major paper to report on it , almost a week after I tracked Ghyslain down , Jish and I interviewed him for the first time , and we started the fundraiser .

Statistics
Here ’s what the Star Wars Kid meme did to my overall traffic .
At its peak , I received almost a million pageviews in a single day .
That includes all pageviews on my weblog entries .
Isolating only the video downloads from my site , or later redirected to one of the mirrors , gives the following chart .
Download the Data
This file is a subset of the Apache server logs from April 10 to November 26 , 2003 .
It contains every request for my homepage , the original video , the remix video , the mirror redirector script , the donations spreadsheet , and the seven blog entries I made related to Star Wars Kid .
I included a couple weeks of activity before I posted the videos so you can determine the baseline traffic I normally received to my homepage .
The file is 158 megabytes — 1.6GB uncompressed — so I ’m distributing it with BitTorrent .
The data is public domain .

Most of us live in a city of some description .
In fact , approximately 50 % of the world is estimated to living in an urban city environment according to The United Nations ’ State of the World ’s Cities ’06 – ’ 07 .
That ’s 3.3 billion people dispersed across the “ 471 ” urban cities .
( An urban city has a population above 1 million ) .
I have already talked about city migration , so I want to talk about what happens to the environment people live in .
I ’m not talking about the natural environment .
I am referring to the man -made visible urban environment .
I am of course talking about street art .
It is only natural that people want to make a mark on their environment .
We decorate our inner walls with pictures , ornaments , and possessions .
It is not surprising that the artists also decorate their outer urban environment with street art .
I live in quite a densely populated area where if it was n’t for the random street art , it would be a far duller place .
I decided to capture a small sample of the street art in my neighborhood .
I restricted it down to a 2 block radius of my house .
And here is what I got :
These Guys were in doing this piece just outside my house .
And this is a picture of the corner of our house !
Although a Bloomberg article , “ Bernanke Plays ` Dangerous Game ’ Balancing Rate Talk With Action , ” focused on the Fed ’s rate dilemma , it also in passing revealed a sharp difference of opinion on the central bank ’s likely actions later this year between economists and market participants :
While Bernanke ’s warning that the Fed will “ strongly resist ” a jump in inflation expectations led traders to bet on a rate increase , economists are more skeptical .
All 101 in a Bloomberg News survey said the Federal Open Market Committee will keep the benchmark rate unchanged tomorrow and most analysts this month predicted officials will stand pat until 2009 .
“ That ’s the dangerous game , ” said Scott Anderson , senior economist in Minneapolis at Wells Fargo & Co. , the fourth - largest U.S. bank by market value .
“ Instead of putting the shot across the bow on inflation , ” Bernanke might have “ held off a few more months to let the credit crisis heal a little bit more . ” …
There are widespread expectations among traders for a rate rise in the next three months :
There are 36 percent odds of a boost in August and 93 percent in September , according to futures contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade .
The balance of the year will provide an interesting test case of whose needs take precedence as far as the central bank is concerned .
Heretofore , it has seemed almost deathly afraid of disappointing Fed futures expectations .
At the same time , it has also been hyper - responsive to any sign of distress in the financial services industry , leading one wit to observe , “ 75 is the new 25 . ”
Although it ’s generally unwise to side with economists when forecasting is concerned .
the reason for their near - unanimity of opinion is their expectation of continued weakness in the financial sector .
Personally , I think it ’s even worse than that , that new problems will surface ( such as rising woes at regional and smaller banks , renewed difficulties at the large players as the impact of the monoline downgrades ripple through ) .
And if the stresses are visible , or worse , disruptive , the views of the Fed funds traders can turn on a dime .
The wild card here is that the number of open seats on the FOMC gives the bank presidents more say , and they tend to be more vocal and hawkish .
Absent tangible evidence of worsening conditions in the financial services industry , their views will probably prevail
Is n't that special ?
PfAW 's Right Wing Watch :
Normally , people love it when other people link to their websites because it means they get more attention , more traffic , and their message reaches more people , .
But the American Family Association has apparently decided that it does n’t want the kind of attention our Right Wing Watch blog has been sending their way ..
The other day we noticed that all of our links back to the AFA ’s OneNewsNow website no longer take readers to the link in question , but instead redirect them to the Good Person Test ( go ahead and click the OneNewsNow link above or any of these other links to see what we mean . )
So instead of being taken to a specific OneNewsNow article , our readers are directed to a website that challenges them to take a quiz to determine if they are indeed a “ good person . ”
Not surprisingly , the answer is “ no ” and that they are in fact going to hell .

“ I do n’t think they ’ll see anything different , ” she said .
“ This lawsuit never had anything to do with commission rates , or discount brokerages . ”
She added that the lawsuit and the settlement arose from misunderstandings about the way the Realtors ’ association works .
“ This was a five - year education of the Department of Justice , unfortunately , and the real estate industry had to pay for that education , ” she said .
Since the 1990s , online real estate brokers have offered a popular and cheaper alternative to the bricks - and - mortar variety .
But such brokers , known in the industry as “ virtual office Web sites , ” complain that the industry ’s practices have denied them the chance to make full use of the multiple listing services to determine what homes are for sale .
The agreement between the Justice Department and the Realtors ’ association must be approved by a federal judge , probably this summer .
As now structured , the deal bans the Realtors ’ association from treating online brokers as different from traditional brokers or discriminating against them , and it ensures that they will not be excluded from membership in the listing service based on their business model .
In one instance , the Justice Department said an unnamed online broker was forced to shut down its
Web site because all the traditional brokers on the local listing service , in response to the national association ’s policy , had withheld their listings from the online broker .
After the Justice Department sued the Realtors ’ association in 2005 , the group suspended the exclusionary policy .
Officials said the settlement would ensure that online brokers are given full access and that its policies are made uniform .
“ For us , it ’s a great result , ” said Pat Lashinsky , chief executive of ZipRealty in Emeryville , Calif. , which offers online users rebates of up to 20 percent off standard sales commissions .
“ We think it ’s a great result for consumers . ”
SANTA BARBARA , California ( CNN ) -- Barbara
Harvey climbs into the back of her small Honda sport utility vehicle and snuggles with her two golden retrievers , her head nestled on a pillow propped against the driver 's seat .
Californian Barbara
Harvey says she is forced to sleep in her car with her dogs after losing her job earlier this year .
A former loan processor , the 67 - year - old mother of three grown children said she never thought she 'd spend her golden years sleeping in her car in a parking lot .
" This is my bed , my dogs , " she said .
" This is my life in this car right now . "
Harvey was forced into homelessness this year after being laid off .
She said that three - quarters of her income went to paying rent in Santa Barbara , where the median house in the scenic oceanfront city costs more than $ 1 million .
She lost her condo two months ago and had little savings as backup .
" It went to hell in a handbasket , " she said .
" I did n't think this would happen to me .
It 's just something that I do n't think that people think is going to happen to them , is what it amounts to .
It happens very quickly , too . "
Harvey now works part time for $ 8 an hour , and she draws Social Security to help make ends meet .
But she still cannot afford an apartment , and so every night she pulls into a gated parking lot to sleep in her car , along with other women who find themselves in a similar predicament .
Watch women who live in their cars »
There are 12 parking lots across Santa Barbara that have been set up to accommodate the growing middle - class homelessness .
These lots are believed to be part of the first program of its kind in the United States , according to organizers .
The lots open at 7 p.m. and close at 7 a.m. and are run by New Beginnings Counseling Center , a homeless outreach organization .
It is illegal for people in California to sleep in their cars on streets .
New Beginnings worked with the city to allow the parking lots as a safe place for the homeless to sleep in their vehicles without being harassed by people on the streets or ticketed by police .
Harvey stays at the city 's only parking lot for women .
" This is very safe , and that 's why I feel very comfortable , " she said .
Nancy Kapp , the New Beginnings parking lot coordinator , said the group began seeing a need for the lots in recent months as California 's foreclosure crisis hit the city hard .
She said a growing number of senior citizens , women and lower - and middle - class families live on the streets .
See how foreclosure filings are up 75 percent »
" You look around today , and there are so many , " said Kapp , who was homeless with her young daughter two decades ago .
" I see women sleeping on benches .
It 's heartbreaking . "
She added , " The way the economy is going , it 's just amazing the people that are becoming homeless .
It 's hit the middle class . "
She and others with New Beginnings walk the streets looking for people and families sleeping in their cars .
The workers inform them about the parking lot program .
New Beginnings screens people to make sure they wo n't cause trouble .
No alcohol or drugs are allowed in the parking lots .
" What we are trying to do is we pull bad apples out , and we put good apples in the parking lots and really help people out , " said Shaw Tolley , another coordinator with New Beginnings .
Most of the time , the lots are transition points .
New Beginnings works with each person to try to find a more permanent housing solution .
" It saddens me when they live in their vehicles , " Tolley said .
" It is not the most ideal situation for senior citizens and families , but it is reality . "
He added , " We need to engage this problem .
This is reality . "
John Quigley , an economics professor at the University of California - Berkeley , said the California housing crisis has left many middle - class families temporarily homeless or forced them to go to food banks to feed their families .
" Part of the reason why it 's so painful in Santa Barbara is , there 's so little in the way of alternative housing , " Quigley said .
" If there were alternative low and moderate housing and rental accommodations that were reasonably close by , you can imagine it would n't have this desperate look to it as people living in their cars . "
At the only lot for women in Santa Barbara , it 's a tough existence .
There are no showers or running water .
On the night CNN visited , a half - dozen women were in the parking lot before nightfall .
Linn Labou , 54 , lives in her car with four cats .
She used to be in the National Guard and is on a waiting list for government housing , but the wait is a year long .
" I went looking for family , but I could n't get them to help me , " she said .
As for Harvey , she begins each day by walking her two dogs before going to her part - time job .
She leaves the dogs in her car with its windows cracked while she works .
It 's another chapter in her life that she 's certain she 'll get through .
Her 19 - year - old daughter moved in with friends to avoid being homeless .
Her other children live overseas , and she did n't want to tell them about her living status .
Even if her children offered to help , she said , she would n't accept it .
" They know me well enough to know that I will get through this . "
" My daughter especially is very unhappy .
Sometimes she 'll cry , and she 'll call and say , ' Mom , I just ca n't stand it that you are living in a car , ' " Harvey said .
" I 'll say , ' You know what ?
This is OK for right now , because I 'm safe , I 'm healthy , the dogs are doing OK , and I have a job , and things will get better . ' "

The light of silence
( Nanowerk News ) Scientists have found a way of protecting quantum systems against noise using adaptively shaped pulses of laser light .
Quantum systems are notoriously fragile as interactions with their surroundings disturb them  rather like an orchestra trying to stay in tune in a very noisy environment .
The stability of quantum systems is essential for any engineering at the quantum level .
Now researchers from Ian Walmsleys Ultrafast Group at Oxford Universitys Department of Physics have found a way to prolong the life of a model quantum system .
The advance uses a genetic algorithm to search for a light pulse containing a colour spectrum -  shaped  in phase and amplitude  that when imprinted on a system protects it from decay .
Contrary to what might be expected , the encoded order makes it more robust against disorder .
Matthijs Branderhorst , who did the experiment , explained :  There have been control techniques before to improve stability but they rely on knowing everything about a given system .
The ground - breaking nature of our approach is that , knowing nothing about a system , we can automatically search for and apply a light pulse that makes it more robust .
We have shown an improvement of the stability with our experimental test system , but on other cases it could make it completely immune from decay . 
The model system used by the researchers to study the idea consisted of two potassium atoms bound together .
However , the approach they have developed could be applied to many other kinds of quantum systems such as those influencing chemical reactions , photosynthesis and quantum computation .
NVIDIA GeForce To Quadro Soft - Mod Guide
The NVIDIA Quadro family of professional graphics cards are very , very expensive .
They are generally 2 - 5X more expensive than their gaming counterparts , the NVIDIA GeForce graphics cards .
But everyone knows that Quadro and GeForce graphics cards are virtually identical in hardware .
Yes , you read that right .
Even with the unbelievable price tag , the NVIDIA Quadro is really no different from their desktop GeForce counterparts .
So why is NVIDIA charging you so much for a Quadro ?
It all revolves around the driver support for professional 3D applications like 3ds Max or Maya .
Quadro drivers allow the Quadro to be used to accelerate the rendering operations of such professional 3D applications while GeForce drivers do not .
This is the basis for the premium prices NVIDIA ( and ATI ) charge for their professional - grade graphics cards .
Obviously , you cannot just use Quadro drivers with your GeForce graphics cards .
After all , it represents the thin red line between a really , really fat profit margin and just a " normal " profit margin .
NVIDIA Quadro drivers are designed to detect the presence of an NVIDIA Quadro graphics card .
It will not install if a GeForce card is detected instead .
However , there is an easy way to soft - mod ( modify in software ) a NVIDIA GeForce desktop graphics card into a NVIDIA Quadro professional graphics card .
We will show you just how to do it in this guide .
Some Caveats
Before we start , you need to understand that soft - modding your GeForce card into a Quadro will not improve your graphics card 's gaming performance in any way .
All it does is enable hardware acceleration of professional 3D applications like 3ds Max .
In addition , the soft - mod is not perfect .
Some applications do not support it , thus deriving no benefit from the soft - mod .
We will examine what works and what wo n't work at the end of the article .
There have also been some reports that modded GeForce cards may suffer some drop in gaming performance .
It is not unknown if this is a problem that affects all Quadro cards , or just modded GeForce cards .
It is also not known if the reported problems are really due to the use of older drivers .
To summarize , unless you really need the Quadro 's ability to accelerate the rendering process in a professional 3D application , you should not soft - mod your GeForce graphics card into a Quadro .
Otherwise , read on !

Will national and political interests divide up cloud storage and computing ?
That topic came up while I was attending Interop last month in Las Vegas during a side conversation with an employee of the Canadian government .
He stated that the Canadian government IT organizations were not permitted to use services which stored or hosted the government 's data outside their sovereign territory .
They especially could not use services where data was store in the United States because of fears over the Patriot Act .
Whoa .
That brings up reminders of conflicts governments have introduced to the Internet , such as Google cooperating with the Chinese government .
The same could happen when your data is stored in the cloud .
What does it mean if your data is stored in the cloud and some foreign government entity might have access to it ?
If your business records or personal data were stored in China , would it be subject to access by government officials unbeknown to you ?
Maybe your data is somewhere which you do n't know who might have spying eyes into it .
I 'm trying not to be paranoid or nationalistic here , but this is a topic no one is talking about ... yet .
The Patriot Act or similar future laws could put a damper on organizations willingness to use cloud storage within US borders .
The same can happen within other countries .
I say , the first public example of one of these types of laws being used to access and then prosecute someone will cause a major uproar , here and outside our borders .
So , am I just being paranoid ?
Or is this a real issue .
Post your thoughts .
Dedicated to Truth and Justice , and anything cool .

As the calendar pages turned from 2007 to 2008 , one constant remained for the motion picture and music industries :
The Pirate Bay 's willingness to ignore their threats ( and copyrights ) to the point that the Swedish group 's site has become the go - to destination for torrented content on the Internet .
But there may be dark clouds looming on the horizon for The Pirate Bay .
Swedish prosecutors are close to bringing charges against admins Peter Sunde , Fredrik Neij , and Gottfrid Svartholm .
In May 2006 , Swedish law enforcement officials seized The Pirate Bay 's servers and took a couple of the site 's operators into custody .
They were soon released , and just a couple of days later , the web site for the Swedish national police was taken down by a DDoS attack .
But while the raid may have won Sweden some friends from the world of Big Content , it angered many Swedes .
They were upset about reports that the Swedish government carried out the raid at the behest of the US government .
In fact , many Swedes are nonchalant about copyright , according to the Wall Street Journal ( subscription ) .
A 2006 report showed that 87 percent of all films viewed illegally in Sweden were acquired via P2P networks , rather than via bootlegged physical media ( France was second at 62 percent and the figure is just 34 percent in the US ) , and the Journal describes the country as a " file - sharing free - for - all . "
The antipathy towards copyright enforcement extends far beyond the Pirate Party in Sweden .
Seven members of the Swedish Parliament from the free - market friendly Moderate Party ( which is a member of the governing coalition ) recently penned an op - ed piece in a Swedish tabloid ( English translation ) calling for the complete decriminalization of file - sharing .
" Decriminalizing all non-commercial file sharing and forcing the market to adapt is not just the best solution , " the MPs wrote .
" It 's the only solution , unless we want an ever more extensive control of what citizens do on the Internet . "
That op - ed had to send shudders up the collective spine of the IFPI , which has its own agenda for copyright reform in Europe , one that involves blocking P2P applications and filtering ISP traffic .
No worries
One group that remains unconcerned in the face of possible prosecution is the administrators of The Pirate Bay .
Last November , Peter Sunde told
Ars that , should charges come , he 's sure of a legal victory .
" I 'm quite confident we 're gonna win and I was expecting this to happen , " he said .
" [ Swedish prosecutor Håkan ]
Roswall is also a very biased man , so I 'm glad to take it to court instead of letting him dig around my personal life for no apparent reason .
Actually , it 's kinda funny . "
Time has n't changed his feelings on the charges , as we checked in with the Sunde .
" I 'm quite sure we wo n't be convicted anyhow , " Sunde told Ars today .
" [ If we are ] , we 'll just appeal all the way to the European Union court .
So in five years time this might be settled . "
Sunde also accused Roswall of having a vendetta against The Pirate Bay .
" The prosecutor decided before the raid that he was going to charge us , " Sunde said .
" He has until the last of January to press charges . "
According to Sunde , he and the other potential codefendants just received over 4,000 pages of material related to the investigation from the prosecutors .
" He does n't want us to have enough time to even read through the material .
To compare : the second - biggest murder case in Sweden had 1,500 pages of documentation . "
Even if the case is successfully prosecuted , there may not be much the Swedish government can do to put a crimp in The Pirate Bay 's operations .
Since the 2006 seizure of its servers , the group has made a point of decentralizing its operations ; the tracker site is mirrored on several servers around the world .
So even though a conviction might cost Sunde , Svartholm , and Neij a few kronor , The Pirate Bay is all but certain to keep dishing up links to movies , music , applications , and more .
And , thanks to the threat of a high - profile legal action , plenty of free advertising .

" When you wore this dress , men told you how much you looked like Alexis Smith .
( Or Gene Tierney .
Or Myrna Loy . )
It was a line , but there was a lot of truth to it .
... Women 's sizes : 4 through 16 .
Color : Cream polka dots on Red .
( Note : dots are the size of small garbanzos ; lemur eyes ; hummingbird hearts . ) "
-- J. Peterman in the " Owner 's Manual No. 23 "
" And there , tucked into the river 's bend , was the object of my search .
The Chiang Mai river market .
Fabrics and spices traded under a starlit sky .
It was there that I discovered the Pamplona Beret .
Sizes 7 1/2 to 8 3/4 . Price : $ 35 . "
-- Mr. Peterman , dining with George Costanza on " Seinfeld . "
The first thing that strikes you about John Peterman in the flesh is that he really talks like that .
Like the writer of the now collectible " Owner 's Manual , " this spring in its 23rd edition .
Like the character on " Seinfeld " ( that would be Mr. Peterman ) , played by John O'Hurley .
There he was recently , at the Traditions furniture store in Walnut Creek , nodding toward a piece he calls the Pulpit Bar .
" I 'll tell you how that came about .
This will reveal what I do in church .
I was in Westminster Abbey , sitting in a pew , looking up at the pulpit , with the spiral staircase up to it , and I 'm thinking that would make a great bar .
And that 's the Pulpit Bar . ...
Well , what do you do once you start drinking and standing around the bar ?
You 're in control of the bar , you 're in control of the conversation .
The Pulpit Bar . "
" Price , $ 4,458 , " you want to add for him .
" Delivered in fewer months than it takes to age your home brew . "
Many people are surprised to learn that there exists a real J. Peterman , one who is n't Elaine 's boss ; others remember his heyday , when he built a $ 75 million business on a whimsical catalog and a cowboy duster , and they wonder whatever happened to him .
It 's a long story , best told over the Pulpit Bar , perched comfortably on the Spectator Stool .
The catalog version , with apologies to Peterman : " You finally find it , the object you 've been seeking for so many years , across so many miles .
Then in one cold , hard winter , it 's gone , along with your name .
But you wait patiently , permitting a television sitcom to repeat your name in reruns around the world , until you can buy it back .
$ 1 million .
Now available in furniture . "
Peterman might not strike catalog fans as the kind of guy who'd have any furniture ; every item he sells -- the J. Peterman Coat , the Nantucket Sweater -- has a story about how it was found , and all that finding takes many a flight and hotel room .
But , he says , " I do have a couple of houses ( one in Lexington , Ky. , and another on a farm about an hour north of Lexington ) and I do have furniture and , believe it or not , I am very , very comfortable -- because I 've traveled so much -- being at home .
" There 's a part of traveling around the world that 's interesting -- you go to Italy and you learn to eat slowly and enjoy the meal and you learn there 's more to life than rushing around .
And you go to Argentina and you learn that sleeping was not in the agenda .
And then you have an opportunity to come back to where you live and put all those things together .
So I like surroundings that are very interesting .
My houses are interesting .
And also very warm ... romantic , in the terms of the journey to another time and place that 's more interesting than where we are today . "
As seen on TV
Peterman -- former minor - league baseball player and longtime entrepreneur , now 62 -- found the famous coat , an ankle - length cowboy - style duster , on a trip to Jackson Hole , Wyo. , and built a catalog around it in 1987 .
Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld , creators of the television series , became fans of the quirky writing and worldly voice that was J. Peterman , and in 1995 designed a character around it .
" They did it without my permission , " Peterman recalls .
" But then the Soup Nazi did n't like the way they did the Soup Nazi , so he sued them , and they took him off the air .
And the lawyers went to the producers and said ' We 'd better talk to Peterman before we go forward with this guy . '
So I 'd get the scripts about six weeks ahead and sign off on them . "
Even though the fictional Peterman seemed irrational and elitist , the real Peterman was sensible and populist enough to see the value of name recognition .
" Seinfeld , " after all , was the top- rated show on television during much of its run -- and beyond .
Says Tom Morton , representative for Jeffco , the company that is making Peterman 's furniture , " I have a customer in Istanbul who watches ' Seinfeld ' reruns and buys ( the furniture ) based on that . "
But even while " Seinfeld " was spreading Peterman 's name , he was losing it .
The company expanded rapidly in the late '90s , opening a chain of stores .
Too rapidly , it had become apparent by the time J. Peterman opened on the first floor of the San Francisco Shopping Centre , in November 1998 .
By the next January , the San Francisco store had closed , the company went bankrupt and Peterman was out -- though his name was still in .
" The rapidity of the crash was amazing , " he says .
" And it was too bad .
But we did a lot of things we should n't have done . "
In the meantime , though , real Peterman had met fictional Peterman ( O'Hurley ) on national television , and , oddly , the entrepreneur and the actor who played a version of him became friends .
Good friends .
Good enough that the real Peterman says , " When the company went down , he had a bigger identity crisis than I did , " then pauses .
" That 's a facetious remark . "
Good enough also that when Peterman was ready to plunk down $ 1 million to buy back his name , he told O'Hurley , " I 'm going to restart the company , do you want in ? "
The answer Peterman remembers : " Yep , how much ? "
And today , the fictional Peterman sits on the real Peterman 's board .
He might also sit at the Pulpit Bar .
Or the Wine Table .
Or -- a big favorite at the Walnut Creek rollout -- the Provence Dining Table .
" This table is narrow , 31 1/2 inches .
Because I want to have a dinner party that will have a conversation with all the people at the table , not two .
I want a great energy going at the dinner party .
The more distance between the participants , the less energy .
The less distance , the more intimacy and the more energy .
And everything in the furniture line is built like that . "
Keeping secrets
Rumor had it that he found inspiration for a new piece the night before , at an antiques store in Menlo Park , but he 's not telling .
" What was it ?
That 's a trade secret .
That 's how I make my living .
I ca n't tell all my secrets . "
He makes no secret , however , of the fact that he wants the new company to differ from the one that could n't turn the century .
The furniture pieces are whimsical , certainly , but they are also substantial , solid and pricey ; the Tuscan Bedstead , for example , is listed at more than $ 5,000 .
They do not come in sets and are not arranged as rooms .
" What I 've done is taken the business back to its roots , concentrating on making every item unique and different , concentrating on the creative and not worrying about the growing , " he says .
" The Chicago Tribune in the 1920s criticized F. Scott Fitzgerald because he was writing magazine articles to make money .
It said , ' We think F. Scott Fitzgerald is too much about the conditions of life and not about the spirit . '
I 've decided to think about the spirit . "
There 's one strategy of the old company that J. Peterman seems willing to repeat in his new incarnation , however : exposure by sitcom .
He 's made a pilot called " Peterman 's Eye , " narrated by O'Hurley .
" It 's Peterman 's quest for some item , person or place around the world , and all of the interesting , funny , witty things that happen along the way , " Peterman says .
" The back story is the story .
I never appear in the show .
The camera is Peterman 's Eye . "
Which could result in an entirely new generation saying , " You mean there really is a Peterman ? "

Crossfire War – Rapid Fire News =Tehran – Ankara – Damascus Watch – West Asia – North – Northeast Africa Theatre
Tehran – Riyadh – Tripoli – Khartoum – El Arish – Ramallah – Gaza – Beirut – Damascus – Ankara – Baghdad / London – Washington – Jerusalem – Cairo – Amman – Paris – Rome ; US State Department Drafting Ultimatum to Iran – Iraq Pm Al - Maliki to Confront Tehran Later This Week – Second US Carrier Arrives in Persian Gulf – Heavy Fighting Could Erupt in Iraq North Over Control of Oil in Kurdish Region – Syria Claims Mosul – Turkey Claims Kirkuk
Night Watch : PERSIAN GULF – “ What the Iranians are doing is killing American service men and women inside Iraq . ”
That was the statement made by U. S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as CBS News reports a second aircraft carrier arrived in the Persian Gulf .
Recently it had been reported two more carriers had left the South China Sea enroute to the Gulf , though publicly Secretary Gates still says no attack is imminent .
The Pentagon has ordered military commanders to prepare new options for an attack on Iran , specifically the headquarters of Iran ’s Quds Force , the branch of the military which controls the support of Shia militias and Sunni groups attacking the occupation and nuclear facilities of Iran ’s nuclear weapons program .
It is even being reported the State Department is drafting an ultimatum to Iran but the first step will be Washington having Iraq Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki confront Iran later this week with evidence of Tehran ’s support of Islamic militias attacking U. S. forces .
If that does not change Tehran ’s policy then the State Department will demand Iran cease its support or else , the war becomes direct . [ CBS ]
Tehran - Iran has no intention of changing its policy of supporting any Islamic group attacking the UK / US and in fact Iran ’s response will be to have the fighting increase to even more than its current level .
Iran believes it is ready for war with the U. S. otherwise the fighting in Baghdad and Iraq ’s south would not have been so intense as it has been for the last month , including the almost daily bombardment of the International Green Zone where embassies and government offices are located .
With the Pentagon ’s attack on Iran then Tehran will probably launch missiles from Iran at the UK / US bases in Iraq and Persian Gulf .
IRNA reports on Wednesday the head of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards Air Force , Brigadier General Hossein Salami stated , “ The Islamic Revolution Guard Corps has become a reliable , invincible and impenetrable body to defend the country against any threats . ”
He then said though the U. S. believes it has the most powerful military empire in the world it has yet to achieve any of its goals .
Washington ’s most glaring failure is its inability to secure Iraq and again the main reason for that failure is Tehran ’s continued support of armed groups attacking it .
The recent harassment of U. S. ships in the Gulf is another indication Iran believes it is ready .
Tehran knew Washington would have no other choice but to attack .
[ IRNA ]
Kirkuk –
As the U. S. concentrates on Baghdad and Iraq ’s south there are indications serious fighting is about to erupt in Iraq ’s north near the Syrian - Turkish border in the Kurdish regions around Mosul and Kirkuk over control of the area ’s vast amount of oil reserves .
Huda al - Husseini , Lebanese columnist with Asharq al - Awsat writes , “ So far , the battle of Basra remains unresolved , same as the battle in Baghdad ’s Sadr City and while all attention is focused on the south another civil war is threatening to erupt in the north .
She writes the Kurds are actively working to annex al Tamim , the capital of which is Kirkuk and is home to oil reserves that could reach up to 15 billion barrels . ”
The Kurds are conducting a “ Kurdization ” program by controlling most of the municipal councils , most jobs , including police posts at the expense of Arabs and Turkmen .
And that is why every Shia - Sunni political party in Baghdad , including Muqtada al - Sadr , is opposed to Kurdish control over this region .
[ ASHARQALAWSAT ]
The U. S. military is still trying to work with the Kurds by erecting mud and earth walls around the city in a desperate attempt to end the arms smuggling , principally by armed Sunni Sahwa forces that have been established no doubt with the assistance of Damascus - Anakara - Tehran , governments that do not wish to see a powerful , independent Kurdistan and at the same time want to increase the crossfire U. S. - British forces are already engulfed by .
Syria claims it should control Mosul and Turkey claims Kirkuk and I suspect both governments will enter the war this year to enforce those claims as London - Washington are not only increasingly trapped in Iraq but at war with Iran .
Turkey ’s current operations against Kurdish forces in Iraq and southeast Turkey are probably nothing more than preparation for its entry .
NOTICE :
Okay , I 'm getting sick of this .
Every now and then , someone brings this up and says reference to 18 + content .
I even saw a website with photoshops of my computer displaying 18 + content .
They even twist the story , saying I have 18 + content .
In reality , I DO NOT hold thise things .
This is extremely depressing and ...
YOU KNOW HOW DARN DEGRADING IT IS !?
Those people who run those website cracking mature jokes over this project is a total jerk .
It 's giving me a bad name and it ruins the innocence of this site .
And it hurts me too !
I even saw one website completely TWIST the story and make this a facility for hiding bad content .
It 's STUPID and extremely annoying .
POSTING REFERENCES TO MATURE CONTENT = PERMABAN
------------------
UPDATE : These " pr0n " people keep annoyng us .
That 's it .
GUEST POSTING ... CLOSED !
I never anticipated the amount of BS this little project can do .
------------------
HOWTO : Make a hidden storage disk !
Okay , so I have some friends who really like to take a look at my files .
Sure , I can hide them .
But what if my parents will look at my PC ?
Oh , no .
Not that I have " mature " content on my PC , but I have written all the crap that gets in my mind there .
So I decided to build this today .
To keep my data safe .
Time taken ( for me ) : 1 hour
Estimated Difficulty : Medium to Hard
Reference for Pinouts :
http://pinouts.ru/Slots/USB_pinout.shtml
Note : I am going to post these instructions on BenHeck and for my friends in the Philippines and hopefully Engadget will feature it .
So we can have people looking around here and to help them too .
LEGAL DISCLAIMER : THIS HOWTO IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES OF FUN ONLY .
I AM , IN NO WAY , GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT YOUR MISTAKES MAY CAUSE .
I ALSO AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BLOW UP YOUR COMPUTER , YOURSELF , YOUR DOG , YOUR HOUSE , OR EVEN BLOW THE CRAP OUT OF YOUR TOILET .
Sorry about the disclaimer , because I know there are people who like to sue others for their mistakes .

I had this unused phone line output near my laptop .
I heard that the previous resident of the house used it for his dial up connection .
Sorry , but 28.8 kilobit dial up for me is over .
I 'm rocking the 1024 Kilobit HiSpeed Cable .
I was not using it , so I decided it will make a perfect hiding place .
---
Here 's the stuff I will use .
The small circuit board up there is a PNY 4GB USB Drive .
I cracked the plastic case off .
It will be the " storage " device .
Right next to it is a scissors .
Left of the USB drive is an IDE Ribbon Cable .
This " ribbon " of wires is pulled from a dead computer .
It 's not really that critical , but I used it for convenience .
At the bottom is a 30 Watt Soldering Iron .
These things get hot enough to MELT metal , so be safe when handling this .
It will be used to melt metal .
The liquid metal will then flow to the bare connections , securing them .
This is called soldering .
Oh , I forgot to photograph the Duct Tape , USB Wire , Telephone wire and Screwdriver .
---
I used scissors to cut four strands of wiring from the ribbon cable .
---
I taped stuff down so they do n't move around .
Here , I am heating the soldering iron to prepare to solder the connections to the USB drive .
A USB port has 4 separate connections .
That 's why I needed four strands of ribbon cable .
---
Sorry , I cannot photograph the soldering because I had my hands full .
And no , I can't let anyone photograph for me or the secret will be out !
Here is the USB drive with four wires on it .
The four wires " connect " to the four connections of the USB port .
I used the iron to melt the metal and stick one of the wire strands on it .
The metal cools , and it will " lock " the wire .
Be sure none of the four connections are touching each other , or you will kill your PC !
---
Testing if the drive still works .
---
Testing if it works with the USB cable .
( more on it later . )
---
Okay , since the " core " of the project is done , now it 's time to take a screwdriver to the plug and unscrew it .
The screws are fairly long , so do n't lose them .
AND FOR CRIKE'S SAKE , PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO UNSCREW THAT POWER PLUG !
YOU'LL GET A NASTY JOLT IF YOU DO SO !
---
Open Sesame !
Do n't worry .
The wires will not shock you .
---
Plug removed .
---
I taped the exposed copper and stuffed the wires back into the recess .
---
Cover the hole with a box , just in case someone goes in .
---
A closer look at the back of the plug .
Notice the different color coding of wires .
---
Using the Reference for Pinouts , ( See at the top of the page . )
I put :
PIN 1 to RED
PIN 2 to ORANGE
PIN 3 to GREEN
PIN 4 to BLACK
I triple checked my connections .
If you have different colors , then sorry , I can not help .
Also , if you only have TWO wires instead of FOUR , bad luck .
Once I did that , I set it to some place safe .
---
Take a phone line wire and clip it .
It must have FOUR pins .
---
Now to make the connector cable .
I took a USB cable and clipped it to size .
Then I took the phone wire .
I exposed the wiring on both connectors .
You should see these wires .
USB CABLE :
RED
WHITE
GREEN
BLACK
PHONE WIRE :
RED
ORANGE
GREEN
BLACK
NOTE : Leave the phone wire longer .
The reason is that the phone wire is brittle and can easily break .
It is infuriating to work with .
---
Heating up the iron .
This takes a while . :-P
The metallic cylindrical shaped spool of wire is called soldering lead .
I had this for three years and I have n't used it all up yet .
Eventually , I will but ...
---
The metal wire melts to coat the wires to bond them together .
Bond the :
RED wire to the RED wire .
WHITE wire to the ORANGE wire .
GREEN wire to the GREEN wire
BLACK wire to the BLACK wire
Triple check the connections for safety .
---
Take some tape and insulate the wires individually .
Make sure no wire is touching another !
The patch cable is DONE !
w00t
---
Now to test if it works .
Plug the Phone Line in first , then the USB Cable to the computer .
Gasp !
The amber light is ON !
It 's working !
I can see my files !

Slow , but working .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sensitive and stolen U.S. military items are being sold on eBay and Craigslist , according to a report by the Government Accountability Office .
Night vision goggles , specially made to military specifications , allow the user to identify U.S. troops .
Government investigators posing as buyers were able to purchase a dozen prohibited military items on the popular online selling sites .
The report notes that the items purchased could easily have been shipped overseas and " used directly against our troops and allies . "
The items include :
• Two F - 14 fighter jet components .
The United States has retired its fleet of F - 14s .
Only Iran is currently using them .
• Night vision goggles specially made to military specifications that allow the user to identify U.S. troops at night .
• Army combat uniforms .
The military has prohibited the sale of uniforms to non-military personnel since January 2007 , when Iraqi Insurgents used U.S. military uniforms to sneak into a base in Karbala and kill five U.S. service members .
• Special " enhanced " body armor vests used by U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , and not available to the general public .
EBay says that it has more than 113 million items listed for sale at any given time and that military goods account for well under one - tenth of 1 percent of those .
A quick search of eBay revealed several Army combat uniforms for sale , despite the sale ban .
" With 7 million listings being added every day , we do the best we can , but things slip through from time to time , " said Kim Rubey , senior public relations manager for eBay .
Testifying before the House National Security and Foreign Affairs subcommittee Thursday , eBay Vice President Tod Cohen said the company vigorously works to keep prohibited items off the site .
" We created prohibited and restricted items policies and built tools using state - of - the - art technology to enforce those policies " he said .
Craigslist says it uses similar measures and relies on users to police the site .
The company has only 25 employees .
Craigslist CEO
Jim Buckmaster told the subcommittee that the rules about what can and cannot be sold are confusing .
Asked by Rep. John Tierney , D - Massachusetts , what Congress could do to make the situation better , Buckmaster answered , " It would simplify things greatly if a law were passed banning the sale of any U.S. military item less than 50 years old . "
" Its sort of amazing to me that we have n't had a law to ban the sale of that . "
Tierney replied .
Most of the items the government investigators bought were stolen from U.S. military facilities , the GAO said .
At the subcommittee hearings , Rep. Chris Shays , R- Connecticut , pressed a Defense Department official for answers on how military goods are making their way into the marketplace .
" Do we have a serious theft problem , or do we not even know if we have the ability to know we have a serious theft problem ? "
Shays asked .
" I might say the latter might be more accurate , " replied Charles Beardall , a deputy inspector general of the Department of Defense .

Brain in a Box : Woman With MS Shows Improvement A device the size of an iPod acts as a " brain , " sending messages to foot .
Jan. 29 , 2008  --
Three years ago Debbie Gomez - Trost was living her dream , watching her triplets grow up and enjoying her new home .
" Everything was golden , " Gomez - Trost said .
" We had kids we always wanted , the house we always wanted .
Everything we wanted and then one day , somebody turned the switch off . "
That 's when she received a devastating diagnosis — she had multiple sclerosis , a progressive disease of the nervous system that disrupts communication between the brain and body .
It can lead to loss of movement and paralysis , and there is no cure .
" I was only 40 years old , my kids were 7 , they were in first grade , " she said .
" Your whole life changes . "
Gomez - Trost worried most about her family .
" I was afraid I would n't see them grow up , " she said .
As the disease progressed , everyday activities like walking up the stairs or chasing after her kids became more and more difficult and exhausting .
Gomez - Trost had to give up the hobbies she once enjoyed and was pained by an uncomfortable brace she had to wear to help her paralyzed right leg .
Struggling to walk , she experienced a condition called foot drop , where she could no longer flex her ankle and walk normally .
" The fatigue was the thing I had to fight , " she said .
" It 's very frustrating . "
She 's a ' Ball of Fire Now '
Then in the summer 2006 , Gomez - Trost received a glimmer of hope in the form of a new device called the WalkAide that helps with footdrop .
Click here to find out more about the WalkAide .
" It sends a stimulation to the appropriate nerve to help them pick up the foot to give them a normal gait pattern when they walk , " said Brian Karban , an orthotist at Hanger Prosthetics and Orthotics .
The device , about the size of an iPod , is strapped around the calf , and a gentle electric signal is sent from the device to the leg , telling the foot to lift and lower .
The WalkAide helped regenerate communication between Gomez - Trost 's brain and her foot .
" When I first put it on all I could say was awesome , awesome , " she said .
Without the WalkAide , Gomez - Trost limped along with the help of a cane .
Using the device , she is able to climb stairs with no visible limp .
" With the WalkAide I was able to decrease the fatigue that my body was feeling , " Gomez - Trost said .
" When you have footdrop , inside your head you 're having a conversation .
You 're telling your leg and foot , up down up down .
So the WalkAide is kind of like a brain in a box .
I do n't have to think about it it 's a naturally occurring event . "
Best of all , she can now keep up with her kids .
" They 're 9 , I can't run foot for foot with them , but I can do the stairs really easy now , " she said .
" We go for walks again .
I 'm able to walk down the street again . "
Her husband , Bob Trost , said that the improvement has been monumental .
" It 's changed our whole family 's life , " Trost said .
" I got my wife back .
She 's able to be with the kids .
She 's a ball of fire now , she 's always on the go . "
Though Gomez - Trost still sometimes uses a cane , the WalkAide has made her more comfortable and boosted her confidence .
" It 's really changed my life a lot , " she said .
" Life - altering events really do n't happen that much , and it happened to me . "
I dropped by the Java Users ’ Group meeting last week since Rich Hickey was there to talk about Clojure .
I expected a bit of carping from the Java guys , and at first they were all “ efficiency this ” and “ security that . ”
But by mid-way through the talk I think they were getting it .
A few even got excited about macros .
If I did n’t make it clear in my first post about Clojure , I like this language .
Here ’s some more reasons why :
Faced with the home mortgage debacle that underlies one of the most dangerous economic crises since the Great Depression , Congress and the administration have been all but paralyzed by two questions :
Who deserves to be helped ?
And how far should the government go to set matters aright ?
Although the Federal Reserve moved dramatically to prevent catastrophe among Wall Street ’s major financial houses , Congress and the Bush administration have taken only small steps to deal with the root problem : the financial tsunami in the housing market set off by defaults on sub - prime mortgages .
But all that may be about to change .
The House and Senate are beginning to consider proposals for federal intervention on a massive scale .
In effect , the government would take over many of the risks now borne by lenders , borrowers and investors -- offering to revamp and then guarantee about 1 million troubled mortgages in an effort to shore up plunging home prices .
Advertisement
The change would come in two stages .
The first would be the likely passage Tuesday of a modest bipartisan housing aid package in the Senate .
Next would come action over a period of months on measures to guarantee $ 300 billion or more in revamped mortgages .
The two measures , advanced by Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass ) and Sen. Christopher J. Dodd ( D - Conn . ) , are likely to attract opposition from President Bush , who has shown a deep reluctance to step into the current housing crisis or even say much about it .

Not a revolutionary step
The proposals also are likely to raise the ire of mortgage industry lobbyists and investors in mortgage - backed securities , who want any effort to ease the crisis to be voluntary and small scale .
Nevertheless , calls for passage of one of the measures or something similarly sweeping are growing increasingly insistent as lawmakers and many economists conclude that something must be done to end the real estate price plunge quickly if the economy is to right itself .
And , contrary to what many Americans may think , government action on such a dramatic scale would not be new or even all that unusual .
Washington has taken similar - size steps during economic crises of the past .

Repeatedly in the nation ’s history , from the savings and loan scandal of the 1980s to the Depression of the 1930s and the financial panics of the 18th and 19th centuries , Washington has stepped in when large numbers of ordinary citizens were threatened with financial devastation .
“ There ’s been a long tradition -- dating back well before the New Deal -- of saving the family home or the family farm , ” said Michele Landis Dauber , a Stanford University professor of law and sociology and author of “ The Sympathetic State . ”
In almost every instance , action came only after long , agonized debate , particularly over the question of whether the beneficiaries of government action were in trouble through no fault of their own .
And in almost every instance , a simple calculation tipped the balance in favor of action :
Although some who were undeserving might end up being helped along the way , the benefit to society as a whole was simply too substantial to ignore .
Advertisement
“ In both the United States and Britain , policymakers have long sought to distinguish between the so - called deserving and undeserving , ” said Harvard University economic historian David A. Moss , author of “ When All Else Fails : Government as the Ultimate Risk Manager . ”
But in practice , he added , “ it ’s often difficult to distinguish reliably between the two .
By pushing too hard on this distinction , policymakers run the risk of punishing everyone , rather than just the supposed bad apples .
“ As James Madison once observed in another context , ‘ Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of every thing . ’ ”
Such pragmatism has been apparent in the Federal Reserve ’s recent efforts to calm rattled financial markets .

The central bank assumed the risk of almost $ 30 billion of troubled securities from Bear Stearns Cos. and provided similar - size loans last month to grease the skids for a takeover of the crippled investment bank by JPMorgan Chase & Co .
In the process , it probably helped wealthy and arguably undeserving players such as Bear ’s creditors and JPMorgan .
But Fed officials said the price of not acting would have been even higher .
“ If you want to say we bailed out the market in general , I guess that ’s true , ” Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told a congressional committee last week .
“ But we felt that was necessary in the interest of the American economy . ”
A similar calculation led Washington to intervene in the 1980s savings and loan crisis .
Advertisement
The S&L ; industry had gone on a lending rampage , but most of its bets had gone bad .
The government seized the assets of 1,000 S&Ls ; , sold off half a trillion dollars ’ worth of property and spent $ 124 billion of taxpayer money paying deposit insurance to the institutions ’ customers , as well as aiding those few institutions that were considered salvageable .
Many depositors were ordinary people whose life savings were threatened .
But others were speculators who simply made bad investment decisions -- often with the assistance of S&L ; executives .
The government set aside the question of who was deserving of aid , deciding that leaving it to market forces to work through the problem would have hurt many innocent savers and been a long - term drag on the economy .
With President Franklin D. Roosevelt , that pragmatism was apparent in one of the earliest New Deal agencies , the Home Owners Loan Corp. , or HOLC .
Advertisement
Many Americans had speculated in real estate during the 1920s by taking out short - term bank loans and using the houses they purchased as collateral .
Unlike today ’s mortgages that allow homeowners to build a stake in their properties , these loans gave borrowers no equity until fully paid off .
As a result , when the housing market and the economy plunged in the 1930s , millions of people lost their homes and the banks took possession .
From 1933 to 1936 , the HOLC refinanced the loans of about 1 million threatened families , deserving or not .
The agency bailed out many of the banks that had made the original loans as well .
By the time the HOLC finally shut in the 1960s , it had not only paid off its bills but returned a small profit to the federal government .
Advertisement
During the late 18th and 19th centuries , Congress passed four major bankruptcy laws in the wake of financial panics .
In each case , the measure released debtors -- deserving or otherwise -- from some of their obligations so they could get back on their feet and become productive members of society again .
In the 1790s , the newly formed federal government finally decided to pay off most of the debts accumulated by the states during the Revolutionary War , despite complaints that speculators in war bonds would benefit .
Distasteful as many found it , paying off the debts was deemed crucial to establishing the new government ’s credit at home and abroad .
A similar decision - making process appears to be underway in the current housing crisis .
Advertisement
Many of those who bought or refinanced their homes with sub - prime loans were victims of overzealous loan brokers paid on commission .
But many others knowingly took out mortgages they could n’t afford , betting that home prices would keep rising and that they could easily refinance .
Whether all these borrowers are deserving or not , political leaders are being forced by events to take increasingly pragmatic approaches to the crisis at hand .

Pressure for action
Advertisement
Across the political spectrum , the consensus is that Washington has done little to help ordinary Americans affected by the entwined housing and financial crises .
“ If you take out the Federal Reserve and a couple of other things , I do n’t see government action of much real consequence so far , ” said David C. John , a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
“ We have n’t done much yet , ” agreed Rep. Frank , the liberal chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
But pressured by the Fed ’s aid to financial players , the demands of economically strapped voters and the sense that key lawmakers may have come up with a way to parry the deserving / undeserving distinction , Congress is about to take up proposals that could greatly expand the scope of federal action .
Advertisement
“ When the Federal Reserve stepped in to staunch some bleeding on Wall Street , we figured it is time to staunch some bleeding in the housing market , which is hemorrhaging daily all over this country , ” said Sen. Richard C. Shelby ( R - Ala . ) .
Under similar proposals by Frank and Dodd , Washington would empower another New Deal - era agency , the Federal Housing Administration , to run a new mortgage guarantee program .
Dodd is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee .
To participate , the lender would have to cut the principal of a troubled mortgage to 85 % of a home ’s current , diminished market value .
The FHA would take 5 % of the new , lower amount as a fee .
Homeowners would get the remaining 10 % as equity to give them a stake in paying off the renegotiated mortgage .
Borrowers would have to prove that they had the financial wherewithal to keep up with the now - lower monthly mortgage payments .
Those who could n’t prove they could pay would be ineligible for the program .
If borrowers failed to pay the new , smaller mortgage , Washington would do so .
Advertisement
There were hints last week that by making the proposed program voluntary , having the government guarantee but not actually buy up houses or mortgages , and by slapping requirements on both lenders and borrowers , the proposal could fly politically .
That hardly means who ’s deserving and who ’s not is no longer an issue .
Conservatives such as Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( R - Texas ) declared they would fight the Frank and Dodd plans .
“ If you look around at who the innocent parties are , ” Hensarling said , “ the American taxpayers are innocent . ”
Frank ’s response ?
“ I want to help the least undeserving people around . ”

Described as " One of the most prevalent pieces of malware in the last three years , " the Downloader - UA.h trojan is running wild on P2P networks .
But thanks to its system strength - and the work of torrent site moderators - such outbreaks are shrugged off by BitTorrent .
Anti-piracy outfits , like all organizations fighting against massive odds , rely heavily on the media to amplify their message .
Whether it ’s a some fringe group exploding a trash can to get attention or someone chaining himself to a prominent building in protest , using the media is relatively cheap and effective .
Organizations like the RIAA and IFPI like to play the fear card to reduce file - sharing so a nasty malware attack on P2P networks , affecting up to 27 % of tested PCs this week , is a dream come true for them , as they continue to spread their message that P2P networks are nothing but trouble .
However , in a testament to its structure and security , BitTorrent is almost immune from these type of attacks and that is why you never hear the RIAA and IFPI talk about viruses and BitTorrent in the same announcement .
In terms of sharing files and avoiding malware , BitTorrent does really well .
This recent malware attack revolved around people downloading files which were renamed to look like music and movies , but instead engineer a situation where lots of other stuff gets installed on the host PC , causing all sorts of problems .
While viewing some of the filenames listed by McAfee , I had to remind myself that I was a novice once too – but it was still a stretch for me to believe so many people would download files that look like these :
preview - t-3545425-adult.mpg
preview - t- 3545425 - changing times earth wind .mp3
preview - t- 3545425 - meet bambi in kings harem.mp3
preview - t- 3545425 - middle eastern chick.mpg
preview - t-3545425 -theme godfather.mp3
t-3545425-bentley bizzle.mp3
t-3545425 -haloween special.mp3
t-3545425 - just got lucky.mp3
t-3545425 - peanut butter jelly amende.mp3
The good news is that the chances of these type of files appearing on BitTorrent are very low as trackers have moderators who remove such junk , something which is largely impossible on Gnutella ( LimeWire ) and eMule ( ed2 k ) .
As long as the ‘ infected ’ users keep this stuff in their shared folder , there is little that can be done to stop it spreading .
If they do n’t clean this stuff out , no - one will , and it ’s in this department BitTorrent comes out tops – again .
First of all , BitTorrent is n’t a ‘ folder sharing ’ client like LimeWire or KaZaA , which means that the user needs to use a torrent site to distribute ( publish ) his torrent .
If the content is legitimate ( and there are very few rules in most places , save obviously illegal material ) the .torrent file will be up for all to download , with links to malware and viruses mostly filtered out by humans – otherwise known as ‘ mods ’ or ‘ moderators ’ .
BitTorrent has thousands of hard working and largely unpaid moderators , who work tirelessly to make sure that files like these do n’t make it to the BitTorrent user ’s computer .
In reality , files presented like the ones above could never slip by the site mods , they would see them a mile away and remove them quickly .
BitTorrent is n’t 100 % malware free but compared to Gnutella and ed2 k , it is astonishingly healthy and that is largely down to the strength of the system and the mods , who work non-stop behind the scenes to keep BitTorrent an enjoyable experience .
For the few small things that slip through the net , try our guides .
All of us are for more transparency , whether it be trading in derivatives or some of the things that have happened that caused this crisis we 're in .
And that may require more supervision .
But I 've never begrudged anybody for getting rich .
It 's important that we give all Americans an opportunity to get rich .
That 's why education and training are so vital to the future of this country .
I do n't believe in the old redistribution of the wealth .

Information is exploding so furiously around us and information technology is changing at such bewildering speed that we face a fundamental problem :
How to orient ourselves in the new landscape ?
What , for example , will become of research libraries in the face of technological marvels such as Google ?
How to make sense of it all ?
I have no answer to that problem , but I can suggest an approach to it : look at the history of the ways information has been communicated .
Simplifying things radically , you could say that there have been four fundamental changes in information technology since humans learned to speak .
Somewhere , around 4000 BC , humans learned to write .
Egyptian hieroglyphs go back to about 3200 BC , alphabetical writing to 1000 BC .
According to scholars like Jack Goody , the invention of writing was the most important technological breakthrough in the history of humanity .
It transformed mankind ’s relation to the past and opened a way for the emergence of the book as a force in history .
The history of books led to a second technological shift when the codex replaced the scroll sometime soon after the beginning of the Christian era .
By the third century AD , the codex — that is , books with pages that you turn as opposed to scrolls that you roll — became crucial to the spread of Christianity .
It transformed the experience of reading : the page emerged as a unit of perception , and readers were able to leaf through a clearly articulated text , one that eventually included differentiated words ( that is , words separated by spaces ) , paragraphs , and chapters , along with tables of contents , indexes , and other reader ’s aids .
The codex , in turn , was transformed by the invention of printing with movable type in the 1450s .
To be sure , the Chinese developed movable type around 1045 and the Koreans used metal characters rather than wooden blocks around 1230 .
But Gutenberg ’s invention , unlike those of the Far East , spread like wildfire , bringing the book within the reach of ever - widening circles of readers .
The technology of printing did not change for nearly four centuries , but the reading public grew larger and larger , thanks to improvements in literacy , education , and access to the printed word .
Pamphlets and newspapers , printed by steam - driven presses on paper made from wood pulp rather than rags , extended the process of democratization so that a mass reading public came into existence during the second half of the nineteenth century .
The fourth great change , electronic communication , took place yesterday , or the day before , depending on how you measure it .
The Internet dates from 1974 , at least as a term .
It developed from ARPANET , which went back to 1969 , and from earlier experiments in communication among networks of computers .
The Web began as a means of communication among physicists in 1981 .
Web sites and search engines became common in the mid-1990s .
And from that point everyone knows the succession of brand names that have made electronic communication an everyday experience :
Web browsers such as Netscape , Internet Explorer , and Safari , and search engines …
I used to have somewhat of a dislike for your kind .
I can't do that anymore , not after hearing you .
now , if anything ... I feel sorry for you .
I should n't , you do n't want my pity .
If you 're happy with your life , all the power in the world to you .
I just do n't comprehend how it is possible for you to want things as they are .
This is directed specifically at a few of you , the only ones like you I know .
The four or five of you who collect in the dorm bathroom at three or four in the morning , early Saturdays ( having been out Friday ) or Sunday ( from partying Saturday ) .
You 're always fairly drunk , not sloppy , you were sober enough to make it past the night checker , but quite drunk nonetheless .
And always still in your glittery shirts and high heels just a bit too high for you .
And you 're washing the too much makeup you put on to win males , washing it off carefully making sure it's all gone before you sleep , so you wo n't break out from residue .
And you 're always talking about sex .
unsurprising .
It 's just how that startles me .
All I say now , is your own words I ’ve overheard over the weeks .
I do not speculate you believe this , or assume .
I have heard the words from your own mouths .
And I know you 're not lying , because you 're speaking to each other , as friends .
A bit too loudly because you 're drunk .
but speaking frankly amongst yourselves .
You do n't even know I ’m there , going about my own business but hearing you anyways .
But you speak of how many guys you 've slept with .
How huge this guy 's cock was , or how ripped the other guy you did tonight was .
This ... is not out of the ordinary .
Not for college girls , or even those older in the " real world " .
These things are normal .
it's what you say next , that makes me hurt for you .
You 've slept with all these guys , easily one or two a weekend , if not a night .
And you do n't get it at all .
You say yourself , with all these guys ... you 've never had an orgasm .
and you kind of wonder what they 're like .
But you assume you 'll never have one .
Because whatever guy you 're with , he finishes , and that 's that .
nothing for you , except the feeling you 've done " what you should " , climbing your social ladder .
You do n't “ get ” sex .
You say this .
You do n't get what it 's all about , you do n't get the good feelings from it .
None of you have ever had a guy go down on you , not a one has even offered .
And if he did , you would n't accept .
you think it 's * disgusting * , you think " down there " is unclean and foul .
Yet you 're more than happy to give HIM a blow job , no matter who he is .
That 's just what you 're “ supposed ” to do , as a part of sex .
You 're more than happy to please him this way , but if he tried to reciprocate you would shun him as perverted .
These are your own words .
You do n't even know the full range of physical feeling possible .
You wonder if you ever will .
part of it is because it does n't sound like he ever tried .
And I guess that makes sense , especially if he's in a half alcoholic stupor , he wo n't have much desire to play nice after he 's gotten what he wants .
But you know the other half ?
More than half .
You fear your own body .
You do n't know its own power or its own bliss .
You talk of how you do n't understand when all your guy friends jack off .
That that 's , well , ok for guys , you guess .
But you could never * touch yourself * like that .
That that 's vile and unclean and perverted ( and you wo n't even say " masturbate " .
It ’s " touch myself " . )
" I could NEVER see why a girl would want to touch herself .. like that " .
" Yeah ...
I could never imagine putting my fingers ... ' down there ' " .
You wo n't even say it .
Vagina .
Vagina vagina vagina .
You wo n't even give it its proper medical term .
much less any of its slang .
cunt .
What about that ?
Ca n't say it ?
Are you uncomfortable with that ?
You are .
I ’m sure those words make you squirm .
You wo n't even say it medically .
It 's just " ... down there " , and you 'll have nothing to do with it .
You 're the people they made tampon applicators for , you know .
You are so uncomfortable with the * natural * workings of your own bodies you need a shield of cardboard or plastic .
All that odd oozy hole between your legs is good for , in your minds , is for a drunken , horny college frat boy to derive pleasure from .
Other than that , other than your sex for standing , your sex for status and for " because this is what I ’m supposed to do " it 's good for nothing .
It 's certainly not for you .
Compared to you ( hell compared to most people ) I have no experience .
at all .
but you know what ?
I ’d not trade places for the world .
I can have more fun merely by myself than you do in your six - pack per weekend of guys .
My body may not be as traditionally " beautiful " as yours , I may not have the Barbie - in - training thing going on .
But what good is perfection if you do n't use it .
You 're out there every single weekend having sex .
and you do n't really enjoy a moment of it .
You 'll never truly understand it , will you ?
Just know the poor little geekling you pity for having no social life ... herself pities you .
Bodies are wonderful .
They 're natural and normal .
And a lot of fun .
I wish I could have you see this .
I wish you understood .
I wish you did n't fear your own flesh .
More than I ever will express .
You do n't probably want my pity , you chose this life .
But nonetheless ... I ’m sorry .

Break out the bubbly : Spam is celebrating its 30th anniversary this weekend .
And my oh my , three decades later , how the annoyances of the internet have changed .
Where it all started
The message considered the first unsolicited mass e-mail went out to unsuspecting inboxes on May 3 , 1978 .
A marketing employee at a company called Digital Equipment Corporation ( now owned by HP ) sent the message to 393 users of the government - run network Arpanet , the predecessor to the internet we know today .
“ DIGITAL WILL BE GIVING A PRODUCT PRESENTATION OF THE NEWEST MEMBERS OF THE DECSYSTEM -20 FAMILY ; THE DECSYSTEM - 2020 , 2020T , 2060 , AND 2060T … ”
Typed in all caps for extra irritation , the email touted two new products being demonstrated in California and invited recipients to see them in action .
The guy behind the message , Gary Thuerk , reported immediate negative response to his ad — but also immediate results .
He told the Wall Street Journal this week that the email led to $ 12 million in sales .
How it ’s transformed
Nowadays , spam takes up anywhere from 80 to 95 percent of all emails sent .
And here ’s the amazing part :
There are actually idiots out there clicking these ads and sending their money .
Internet security firm Sophos was recently quoted as estimating about 10 percent of spam recipients purchase products from the mass mails .
And guess what ?
Their clicks are costing all of us .
Research companies say the wasted bandwidth from spam will add up to $ 140 billion worldwide this year alone .
What ’s more , with increasingly sophisticated spamming techniques , tracking and stopping those unwanted ads is proving to be a tricky feat .
In honor of this week ’s anniversary , McAfee decided to conduct a little experiment to see just how severe the problem really has become .
The anti-virus giant had volunteers spend 30 days surfing the net on completely unprotected computers , with all personal guards down .
They answered every email , filled out every form , and responded to every ad .
The result ?
More than 126,000 unsolicited emails , and a lot of problems .
“ We started with a brand new computer that was lightning fast .
We end with a computer that takes a long time to open even the simplest of webpages and I fear may be tracking every keystroke and page we visit , ” one participant wrote in her diary of the experience .
“ It multiplies like crazy – like a virus .
And it just keeps coming , ” noted another participant .
Going beyond spam
Spam ’s not the only thing multiplying like a virus on the net .
The number of annoying trends trying to take advantage of users has actually become an FBI concern .
The government ’s Internet Crime Complaint Center , or IC3 , tracks all sorts of schemes and scams moving throughout cyberspace , spam included .
Some of the other current hot issues on the watchlist :
Auction fraud : Ripping people off with phony sales on sites like eBay .
Be wary of sellers using multiple names , using addresses outside of your country , or asking for direct wire transfers of money .

Thuerk really to blame for all of this ?
Depends who you ask .
I ’ve gotta believe that if he did n’t send that ill - fated message , someone else would have had the idea before long .
His defense , as told to the Wall Street Journal : “ If the airline loses your luggage , do you blame the Wright brothers ? ”
Touché , Thuerk .
Touché .
Still , someone has to be the scapegoat for this sea of annoyance , to act as a recipient of our spam - induced rage .

The Thin Cheesecake release is out ( v0.6.1 ) !
sudo gem install thin
That tasty and sweet Cheesecake release comes with some new sweet topping : config file support , uses less memory , some speed tweaks , but that ’s nothing new regarding what we all know and use from other web servers .
Nothing very innovative , breath taking , crazy , revolutionary or surprising you say .
You ’re right !
Almost …
There ’s another feature that as never been seen amongst Ruby web servers ( indeed , have n’t found any that does that ) .
But first , lets explore the typical deployment of a Rails app .
Let ’s deploy Rails shall we ?
Typically you ’d deploy your rails application using mongrel like this :
mongrel_rails cluster :: configure - C config/mongrel_cluster.yml -- servers 3 -- chdir /var/www/app/current ... mongrel_rails cluster :: start - C config/mongrel_cluster.yml
Then on your web server / load balancer configuration file ( Nginx in this case ) :
nginx.conf
upstream backend { server 127.0.0.1:5000 ; server 127.0.0.1:5001 ; server 127.0.0.1:5002 ; }
Now with Thin , it ’s the same
thin config - C config / thin.yml -- servers 3 -- port 5000 -- chdir ... thin start - C config / thin.yml
That will start 3 servers running on port 5000 , 5001 and 5002 .
And your web server configuration stays the same .
Really , between you and me , is Thin really really faster ?
Simple “ hello world ” app , running one server
And uses less memory too :
Mesured after running : ab - n5000 - c3
What about that new , crazy , amazing feature you mentioned ?
Ever wanted to keep closer to you web server ?
Sometimes connecting through a TCP port on 127.0.0.1 feels a bit … disconnected .
What if we ’d get closer to it , get intimate with it , share some feelings , exchange toothbrush ?
Introducing UNIX socket connections
When using more then one server ( a cluster ) behind a load balancer , we need to connect those servers to the load balancer through dedicated ports like in the previous “ Let ’s deploy Rails ” section .
But this connect the 2 using a TCP socket which means , all requests have to go though the network interface stuff twice !
Once from the client ( browser ) to the load balancer / web server and again to the backend server .
There ’s a better approach to this .
Some load balancer ( like Nginx ) support connecting to a UNIX domain socket .
nginx.conf
upstream backend { server unix :/tmp/thin.0.sock ; server unix:/tmp/thin.1.sock ; server unix:/tmp/thin.2.sock ; }
Then start your
Thin servers , like this :
thin start -- server 3 -- socket /tmp/thin.sock
And yes , it is faster :
3 servers running a simple Rails application , behind Nginx
Rosie Millard just wanted to make her kids happy , is that so wrong ?
How could she have known that getting a single DS to share between the four of her children , along with what sounds like a bootleg 20 - game card , could tear the family fabric apart ?
She talks of the horrible behavior her kids exhibit as they vie for time with the games , and going to any means necessary to do so .
I ’m not judging or anything , but perhaps the problem lies not in Nintendo ’s handheld , but in the children .
I could be wrong , and Nintendo might be plotting world domination by possessing the younger generation .
That is crafty of them .
Rosie ’s full story after the break .
As my eight - year - old son Gabriel hit his five - year - old sister Honey on the head , ten - year - old Phoebe started yelling and the youngest , three - year - old Lucien , joined in the fun , a red mist descended over my vision .
It was eight in the morning .
No one had eaten breakfast .
The curtains had not been opened .
The beds had not been made .
The dog had not been walked .
Our habitual regime of a ten - minute morning music practice had been abandoned .
The entire mood was one of anger , confrontation , pain and frustration .
Welcome to a family of Nintendo - users .
Or should I say user , since we had only one of these infernal devices .
I finally buckled to buy a Nintendo DS Lite after considerable and sustained pressure from my children .
What finally did it was a suggestion from my oldest child that without a Nintendo in her school bag , she would be unable to fit in at school .
( Yes , I know – oldest trick in the book .
And I fell for it . )
It was that , plus reading a piece in one newspaper which suggested that if you regularly played Brain Trainer on your Nintendo , you ’d bump up your mental acuity .
And another piece from child expert Dr Tanya Byron , of all people , which , as far as I recall , actually suggested that regular use of interactive toys such as the DS helped your children to be caring and creative .
I also had a sneaking and totally selfish wish to be Mother of the Year .
Which I was , for about a day .
When the pale blue , £ 150 Nintendo finally arrived last November , fresh from Hong Kong ( I had bought it on the net ) , crammed with a ‘ bundle ’ of 20 games including Brain Trainer , Fifa 08 , and Nintendogs , my children hugged me tightly .
“ Thank you , thank you , Mummy , ” they chorused .
“ We LOVE you ! ”
Mission accomplished , I smiled indulgently at them .
Then we were off , down a slope which became comprehensively more slippery the longer my family and the Nintendo existed under the same roof .
At first , I decreed that the device would be a “ family Nintendo ” , passed around lovingly by everyone as we all played Brain Trainer together .
That idea lasted about a week .
I found Brain Trainer utterly predictable and the children found it totally boring .
Gradually , each child found his or her own Nintendo ‘ fix ’ .
Gabriel became obsessed with playing the football game Fifa 08 : over meals , on the loo , in bed at midnight .
Phoebe just took virtual dogs for walks , while Honey zoned in on the My Little Pony game .
The ‘ toy ’ caused endless rows , sessions of screaming and increasingly regular parental punishments .
It was removed and placed in my desk .
The children found it and hid it in their bedroom .
I put it into my bag .
They discovered it again .
I devised a daily Nintendo rota .
Then we lost the charger .
What a great week that was .
The musical instruments were resumed , the real dog was walked , the argument quotient in the house calmed down .
Then we found the charger again .
The children wept with joy .
“ You ’d better behave with it this time , ” I warned .
“ Otherwise … ”
“ Yeah , yeah , ” they shouted , skipping off happily .
How long did that last ?
How long do you think – 20 minutes , tops .
I ’ll admit , the Nintendo had its uses .
I managed to achieve a longheld aim of getting a short haircut for Phoebe via the simple tactic of allowing her to take the Nintendo to the hairdresser’s .
She was so engrossed that she failed to notice the flashing blades and ended up with a wonderfully short crop .
Having a Nintendo to hand is also jolly useful when you are on a train with a child and want to read a book , write a letter or call the office .
Hand over the Nintendo and without any effort , you have a window of about two hours of peace , with your child doing something quietly constructive .
Except , it ’s not .
What is constructive about playing football on a tiny screen , or washing a virtual dog , or watching a hideous pink pony trot around a pink palace decorated with shells ?
Fighting to get onto the machine was bad enough , but it was worse when they were forcibly dragged from it .
Our Nintendo had taken the guise of a small but toxic drug which , little by little , was poisoning my children .
When they had had their fix , they were even more frustrated and discontented than before .
Interestingly , Dr Susan Greenfield , writing last weekend in the press , seems to suggest the same thing .
A specialist in brain degeneration , Dr Greenfield has a new book out which predicts that young people are headed for a mass loss of personal identity , thanks to the amount of time they spend in the interactive realms of things like Nintendo .
“ The time is well nigh , ” she said , “ to explore the impact of these technologies . ”
Well , I do n’t want to explore the impact any more .
I know what the impact is on my children .
I have first - hand evidence that using a Nintendo turns my delightful , curious and funny children into argumentative demons full of aggression , wholly uninterested in anything apart from playing , and then playing some more .
At the same time that all the children started crying and yelling before breakfast , I spotted Phoebe ’s cello and I realised that she had not got it out of its case all week .
Yet she had notched up probably around eight hours on the Nintendo .
There and then , I made my mind up .
The Nintendo had to go , and to hell with my children ‘ fitting in ’ .
But how to get rid of it ?
I mused on the idea of giving it to my sister , a mother - of - five , but rejected that on the grounds of child cruelty .
I considered selling it on eBay , but rejected that on the grounds that I did n’t want to waste any more of my energy on the hideous thing .
In the end , last week , I walked into my local branch of Cancer Research UK and gave it away .
“ Would you like this Nintendo ? ” I said .
“ In perfect condition , with a bundle of 20 games .
Plus charger . ”
The lady behind the counter smiled broadly .
“ What a fantastic gift , ” she said .
I returned to stunned disbelief from the children – “ You did what ? ” – and floods of real tears .
Since then , however , our domestic life has been transformed .
The children have swung back into their old habits of reading , playing the violin , walking the dog , occasionally fighting , cooking and making things .
Do they mourn for the lost screen - based world of the Nintendo ?
Actually , I think they ’ve forgotten all about it .
Mr Taylor denies trading arms for diamonds
Liberia 's ex-President Charles Taylor had transactions of about $ 5bn in two US bank accounts during his presidency , his prosecutor has told the BBC .
Mr Taylor is being tried by a UN - backed war crimes court for backing rebels in Sierra Leone while in office .
He denies trading arms for diamonds and challenged the international community when he stood down in 2003 to trace and seize any monies they alleged he had .
If any was found he would " turn them over to the Liberian people " .
During Sierra Leone 's decade - long civil war , which officially ended in 2002 , tens of thousands of people died and thousands more were mutilated , raped and had limbs amputated .
Mr Taylor 's case has been transferred from Sierra Leone to The Hague for security reasons , although it is still being conducted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone .
He denies 11 counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes .
UN freeze
" We 've certainly found evidence of hundreds of millions of dollars taken by Charles Taylor illegally in various banks at different times , " prosecutor Stephen Rapp told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme .
" We have evidence of two accounts that were maintained in his name in the United States during his presidency , " he said .
The sum of transactions of the two accounts over time totalled $ 5bn , he said .
About $ 375 m had been debited from one account and Mr Rapp said he was in the process of tracing the funds and a number of countries were co-operating .
If recovered , Mr Rapp said that the money would be subject to a UN freeze on Mr Taylor 's assets .
He said that he hoped any money recovered would be shared between the victims of the Sierra Leone civil war and the Liberian state , if Mr Taylor was found guilty .
The title is a play on the anti-proliferation catchcry :
You ca n’t hug a baby in nuclear arms .
That , of course , is the idea , the result of a deliberate strategy and as a direct consequence of Israel ’s prevailing self - definition and worldview .
As surely as our cosmology informs our sociology , the abhorrent siege of the Gaza Ghetto continues , the result of the internal logic of Israel ’s continued existence as an apartheid expansionist state , producing policies of continued ‘ low - intensity ’ ethnic cleansing , divide and rule and genocide as Ilan Pappe and others have described .
Zaid Khan ’s words are worth quoting again :
Nearly 70 years ago , in a small eastern European city , an oppressed and occupied people were under siege , living under atrocious and brutal conditions , lacking food , medicine , electricity , water , and slowly being strangled in the hope they would just disappear .
Warsaw Ghetto 1941 – Gaza 2008 .
Israel , you are a disgrace .
Gazan resident Sami Abdel - Shafi writes in A strangled people :
Israel ’s current policies are slowly expelling Palestinians from their land and pushing those who remain into indignity , desperation and extremism .
The word “ siege ” no longer seems adequate to describe what is being done to Gaza .
The territory ’s 1.5 million people have been thrust into a humanitarian catastrophe .
It has become a nonsense to speak of peace negotiations while Israel creates more injustices on the ground in the West Bank and East Jerusalem .
The prerequisite for peace , justice and genuine security is clear to an increasing number of thoughtful observers such as Virginia Tilley , Ali Abunimah , Mazin Qumsiyeh and many others : Israeli abrogation of its insistence on defining itself as an ( artificially and exclusively ) Jewish State , instead becoming a democratic state of , for and by all of its citizens .
Since most Israelis define themselves as secular , how long will they continue to be subject to the small number of extremists among the orthodox Jews ?
Israel also clearly does not fulfil one of its purported raison d’etre ’s of being a safe haven for Jews : it cannot ever do so as it is currently conceived .
Second , a re-direction of the astronomical sums of US aid currently for Israel towards a massive re-building of Gaza would also be a better use of these funds ( reparations , not state terror ) and would be a master stroke of US policy in the region .
Of course , that would have to get around the problem of currently the most Israeli - occupied and Likud - coopted territory of them all as Pat Buchanan noted : Capitol Hill .
The climate is very slowly changing with the efforts of people like former President Carter , the creation of alternative PACs such as J - Street ( not a panacea , but a start ) , organisations such as Council for the National Interest ( CNI ) , academic work such as that by Walt and Mearsheimer and the bold , courageous and persistent grassroots work of thousands of people .
Let ’s keep up the pressure , as citizens of our respective countries and faith traditions .
Our survival depends upon it , as well as the Palestinians .
As John Pilger has noted : Gaza is a metaphor for the Middle East , and for the world .
Clinton Fires Back : Obama , Edwards Given ' Free Ride ' Hillary tells Diane Sawyer :
If she breathes deeply , that will be lead story .
Jan. 8 , 2008  -- ` Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , is an experienced leader .
That 's the message she 's been attempting to drive home to voters since announcing her bid for the presidency nearly one year ago .
But now Clinton , who lost the Iowa caucus to not one but two Democratic rivals , stands on the verge of another potential upset in New Hampshire .
The intense pressure on candidates was underscored Monday when Clinton choked up while answering a question during a campaign stop in New Hampshire .
In an interview just hours after that emotional moment , Clinton told ABC News ' Diane Sawyer it was n't so unusual , insisting , " I care about what is going on in peoples lives .
That 's how I got involved in this kind of work .
That 's what I think a president should be concerned about .
And there 's a lot of concern and worry and just people hoping and praying that their problems are gonna be solved . "
Campaigning Monday before the first - in - the - nation primary , the former first lady got emotional and had tears in her eyes as she spoke with voters about how hard it is to balance a busy campaign life , and her passion for the country 's future .
" It 's not easy , and I could n't do it if I did n't passionately believe it was the right thing to do .
You know , I have so many opportunities from this country I just do n't want to see us fall backwards , " she said .
With her voice breaking and tears in her eyes , Clinton continued , " You know , this is very personal for me .
It 's not just political , it 's not just public .
I see what 's happening , and we have to reverse it . "

' Free Ride ' for Obama and Edwards
Sawyer also addressed gender issues with Clinton , asking whether it 's different when a woman — particularly a presidential candidate or president — shows that kind of emotion .
" Well , men do it all the time , " Clinton told Sawyer , " and we 've had that going back at least since Ronald Reagan , I guess , and certainly since then . "
Clinton also took the opportunity to take a shot at her Democratic rivals Sen. Barack Obama and John Edwards .
She said the two men have formed " kinda a buddy system . "
" You know for both Sen. Edwards and Obama , they 've been given pretty much a free ride and that 's fine , " Clinton said .
" I do n't mind having to get up there and take all the scrutiny .
But at some point the free ride ends , maybe it ends now , maybe it ends in a month maybe it ends in the general election .
You can not be elected president if you do not withstand the tough questions . "
The two - term senator acknowledged she 's in unfamiliar territory — for the nation and as a candidate .
" Look , I 'm charting new ground — I know that and you know it 's a little bit of a challenge which I fully accept and I 'm ready to meet . "
Clinton , who took few questions from reporters in Iowa and little more from voters , has changed strategy in New Hampshire , emphasizing a softer side to a person well known to much of the American public .
" I think that Americans know that the people who are running for president are going to put forward who they are and I 'm somebody who deeply cares about what 's going on and I am incredibly passionate about what we need to do in our country , " Clinton told Sawyer on location for " Good Morning America . "
" Now as a woman , " she continued , " I know I 've got to be always presenting a sort of organized front .
And nobody 's ever said that is n't one of my strong suits .
I 'm also a person , to some people 's surprise .
And what gets me up in the morning is not the next speech I 'm going to make , and not the interview I 'm going to do , it 's whether I 'm going to be helping somebody and whether I 'm going to solve a problem for somebody . "
Clinton , who routinely touts 35 years in the public arena , expressed little surprise at the reaction to " the moment . "
" Oh , Diane , I do n't know why .
I feel like if I breathe deeply it 's going to be a lead story and that 's just something that goes with the territory . "
Criticism from rivals also goes with the turf .
After this morning 's event , Edwards expressed his readiness to face the strenuous demands of the presidency .
" What I know is I 'm prepared for that and I 'm in this fight for the middle class and the future of this country for the long haul , through the conventions , straight to the White House , " Edwards told reporters .
However , in an interview Monday with ABC News ' David Muir , Elizabeth Edwards offered more compassion than her husband , noting that everyone on the campaign trail can relate to how grueling the task can be .
At another campaign stop later in the day , Edwards appeared to adopt his wife 's more sympathetic tone .
" These campaigns are very grueling , " he said .
" They 're tough and difficult affairs , running for president is a tough process . "
During a campaign stop at Jake 's Coffee in New London , N.H. , Obama was also asked to comment about Clinton 's teary moment .
" I did n't see what happened , " he said , but added , " I know this process is a grind .
So that 's not something I care to comment on . "
When asked about Edwards ' response by Sawyer , Clinton replied , " I do n't think anybody doubts my toughness .
That 's never been one of the criticisms leveled at me . "
Clinton also said her husband , former President Clinton , and daughter Chelsea have provided her with comfort and strength during the grueling campaign .
" You know , he 's been incredibly supportive and he understands the electoral process better than anybody but he also understands the job of being president , " she said of her husband .
" And every day he says to me , ' You know I really have confidence in you in being the president America needs , ' and that 's more important to me than any kind of pep talk or advice . "
ABC News ' Kate Snow , Eloise Harper , David Muir and Raelyn Johnson contributed to this report .
The Hardest Working Presidential Candidate Logo
Late last year , a slide show in The New York Times , “ Reading Tea Leaves and Campaign Logos ” took to the blogwaves like wildfire .
In it , illustrator Ward Sutton passed mocking judgment ( to great effect ) on all of the 2008 presidential candidate logos , commenting on anything from the type choice to the relative size of the R in Rudy Giuliani ’s logo ( “ Extra large ‘ R ’ to remind you just how Republican he is ” ) .
But in his zeal to mock equally , he certainly got one critique wrong : Obama ‘08 .
Illustration by Ward Sutton for The New York Times .
[ Disclosure : I ’m not a partisan of Obama , and this post is not an endorsement of his campaign or big smile , just a post commenting on a logo . ]
From the day this logo was unveiled I received many e-mails asking whodunit and commenting how much they liked it and how different it was from all other Presidential candidate logos .
Ever .
The logo was designed ( jointly or separately , depending of what you read into each firm ’s blurb ) by Chicago - based Sender LLC and mo/de : “ We were looking at the ‘o ’ of his name and had the idea of a rising sun and a new day , ” explains Sol Sender , “ The sun rising over the horizon evoked a new sense of hope . ”
Sutton at least got the sun rising part right .
“ Undefined ” , on the other hand , might be this logo ’s strongest asset and the result of clever designers not someone “ too inexperienced ” .
I had n’t visited Obama ’s web site in a long time , until last night when a nice designer from Nike e-mailed me pointing out the “ ridiculously nice ” ( as he put it ) implementation of the logo under the “ People ” section of the site .
And , indeed , they were ridiculously well done .
For each segment of people , the logo changes accordingly , tip - toeing a fine line between cliché and clever , and never crossing to the former ’s dark side .
The iterations are quickly identifiable and feel genuinely concerned with connecting to the people they are talking to , without pandering .
The executions are rather flawless and work perfectly on screen with the detailed gradients and subtle background illustrations .
Even the typography is lovingly handled , with each segment changing ever so slightly and unified by the use of Gotham in most of the applications , and using other typefaces as fitting — even the “ kids ” typography looks finessed , despite the looming pitfalls of faux child - drawn typography .
This kind of playful flexibility is typically reserved for the likes of MTV , VH1 or Nickelodeon and the breadth of this kind of brand architecture for global corporations with endless divisions .
A painstaking task , but the flag element of the logo is applied to each state .
Even the holiday edition looks great .
Christmas tree ornaments are on sale , to boot .
The effect of design on political ambitions is likely more important than political advisors would think , but certainly less important than the actual policies of the candidate .
Nevertheless , it ’s encouraging to see design and identity innovation in an otherwise stale category .
Thanks to Darrin Crescenzi for the tip .
If we women do fall victim to some nefarious person , we must remember -- in spite of all the " friendly advice " we 've been given -- that the blame lies solely on the back of those who would harm others .
It ’s the little things .
Not just one by one , like the single instance
I ’m going to describe here , but all the little things put together .
They add up .
They creep up on us and take root in our thoughts .
They
fester and make us doubt ourselves .
They are the thin and small voices
that remind us not to show too much skin at the beach or to put on
" sensible shoes " before walking in unfamiliar areas .
These little
things , often described as " friendly advice , " lay the groundwork for
self - blame .
As I was reading the Iowa Independent commentary by my colleague Douglas Burns , " How to Hit College Campuses with All the Right Moves , " I found myself nodding at most of what he had to say .
That is , until I got to point No. 7 :
Women should always travel with friends to parties .
On the college - campus party landscape , women can be in an especially
vulnerable position .
This goes for universities and small colleges
alike .
Sex . Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

If you doubt this , ask the directors at the women ’s centers on campuses how many calls they get each year about date rapes .
When
a young woman leaves her group of friends and goes it alone at a
fraternity party , a dorm bash or an off - campus gathering , she is at the
greatest risk of becoming a victim .
Remember , perpetrators generally are n’t the guys who pop out from behind trees in the night .
They are friends or acquaintances .
While I find no fault with instructing young people to travel in
groups or with a buddy , I do think it is unfair to only hold females to
this standard of safety .
It implies that women are unable to protect
themselves .
It implies that freedom , at least if you are female , has
consequences .
Far worse still , it implies that women who do choose to
go stag are somehow " asking for it " because — let ’s face it — women
have been warned .
Those men , even those you know , ca n’t be to blame for their actions
if you are alone at a party .
( God forbid that a woman should be both
alone at a party and wearing make - up or perfume ! )
This is presumably
because men are entirely unable to control themselves .
It is just as
your dear old abstinence - only educator taught you : women must have
enough control for both genders .
If I could give Burns and other like - minded people a gift it would
be for them to be able to visit a domestic violence shelter and have
the residents speak openly and honestly to them .
Most who have never
been subjected to that type of situation often think of it in terms of
violence .
We imagine the hitting , the raping , the kicking , the
injuries .
But the really deep stuff is n’t typically what can be seen .
It ’s the stuff that is carried inside — fear and guilt of the same
type , but on a much larger scale , than what Burns is advocating with
his well - meaning advice .
One of the most poignant things I ’ve read this year is " Beyond Rape , " a first - hand account of rape by journalist Joanna Connors .
It details not
only the rape she suffered 20 - some years ago , but her reaction and
embodiment of it .
For more than two decades she believed it was her
private burden , but acknowledges that it became little more than a
" genetic disease " that she probably passed on to her children .
There are some of us — myself included — who have had trauma so
great in our lives that we cannot help but to pass some of the fear ,
guilt and anger to our children .
My children will never have
opportunity to escape their brother ’s death .
Because I ’m afraid , they
will never know a carefree mom who allows them to circle the block
alone on their bicycle .
Only time will tell how many generations of my
family will feel the breeze from the butterfly wings that were
fluttered nearly 10 years ago .
A great song that describes the concept of passing fear and
self - blame to subsequent generations is " Because of You , " sung by Reba
McEntire and Kelly Clarkson :
Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk .
Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I do n’t get hurt .
Because of you I find it hard to trust not only me , but everyone around me .
Because of you I am afraid .
My oldest daughter will begin her junior year in high school this
fall .
In just two short years I will watch , with much more fear than
should be allotted any one mother , as she takes her final few steps
toward independence .
Neither she nor I can escape the fear that has
already been placed in our hearts because of a family member who died
too soon .
But both she and I — as well as all the other women in the
world — can stop this dreadful practice of self - doubt and self - blame .
Women do n’t make men rape them .
Women do n’t " ask for it " by the way
they dress , going alone to parties , having breasts or vaginas , parking
in dark areas , carrying condoms or wearing make - up .
Just like all other members of society , we do our best to protect
ourselves .
If we do fall victim to some nefarious person , we must
always remember — in spite of the multitude of friendly advice we’ve
been given — that the blame lies solely on the back of those who would
harm others .

Are Corporate Media Attacks on French Actress , Marion Cotillard , for 9/11 Comments , a Result of 9/11 Commissioner 's Call for new 9/11 Investigation ?
This week , the corporate media launched into a bizarre full front orchestrated attack on French , Oscar winning actress , Marion Cotillard , for her doubts about the official story of 9/11 .
What makes it bizarre is that she made them over 1 year ago .
So , why drudge them up now ?
It is likely it is part of a futile damage control by US and UK corporate media , who have been accomplices in the 9/11 attacks , some since day 1 .
Why now , are they unloading on Marion Cotillard ?
Because 9/11 Commissioner , war veteran , and former Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey is reportedly calling for an open ended new 9/11 investigation that would stay open for all new emerging facts to be investigated .
This concept has to be striking terror in the hearts of media censors , shills and thugs , who have apparently been involved in the 9/11 cover up and effort to terrorize Americans since day one .
The BBC " somehow " knew that WTC 7 was going to collapse 23 minutes " before " anyone in the world knew it was going to happen .
When this footage was discovered the BBC then engaged in a childish frantic cover up where they claimed to have " lost " all three of their legally required archive films showing their reporter in NYC on 9/11 , announcing the WTC 7 collapse " 23 minutes before it did .
"
CNN apparently was also involved , having foreknowledge of the WTC 7 collapse , about an hour " before anyone in the world " .
Of course corporate media in the US and UK has never spent any time investigating these bizarre examples of insider knowledge they themselves are now proven to have had on 9/11 .
HOWEVER , they have dedicated substantial time acting as thugs , attacking anyone who questions the increasingly transparent official myth of 9/11 .
Rosie O'Donnell and Charlie
Sheen were among the media 's early victims , when they came out and challenged the official story of the building collapses .
The oscar winning French actress is just the latest .
But , again , why are they attacking her now for year old 9/11 comments ?
Not only because of 9/11 Commissioner Kerry 's call for a new 9/11 investigation , for his reported call for one , is just part of an avalanche of 9/11 truth and suspicion bursting forth from government and popular culture .
A 9/11 truth presentation at the European Parliament recently came on the heels of Japanese National television covering their nation 's lead opposition leader hammering their prime minister , as he made a case that their government had been duped by a US government that had involvement in the attacks of 9/11/2001 .
Before that Dennis Kucinich had committed to opening new 9/11 investigations .
Even our friendly neighbor to the north , Canada , is now seeing national CBC television coverage of charges of 9/11 as an inside job .
National television news audiences in Australia , due to the trial of so - called " 9/11 terrorists " are now being exposed to the defense claims that 9/11 was perpetrated by the US government .

Jennifer Buettner was taking care of her young niece when the idea struck her .
The child had a nagging case of hypochondria , and Ms. Buettner ’s mother - in - law , a nurse , instructed her to give the girl a Motrin tablet .
“ She told me it was the most benign thing I could give , ” Ms. Buettner said .
“ I thought , why give her any drug ?
Why not give her a placebo ? ”
Studies have repeatedly shown that placebos can produce improvements for many problems like depression , pain and high blood pressure , and Ms. Buettner reasoned that she could harness the placebo effect to help her niece .
She sent her husband to the drugstore to buy placebo pills .
When he came back empty handed , she said , “ It was one of those ‘ aha ! ’ moments when everything just clicks . ”
Ms. Buettner , 40 , who lives in Severna Park , Md. , with her husband , 7 - month - old son and 22 - month - old twins , envisioned a children ’s placebo tablet that would empower parents to do something tangible for minor ills and reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics and other medicines .

North Carolina superdelegate says she told Clinton camp : ' I know I did n't hear you imply that my vote was for sale '

While voters in Indiana and North Carolina cast their votes , several Hoosier and Tar Heel superdelegates still sitting on the fence shared personal stories with RAW STORY about the pressures and issues that will help them finally decide : Hillary or Barack .
North Carolina superdelegate Dr. Jeannette Council , currently a member of the Cumberland County Board of Commissioners , said her decision will be based on the voters in her district as well as her own conscience .
 Ive been in politics for 30 years and Ive paid my own way to the convention since  72 ,  Council said .
 Ill announce my decision tomorrow because I dont want to influence anyones vote .
The  Wright  thing has probably cost Obama a few points here though I think hell win .
What is most important to me is education , health care , and inspiring the kids and thats what Obama has done .
All of my children are for him .
Dr. Council said that she had been contacted numerous times by both campaigns , though she said the Clinton campaign has been more aggressive .
She seemed upset about calls from the campaign .
" They asked me what it would take to get my vote and I said , ' I dont think I heard you right , ' " Dr. Council told RAW STORY Tuesday .
" ' I know I didnt hear you imply that my vote was for sale . '
' Oh no , ' [ they said ] , ' that was nt what I intended to say at all . ' ... ' Then what the hell do you mean ? ' "
Sounding frustrated by the bitterness of the campaign , Dr. Council said she felt that Obama had been unfairly treated by the press and Senator Clintons campaign .
She has not participated in any presidential candidate events or met with the candidates swarming around her state for the last four weeks .
Economy is focus of second superdelegate Another North Carolina superdelegate , David Parker , says he spends time with both candidates and they constantly ask for his vote , but hes holding out .
 Hillary Clinton told me last night that the elected  delegates could switch their vote at the convention and I told her that she was talking like a lawyer ,  Parker said Tuesday .
 Sure , they can change , but the chances are zero that they re going to change  at least , not on the first ballot . 
Asked if Clintons thinking gave him a good idea whether she was planning to stay in the race until the convention , Parker said ,  Probably . 
 Shes come up in the polls and the timing has been bad for Obama with the Rev.
Wright revelations , but I still think its a good thing because he needs to be bloodied up before he goes into the general election ,  he added .
Parker also said that he wouldnt vote until it became clear there was a winner and he wasnt concerned if the battle went all the way to the Democratic Convention in Denver this August .
 What matters most to me is how the candidates respond to the economy .
Everything points to a troubling fall .
Whichever candidate can convince the voters they can come up with quick results will win the election ,  said Parker .
Asked if he'd be voting for Hillary Clinton because of her gas tax roll - back , Parked laughed and then turned serious .
 I honestly dont know ,  he said .
 Remember , there are a lot of guys like me down here  over - educated white males trying to purge the spot of generations of racial inequality  and that will definitely play a part in my decision . 
Three Indiana superdelegates still undecided
In the Hoosier state , only three superdelegates remain uncommitted .
One is Rep. Peter Visclosky ( D - IN ) , whose endorsement is highly coveted by both camps .
His First District includes the far northwest corner of that state , which borders the south side of Chicago .
The area is largely urban and one of the strongest African - Americans voting blocks in Indiana .
Jacob Ritvo , Communications Director for Congressman Visclosky , told RAW STORY :
 The most important issues to determine who will get his superdelegate vote ; jobs , jobs , jobs , the economy , the war in Iraq , gas prices , and access to healthcare . 
Congressman Visclosky has received lots of mail urging him to support Obama or Clinton and hes been wooed and pursued by both , Ritvo said .
 The Congressman doesnt have any self - imposed timetable ,  Ritvo said .
 Hell wait until after our primary and may choose then or not until this summer .
Another uncommmitted delegate , first - term Congressman Joe Donnelly from Indianas Second District told the Kokomo Tribune ,  Ill vote for the candidate who can do the most to improve health care for Americans and help working families .
Like most uncommitted superdelegates still hanging out on the sidelines , Donnelly said he didnt want his decision to influence any voters .

Since its debut five years ago Monday , Apple 's iTunes Store has sold more than 4 billion songs and accounts for approximately 70 percent of digital music sold worldwide .
In the next five years , it may well account for a staggering 28 percent of all music sold worldwide .
By 2012 , digital music is projected to account for 40 percent of music sold , according to InStat .
If Apple holds onto its current market share , it will account for more than one - quarter of all music sales by its ninth birthday .
Not bad for freeware .
" I 'm very skeptical about whether iTunes can be unseated , because there 's not a lot of consumer pain there , " said Paul Resnikoff , editor of Digital Music News .
Digital Music
News recently found that iTunes is installed on nearly 30 percent of all computers worldwide , making it the most widely installed music store application in the world .
When Apple snapped up a little music program called SoundJam MP back in 2000 , no one predicted that the iTunes application it became would lead to a complete restructuring of the music industry .
Like all journeys , iTunes ' reinvention of the music business began with a single inauspicious step .
The major labels agreed to license their music only to Apple because the iTunes Store ran exclusively on Macs , representing a " sandbox " in which the labels could test the fledgling online music market .
Of course , once the labels saw Mac users snapping up their songs , the Windows version followed soon after , setting the stage for iTunes ' dominion over the digital music market , which it has held onto ever since .
The key to iTunes ' continued success has clearly been the iPod , but as iPod sales plateau , Apple may need to rethink its iTunes strategy , especially because its partners in the music business are looking for ways to give its competition an unnatural advantage .
" Apple is under pressure from the four major labels to change its pricing model to a tiered pricing structure , " said Susan Kevorkian , an IDC audio analyst .
" The way the labels are pressuring Apple is by withholding DRM - free downloads from the service … [ while ] cultivating other online music services , most notably Amazon 's MP3 downloads store . "
But despite its compatibility with the iPod , Amazon is n't stealing many customers from iTunes – only 10 percent of Amazon MP3 customers have bought from iTunes in the past .
" They 're playing on the periphery of this dominant iTunes application , " Resnikoff said .
" Why would I want to go outside of that ? "
Despite the apparent toothlessness of the current Amazon threat , pundits agree that Apple needs to make significant changes to maintain its lead .
Kevorkian thinks
Apple should cede to label demands for tiered pricing to stave off a possible migration to stores that lack DRM and offer lower prices .
Besides , she says , Apple 's 99 - cents - per - song strategy has served its purpose : to put digital music " on the radar " of the music - buying public .
Apple has other ways to grow iTunes without relying on the iPod – even ideas Jobs has pooh - poohed in the past , such as music subscriptions .
The most obvious ( and least likely ) scenario is a PlaysforSure - style subscription service , which would require a new , stronger version of FairPlay DRM and rule out compatibility with older iPods .
A more likely option would be an eMusic - style subscription in which customers get a fixed number of songs per month , receiving a better deal than if they 'd purchased the songs individually .
Then there 's the so - called " unlimited music " iPod , which could be on the horizon .
" We think the issue holding things up is how much money per iPod the labels get , " Kevorkian said .
If Apple tires of butting heads with the labels , it could eventually cut them out of at least part of the equation by forming its own record label to keep a portion of the estimated 65 cents it currently pays out to the labels for each song sold .
" Digital distribution makes the economics of the industry so different , " Kevorkian said .
" That , coupled with Apple 's tremendous brand name and reputation as an online music distributor , could make it a very important point of departure . "
All it would take , she said , is the addition of an A&R department for scouting bands .
Dan Frakes , senior editor of MacWorld , agrees : " I think Apple will eventually work directly with the creators of content , allowing iTunes to sell original content without having to go through the entertainment industry . "
Only Steve Jobs knows which of these paths
Apple will take , but in general , iTunes ' prospects for the next five years looks about as bright as they have been for the last five .
" If Apple keeps doing what it 's doing , " Resnikoff said , " I do n't think you 'll see any factors really eroding iTunes ' installation percentage .
It 's an application that works so well . "
Gallup Daily : Obama Opens Up 16 - Point Lead , Biggest Yet Lead is now 55 % to 39 % over Clinton
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup Poll Daily tracking finds Barack Obama with his largest advantage over Hillary Clinton in Democratic voters ' nomination preferences thus far , 55 % to 39 % .
Obama 's previous largest lead was 11 percentage points , in May 15 - 17 and April 12 - 14 polling .
His widening lead over Clinton has been evident in each of the last three days of tracking , after the two had been more closely matched earlier in the month .
Clinton 's largest lead in the Gallup Poll Daily tracking was 20 points in mid-January , when she led Obama 48 % to 28 % ( John Edwards was still in the race at that time ) .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
Tuesday , voters in Kentucky and Oregon will register their preferences for the Democratic nomination .
Clinton is expected to win Kentucky and Obama Oregon .
There is some speculation that Obama may declare victory given that he is expected to clinch a majority of the delegates available in the state primaries and caucuses ( outside of the contested Florida and Michigan primaries ) .
Clinton has vowed to stay in the race until all the primaries and caucuses have been held in early June .
Despite her growing deficit to Obama in the Democratic race , Clinton continues to poll slightly better than Obama in matchups for the general presidential election vs. John McCain .
The latest tracking results , based on May 14 - 18 polling , shows Clinton with a 48 % to 44 % lead over McCain among registered voters nationwide , while Obama has just a 1 - point edge ( 46 % to 45 % ) over the likely Republican nominee .
-- Jeff Jones
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The Democratic nomination results are based on combined data from May 16 - 18 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 1,261 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
The general election results are based on combined data from May 14 - 18 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 4,444 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

The John McCain campaign has started a new blog , called The McCain Report .
So far there are three posts , all by a single little - known blogger .
The first entry is the standard “ Hello , World ! ” , but it shows a cheeky sense of humor when it jokes about the blog ditching its original lime - green background .
Looks promising , but it goes downhill from there .
The second entry shows what this blog will be all about : it accuses Obama of being “ Changey ” ( a word not in my dictionary , other than for a small town in France — are they accusing Obama of being , um , French ? ) , followed by a quote from McCain where he calls Ahmadinejad a dictator ( note to McCain : Ahmadinejad is n’t even the primary leader of Iran ) .
The second entry ends with a seriously misleading quotation .
They quote an AP article about Jerusalem as saying “ Obama is trying to have it both ways , but there is nothing new about that . ”
They imply that the AP article is saying that there is nothing new about Obama trying to have it both ways .
But the actual quote is “ Obama is trying to have it both ways , but there is nothing new about that .
So does President Bush .
President Clinton did , too . ”
The point being that our last two presidents have also had ambiguous positions on Jerusalem ( which they seem to think might be a good thing , all things considered ) .
The last ( but certainly not least ) entry is “ Attention disaffected Hillary supporters , John McCain is a huge ABBA fan . ”
Followed by a ABBA music video of “ Take a chance on me ” .
Seriously .
UPDATE : According to The Nation , the McCain Report originally had a link to the liberal blog Daily Kos , but apparently that was short lived — the link is gone .
The musical based on Mr Mandela ’s life , on which the curtain will rise in May 2010 , is said to have been on the drawing board for the past five years but the new details contained in Miss Mandela ’s memoir are said to have led to it finally being produced .
DIGG THIS
Americans are taught to expect their elected leaders to be relatively honest .
But it was n’t always like that .
In the mid 1800s , people joked about political candidates who claimed to have been born in a log cabin that they built with their own hands .
This jibe was spurred by William Henry Harrison ’s false claim of a log-cabin birth in the 1840 presidential campaign .
Americans were less naïve about dishonest politicians in the first century after this nation ’s founding .
But that still did not deter presidents from conjuring up wars .
Presidential deceits on foreign policy have filled cemeteries across the land .
George W. Bush ’s deceits on the road to war with Iraq fit a long pattern of brazen charades .
In 1846 , James K. Polk took Americans to war after falsely proclaiming that the Mexican army had crossed the U.S. border and attacked a U.S. army outpost — shedding the blood of our citizens on our own soil . 
Though Polk refused to provide any details of where the attack occurred , the accusation swayed enough members of Congress to declare war against Mexico .
Congressman Abraham Lincoln vigorously attacked Polk for his deceits .
But Lincoln may have studied Polk ’s methods , since they helped him whip up war fever 15 years later .
In 1917 , Woodrow Wilson took the nation to war in a speech to Congress that contained one howler after another .
He proclaimed that self - governed nations do not fill their neighbor states with spies — despite the role of the British secret service and propaganda operations in the prior years to breed war fever in the United States .
Wilson hailed Russia as a nation that had always been democratic at heart — less than a month after the fall of the tsar and not long before the Bolshevik Revolution .
He proclaimed that the government would show its friendship and affection for German - Americans at home — but his administration was soon spearheading loyalty drives that spread terror in many communities across the land .
In 1940 , in one of his final speeches of the presidential campaign , Franklin Roosevelt assured voters ,  Your president says this country is not going to war . 
At the time , he was violating the Neutrality Act by providing massive military assistance to Britain and was searching high and low for a way to take the United States into war against Hitler .
In his 1944 State of the Union address , Roosevelt denounced those Americans with such suspicious souls — who feared that I have made  commitments ’ for the future which might pledge this Nation to secret treaties  at the summit of Allied leaders in Tehran the previous month .
In early 1945 , Roosevelt told Congress that the Yalta Agreement spells the end of the system of unilateral action and exclusive alliance and spheres of influence .
In reality , he signed off on Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and the crushing of any hopes for democracy in Poland .
In August 1945 , Harry Truman announced to the world that  the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima , a military base .
That was because we wished in this first attack to avoid , in so far as possible , the killing of civilians . 
Hiroshima was actually a major city with more than a third of a million people prior to its incineration .
But Truman ’s lie helped soften the initial impact on the American public of the first use of the atomic bomb .
( The U.S. government also vigorously censored photographs of Hiroshima and its maimed survivors . )
Vietnam falsehoods
Presidential and other government lies on foreign policy are often discounted because they are presumed to be motivated by national security .
But as Hannah Arendt noted in an essay on the Pentagon Papers , during the Vietnam War ,
The policy of lying was hardly ever aimed at the enemy but chiefly if not exclusively destined for domestic consumption , for propaganda at home and especially for the purpose of deceiving Congress .
CIA analysts did excellent work in the early period of the Vietnam conflict .
But in the contest between public statements , always over - optimistic , and the truthful reports of the intelligence community , persistently bleak and ominous , the public statements were likely to win simply because they were public ,  Arendt commented .
The truth never had a chance when it did not serve Lyndon Johnson ’s political calculations .
Vietnam destroyed the credibility of both Lyndon Johnson and the American military .
Yet the memory of the pervasive lies of the military establishment did not curb the gullibility of many people for fresh government - created falsehoods a decade or so later .
During the 1980s , the U.S. State Department ran a propaganda campaign that placed numerous articles in the U.S. media praising the Nicaraguan Contras and attacking the Sandinista regime .
As the Christian Science Monitor noted in 2002 , the State Department fed the Miami Herald a make - believe story that the Soviet Union had given chemical weapons to the Sandinistas .
Another tale , which happened to emerge the night of President Ronald Reagan ’s reelection victory , held that Soviet MiG fighters were on their way to Nicaragua . 
The General Accounting Office investigated and concluded that the State Department operation was illegal , consisting of prohibited , covert propaganda activities .
There was no backlash against the government when the frauds were disclosed .
Instead , it was on to the next scam .
Reagan , Bush , and Clinton
Reagan paved the way for subsequent presidents in immersing anti-terrorist policy in swamps of falsehoods .
In October 1983 , a month after he authorized U.S. Marine commanders to call in air strikes against Muslims to help the Christian forces in Lebanon ’s civil war , a Muslim suicide bomber devastated a U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut , killing 242 Americans .
In a televised speech a few days later , Reagan portrayed the attack as unstoppable , falsely claiming that the truck crashed through a series of barriers , including a chain - link fence and barbed - wire entanglements .
The guards opened fire , but it was too late . 
In reality , the guards did not fire because they were prohibited from having loaded weapons — one of many pathetic failures of defense that the Reagan administration sought to sweep under the carpet .
In 1984 , after the second successful devastating attack in 18 months against a poorly defended U.S. embassy in Lebanon , Reagan blamed the debacle on his predecessor and falsely asserted that the Carter administration had to a large extent gotten rid of our intelligence agents . 
A few days later , while campaigning for reelection , Reagan announced that the second embassy bombing was no longer an issue :  We ’ve had an investigation .
There was no evidence of any carelessness or anyone not performing their duty .
However , the Reagan administration had not yet begun a formal investigation .
On May 4 , 1986 , Reagan bragged ,  The United States gives terrorists no rewards and no guarantees .
We make no concessions ; we make no deals . 
But the Iranian arms - for - hostage deal that leaked out later that year blew such claims to smithereens .
On November 13 , 1986 , Reagan denied initial reports of the scandal , proclaiming that the no concessions ’ [ to terrorists ] policy remains in force , in spite of the wildly speculative and false stories about arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments .
We did not — repeat — did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages nor will we . 
But Americans later learned that the United States had sold 2,000 anti-tank weapons to the Iranian government in return for promises to release the American hostages there .
Money from the sale of those weapons went to support the Contras ’ war in Nicaragua ,  as Mother Jones magazine noted in 1998 .
Saddam Hussein ’s invasion of Kuwait in the summer of 1990 provided a challenge for the first Bush administration to get Americans mobilized .
In September 1990 , the Pentagon announced that up to a quarter million Iraqi troops were near the border of Saudi Arabia , threatening to give Saddam Hussein a stranglehold on one of the world ’s most important oil sources .
The Pentagon based its claim on satellite images that it refused to disclose .
One American paper , the St. Petersburg Times , purchased two Soviet satellite images taken of that same area at the same time that revealed that there were no Iraqi troops near the Saudi border — just empty desert .’
Jean
Heller , the journalist who broke the story , commented ,  That [ Iraqi buildup ] was the whole justification for Bush sending troops in there , and it just did n’t exist . 
Even a decade after the first Gulf war , the Pentagon refused to disclose the secret photos that justified sending half a million American troops into harm ’s way .
Support for the war was also whipped up by the congressional testimony of a Kuwaiti teenager who claimed she had seen Iraqi soldiers removing hundreds of babies from incubators in Kuwaiti hospitals and leaving them on the floor to die .
George H.W. Bush often invoked the incubator tale to justify the war , proclaiming that the ghastly atrocities  were akin to  Hitler revisited . 
After the United States commenced bombing Iraq , it transpired that the woman who testified was the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador and that her story was a complete fabrication , concocted in part by a U.S. public relations firm .
Dead babies were a more effective selling point than one of the initial justifications Bush announced for U.S. intervention — restoring Kuwait ’s rightful leaders to their place — as if any Americans seriously cared about putting Arab oligarchs back on their throne .
( A few months before Saddam ’s invasion , Amnesty International condemned the Kuwaiti government for torturing detainees .
)
Bill Clinton ’s unprovoked war against Serbia was sold to Americans with preposterous tales of the Kosovo Liberation Army ’s being freedom fighters , with absurd claims that a civil war in one corner of southeastern Europe threatened to engulf the entire continent in conflict , with wild and unsubstantiated claims of an ongoing genocide , and with a deluge of lies that the U.S. military was not targeting Serb civilians .
Lying and warring appear to be two sides of the same coin .

It remains to be seen whether the citizenry is corrigible on this life - and - death issue .

Obama : McCain ' offensive , ' 'losing his bearings '
On CNN today , Obama was asked about McCain 's making an issue of a Hamas official 's supportive words for Obama .
Obama responded with the same sort of high - road message that seems to have worked fairly well against the gas tax holiday :
The suggestion , he said , was " offensive , " and furthermore a mark that McCain is " losing his bearings " as he pursues the presidency .
" My policy toward Hamas is no different than his , " said Obama , who called McCain 's comment a " smear . "
Senators in Florida have voted to ban fake bull testicles that dangle from the trailer hitches of many trucks and cars throughout the state .
Republican Senator Cary Baker , a gun shop owner from Eustis , Florida , called the adornments offensive and proposed the ban .
Motorists would be fined $ 60 for displaying the novelty items , which are known by brand names like ' Truck Nutz ' and resemble the south end of a bull moving north .
The Florida Senate voted last week to add the measure to a broader transportation bill , but it is not included in the House version .
In a spirited debate laced with double entendre , Senators questioned whether the state should curtail freedom of expression in vehicle accessories .
Critics of the ban included the Senate Rules chairman , Senator Jim King , a Jacksonville Republican whose truck sported a pair until his wife protested .

No , no , no !
Here it is :
Why not just cut off one leg , then stand on your other leg while you hold the melon up in the air like you 're waving a big round heavy green melon - land flag ?
The next step is to find a friend with a machete and a good pitching arm ( and two legs ) .
You then see that he can get a running start when he pitches the machete at the watermelon , so you hop up and down while he takes the device like a machete and flings it curve - ball - style right towards the center of the melon and -- because he's also a magician -- the blade spins down like a ninja and slices the thing through the middle , twists in one decisive motion and carves the seed ring right outta the center , and those seeds fly out into the garden and plant themselves a watermelon tree .
This idea is a good one , by the way , because when the watermelon tree is grown tall , you can cut yourself a branch and use it to fashion a brand new leg for yourself , and then the next time you need the seeds sliced out of a watermelon , you wo n't have to hop , so your friend the pitcher - magician can skip the curveball and just throw a regular old fast one .
Moral of the story ?
" When you gots a magician , you do n't need no MRI . "

Over 100,000 votes went uncounted in Florida 's November 2006 election -- all on the ES&S iVotronic paperless touchscreen voting machines -- as described in a recently released report by Florida Fair Elections Center .
The report , the result of a year - long investigation by FFEC Executive Director Susan Pynchon and FFEC Research Director Kitty Garber , concludes that it was the failure of the iVotronic machines that resulted in thousands of uncounted votes in the closely - contested November 2006 Congressional District 13 race in Sarasota County - - a race that has been the subject of two lawsuits to overturn the results of that election , and which is still the subject of an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Congressional House Administration Committee and the federal Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) .

Three taxi drivers in the southern Mexico city of Tapachula were arrested on Friday for showing pornographic DVDs in their cabs , FOX news reports .
The men were arrested after a female passenger complained to police that a cab driver had turned on a porn video while she and her 6 - year - old son were was riding in the vehicle .
" I asked [ the taxi driver ] to remove the film and he ignored me .
It really bothered me and I asked to get out and went to file a complaint , " Edelma Gonzales said .
Tapachula police spokesman Ramirez told reporters police may fine the drivers for " moral turpitude " or possibly hand the suspects over to state investigators on charges of child sexual molestation .
According to the report , pirated adult DVDs are sold on the streets throughout Mexico and are especially common in Tapachula , a border town across from Guatemala .

The day after admitting he killed a woman and dumped her body on a rural road , a St. Catharines , Ont. , man was released from jail .
Judge Stephen Glithero sentenced Wayne Ryczak , 55 , to one day in jail on Thursday for the death of 29 - year - old Stephine Beck .
The one - day sentence is in addition to time Ryczak already served since his March 5 , 2007 , arrest — time the judge said was equivalent to 30 months .
“ Devastated , we ’re devastated , ” Beck ’s mother , Alice Dort , said from her home in Nova Scotia shortly after a police detective broke the news by phone .
“ This is just so unbelievable . ”
“ There ’s no justice .
None whatsoever .
I ’m just so disgusted . ”
The Crown asked for seven to 10 years in jail .
Ryczak ’s lawyer requested two years less a day to be served in the community .
After deliberating for 20 minutes , Glithero said a 30 - month sentence in the penitentiary would be appropriate and Ryczak had already served it .
Ryczak was also given three years ’ probation .
Exactly what I needed to wake up to .
Thanks , Canada !
This is fucking disgusting .
A 30 - month sentence is appropriate for killing a woman ?
Sure , if she has sex for money !
After all , if you ladies happen to think you can do whatever you want with that vagina of yours , you deserve whatever it is that you get .
Fuck , I am so angry .
Update 05/17 ( matttbastard ) : Ontario NDP Calls for Ontario AG to appeal 1 day sentence :
The Ontario NDP is calling on the attorney general to appeal the one - day sentence of a St. Catharines , Ont. man who plead guilty this week to manslaughter in the strangling death of 29 - year - old Stephine Beck . [ … ]
New Democratic Party Justice Critic Peter Kormos , in an open letter to Attorney General Chris Bentley , called on the province to ensure the sentence is appealed immediately .
“ I tell you , sir , that the community is outraged , ” Kormos wrote in his letter .
“ How can this sentence of one day , and it can barely be called a sentence , be justified ? ”
h/t pale via IM
Update 2 ( matttbastard ) : From The St Catharines Standard :
“ They just dismissed [ Stephine Beck ’s ] life with that sentence , ” said Dee Holman , a member of the community ’s sex - trade task force .
“ They minimized her death . ” [ … ]
Holman said the sentencing made Ryczak appear to be the victim and minimized his use of drugs and prostitutes .
“ ( Beck ) will never have a chance to get her drug and alcohol counselling , ” Holman said .
“ Her life is gone . ”
In sentencing Ryczak Thursday , Judge Stephen Glithero said he was not measuring the value of Beck ’s life .
“ All life is valuable to us as a community , ” he said .
He noted there were people in the courtroom for Wednesday ’s plea hearing wearing T - shirts that read , “ Sex work should n’t equal murder . ”
“ This was not a case whatsoever of anyone preying on a sex - trade worker , ” Glithero said . [ … ]
But Valerie Scott , executive director of Sex Professionals of Canada , which is in favour of legalizing prostitution , said a victim ’s lifestyle is factored into court decisions .
“ It happens all the time , ” she said .
“ The laws against sex work continue to tell people that we ’re disposable .
It ’s OK to kill us and murder us . ”
The Ryczak sentencing puts the “ gold seal of approval ” on those actions , she said .
“ If this were anyone else , it would n’t have gone down like that in court . ”
Update 3 05/18 ( matttbastard ) : Via ange @ light my heart on fire ( all emphases mine ) :
Unfortunately , the case of Stephine Beck is not an anomaly .
Within the last decade , six other women involved in sex work and living with substance abuse problems have been found murdered in the Niagara Region : Dawn Stewart , 32 ; Nadine Gurczenski , 26 ; Diane Dimitri , 33 ; Margaret Jugaru , 26 ; Cassey Cichocki , 22 , and most recently , Shari Bacon , 36 .
Although the Niagara Regional Police convened a task force in 2007 and have since made one other arrest , Glithero ’s sentence is reflective of a community - wide failure to value and protect the lives of some of the region ’s most vulnerable citizens .
The St. Catharines Standard routinely runs articles about “ hookers loyal to their drug problems ” ( 6 March , 2007 ) while the police department justifies its regular sweeping arrests of prostitutes ( and subsequent public naming in The Standard , which does not report the names of men arrested for domestic abuse ) by claiming that if you take away the supply , demand will vanish ( July 2007 ) .
This appalling disdain for and ignorance of the realities and risks faced by sex workers is all the more horrifying when compared to the hysteria and moral outrage expressed by the entire Niagara community during and after the arrests , trials and verdicts of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka .
That Homolka ’s plea bargain was considered a deal with the devil while Ryczak was set free immediately upon pleading guilty is shameful and hypocritical , and reflects a clear double standard when it comes to which lives are valued and which are not .

I did n't post John Berry 's most recent article , Fed Actions Defuse Subprime ARM Rate Reset Bomb , because I was n't sure if interest rate resets are the major source of the foreclosure problem .
There 's evidence that falling prices are the main source of the foreclosure problem , not interest rate resets , and I did n't want to push the " do n't worry so much " point , or focus attention on resets , if that is not the right thing to look at .
First , here 's Brad DeLong 's summary of John Berry 's article :
John Berry Notes that the ARM Reset Bomb Has Been Somewhat Diffused ... , by Brad DeLong :
He writes , for Bloomberg : Bloomberg : Many analysts and public officials have said that foreclosures of subprime adjustable - rate mortgages would soar this year as owners ' monthly payments jumped when interest rates reset to a higher level .
Not only is that unlikely to happen , this year 's resets of earlier vintages of subprime mortgages may even reduce some payments that increased in 2007 .
The reason ?
The index to which many ARMs are tied is the six - month London inter - bank offered rate , or Libor , and that rate has fallen from more than 5.3 percent last fall to about half that level .
The Federal Reserve 's cuts in its target for the overnight lending rate -- the last to 2.25 percent on March 18 -- from 5.25 percent in mid-September , plus actions to increase liquidity in the inter - bank lending market , have caused the Libor to fall .
Unfortunately , most of the defaults and foreclosures that have wreaked havoc in financial markets have n't been due to resets so far .
Many borrowers simply bought a house or condo they could n't afford unless bailed out by rising prices , and lower rates alone wo n't help them much .
Still , the big drop in Libor means there likely will be many fewer foreclosures than there would have been .
Much of the discussion about the danger of resets has focused on the initial interest rate , or ``teaser rate , '' that ARMs carried .
That left the impression it was a very low rate that would adjust up a lot .
Most of the initial rates were 8.5 percent or above , and now many are set to adjust hardly at all ...
Here 's why I wonder if this is missing the main factor behind foreclosures .
This is Richard Green ( original post with graph ) :
Is Everything we Know About Subprime Wrong ? , by Richard Green : Yesterday I saw a great talk by Paul Willen of the Boston Fed .
An earlier version of the paper he gave is here .
I do n't think I am caricaturing what he said to say when I describe the following takeaways from his talk : ( 1 ) Falling house prices lead to defaults more than defaults lead to falling house prices .
... ( 2 ) Interest rate resets have little of anything to do with the large number of defaults we are observing .
For the vast majority of subprime loans , defaults or refinances happen before resets take place .
It is moreover the case that the size of the resets is smaller than most of us think , because the initial teaser rates are pretty high .
( 3 ) While ARMs have higher default rates than FRMs , putting ARM borrowers into FRMs will not necessarily reduce defaults .
...
Beyond this last point , a working paper I have with Cutts and Ramogopal shows that ARM borrower are fundamentally more likely to be risk - takers than FRM borrowers , so the difference in loan performance between the two products may say more about the distributions of the different borrowers , rather than the products themselves .
In any case , all of this means that many of the policies being pushed at the moment ( such as interest rate freezes ) may not be particularly helpful in resolving the crisis .
I decided to post on this after all because a debate has broken out about whether Berry 's conclusion about resets is correct .
But if resets are n't the big problem we should worry about , whether he 's right or wrong is n't as important and we should shift our focus away from resets and toward policies that prevent or attenuate falling prices .
With respect to the debate over resets , here 's Andrew Leonard with a summary of Yves Smith 's criticism of Berry 's conclusions :
Whatever happened to the great ARM reset crisis ? , by Andrew Leonard : Remember all the concerns expressed about the great ARM reset bulge of 2008 , when the introductory , low - rate periods of millions of adjustable - rate mortgages were supposed to expire and send countless more American homeowners into foreclosure ?
On Thursday , Bloomberg News columnist John Berry suggested that the reset crisis would n't be as bad as once predicted .
He gave two reasons : First , the interest rate cuts orchestrated by the Fed are having the desired trickle down effect of putting downward pressure on the interest rates that various ARMs will reset at , and second , contrary to popular belief , most borrowers do n't actually have mortgages with absurdly low initial interest rates , so they wo n't suffer too much damage .
...
Berry based his conclusions on data presented in a recent report from two New York Federal Reserve Bank economists ...
I read Berry 's column on Thursday and considered noting it here .
How the World Works savors contrarian takes .
But in my judgment , over the past two years that I 've been following his coverage of the Federal Reserve and the economy , Berry has consistently understated the potential harm that might be wreaked by the housing bust and credit crunch .
...
So I decided not to call attention to yesterday 's Berry column , figuring it just was n't that interesting that someone who has a track record of optimism about the economy was ladling out some more good cheer .
With this background , readers might therefore understand why I was intrigued to read Naked Capitalism 's Yves Smith analyze Berry 's column this morning and call it " extraordinarily misleading . "
Emphasizing that the data
Berry based his conclusions on came from just one month of mortgage - backed securities issued by just one mortgage lender , Smith took the time to look at a database containing information on 38 million mortgages issued between 2004 and 2006 .
That database shows that out of 8.4 million ARMS originating during that time period , only 9.1 percent had initial interest rates of 8.5 percent or higher .
A whopping 1.1 million were 2 percent or lower .
( Contrast that to Berry 's assertion that " most of the initial rates were 8.5 percent or more . " ) ...
Again , though , we should n't get too wrapped up in this debate if it is not the source of the problem .
If it 's prices and not resets , then policy prescriptions need to deal with price effects , e.g. setting a price floor , rather than wasting a lot of time constructing proposals to insulate homeowners from interest resets .
On price floors and mortgage bailouts to prevent foreclosures , it 's nice to see people coming around to the idea .
Ryan Avent of The Bellows discusses how we determine irresponsible actions , if we even can , and what this means for policy :
More on Mortgage Bailouts , The Bellows :
It should be clear that I ’m coming around on the idea of providing assistance to struggling homeowners , for a number of different reasons .
A big one is that the case for concern about moral hazard grows weaker by the day .
In looking at McCain ’s mortgage assistance plan ( which is , basically , there will be none ) , you see that he does n’t want to reward those who got themselves into this position by acting irresponsibly .
But is it the case that most of the people harmed by the housing collapse are those who acted irresponsibly ?
...
The ... fate of an individual homeowner depends on the state of the market .
McCain says he does n’t want to reward folks who bought a house knowing they could only afford it if prices continued to rise .
Fine .
How does he feel about folks who bought a house knowing they could afford it so long as prices did n’t decline by 20 percent ?
Or so long as half the surrounding homes did n’t enter foreclosure ?
Why is this important ?
Let me quote OFHEO :
The causal relationship between home prices and foreclosures is two - directional : high foreclosure activity can both cause and be caused by home price declines .
Home price declines can cause foreclosures by decreasing the equity homeowners have in their properties .
Mortgagors are much more likely to default on their loans if the current value of their property falls below the outstanding loan balance ...
Declines in home prices will increase the frequency with which homeowners ... “ walk away ” from the property and the mortgage .
Home foreclosures contribute to weakening prices by introducing additional supply to the inventory of unsold homes .
Compounding this influence is the fact that the sellers of foreclosed homes , frequently creditors , may be strongly averse to holding onto the property for an extended period of time .
As a result , they may be willing to sell for lower prices than resident homeowners .
So , we had some borrowers who were going to default if prices quit skyrocketing .
When prices quit skyrocketing , they went belly up , and prices stopped rising entirely .
Then the borrowers who needed prices to rise at least a little went belly up , pushing prices downward .
Then the borrowers who needed prices to at least stay level went belly up , pushing prices downward .
You see where this is going .
At the same time , troubles in credit markets due to defaults have pushed up key interest rates and made it difficult for potential buyers to get loans , heaping still more downward pressure on housing markets .
The end result is that a lot of people who were n’t speculating , and who were n’t really being too reckless , have found themselves in a great deal of trouble .
At some point the best way to handle this issue is not to make sure that wrongdoers are punished , because the damage has simply spread too far and included too many people who were n’t trying to game the system .
At that point , you bail out the system to keep it from sinking , and you fix the rules that allowed this situation to arise in the first place .
We ’re at that point , and the failure to recognize that fact will mean that this cataract just sucks in a steadily widening field of homeowners , who are steadily less responsible for the problems we face .
That 's the argument I 've been making , " you bail out the system to keep it from sinking , and you fix the rules that allowed this situation to arise in the first place . "
Update : I have a question , and it 's come up in comments as well .
It 's easy to explain how interest rate resets could increased foreclosure rates since the monthly housing payment will change as a result of the reset , but why do falling prices cause increased foreclosures ?
Falling prices do n't change monthly payments , so why do more people default ?
I can think of one reason .
Every month , a certain number of people will become unemployed and the unemployment event itself could cause foreclosures if they cannot meet monthly payments .
But the problem is worse when prices are falling below loan values since if the person needs to move to take a new job , the only option they may have is to move and default on the loan , or stay where they are and default on the loan ( and there 's no longer any equity in the house that can be used to tide them over until they get another job ) .
Thus , as housing prices fall and this happens more and more often , we see foreclosure rates increasing ( the fall in housing prices may be associated with rising unemployment rates making it worse ) .
Similarly , many housing sales are driven by divorce .
When this happens and neither person can make the payments alone , it 's often necessary to sell the house .
If prices are falling , default is more likely since they may not be able to make up the difference between the loan value and the value of the house .
Neither of these explanations have much to do with people making bad decisions about the housing purchase per se , if they had stayed employed or stayed married they could have made the payments , but that 's not what happened .
When housing prices are falling below loan values , the problems people experience in life are amplified .
How else could falling prices increase foreclosures ?
Update : Richard Green gives an answer :
More on Airplane Seat Cameras
I already blogged this once : an airplane - seat camera system that tries to detect terrorists before they leap up and do whatever they were planning on doing .
Amazingly enough , the EU is “ testing ” this system :
Each camera tracks passengers ’ facial expressions , with the footage then analysed by software to detect developing terrorist activity or potential air rage .
Six wide - angle cameras are also positioned to monitor the plane ’s aisles , presumably to catch anyone standing by the cockpit door with a suspiciously crusty bread roll .
But since people never sit still on planes , the software ’s also designed so that footage from multiple cameras can be analysed .
So , if one person continually walks from his seat to the bathroom , then several cameras can be used to track his facial movements .
The software watches for all sorts of other terrorist - like activities too , including running in the cabin , someone nervously touching their face or excessive sweating .
An innocent nose scratch wo n’t see the F16s scrambled , but a combination of several threat indicators could trigger a red alert .
This pegs the stupid meter .
All it will do is false alarm .
No one has any idea what sorts of facial characteristics are unique to terrorists .
And how in the world are they “ testing ” this system without any real terrorists ?
In any case , what happens when the alarm goes off ?
How exactly is a ten - second warning going to save people ?
Sure , you can invent a terrorist tactic where a system like this , assuming it actually works , saves people — but that ’s the very definition of a movie - plot threat .
How about we spend this money on something that ’s effective in more than just a few carefully chosen scenarios ?

Wall Street fears the light
The fear in Wednesday 's stock decline was palpable .
Wall Street was responding to the specter of transparency the way it always does — with alarm .
Big brokerage firms , led by Merrill Lynch and Lehman Bros. , plunged after the nation 's top securities cop called for more disclosure of Wall Street 's finances .
The decline was the biggest in two months for financial stocks .
Securities and Exchange Commission chief Christopher Cox said his agency later this summer will require investment banks to make more capital and liquidity information public .
In other words , these publicly traded firms will have to give their investors a more accurate financial picture of what they 're doing .
Those who own shares in investment banks have reason to worry .
The bright light of public scrutiny almost always costs Wall Street money .
It 's an institution , after all , that profits most when it can exploit the ignorance of others .
Creature of the night
Wall Street prefers the dark , where it can control the information meted out to investors .
It 's no coincidence , after all , that market participation exploded with the advent of the World Wide Web , which made stock prices readily available with minimal delay to average citizens .
Nor is it surprising that companies such as Bloomberg became multibillion - dollar businesses by taking information once held exclusively in the dark hallways of Wall Street and making it available to those with money at risk .
In the 1970s , when the SEC forced Wall Street to disclose brokerage commissions , rates tumbled and Wall Street 's profitability shifted to other businesses such as investment banking .
Something similar happened in the bond market .
As real - time pricing seeped in , investors could see the difference between their bids and the seller 's asking price , known as the spread .
The spread represented brokers ' profit .
If you wanted to know the price of a municipal or corporate bond , you had to ask your broker .
You assumed he was giving you an accurate price and that he was n't inflating the spread for his own benefit .
When pricing became more transparent , the spreads narrowed .
Information , after all , is the foundation of competition .
Worries no wonder
Is it any wonder , then , with Wall Street facing new disclosure demands over its finances that investors are worried ?
Most investment banks provide some basic liquidity information in their quarterly financial statements , and some provide more detailed data to the SEC that the commission currently does n't make public .
Cox 's plan would require banks to disclose that information and provide more details about funding and capital ratios .
Eventually , firms also will have to reveal their concentrated exposure to key markets , he said .
For example , had the rule been in place this year , Bear Stearns would have had to discuss its vulnerability to the collapsing mortgage market .
International rules
Commercial banks already have to release this kind of data under the international standards by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , a 10 - nation consortium of central bankers .
The Basel Committee is developing a new set of standards that would require similar disclosure from investment banks .
It 's unclear whether better disclosure would have saved Bear Stearns .
Certainly , it would have given investors a clearer picture of what they were buying into .
Cox , of course , is on the defensive , facing questions from Congress and the investing public over the SEC 's failure to head off Bear Stearns ' demise .
Exposing time bombs
As the SEC stood on the sidelines , the Federal Reserve stepped in and brokered a fire sale deal to JPMorgan Chase , in part because it worried that Bear 's failure would spark a cascade of financial institution failures that would reverberate through the short - term debt markets .
Cox 's plan might not have prevented that , but it may have caused investors to question Bear 's exposure to mortgage securities long before those holdings became fatal .
Who knows what other time bombs may be ticking on Wall Street 's books ?
What other financial risks have investment banks understated in the name of fast profits ?
That 's what Wall Street is worried about .
When we turn on the lights , its party is over .

What this page is for :
Despite being a signatory ( since 1995 ) to the UN Convention on Racial Discrimination , Japan has taken no legislative action to bar businesses and other public places from refusing entry to customers based on nationality and race .
Starting from 1993 in Otaru , Hokkaido , and now running unchecked throughout Japan , signs saying " JAPANESE ONLY " etc have gone up , making an unspoken undercurrent of fear of the outsider into clear , present , and brazen exclusionism -- following the best traditions of segregation and apartheid .
The Japanese government 's steadfast refusal to outlaw this form of discrimination by nationality and race has only made the situation worse , so the time has come for the grassroots to take matters to the street .
Or to the internet , as it were .
This page will call for the sanction of public shame by putting up photos of those exclusionary enterprises , including name , address , phone number , etc .
The photos have dates for when they were taken .
Some signs depicted may ( thankfully ) no longer be up ; however , the photos will stay up in perpetuity , as a record of past misdeeds that should not be allowed to fade into anecdotery ( criminal records , after all , linger for individual miscreants ) .
Contact the business in question to see if an exclusionary policy is still in effect .
Submissions to The Rogues ' Gallery are welcome .
I ask the submitter to please send a reasonable - quality photo of 1 ) the storefront ( if possible with name of the establishment clear and the sign displayed ) and 2 ) a closeup of the exclusionary sign , dated , with the name and approximate address of the place .
( Sorry , we cannot " just take your word for it " that some place excluded you -- we need a sign of some sort or else there will be libel lawsuits ) .
I would prefer that these places be open to anyone ( i.e. that these places not be sex shops or enterprises specifically catering to the prurient interest -- because in these cases the issue gets blurry .
However , bars , discos , etc are acceptible . ) .
Particularly those which are essential for daily life ( hotels , stores , restaurants , public baths , housing etc. ) .
Your anonymity will be respected .
That 's what the photos are for -- incontrovertible evidence .
I recommend that readers tell their friends , particularly their Japanese friends , to stay away from the following establishments , even register a complaint with the owner or manager for an unreasonable policy .
Japanese yen coming from foreigners has the same value as if it came from a Japanese .
There is no justifiable reason whatsoever , regardless of the business ' past experience with some foreign custom , to apply a blanket exclusion to everyone who looks foreign .
That is why there is an international treaty against it .
And why , if Japan would keep treaty promises made all the way back in 1996 , there should be a law against it .

LOCATIONS WITH OPEN - DOOR POLICIES FOR NON - JAPANESE CUSTOMERS
Yes , there are places which publicly recognize that refusing customers on the basis of color of skin or passport is not cricket .
They should be known about here as well to provide balance .
The Nago Bar and Restaurant Association in Nago , Okinawa , is bucking the trend with open - door signs ( since Okinawan refusals of American soldiers -- therefore all foreigners -- are Legion ) .
As are realtors in Saitama Prefecture with stickers saying they 'll rent to anyone regardless of nationality .
Well and good .
May these businesses prosper .

Otaru ( Hokkaido )
ONSEN YUNOHANA
( Address : Otaru - Shi Temiya 1 - 5 - 20 , Phone ( 0134 ) 31-4444 ) EXCLUDES FOREIGNERS
FROM ITS OPENING DAY , JULY 1998 .
The tall photo on the left was taken on Sept 19 , 1999 in front of Yunohana " Onsen " super - sento , the largest family - oriented bathhouse in Otaru .
Note the red arrow .
It points to a doorside placard exclaiming in red orthography " JAPANESE ONLY " in English , Japanese , and Russian .
Closeup of this sign is directly below this text .
( Photo Credits : Olaf Karthaus and Dave Aldwinckle )
However , as the red sign in English proved highly photogenic in the international media , it would be replaced ( see Olaf in the yellow coat substantiating the date , January 3 , 2000 ) .
The new sign by Olaf still refuses foreigners by saying , in translation by Arudou Debito , " Due to various circumstances , we are refusing entry to foreigners .
Furthermore , we will be deliberating on this policy from now on . "
This " deliberation period would stretch stretch out for over a year -- even for two and a half months after Arudou Debito went to the onsen on Oct 31 , 2000 to be refused as a Japanese citizen .
It ended suddenly when a lawsuit against them for racial discrimination was made public on Jan 16 , 2001 ; within 24 hours , within the wee hours of Jan 17 , 2001 , the sign was down and replaced by two photocopies -- outlining bathing rules provided by the city , and four conditions for entry for foreigners only .
But only , of course , after sixteen months ( Sept 1999 to Jan 2001 ) of fruitless negotiations with Yunohana and hand - wringing by the Otaru City authorities .
STATUS REPORT : In April 2006 , the Otaru Lawsuit finished -- the Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal , claiming it is " not a constitutional issue " .
Read more about the Otaru Onsens Case in book form here in two languages .
Yunohana still refuses all foreigners " who do not speak Japanese " at all ( now three ) of their bathhouses -- in Otaru Temiya , Otaru Asari , and Sapporo Minami -ku Jozankei , one of Hokkaido 's biggest onsen resort areas .
As of 2012 , word has reached the Rogues ' Gallery moderator that Yunohana no longer has exclusionary policies .
Monbetsu City ( Hokkaido )
( click on pictures to see larger image )
Photos taken November 15 , 2003 , by Arudou Debito
LOCATION : " Yukemuri Monbetsu Tokkari no Yu " bathhouse ( Monbetsu- shi Saiwai - chou 4 - 1 - 1 , Ph. 01582-4-1726 ) , opened April 2003 as a public - private sector hybrid ( dai - san sector ) .
Photo taken Sept 16 , 2003 .
The Japanese version of the sign translates as : " Because manners are not observed , for the time being , we refuse entry to all sailors of foreign ships . "
The Russian version is much more direct : " Where is , dear sirs , your respect for our rules ?
In the bath the entrance of STAFF OF FOREIGN SHIPS is temporarily PROHIBITED . "
ロシア語で この看板はもっと率直です（ロシア語が読める友人が出典、●●の間は強調のために 原文が大文字） 。
----------------------------------------------------
「 船員様よ、我々の ●ルール● に対する尊 敬はどうなりましたか？当分の間、我々の風呂には ●外国船乗り組み員● の入浴が ●禁じられています● 」 。
---------------------------------------- ------------
According to the Japanese press , the bathhouse claims Russian sailors have been making a mess and decided to ban their entry .
It joins the ranks of Hamanasu Shoutengai and Monbetsu Onsen ( behind Monbetsu Prince Hotel ) , which have been refusing all foreigners with " Japanese Only Store " signs ( " nihonjin senyou ten " , in Russian , see below ) and policies unabated since 2000 ( http:// www.debito.org/lawsuitbackground.html#end-year), despite government warnings and negative publicity .

STATUS REPORT : SUCCESS !
Thanks to all the press coverage , as of January 23 , 2004 , " Yukemuri Monbetsu Tokkari no Yu " has taken its signs down ( see photo above ) and opened its doors to customers of all nationalities ( However , they do explain the rules using multilingual notices at the counter to foreign - looking customers ; so if you find that belittling , sorry .
Politely express your discontent to the management .
This is still progress . )
( Photo taken by Arudou Debito on February 5 , 2004 .

And as of January 4 , 2005 , a visit Tokkari no Yu revealed a sign that says , in Russian and Japanese , that rules must be followed or the police will be contacted .
We were given no hassles at the counter , either .
Three Russians we met inside were rule - abiding , of course .

LOCATION : " JOY " Restaurant ( a buffet all - you - can - eat style family restaurant inside the abovementioned " Yukemuri Monbetsu Tokkari no Yu " bathhouse )

English : " Please .
If you are not accompanied by a Japanese or by a Japanese speaker , you are not allowed to enter the premises . "

NHK reported on July 4 , 2000 , that the Ministry of Justice Division of Human Rights , Asahikawa Branch , issued a letter of warning ( Japanese here ) to a restaurateur 's union ( inshokuten kumiai ) in Hamanasu Doori , a nightlife district in Monbetsu City , Hokkaido .
This union , it is revealed , has since 1995 actively solicited , made , and sold signs which said , in Cyrillic , " Japanese - Only Store " ( see photo at left ) - - ostensibly to shut out all Russian sailors visiting this seaport town .
By year - end and despite the Ministry Justice , a February 28 , 2001 broadcast of TBS TV Program " Koko ga Hen da yo , Nihonjin " , about 50 establishments still have the exclusionary signs up .

STATUS REPORT : Sept 2003 newspaper articles indicate the problem is spreading , and a phone call to a Monbetsu journalist shortly afterwards by Arudou Debito reveals the signs are still up in some places , unabated , after nearly a decade .

NEW STATUS REPORT : ( February 9 , 2004 ) SUCCESS !
Thanks to all the press coverage and repeated entreaties to the management by Olaf Karthaus and Arudou Debito to take the signs down , both Karaoke Parlor O-edo and Restaurant " Joy " have taken their signs down ( see photos below ) and opened its doors to customers of all nationalities .
( Photos taken by Arudou Debito and friends on February 6 and 7 , 2004 .

( February 6 , 2004 , Monbetsu , Hokkaido ) Karaoke Parlor " O- edo " has its " Japanese Only " sign in Russian taken down by Olaf Karthaus ( left ) and Arudou Debito .
( February 8 , 2004 , Monbetsu , Hokkaido )
However , the signs still remain up at Sunakku " Don " and Monbetsu Onsen , as well as 26 other places around Monbetsu , according to local sources which went from bar to bar on a sign hunt on January 30 , 2004 .
A cursory search by Rogues ' Gallery Monitor on January 3 - 5 , 2005 still found at least five in plain sight .

UPDATE AUGUST 2006 :
Another sign bites the dust :
( Click on photo for larger image .
Photo taken August 28 , 2006 by Chris Gunson . )
Location : Yakiniku Restaurant Mitsuen ( Monbetsu Ph 01582-4-3656 ) , just off Hamanasu Doori .
Hear a sound file of how Rogues ' Gallery Monitor Arudou Debito ( pictured above in tip - top condition , having cycled 800 kms to get there negotiated to get the sign down ( with Debito stuttering in surprise at how easy it was , and Chris giggling at the end ) !
Note the recording device on Debito 's collar , and the cat to the back left .
That cat was fed shortly before by the owners .
Cats welcome , foreigners not .
Luckily , when we asked them to take the sign down , they quickly complied !
Pity it only took six years and a coaxing from us .
Wakkanai ( Hokkaido )
( ２００１ 年４月和英ルポはこちらです。 2001 Eyewitness report in English and Japanese here . ）
Location : YURANSEN ONSEN ( Wakkanai - Shi Suehiro 3 - 6 , Ph ( 0162 ) 24-2619 -- see sign at right ) , which actually provides separate entrances for foreigners .
There are three segregated facilities -- the REGULAR BATHS , which as offically - recognized Public Baths ( Koushuu Yokujou ) cost 360 yen to get into ( 460 additional for sauna entry ) , and FAMILY BATHS , which cost 800 yen ; both of these facilities are forbidden to foreigners .
The third facility is the SAUNA FOR FOREIGN GUESTS ( see pictures below ) , where foreigners pay a flat fee of 2500 yen ( including rental of towel , trunks , and bathrobe ) .
This is in violation of Section Two , Clause 1 of the Hokkaido Public Bath Ordinance ( Koushuu Yokujou Hou Shikou Jourei , Hokkaido Jourei No 3 ) , which establishes that Public Baths are " necessary and essential " ( hitsuyou fukaketsu ) enterprises for the public health of " regional residents " ( chiiki juumin ) -- which of course includes taxpaying foreigners .
It is also unisex ( not divided between male and female sections ) , which is illegal .
Governmental awareness of this activity has been confirmed by Mr Kouno , Wakkanai Hokensho Seikatsu Eiseika Kankyou Eisei Kakari ( ph. 0162-23-6161 ) , who acknowledges this exclusion of foreigners but claims they are powerless to stop it .
Moreover , this flaunting of the law has an important impact on the atmosphere of enforcement .
Mr Ohshima , owner of the Wakkanai franchise of the Yuransen chain , told Dave Aldwinckle on April 9 , 2000 , " Everyone know 's I 'm doing this , and nobody has stopped me .
So it is not illegal . "
Moreover , Mr Ohshima told Olaf Karthaus , fellow coordinator of this project , who was turned away at the door on August 10 , 1998 , after cycling 141 kms : " Well , Otaru is doing it , so so can we . "
Photo proof follows ( all photos in this section courtesy of Olaf Karthaus and Dave Aldwinckle , taken April 9 , 2000 ) :
Yuransen is a big place ( the biggest in Wakkanai proper ) , and it opened on January 23 , 1997 with segregated facilities , according to Mr Ohshima .
Here is a picture of the front , showing a sign for all three facilities :
Understandibly this is a little hard to see , so let me guide you .
The Blue Arrow points to the words " Kazoku Buro Iriguchi " , or " Family Bath Entrance " .
The Yellow Arrow points to " Koushuu Yokujou Iriguchi " , or " Public Bath Entrance " .
The Red Arrows point to the signs , at both the Family and Public Bath entranceways ( in English and more detailed Russian only , not Japanese ) , which say " Sauna For Foreign Guests " , with a separate entranceway around the corner .
Here is a closeup of the signs by the Public Bath entrance in front for a better view :
Again , note the price difference .
360 yen for Japanese entering the front door , but for those deemed " foreign " , their designated side door has a sign saying :
Yes , that 's 2500 yen , over six times as much .
Of course , it does say underneath ( sorry it is so hard to read ) , " Including the fee for renting a bath towel , a bathrobe , and a pair of bathing trunks " , which might sound closer to value for money .
But foreigners do n't get the choice -- many certainly do n't need to " rent " bathing trunks .
Plaintiff Arudou Debito / Dave Aldwinckle went inside the Gaijin Baths with Mr Ohshima on April 9 , 2000 , and attests that the tubs and sauna are significantly smaller than the Japanese - only side ( this was also confirmed by the manager , Mr Ohshima ) .
( ２００１ 年４月和英ルポはこちらです。 2001 Eyewitness report in English and Japanese here . ）
Most tellingly , the definition of " foreignness " for these exclusionary onsen starts from puberty .
This was seen at Yuransen on July 30 , 2000 , 1 pm , when Hokkaido International School 's basketball coach Adam Fraser cycled from Teshio to Wakkanai ( a distance of 110 kms ) accompanied by four of his male international students .
One Japanese / American student was 14 years old and living in Japan eight years , another Japanese / American was 16 years old living in Japan five years , one American had lived in Japan twelve of his 16 years , and one South African boy was born in Japan and lived here all his life .
All students spoke fluent Japanese and knew Japanese bathing customs from a very young age , yet all were refused at Yuransen 's door and told to go the Gaijin Bath .
The two Japanese - American students eventually mentioned their dual nationality and were let in , but the Caucasian coach and his two other Caucasian students were left standing outside until they finished .
There is no other onsen within 15 kms ( i.e. a long bikeride ) of Yuransen ( NB : there are bathing facilities at downtown hotel , but it is not an official public bathhouse ) , the stranded three eventually got the sweat off their bodies by bathing in the salty sea .
This silliness must stop as it is thusly affecting our children , the ultimate innocents under these policies .
NEWS FLASH : International Herald Tribune ( April 23 , 2004 ) , from New York Times ( May 12 , 2004 ) on discrimination in Wakkanai and Monbetsu , Japan : " Unwelcome Mat : Bars in a Japanese port keep Russians outside " .
STATUS REPORT ( August 2006 ) : Public Bathhouse Yuransen went bankrupt in March 2006 , maintaining its exclusionary rules all the way to the bitter end .

The front door bearing all the signs above is behind the pillar and boarded up .
The " Gaijin Bath " segregated entranceway is along the wall to the right , between the boarded - up windows .
So much for its claim that foreigners , if let in , would drive them out of business .
It 's rival onsen , " Doumu " ( the northernmost onsen in Japan ) , is no doubt taking up the slack .
And it does not refuse foreigners entry .
Anybody hearing any lessons here ?
Ii kimi da .
LOCATION : SHIDOU SPORTS SHOP ( Wakkanai Shiomi 2-6 - 28 )
Here is a photo of the storefront .
It has a sign on the front door , in Russian , which we could not read because we are not Russian speakers ( see Red Arrow ) .
A Russian friend sent us a translation later .
The sign reads : " They ask Russians no enter " ( sic )
Karthaus and Aldwinckle entered Shidou Sports in April 2000 and asked about what the sign meant , and if we as foreigners were permitted to be in here .
The staff said , " It means no Russians may enter , " and then went on to indicate that we should not be in here .
When we asked about our friends in Wakkanai who said they were excluded from this store , yet were not Russian and spoke Japanese , the staff said that foreigners should be accompanied by Japanese who will take responsibility for them .
Why ?
" Russians shoplift , throw cigarette butts on the linoleum floor , try on clothes and leave their body smell ( taishuu ) on them , and generally scare the Japanese customers . "
That may indeed be a problem , but store 's anti-Russian policy is also applied to all unescorted white foreigners .
STATUS REPORT : ( As of April 2000 ) Shidou Sports took their sign down .

Sapporo ( Hokkaido )
In response to both police - stoked fears of foreign hooliganism and the profit motive ( with the publisher of Sapporo 's bilingual information magazine , XENE , offering translation services to xenophobes ) , " Members Only " signs ( Japanese are automatically " members " , naturally - - especially since the signs are not even in Japanese ) proliferated around Susukino and downtown Sapporo during the 2002 World Cup .

STATUS REPORT : ( As of November 2002 ) The signs soon disappeared after complaints , some press coverage , and the end of the World Cup .
Some " soaplands " , however ( as of January 26 , 2004 ) , still have them up -- which means this " Members Only " policy has nothing to do with " hooligans " .
For causing replicable social damage by giving discriminators the tools to ply their trade , Xene issued the following apology :

This is against the law , i.e. the Ryokan Management Law ( Ryokan Gyouhou , Article 5 , see above link in Japanese ) .
As it says above : an establishment cannot turn away lodgers unless there is a health issue involving contagious disease , a clear and present endangerment of public morals , or because all rooms are full .
It even has signs up to this effect :
" For the present , Foreigr [ sic ] use can not be performed .
Very sorry for this .

NB from the Rogues ' Gallery site manager : I called them on Feb 24 , 2005 to confirm that yes , their signs are still up and the policy is still in place .
" We refuse people who cannot speak Japanese . "
When I told them that this was not sufficient grounds for refusal , as per Hotel Management Law , Article 5 ( I even read it to them over the phone ) , the clerk begged off , said the policy is in place and that 's that , and the manager is not in , etc .
This is a pretty egregious case , since for once there is a clear law against this .
It 's all a matter of enforcement .
So , print up the law in Japanese from this link and show Article Five to the hotel management .
If they still flaunt the law , try going to the cops , law in hand , and see what happens .
Good luck .

It 's a love hotel , and as such also subject to laws governing hotels .
As for the meaning of the English , enjoy the puzzle .
In Japanese , it warns guests not to bring in foreign lady touts ( i.e. " waiting on the road " ) .
I guess Japanese prostitutes are okay , then .

KABUKICHOU 歌舞伎町
Mass - produced neighborhood signs for excluding all foreigners .
Note how sophisticated the English language level of exclusionism has gotten .
These cellphone snaps taken March 16 , 2008 by Rogues ' Gallery Moderator Arudou Debito at the address above ( look down the stairwell to see the sign just to the left of the black stand ) .
But there are many other businesses now displaying the same sign in Kabukichou .
Ironic , given that Kabukichou has the highest concentration of businesses run and staffed by foreigners in Japan .
How do they go to work ?
I guess they 're not " guests " .
See what I mean about the increasing sophistication of the exclusionary language ?

( NB : The Japanese below the JAPANESE ONLY text on the sign reads , “ The inside of this restaurant is very small .
In order to avoid accidents , we are sorry , but we refuse entry to all children below the age of 5 .
We ask for our customers understanding and cooperation . ” )
Information on and reviews of the restaurant in Japanese : http://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1311/A131102/13010522/, last updated January 2014 , with no mention of its “ Japanese Only ” rules .
( It does mention the no children under five rule : 店内が非常に狭いため、事故防止の観点から5歳未満の子連れ不可の張り紙あり」 .
Interesting how a “ no foreigners ” rule somehow escapes mention . )
Comment by the submitter , dated April 5 , 2014 :
Please would you mind helping me ?
Today I went to a restaurant in Asakusa with my wife and some Japanese friends .
They did n’t allow us to enter , because me and my wife are not Japanese .
In the entrance there is a paper that says “ Japanese only ” in English , and other advertisement in Japanese .
My Japanese friend , entered to the restaurant and kindly asked the manager if me and my wife could enter , too .
The manager said they does n’t allow foreigners , no matter if they speak Japanese nor have been living in Japan for long .
I hope you can help me , and write some article about this discrimination .
I think discrimination is one of the worst problem in our world , so we must stop it immediately .
Thank you for your time !!!
Comment by the Rogues ' Gallery Moderator :
I called Tentake on April 5 , 2014 , to confirm with the management that yes , they do have a “ Japanese Only ” restriction .
Their reasons given : 1 ) Hygiene ( eiseimen ) , which were , when asked , issues of “ foreigners ” not taking off their shoes when entering , 2 ) NJ causing problems ( meiwaku ) to other customers , and 3 ) a language barrier , as in NJ not speaking Japanese .
Basic Otaru Onsen exclusionary excuses .
When asked if he did n’t think these were prejudicial generalizations about all NJ , he said repeatedly that he could n’t deal with “ foreigners ” ( tai ’ou o shi kirenai ) .
Then he hung up .
Readers who feel that this restaurant is behaving inappropriately for a business open to the general public are welcome to phone them at the number above , or drop by and say so to the management .

NB from the submitter of the photographs : " Last weekend , I saw a sign on Aoyama Dori advertising an " estee " salon for women .
The sign and the salon are located next to the temporary Kinokuniya supermaket building .
What made the advertisement unique was that it explicitly stated in English that the services provided by the salon are for " Japanese Women Only " ( attached for your reference is a copy of the store 's pamphlet advertising the subject services ) .
I found the advertising offensive and called the store owner to ask for an explanation of the exclusionary statement .
The owner explained that the salon would not provide services to foreigners , including Koreans living in Japan .
I think that you may find it interesting that a store located in the center of Aoyama is openly and blatantly engaging in discriminatory advertising and practices . "
NB from the Rogues ' Gallery Manager : I called Princess Plumeria to confirm the reasons for exclusionism on Feb 24 , 2005 .
The manager told me that yes , all " gaijin - sans " are refused because their facilities are " too small " ( How big do they think feet can get ? ) .
And they want to avoid a language barrier should anyone feel unwell during the footbaths .
When I asked about the Zainichis ( Japan - born ethnicities , such as ethnic Koreans or Chinese ) , she said that they would be refused too .
Even though Zainichis have no language barrier ?
That was where she said she was now too busy to talk ...

What 's even more ironic ?
That this is done in a Hawaiian motif .

Alas , Hawaiians are forbidden entry too , naturally .

After the famous stabbings in Akihabara in June 2008 ( by a Japanese ) , a shop which sells weapons and knives in Akihabara had the temerity to maintain a sign up on their shop refusing foreigners entry .
Photos received May 24 , 2008 .
( Click on images to expand in browser )
UPDATE : After calls ( June 9 and 16 , 2008 ) and meeting with the owner of the shop ( June 17 , he was very friendly and cooperative ) , the store agreed to take down their sign and replace it with a new one written by Rogues ' Gallery monitor Arudou Debito ( photo by same taken June 17 ) .
Now while I 'm not a fan of making weapons obtainable by anyone , there are more things in the store than just knives etc .
The misleading sign has at least been made nondiscriminatory .

Nevertheless , as of October 10 , 2008 , " MAD "s website still explicitly says their knives are not for sale to foreigners .

STATUS REPORT : ( MARCH 2004 ) : Arudou Debito and friend Ben visited Rizal on March 27 , 2004 .
Ben was refused entry , until he pointed to me and said that he was with me ( a Japanese citizen ) .
The person on duty confirmed my Japanese ability with two questions of " Hontou ni nihonjin desu ka ? "
( Are you really a Japanese ? ) , which I answered in the affirmative .
Without even asking for further ID , he let us in , where we dropped about 17,000 yen on pleasant chat , beers with two very friendly Filipina staff , and a rousing round of karaoke on the stage ( Ben sang Bowie 's " Let 's Dance " , I sang Dylan 's " Like a Rolling Stone " extremely nasally ) .
I asked them to remove the sign .
They said they would take my suggestion under advisement .

Yes , you are reading that sign correctly :
" Entry absolutely forbidden to Chinese and Naturalized Citizens , Chinese War Orphans ( zanryuu koji ) , and people with Chinese blood mixed in .
ONLY PURE - BLOODED JAPANESE MALES PERMITTED . "
Only pure - breeds ?
They 've really thought this policy out to be as exclusive as possible .
Not even naturalized citizens ?
That deals the moderator of the Rogues ' Gallery out too .
Now we 're separating customers specifically by blood ?
The signs are getting worse ...

The English and the Japanese versions of the above sign differ , in that the English requires an escort , but the Japanese says " Gaikokujin no nyuuten , okotowari itashimasu " , or " We refuse foreigners entry to this establishment . "
Which version is to be believed ?
The Japanese , as a blanket refusal was enforced upon the source of these photographs .
( photos taken March 2004 )
PROGRESS REPORT ( April 2004 ) :
The person refused at these places has sought redress at the local Ministry of Justice , Bureau of Human Rights , which apparently will inquire about having the signs removed , but have stated quite clearly that they consider these refusals to be a managerial decision , not an issue of human rights .
Great sentiment from the agency entrusted with protecting people from discrimination ...
The person refused is currently considering legal action .
The Japan Times released an article on the issue and discriminations in Koshigaya ( March 25 , 2004 ) , entitled " DOWNSIDE OF BEING FOREIGN : Discrimination 's blatant signs , not roots , easy target " .

Neither site mentions the fact they bar entry to all foreigners who are illegal , or who do not speak Japanese .
( All photos taken June 7 , 2004 , courtesy of an accompanying Yamanashi Nichi Nichi Shinbun reporter . )
Practice of this policy in fact violates the Foreign Registry Law and the Ryokan Management Law ( see report ) .
The particularly disappointing thing about this case is that it is a repeat of a foreigner exclusion campaign , due to panic about AIDS transmission from foreigner - tainted bathwater , which occurred around Kofu in 1992 .
Local public baths put up exclusionary signs , encouraging others in Nagano and Saitama to follow suit , until one lone local sento defied pressure from its Japanese clientele , got the facts about AIDS from the Kofu Department of Public Health , and stayed open to foreigners , turning back the tide -- until bathhouses in Otaru took up the slack from 1993 to 2001 .

Person refused entry to the nightclub comments :
" Myself and four of my friends were refused access to two different clubs in Nagoya consectutively on Saturday night [ Feb 12 , 2005 ] .
The first , ' Club Ozone ' in Sakae did not have a sign , they just told us ' No Gaijin on Saturday Nights ' .
The second , ' Club Abime ' , had a sign and we took a picture ...
I find this particulary unfortunate due to the fact that this is the city that is hosting the 2005 World Expo [ starting March 25 , 2005 , and running on until September ] .
We spoke to the manager of Abime and point out the large billboard across the street reading ' Harmony Between Nations ' .
He did n't seem to care .
We questioned the bouncer at Club Ozone and he claimed that there was an incident involving a foreigner a few weeks prior .
I mentioned the Expo and he claimed that it was another reason they would not be allowing foreigners on Saturday nights .
When asked how long this policy would continue , he said ' forever ' ...
Publicity of this nature does not reflect well in the host city of an international event , paticularly an event poised at fostering ' Harmony Between Nations ' " -- Ian Brown , Nagoya

As was reported on the Debito.org blog on January 8 , 2008 , in November 2007 a NJ resident of Ishikawa Prefecture was offered a subscription , by a sales manager of an independent company selling magazine subscriptions , to the Hokkoku Shinbun , a regional Ishikawa Japanese newspaper .
Receipts dated November 13 , 2007 as follows : ( click here to see larger scans and a fuller report ) :
The subscription was abruptly cancelled the next day , with a postcard from the salesman , a Mr Matsuda , confirming that the company will not sell subscriptions to foreigners ( click on images for larger scans and a fuller report ) .
The company 's standpoint as revealed in telephone interviews here .
( The Hokkoku Shinbun itself has disavowed any connection with this company . )
This outcome is confounding .
As can be seen in other entries on this Rogues ' Gallery , we have managers worried that letting NJ into their facilities might cause , they claim , problems with manners , sanitation , violence , or just plain discomfort to the owners for their own langauge insecurities or xenophobic tendencies .
It 's confusing why a newspaper outlet ( in these days when print journalism is scrambling for paying customers ) would unilaterally void a subscription contract .
Are they worried the foreigner might be able to read their paper ?
UPDATE ( February 2008 ) : After investigation by reporters from Kyodo News , the Mainichi Shinbun , and a shuukanshi weekly , reporters on the case told me that their editors said this was a non-story , and no article on this issue appeared in any publication .
The Rogues ' Gallery moderator 's interpretation of this outcome is that newspapers are not happy to investigate other newspapers when there are financial interests involved .
This is how uncritical our media gets .
Anyway , as newspapers themselves advise , avoid subscription outlets that are not official newspaper sales offices .

COMMENT FROM THE SUBMITTER : " This Sunday ( December 10th , 2006 ) I went to an internet café relatively close to where I live , since I have no access to the internet during Sundays and I had an urgent mail to send .
I translate Japanese children 's books into Swedish in my spare time , and I had a deadline .
Lo and behold , a true " foreigners only " at the desk .
I was there with a japanese friend , so they said it would be OK for me to enter anyway : they had had some problem with a foreigner who did n't speak Japanese two months ago , and felt that the sign was in good order to avoid further problems .
" Being a social anthropologist , I chose not to make a fuss over it in their face and instead came back with at tape recorder and actually got an interview with some middle - management boss about the reason for the rule , the café 's view on it and his personal ( at least he said so ) view .
Surprisingly enough he even managed to come up with the " I realize that I would feel bad if I saw a ' no japanese ' sign abroad " argument himself , but whether or not he was just being polite or not , I do n't know .
" Talking about it with a friend , I got the link to your homepage .
It was quite a shock for me to see such a sign for the first time , and it made me feel much worse that I would have guessed . "
UPDATE DECEMBER 23 , 2006 :
The Internet cafe manager realized that what they were doing was not very nice , and took the sign down shortly after Jonas reported the situation .
They have since instituted an ID membership system for all customers regardless of nationality ( which is what they should have been doing all along , of course ) .
More information and updates on my blog at http://www.debito.org/index.php/?p=117.
Anyway , the sign is down and the rules are changed .
Good .

( Original notification , dated November 28 , 2005 )
" Hello Debito - san , I thought you might appreciate pictures of a ryokan I stayed at on the night of Saturday , November 26 , 2005 .
The establishment in question is called " Yamazaki Ryokan " ( http://www.ryokan-yamazaki.co.jp/index.html ) , and is located in north - west Kyoto , on the number 8 bus line , just south of the Takahana - cho bus stop .
" Upon arrival , I noticed two doors near the entrance , one marked for Japanese and the other for Foreigners .
Upon inspection , I saw that it was a segregated bathing area .
This was not a problem for me and my girlfriend , since we had a bath in our room .
It did , however , taint my image of the elderly woman who seemed to run the place , who otherwise provided us with reasonable service .
Interestingly , this ryokan is a member of the " Japanese Inn Group Kyoto " .
I wonder if they endorse this type of segregation .
" In my three and half years of living in Japan , this was my first time to see such a sign .
I was particularly surprised to see it in Kyoto , a major city which tourists visit , and home to many non-ethnic Japanese .
While this incident did not diminish my esteem for Kyoto as a wonderful , culturally rich place to visit , it certainly made me qustion the motives of the ryokan owners .
" Find attached two pictures of said ryokan .
The first is of the bathhouse doors showing the attached signs , and the second includes one of the doors and the ryokan 's signboard .
Keep up the good fight , David Woods , Mie-Ken , Japan . "
( Click on photos to see larger image )
Update from list monitor : Calling the ryokan on November 28th , 2005 , 2PM , and talking to an elderly Mr Yamazaki , the manager , he confirmed that there were signs up " because of the large number of foreigners attending " .
When I asked if women and men , separated by nationality , were now forced to bathed together , he said , " no , women get their own baths in individual rooms " .
I asked him why he was segregating people by nationality , and he repeated the large rush of foreigners and their big bodies somehow justified separate baths .
I told him that he should take the signs down , and he said he would take my request under advisement .

On September 4 , 2004 , Steve McGowan , an African American and resident of Kyoto Prefecture , was recommending " G- style " , an eyeglass store he had frequented before to a black South African friend .
They were standing outside the shop when the owner , a Mr Narita Takashi , came outside and told McGowan and his friend to leave : " I do n't like black people !
Do n't touch the door !
Do n't touch the shop window !
Get over there ! " [ shooing them away and pointing across the street ] .
These statements are part of the court record in a lawsuit for racial discrimination filed in 2005 .
So is Narita 's claim that shooed them because a neighbor phoned his store to warn him about two scary blacks outside his premises .
Subsequent visits to the G - Style by both McGowan 's wife ( as well as Arudou Debito and other human rights activists ; the conversation was tape - recorded ) got Narita on record saying that he does n't like black people , as he'd had a bad experience in Germany ( involving a stolen bag and a prurient proposition ) many years ago .
When the owner refused to apologize ( instead justifying this behavior to the press ( Tokyo Shinbun Nov 4 2005 , see website ) as merely part of his personality ) , McGowan took Narita to Osaka District Court for 5.5 million yen damages .
McGowan lost in Osaka District Court in January 2006 due to " insufficient language ability " on his part and for suing for the wrong thing - - " racial discrimination " instead of " foreigner discrimination " .
The decision was overturned on appeal in McGowan 's favor in October 2006 by the Osaka High Court , but with a nominal severance and no acknowledgement of racial discrimination being the specific cause of the refusal .
Full details in English and Japanese at http://www.debito.org/mcgowanhanketsu.html.
This case is included on the Rogues ' Gallery as it has been confirmed both officially in court and by Arudou Debito in person that a refusal took place , and it was on the grounds of a customer being " a black person " and thus objectionable .

The logo is even abbreviated in the visual to " ' Gaijin ' allowed " for your convenience .
Thanks for making it so clear , I guess .
Very Heartful .
You 'll also notice that there is only one apartment of the twelve on this page which will deign to take " gaijin " ( the very first one in the top left hand corner ) .
And it 's nearly the cheapest and quite possibly the crappiest one on the entire page–only a one - room ( 1R ) .
What a coincidence .
What a lovely way to welcome newcomers who have enough hurdles to jump over in this society , without having the most fundamental thing they need in their life–a place to rest their head every day–denied them when they first arrive or need to move .
Moreover relegate them to lousy housing regardless of income .
The fact that this company is bold enough to make exclusionism so explicit ( the realtor will no doubt counterargue that this is done by the landlord 's wishes ; they 're just following orders ) makes them an accessory to the discrimination in black and white .
Debito.org wishes to discourage this type of systematic discrimination in any way possible , so the realtor gets put up on the " Rogues Gallery of Exclusionary Establishments " .
If you 're looking for apartments in Fukushima - ku , Osaka , I suggest someplace less tolerant of intolerance .

On a visit to Kobe for Golden Week , I came across a bar worthy of your Rogues ’ Gallery of exclusionary establishments .
Ironically , it was a soul music bar called Soul Love , with a sign featuring album covers of soul artists , including prominent Motown acts , who presumably would not be welcome inside the bar .
The bar was located on Higashimon Dori , a prominent thoroughfare in Sannomiya , one of Kobe ’s major entertainment districts .

Kurashiki ( Okayama Pref )

( 岡山県倉 敷市阿 智３ー４ー１６ 、 Ph. 086-434-8551 ）
( Rogues ' Gallery Monitor Arudou Debito displaying his proof of citizenship after being refused entry , in front of Santa Monica Bar , Kurashiki , July 11 , 2004 ) ( Report and photos courtesy Chad Edwards , revised by Arudou Debito )
The author , a long - term Kurashiki resident , and Rogues ' Gallery monitor Arudou Debito , visited nearby port town Mizushima during the afternoon of July 16 , 2003 .
During that trip , the ailing industrial / port town of Mizushima had drinking / entertainment establishments with vaguely - worded exclusionary signs posted outside .
When Arudou Debito asked about possible entrance , even with proof of Japanese citizenship , the establishments made clear that all foreign - looking customers were in fact not welcome .
On July 12 , 2004 , at around 1:30 AM , I accompanied Arudou Debito to hankagai Achi in Kurashiki City ( a 2 - minute walk from the station ) .
This is an international tourist destination , featuring the famed Bikan - Chiku and the new Tivoli Park ( a copy of its European sibling ) .
'... some 7 million people from all over Japan and abroad visit Kurashiki every year -- with good reason " - according to the Kurashiki City website .
The author was refused from entering a drinking establishment about eight months before , but when we returned to the scene the shop was closed .
So we went to adjacent " Santa Monica " , which had been until now known for being open to foreigners .
I entered alone and waited at the admission desk , but the manager did n't even acknowledge my presence .
He had a Filipina hostess tell me in English , " Sorry but this establishment is for Japanese only " .
After returning outside , both Arudou Debito and I decided to re-enter Santa Monica together with Debito 's Japanese passport in hand ( see photo below ) .
After acknowledging that only Japanese may enter , the manager then inspected Debito 's Japanese passport , acknowledged that he was a Japanese , then told him that there was neither enough staff nor space to accomodate us ( on a slow Sunday night , no less ) .
In reality , two large booths were open and most of the staff were assembled at a nearby table -- apparently waiting for customers .
In any case , entrance was denied us .

「 ご無沙汰しております。昨日、広島で人権講演の仕事があって

REPORT FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHER ( A Southeast Asian naturalized Japanese citizen .
Japanese original , translated by Arudou Debito ) :
" Long time no see .
Yesterday I had a speech in Hiroshima on March 8 , 2007 , but I arrived in Hiroshima the night before .
I met with a guy friend ( Japanese by birth ) , and went for dinner , then a night out on the town .
The place he introduced me to would have Indonesian hostesses , and he asked me if that would be okay .
Yes .
We went inside SAMA SAMA and were shown to a table by the management .
" As soon as we had sat down , one of the male staff came up to us and said , ' Excuse me , Gaijin are not allowed in here . '
I just happened to have my passport on me and explained that I am in fact a Japanese .
However , he replied , ' You look foreign , so kindly leave . '
After he kicked me out , he pointed to the sign outside with said exclusionary policy .
When I tried to take a picture , the manager got in the way , so they 're a little shaky .
Enclosed .
What should I do now ? " [ NB : I recommended a lawyer .
Probably more news to come . ]

REPORT FROM THE SUBMITTER ( edited ) : " I do n't know if this is a new one for your wall , but I could n't find any mention of it online .
First , some background :
" Hiroshima has seen its share of suspicious behavior from the police in recent months ; dance clubs were shut down in violation of a never - enforced dancing permit .
Almost all clubs in Hiroshima allow dancing , but only one club holds such a permit .
" When these raids were conducted , " gaijin bars " and clubs were a particular target .
The police often sorted the club patrons into three groups : Japanese , military , and foreigner .
The Japanese were " released " immediately , the others often required to stay for questioning .

" Being so close to Hiroshima , US military soldiers often come into the city on Fridays and Saturdays to the less reputable parts of town .
I will be the first to admit I find their presence a little intimidating at times : - they do n't speak Japanese or bother to learn the customs - often they only come to have one - night stands with whatever Japanese girls they can find - many are agressive when drunk - a foreigner was assaulted last night by a member of the military while talking on his keitai to his mother ( just standing on the side of the street ) .
" El Barco , an advertised " international bar " , was probably most affected by these raids .
Its clientele consisting mostly of eastern European girls and US military forces , it was an easily identifiable target for the koban in these raids .
I will be the first to admit I find this area a little seedy , and the military personnel a little scary at times .
" I do n't know when it was posted , but I discovered this sign ( picture attached ) on a club , Sumatra Tiger , adjacent to El Barco .
Would n't such a sign demand that all foreigners ( at least , " American - looking " foreigners ) present their gaijin cards as proof that they are civilians working in Japan , and not affiliated with the US military ?
And of course , I assume no private club has the right to make such a demand , only the koban or government officials . "
COMMENT FROM GALLERY MODERATOR : I rather agree that a bar is not the best place to face drunk young military types , and can understand a certain degree of trepidation both from bar owner and client .
However , this is a place which is restricting entry to non-Japanese , which falls under the purview of the Rogues ' Gallery .
It is also important , as the submitter says , to see how this policy is actually enforced -- and if all " foreigners " will be treated as " military " on appearance alone .
Anyone want to drop by this place and find out ?-- Arudou Debito

On November 3 , 2006 , during the JALT National Conference at Kitakyushu , a JALT member was refused entry to the above restaurant .
Reason given was that the establishment was full , even though to the refusee it visibly had open tables .
The person who was refused informed Rogues ' Gallery moderator Arudou Debito at the conference after one of his presentations , and volunteer Jessica tracked down the site .
On November 4 , at around 9PM , Arudou Debito , Jessica , and four other friends ( including Ivan Hall , author of CARTELS OF THE MIND ) went to the restauant in question .
Arudou first went in alone and the manager , a Mr Matsubara Tatsuya , indeed tried to refuse him entry by claiming the restaurant was full .
A quick walk around the restaurant confirmed that the establishment , with at least eight large tables plus counter space , was in fact almost completely empty .
When it was clear that Arudou and Matsubara could communicate in Japanese , Matsubara then switched tacks and offered him counter space .
Arudou then brought in his friends and confirmed that they could have a table .
Arudou and friends then confirmed ( after being seated and ordering drinks ) that a ) Matsubara did refuse foreigners entry , b ) because he cannot communicate in English - - he finds it his " nemesis " ( nigate ) , c ) and because he finds foreigners frightening ( kowai ) .
When asked if he had ever had any bad experiences or altercations with non-Japanese customers , Matsubara said no .
He just ( for reasons never made very clear ) did not want to have to deal with them .
When Arudou and friends softly and calmly pointed out that a ) non-Japanese are customers too , with money , not to mention language abilities ( or at least forefingers to point to items on the menu ) , b ) refusing them entry hurts their feelings , as it did the person refused the previous evening , c ) that welcoming customers was part of the job description of his line of work ( kyaku shoubai ) , he apologized and said he would try harder not to refuse non-Japanese customers in future .
The irony of the situation was that at the end of our drinks , one of the waiters who attended us ( a student at the local technical college ) talked to us in very good English .
Why could n't Matsubara just have passed any customer with whom he was unable to communicate on to his staff ?
We look forward to future reports from readers of this website who might wish to investigate this restaurant in future to see if Matsubara keeps his promise .
( NB from website monitor Arudou Debito :
This is not signposted discrimination per se , but Rogues ' Gallery monitor Arudou Debito personally confirmed the exclusionism ( and was witnessed by third parties ) , I have included this case on the Rogues ' Gallery . )
UPDATE DECEMBER 22 , 2006 :
Status :
On hold .
The Fukuoka Bureau of Human Rights ( jinken yougobu ) is giving me the runaround .
Nearly two months later , they have still not called JUNGLE to confirm whether or not they refused us .
He wants to hear the story directly from the person originally refused before proceeding further ...
Useless organization !
The Kitakyushu City Tourist Board , however , has since phoned the place and told them to stoppit .
Fine .
UPDATE JANUARY 2007 : The person who was refused has talked to the BOHR directly about what happened to him .
But we have heard nothing from them since .

Jeff Norman reports : " I ran into the manager of this store and asked him about this policy ...
He stated that it was n't discrimination just that no one was able to speak English there .
When I asked him if there were a large number of foreign pool players , he said no and that there had never been a problem with any foreign patrons .
He went on to add that he had spoken with an American relative by marriage and that relative had suggested to him that he do this to avoid any trouble .
He claimed that he would consider my opinion on the matter .
The amazing thing here is that there really does n't appear to be any need for this sign or discriminatory policy at all , but yet it exists .
Lastly , the question that is always left in my mind is how can a ' Japanese Only ' sign not be considered discriminatory ? "

Submitter Justin notes : “ Shop is located near Kadena US Air Force base .
While these signs are a step up from completely discriminating against all NJ , it is ridiculous that they can get a sign saying people who can't speak Japanese are not admitted , but can't have someone translate a paper listing the ' rules and regulations of the shop ' in English . ” Quite .
And the English translation is quite good too , so this “ language barrier ” feels more like an excuse just to exclude like the ones proffered by Onsen Yunohana back in 2001 .
The Moderator also wonders how Maimu will be testing customers ' language ability , what the sufficient linguistic thresholds are to “ pass ” , and if it will be only be enforced on people who “ look foreign ” .
MISCELLANEOUS EXCLUSIONARY SIGNS
Photos of these signs were taken by well - meaning people , some with hazy memories of time and place , or difficulty in reconfirming .
I still include them in the Rogues ' Gallery to show that the problem is more widespread than many people ( some of whom claim that this discrimination is a non-issue , because these are isolated incidents or the sample size is too small ) might think .
How bad do things have to get , how many places have to put signs up and refuse customers by race and appearance alone , before people admit there is a problem of racial discrimination in modern Japan ?
TSUKIJI SEAFOOD RESTAURANT
Address and phone number unknown ( was not able to check for myself from Sapporo ) , photo taken February 2008 , courtesy CG .
Sign describes complicated rules , and indicates that even Japanese who cannot follow them will be refused entry .
However , the assumption still remains that non-Japanese will be unable to understand the rules of the establishment , so it blanket refuses them .
Full report here .
UPDATE : Exclusionary sign is now down as of February 2008 , thanks to others contacting the restaurant and encouraging the management to reconsider .
Above : Hotel sign , location unclear ( probably Tokyo )
Sign refuses all foreigners , drunks , and organized crime members -- in that order .
Pity that being drunk or a hitman are a matter of personal volition .
In any case , keep in mind that refusals at hotels in Japan are violations of Article 5 the Hotel Management Law ( ryokan gyouhou ) , which clearly states that people can only be refused on the grounds of all rooms being full , a clear threat of contagious disease , or a threat to " public morals " ( fuuki ) .
Visa status or language ability are not adequate grounds .
Thus refusing people accommodation ( unlike refusing them , say , a bath or a meal ) only because they are foreign is clearly illegal in Japan .
Download the letter of the law in Japanese here and present it at any exclusionary hotel in Japan .
If even then they flout the law , try going to the police if you like , law in hand , and see what happens .
Good luck .
Above : Nightlife in Tokyo Ikebukuro ( Toshima - ku Ikebukuro 1 - 3 ) .
The website monitor tracked down the organization listed in subtext as sponsoring this sign , the Tokyo Bouhan Kenzen Kyouryoku Kai ( Tokyo Crime Prevention and Health Association ) , because it sounds like a government organization ( and the Japanese government had better not be using taxpayer money on something like this ! ) .
After a Google search , calls to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government , the National Police Agency , and the organization itself revealed that it is a private organization without public funding .
When asked to take the signs they sponsored down , the group refused , claiming " Gaijin do n't obey our rules .
They cause trouble . "
This photo has been relegated to the " Miscellaneous " section because it was found in front of a business not quite catering to the general public , something we generally do n't like to touch because it blurs the issue .
Nevertheless , it is still an exclusionary sign , displayed in violation of international treaty , which will , as history has shown , encourage copycatting in other , more everyday industries if left unchallenged .

Until the Rogues ' Gallery monitor can confirm the exact location ( bar 's name and address ) of this sign , it will remain in the " Miscellaneous " section , alas .

LOCATIONS WITH OPEN - DOOR POLICIES FOR NON - JAPANESE CUSTOMERS
Yes , there are places out there which publicly recognize that refusing customers due to the color of skin or passport is not cricket , and they should be known about here to provide balance .
The Nago Bar and Restaurant Association in Nago , Okinawa , is bucking the trend with open - door signs ( since Okinawan refusals of American soldiers -- therefore all foreigners -- are Legion ) .
Well and good .
May these businesses prosper .

What Is Back Office Outsourcing and What Are the Benefits ?
It can be difficult to offer help to your back office employees when technological issues arrive without a tech background .
How can you ensure that your back office operations run smoothly when you ’re not available to solve problems ?
Back office outsourcing is becoming a more popular option for businesses .
Companies can devote their energy to less technical - related projects and problems .
If you want to cut business costs and build a stronger brand for your business , back office outsourcing might be the solution .
But what is back office outsourcing ?
Check out our guide below to learn more about back office outsourcing and all of the benefits it provides growing businesses !
What Is Back Office Outsourcing for Businesses ?
Outsourcing occurs when a company or business purchases services from a foreign supplier .
That can sound a bit obscure and confusing , but it ’s not !
Many tech companies outsource branches of their company .
Chances are you ’ve called your internet provider ’s customer service line and been put through to someone in the Philippines or India .
This means your internet provider is outsourcing .
Occasionally outsourcing can occur in a company ’s home country , but it ’s less common .
So , what is back office outsourcing then ?
Back office outsourcing is exactly what it sounds like : the outsourcing of back office positions .
Back office refers to departments like accounting , human resources , and IT support .
The Benefits of Back Office Outsourcing
Outsourcing back office positions is a wise decision for many businesses to make , small and large companies alike .
Allows Businesses to Build Their Brand
The biggest benefit lies in the fact that outsourcing back office positions allows companies to focus more on developing their brand and improving their services or products .
Cutting the back office from a business allows its employees to devote their talents elsewhere .
Businesses can work to improve the quality of service they deliver .
They wo n’t have to devote as much time to back office tasks .
This allows them to take on more tasks and collaborations with other businesses .
Invest in Specialized Services
Many back office outsourcing organizations only hire specialists .
Sometimes it can be a risk hiring local candidates for back office positions .
But when you opt to buy services from a company that specializes solely in back office outsourcing , you can be assured that you ’ll have specialists working for you .
Access to More Advanced Technology
Working with a back office outsourcing company gives you access to more advanced technology .
You wo n’t have to worry about your servers being down or not having the most up to date programs or software .
Outsourcing companies feature high - quality tech .
This helps them provide their clients with the best possible service .
Increased Flexibility
If your company is constantly on the move , back office outsourcing can help you maintain that flexibility .
If your project development team has to travel across the country , you do n’t have to worry about leaving your back office employees to fend for themselves in the office .
Your outsourcing team will be carrying on their tasks halfway across the world !
This is also helpful if you operate on an unusual schedule .
Say you want to run a business that operates from 11:00 - 9:00 .
It can be difficult to find good back office employees if your candidates are looking for a standard 9 - 5 job .
With back office outsourcing , your “ employees ” can work on a designated schedule , but it wo n’t necessarily have to align with your business hours .
Lower Operating Costs
This is the most drawing reason to invest in back office outsourcing .
Outsourcing lowers employment costs drastically .
Plus , businesses wo n’t have to account for physical costs , such as renting out a larger commercial space to accommodate a larger staff .
The funds that businesses save with outsourcing can be invested in other fields .
Businesses that outsource can push more money into things like advertising or social media campaigns .
The possibilities are endless !
It ’s also beneficial for companies who may have busier seasons than others .
If your business sees more traction in the summer months , outsourcing allows you to only pay for the services that you need .
With back office outsourcing , it ’s not necessary to hire a staff member whose services wo n’t be needed as much when winter rolls around .
The Cloud at Your Fingertips
Many back office outsourcing companies use the cloud , which will give you quick and easy access to any data you may be searching for .
It also brings your business up to level with other professional organizations that are using the latest technology .
Allows for Easier Expansion
Sometimes the need for a bigger property can keep companies from expanding their business .
If you are outsourcing your back office positions , you wo n’t have to worry about relocating employees or a bigger location .
You might have to expand your outsourcing team if you expand !
That will be less costly than accounting for more physical space wherever you intend to expand though .
Deciding Whether Back Office Outsourcing Is Right For You
Back office outsourcing can be useful for an array of businesses , not just big tech companies .
Now that you no longer have to ask “ what is back office outsourcing ? ” , you might be considering outsourcing services for your own company .
We get it .
You want to devote more time and financial resources to perfecting your brand and working on projects .
Passing more technical tasks like payroll off to back office outsourcing companies can save you time and money !

DIGG THIS
I have spent my entire life cringing at the stupidity , cowardice , and self serving fraud of the intellectual establishment in this country .
And now that we have 24 hour cable news , and now that talk radio has become BIG MEDIA ( it used to be honest when there was no money in it ) the intellectual level of political and social criticism in this republic aspires to Olympian heights of fatuity .
Nothing is allowed in political discourse except the bromidic , the stupid , the superficial .
Any attempt at truth or honesty is attacked as extreme , even insane , by a cowardly bunch of media pundits trying to score points with each other by ganging up on the victim like schoolyard bullies ganging up on the new kid .
Just look at the way they turned Dr. Ron Paul into a doubleplus unperson .
Consider the difference in other countries .
Consider that in Italy the newly elected right wing openly compares itself to General Franco and the crowd cheers ” Il Duce ” at the new Roman mayor .
This is the very same country that boasted the largest communist party in Europe in the 1970’s .
This is also a country with a dozen viable political parties , a country that discusses the idea of regional secession as a serious consideration .
How ironic it is that a country such as Italy with broad based support of Fascism and Communism is freer intellectually than the US , a supposed free country with a bill of rights guaranteeing free speech !
In this country , the chattering classes all compete to see who can repeat the same hackneyed phrases more loudly .
Any dissent is seen as a reproach on the monolithic poltroonishness of the conformist establishment and its apostles .
With the new 24 hour electronic yellow journalism and its vaudeville showmen posing as thinking pundits , the superficiality takes on hyper levels .
Complex issues concerning peace and war , foreign policy , terrorism ( and its causes ) , morality , political philosophy become mere talking subjects , theatrical props , for media sideshow barkers pimping for ratings glory .
The tendency is to use out - of - context sound bites to invent huge media controversies , full of sound and fury and signifying nothing .
For the past month we have heard a lot about The Reverend Jeremiah Wright .
There are endless loopings of the same half a dozen out - of - context sound bites .
This is nothing more than a collective gang bang by mindless narcissistic media stars who intentionally dumb down what he said to create a phony scandal for Barak Obama .
These tapes were probably unearthed by someone in the Hillary machine , or McCain ’s , or one of their sympathisers .
So now there is open season on this preacher .
What is the substance of these attacks ?
It is no more substantive than late night TV or stand up comics .
Besides the misquotations , the media focused on his style as a black minister .
We have heard endless loops showing how outrageous or bombastic he is .
We heard clips of him singing Handel ’s “ And the Glory of the Lord ” and his “ God Damn America ” .
It ’s as if the media were shocked !….. SHOCKED !!
that there is such a thing as black Full Gospel preaching style , complete with spontaneous responses accompanied by organ improvisation .
This genre is famous for using politics and themes of racial oppression for over 100 years .
You would think that The Reverends Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesse Jackson were unknown .
Or Al Sharpton .
The Reverend Wright , in an attempt to add some substance to this sound bite circus , spoke at the National Press Club in Washington DC . last week .
He was not giving a sermon .
He was not “ bombastic ” .
He spoke in a temperate voice and gave a scholarly speech on the black theological tradition in the USA .
He talked about the role that “ Liberation Theology ” played in both the black churches , and in the Yankee Congregationalist , United Church of Christ .
The entire media were glued to this speech .
They were not looking for a dispassionate discussion of theology in black churches , or context to his previous statements – that would be too boring – they were looking for another sensationalist sound bite , the more outrageous the better .
They got it during the question & answer session after the speech , with confrontational questions which clearly showed the hostile bias of the questioner .
The questions assumed that Wright is a kooky conspiracy theorist , and a blaspheming traitor to his country .
No one really listened to what he said .
In its reporting , the media reduced his comments to platitudes , and the endless references to his speech followed the predictable collective script of the fatuous imbeciles in the media to see who can repeat the same hackneyed phrases to win kudos from their colleagues .
What did he say that was so outrageous ?
Based on the comments of the lemming pundits , I seriously wondered whether they saw the same speech I did .
I listened to the whole thing twice and was hard pressed to find anything that was outrageous or insane .
I certainly have my criticism of “ Liberation Theology ” with its close association with Marxism , especially in Latin America .
But this was not the focus of the media .
Their focus was on him defiantly defending his “ outrageous ” remarks .
Almost all of those remarks I agreed with .
He was asked if he was patriotic , and said that he served 6 years in the military and that it was more military time than Dick Cheney served .
Was this an insane or even false statement ?
He said that the US government oppresses people around the world , that it sends Americans , “ to die for a lie ” .
When asked why he blamed the US for 911 , he said that the “ chickens have come home to roost ” in the form of blowback from our policies overseas .
Most did not bother to find out that he was quoting Edward Peck , the former ambassador to Iraq , and deputy director of terrorism under Ronald Reagan .
Wright added , quoting the Bible ’s golden rule , that you can not do terrorism to others and not have it come back to you .
This is virtually the same thing for which Dr. Ron Paul got raked over the coals .
Questioning the cause of 911 is the modern American Intellectual Inquisition equivalent of heresy .
It is double heresy if you equate our government with a terrorist organisation , even though bombing civilians does cause terror .
Recognised states do n’t do terrorism unless they are Iraq or Iran .
He was asked if he would apologise to the American people for blaming them for 911 .
He made the distinction , lost on most Americans , between the people and their government .
This is total blasphemy in the minds of the orthodox American Establishment .
In their thinking the American people and their government are one in the same because of Democracy , and the vaunted electoral process .
The idea that the government in this , “ the most free and democratic nation on earth – EVER ” would have its own corrupt agenda against the best interests of the people is a thoughtcrime .
This is odd , since most Americans have no trouble spotting corruption at the state or local level , or complaining of excessive spending and taxation .
In the NYC area , we have had three governors ( NJ , NY , Conn . ) resign in the last ten years for corruption .
However , at the federal level , especially when it comes to war , Americans refuse to look at the truly mammoth corruption , distortion , and immorality of their government .
He was asked about his relationship to Reverend Louis Farrakhan .
As he explained , this had to do with a statement made by Farrakhan 20 years ago about Israel , a sacred cow in the minds of the establishment .
Wright explained his position regarding Israel : that it had a right to exist , that they were the children of God , BUT that they need to reconcile with their enemies ; the Israelis need to sit down with the Palestinians and come to a peaceful understanding so that their children “ do n’t grow up talking about killing each other ” .
He said that reconciliation , not killing was God ’s way .
Is that an “ insane ” or “ outrageous ” notion ?
Is it theologically erroneous ?
The media had a field day with Wright ’s comparing Farrakhan to stock broker EF HUTTON .
Do media pundits not understand the use of analogies or similes or metaphors in speech ?
Wright was saying that when Farrakhan talks , the black community listens .
Is this a false statement ?
If so , then why do the media , who are mostly white , bother to cover Farrakhan ?
The punditry went berserk over his “ conspiracy theory ” that the US Government invented AIDS .
The Reverend Wright cited the Tuskegee experiment , where the government used blacks to experiment on syphilis .
He also pointed out that the Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq were sold to Saddam by the US Government back when he was our ally and that he used them on the Iranians with our blessing .
He said that , given the history of our government and its use of deception , he believed “ it was possible ” .
I personally doubt the conspiracy theory that the US Government invented AIDS , but I personally doubt any number of conspiracy theories of my friends , whilst I harbor conspiracy theories of my own with which others disagree .
In fact most Americans believe in some form of conspiracy or secret , illegal dealings committed by their government .
Why is that ?
Is this unique to Americans as a culture ?
I do n’t know .
We know the US Government has lied to us in the past .
We know that the US has used the CIA to topple governments in South America at the behest of the United Fruit Company .
We know , in spite of the official , revisionist “ spin ” that the government knew in advance of the Japanese carrier force prior to Pearl Harbour ; and that even in the DC media there was open speculation that war with Japan was imminent .
We know that the Navy translated the communiqué of the Japanese to their ambassadors in Washington and that they were instructed “ to burn all documents and code machines ” .
We know the US Government lied about the Tonkin Gulf Incident , and lied about being in Laos and Cambodia .
We know the US Government has been a king maker in the Mideast while denying same .
None of these revelations ever get admitted at the time ; only years later do books by insiders get written telling the truth .
Would there be so many conspiracy theories in America if our government were transparent and honest or followed the Constitution ?
If you Google “ conspiracy theory ” , why do so many hits deal with the United States ?
Why does n’t Switzerland come up except as a movie title ?
Why not Canada ?…… or Iceland ?
Then there was the “ God Damn America ” quote .
He explained this also , yet the media pretended not to hear .
He said “ damn ” is derived from “ condemn ” , and that God condemns the actions of the US Government ( again NOT the people ) for inflicting violence on other nations and that non-violence was consistent with Christian teaching .
He asked the questioner if he heard the whole sermon from which that quote was taken .
But context or understanding did not figure into the thinking of the questioner .
I wonder if there are examples , say in the Old Testament , of God condemning wicked immoral nations ?
This electronic tabloid circus unfortunately drags in supposedly high - brow broadsheet press into the mud .
This was especially true last week after his National Press Club Speech .
One after another , the senior Washington polemicists and bureau chiefs chimed in so they could be counted in the “ me too ” column .
There were the obligatory references to Wright as “ crazy ” and “ lunatic ” or “ loony ” with no attempt to address what he said .
But the “ intellectual ” writers of the papers of record added new buzzwords , to wit : “ narcissistic ” , “ solipsistic ” , “ divisive ” “ his fifteen minutes of fame ” “ revenge on Obama ” .
Here we have the Establishment Left , many of whom , tired of the sleazy fraud of the Clintons , want Obama nominated and hope that he ’ll beat McCain .
Bob Herbert of the New York Times wrote , ” …. Wright went to Washington on Monday not to praise Barak Obama but to bury him …….
Feeling dissed by Sen. Obama , Mr. Wright gets revenge on his former follower ……
He ’s living a narcissist dream .
At long last his 15 minutes have arrived . ”
They called him divisive but not the mudslingers who brought edited sound bites public and replayed them over and over ; sound bites that were part of a long sermon .
Why are they dumping on Wright rather than blaming the tabloid media for taking him out of context ?
Here ’s the reason .
To quote Mr. Herbert :
“ The question that cries out for an answer from Mr. Wright is why – if he is so passionately committed to liberating and empowering blacks – does he seem so insistent on wrecking the campaign of the only African - American ever to have had a legitimate shot at the presidency . ”

Massachusetts
-------
A bill that would reduce the punishment for marijuana possession in Massachusetts passed the Joint Committee on the Judiciary after a hearing last week , moving it one step closer to getting on the ballot in November .
The legislation would decriminalize possession of less than an ounce of marijuana , and reduce the punishment for " personal use " of marijuana from six months ' probation and a driver 's license suspension to a $ 250 fine .
Supporters of decriminalization in the State House and from outside advocacy organizations maintain the bill would not lead to increased drug use and would dole out a punishment proportionate to the offense , while opponents say the bill will lead to increased use of harder drugs like heroin .
Sen . Patricia Jehlen , a Medford Democrat , sponsored the bill and said she thinks reducing the punishment to a civil offense would be a more effective use of public money and would promote public safety better than current rules .
Similar bills have already passed in 11 other states and evidence shows that decriminalization does not increase drug use , she said .
According to a study conducted by Harvard economics professor Jefferey Miron , the decriminalization of marijuana did not lead to any measurable increase in marijuana use in states that decriminalized marijuana , and could save law enforcement about $ 29.5 million annually .
Steve Epstein , treasurer of Massachusetts Cannabis Reform Coalition , testified at last week 's hearing and said though there is strong support for the bill , most people opposed to the bill think decriminalizing marijuana is a backward step in the war on drug abuse .
" I think the bottom line is : it would be nice to know that sooner rather than later [ that ] persons over the age of 18 are not going to be handcuffed for smoking a little marijuana , " Epstein said in a phone interview .
Rep. Martin Walsh , a Boston Democrat , testified against the decriminalization of marijuana and said though 57 percent of his constituency voted in favor of decriminalizing marijuana , he would do " everything in his power " to prevent the bill 's passage .
Despite comparisons between alcohol and marijuana by reform supporters , Walsh said they are " two very different substances . "
Walsh said Massachusetts leads the country in rates of heroin abuse , and the rate would only increase if pot were legalized .
" The next step after marijuana potentially could be OxyContin , heroin and then the next step after that , as we all know , is jails , mental institutions or death , " he said .
Sen . Gale Candaras , a Wilbraham and chair of the Joint Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse , said evidence suggests that alcohol is more a gateway drug than marijuana .
Rep. Cory Atkins , a Concord Democrat , said the repercussions of marijuana convictions are more severe than the offense itself .
" Marijuana is not considered to be one of the ' harder ' drugs , yet kids get caught with it and it stays on their record forever , " he said .
Keith Stroup , founder of the National Organization for the Reform of the Marijuana Laws , was arrested for smoking a joint at this year 's Marijuana Freedom Rally at the Boston Common .
" Last year , over 7,000 people had their lives needlessly scarred or interrupted for engaging in a relatively harmless activity , " he said .
Stroup , 64 , said the charges would be dropped if he apologized , but he refused to make a statement .
He said the effects of smoking pot are less harmful than the effects of cigarettes and alcohol .
Whitney Taylor , the treasurer and chairwoman for the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy , said the initiative is well - supported because 30 public policy votes in the last seven years about the issue have passed every time with an average 63 percent majority .
Taylor said the committee got well over the required number of signatures for the initiative 's petition and will begin a second signature - gathering phase to get the issue on the November ballot .
Students for Sensible Drug Policy member Stacy Fontana said students ' attitude toward marijuana is different than that toward alcohol because the substances do not intoxicate people in the same way .
" You can smoke weed and still do school work , but no one gets drunk and then sits down to write a paper , " she said .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Climate change could alter the farming map of Australia , with some agricultural operations moving into the wetter north of the island continent as the major food - producing belt in the south dries up .

But shifting large - scale farming north to a wetter , hotter climate would be risky as animals and crops would face a higher frequency of heat stress , said a new report by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ( CSIRO ) .
Australia ’s outback , home to large scale cattle and sheep farms battling the worst drought in 100 years , would become more marginal with climate change , but the country ’s sugar , wine and horticulture farms could benefit from the warmer temperatures .
CSIRO examined the impact of climate change on 10 agricultural sectors in Australia worth A$ 40 billion ( US $ 38 billion ) a year and found negative and positive effects .
The report looked at climate change forecasts out to 2070 .
“ We ’ve applied the latest climate change projections to build a picture of the challenges that will affect all types of agriculture in all corners of the nation , ” CSIRO scientist Mark Howden said in a statement .
“ For many agricultural businesses incremental changes may be enough , but some regions and industries will need to be open to more transformative changes , ” said Howden .
The CSIRO examined the impact of a temperature rise of two to 2.5 degrees Celsius on Australian agriculture .
Significant reductions in rainfall and higher temperatures across Australia ’s wheat - growing lands would see reductions in yields and quality , said the report , but added that a possible reduction in frosts may increase crop options .
But it said that farmers who introduced new crop management practices , new crop varieties , altered rotations and improved water management , could turn a negative into a positive .
“ In the wheat industry alone , relatively simple adaptations may be worth between A$ 100 million to A$ 500 million p.a. at the farm gate , ” it said .
Australia is the second - largest wheat , canola and beef exporter in the world and the largest barley exporter .
“ Australian rangelands have often been associated with drought , that land can be degraded very rapidly , and that recovery of degraded lands is very difficult , ” said the report .
WINNERS AND LOSERS
Cattle and sheep farmers face not only less rain and hotter temperatures , but soil erosion and acidification , salinization , weed invasion and deteriorating animal nutrition and health .
The report said cattle and sheep farmers could combat climate change by adopting a conservative , but constant stocking rate from year to year and by owning multiple farms in different locations to offset climate changes .
“ At a national industry level , there are likely to be winners and losers , with some rangelands becoming more productive while others become less suitable for grazing , ” said the report .
The Australian wine industry is the country ’s third - largest agricultural exporter , behind wheat and beef products , with exports for the year 2007 valued at A $ 3 billion .
Climate change will force winemakers to plant different grape varieties to overcome a decline in grape quality , but may open up new lands for vineyards .
“ Some varieties that would not ripen in the present climate may be successfully planted in the future warmer climate , ” said the report .
But some agricultural industries look set to benefit from climate change , said the CSIRO report .
Sugar cane yields may rise with less rain and more sunshine creating a longer growing season , while a reduction in frost and less severe winters may see an expansion in horticulture .

Revisiting Black Sunday Hack - Coding Horror
2001 年頃に DirecTV とハッキングコミュニティの間で繰り広げられた攻防に関してのおさらい。最近，この件に関する記事が
Wired に掲載されたため，今更ながら掘り返してきている。
当時の DirecTV の視聴システムはハック耐性が弱く，スマートカードに簡単な改造を施すことによって「タダ見」することができていた。
DirecTV 側としてはこれを潰すべく，衛星放送信号にプログラムアップデートを載せて配信するのだけれど，ハッカー側もそれを無効化するテクニックを編み出して対抗する。
そこで DirecTV 側は，対ハックプログラムを 60 回もの細かなアップデートに分割して送り込むという手法をとった。それぞれは無意味に思われるアップデート（頻繁な更新による嫌がらせに見せかけた）が，裏ではハックカードを破壊するためのプログラムを着々と構築していたというわけ。
２ヶ月もの期間をかけて密かに送り込まれたプログラムは，スーパーボウルの１週間前に発動された。この対ハックプログラムにより約１０万枚ものスマートカードが破壊されたと推定されている。そして，その破壊されたスマートカードの先頭８バイトには
" GAMEOVER " の文字が刻まれていたという 。
The number one purpose of the Missionette program , according to its Web site , is " to win girls to Jesus Christ through love and acceptance . "
It 's the Girl Scouts , only sponsored by your local evangelical church : uniforms , merit badges — and lots of talk about Jesus ' edict to " go and make disciples of all nations . "
It 's a rite of passage for many Christian girls .
Info Andrew Thomas
It is not , however , something that ought to financed with public money .
Obviously .
But public dough is exactly what 's underwriting the Missionettes at one Phoenix church .
Last March , the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office wrote a $ 5,000 check to support the Missionettes at Abundant Living Center .
Do not be mistaken , readers .
This was not a personal check from County Attorney Andrew Thomas .
( That would be okay . )
Nor did it come from Thomas ' campaign coffers .
( Also okay , although kind of weird . )
No , the office financed the donation with RICO funds — money seized from illegal enterprises and granted to law enforcement for four purposes : racketeering investigations , gang prevention , substance abuse programs , and substance abuse education .
RICO strictures come straight from the U.S. Department of Justice .
And I can assure you that Justice has n't added any provisions saying that it 's cool to give RICO moneys to churches instead .
In fact , the expenditure is clearly illegal — a clear violation of the separation of church and state outlined in the Constitution .
And the Missionettes are only the tip of the iceberg .
I reviewed RICO fund expenditures by Thomas ' office during his tenure and found $ 168,000 in earmarks for church - based programs and Christian ministries — many of them blatantly focused on converting people to Christ .
Many of the ministries in question do n't focus even indirectly on gangs or substance abuse .
That means they do n't fit Justice Department requirements .
And some of the ones that do deal with substance abuse issues are " Bible - based " programs — meaning they are not eligible for public money .
Period .
If anyone should understand the law , it 's the county 's top prosecutor .
But records show that at least two of his staffers signed off on the payments — one of them Phil MacDonnell , Thomas ' top aide .
( Thomas ' office declined comment . )
And that 's not all .
I originally asked to see the county attorney 's RICO records because I was curious about all the public service campaigns his office has been running .
Every time I turn on the TV , there 's Thomas , giving parents helpful tips or telling kids to stay off drugs .
Those spots are funded with RICO money .
I found records showing that , during Thomas ' tenure , the office has spent $ 2 million on TV ads , radio spots , and billboards .
Unlike the giveaway to Christian programs , that 's legal .
But something I found in the records makes me question whether Thomas is more interested in stopping drug use — or promoting himself .
Ever notice how the ads focus on Thomas , rather than the sort of local celebrity ( Randy Johnson , Brandon Webb ) who might actually have sway over kids ?
There 's a reason for that .
The ad agency Thomas hired to shoot the commercials is the very same company that produces his campaign commercials .
They 're " selling " Thomas , just as they did during his two previous runs for office — only this time , they 're doing it with public money .
Nobody official monitors RICO spending .
Like other law enforcement agencies in Arizona , the county attorney has to turn in only big - picture data to the Arizona Criminal Justice Commission for each quarter 's spending .
No line items are included .
When I requested a list of the office 's RICO fund projects , it took five months and a strongly worded letter from New Times ' attorney to get them .
Even then , I did n't get a nice organized spreadsheet :
We 're talking a giant pile of invoices .
So all numbers in this column come from my calculations , after five hours of note - taking and another two hours of basic math .
But the most disturbing things in the records do n't require a calculator to understand .
Chief among them ?
Thomas ' earmarks to Christian organizations that clearly intend to use the funds for proselytizing on Jesus ' behalf .
In addition to the Missionettes , the earmarks include :
• $ 15,000 for a Mesa church called the Eagles Wing Faith Center , in part to " develop a new program to expand their outreach by implementing a family resource center . "
• $ 7,500 for the Phoenix Metro Master 's Commission , an organization that sponsors a nine - month " discipleship - training program dedicated to making Disciples of Christ , " according to its Web site .
• $ 5,000 for a " Christ - centered 12 - step recovery ministry " at Covenant of Grace Church in Phoenix .
• $ 20,000 for Teen Challenge of Arizona , an organization affiliated with prominent evangelical minister David Wilkerson .
• $ 23,000 for the Roman Catholic Diocese 's mentoring program for kids with parents in jail .
• $ 5,000 for the AsSalt arena tour — actor Stephen Baldwin 's attempt to reach skater kids and bikers with the Gospel .
As best I could tell , there were no grants to religious groups other than Christian ones .
And grants to secular groups seemed few and far between .
Eugene Volokh is a professor at the UCLA School of Law who writes about school choice and First Amendment issues .
He says that Thomas ' office is " absolutely in trouble " if it prefers one type of faith - based group over another , or if they prefer faith - based groups to secular ones .
And , more importantly , Volokh says that public funds are not allowed to be used for a religious purpose .
Period .
Richard Katskee , assistant legal director at Americans United for Separation of Church and State , agrees .
He says the county 's " donations , " as I 've described them , are illegal .
" The government is not allowed to use public money to fund religious programming , " he says .
The Missionettes are , by definition , religious programming .
So is Stephen Baldwin 's preaching from the stage in an arena .
You could certainly make a better argument for using RICO funds for a " Christ - centered 12 - step recovery ministry , " like Covenant of Grace offers , but both Katskee and Volokh say that even those expenditures are n't legal .
" Any time you 're giving public money to a religious group , there have to be restrictions that bar the use of these funds for religious practice , " Volokh says .
So Catholic Charities can get government money to run soup kitchens , as long as they welcome people of all faiths , Katskee says , and do n't require them to listen to a sermon in order to get soup .
A Christian school can use government funds to pay for an overhead projector for math class , but not one for the religion teacher , Volokh explains .
That sort of separation , clearly , is not happening here .
( See : The Missionettes , Stephen Baldwin , et cetera , et cetera . )
This is n't about contributing to proven social service programs .
It 's about shoring up Thomas ' popularity with his political base .
The churches benefiting from his largesse house the very people he needs to come out for him in what 's sure to be a tight re-election campaign this November .
It 's Tammany Hall , only tailored to social conservatives instead of uneducated immigrants .
And the donations to Christian churches are n't the only RICO funds Thomas is using to win votes .
He 's also used RICO bucks in an endless campaign to increase his name recognition .
See those billboards along the road , telling you that Maricopa County Andrew Thomas is going after drunk drivers ?
RICO bucks paid for those .
See those silly public service spots on TV , in which Maricopa County Andrew Thomas tells you that it 's okay to snoop around in your kid's closet ?
RICO paid for those , too .
Records show that Arizona agencies raked in around $ 24 million in racketeering seizures last year alone .
Thomas ' office , as the prosecuting agency in the biggest county in the state , got $ 12 million of it .
While much of that gets distributed to local law enforcement , Thomas ' office spent $ 1.6 million of it .
( And , as much as Thomas is spending , Maricopa County is still sitting on a stash of about $ 12.3 million , according to the Arizona Criminal Justice Commission . )
Some agencies use the money to buy computers , or phone taps , to use in racketeering investigations .
Others use it for anti-drug Web sites or commercials .
It 's up to each agency to spend the money as it sees fit , as long as they follow the Justice Department 's broad guidelines .
Thomas ' biggest expense has been the aforementioned ad campaigns , which are perfectly legal .
But he handles them much differently than his predecessor , Rick Romley , did .
Romley ran his anti-drug ads in cooperation with the Partnership for Drug - Free America — a deal that made sense .
The Partnership , which relies on pro bono work from the advertising industry , produces high - quality anti-drug messages — and uses research and statistical analysis to determine which ads are most effective .
By using RICO money to buy ad time , Romley 's staff ensured that the agency 's campaigns were seen on TV screens during peak hours of viewing , not just late - night slots .
But when Thomas took office in 2005 , his office 's partnership with the Partnership ended .
Rather than buying airtime for the Partnership 's ads , records show that Thomas hired Peterson Advertising to produce new spots .
That company , which is based in Georgia , specializes in conservative causes .
( Literally , its Web site boasts that " Conservative Causes : Our # 1 Specialty ! " )
The agency had previously produced the commercials for Thomas ' campaigns for both attorney general and for county attorney , according to his campaign finance reports .
So .
Instead of using ads from the Partnership for Drug Free America , ads that would have cost him nothing but airtime , Thomas spent $ 128,000 in RICO funds to create new ads .
Why ?
Partnership ads would n't promote Thomas .
In fact , the Partnership bars politicians from appearing in its spots .
They 're interested in ending drug use , not propping up political careers .
Peterson's RICO - funded ads feature Thomas ' face , and his name — ad infinitum .
Leslie Bloom , executive director of the Partnership 's Arizona chapter , says that her staff met with Thomas ' , but Thomas decided to take a different path .
" Obviously , I think it 's a case where they have their own goals and ideas of what they want to accomplish , " she says .
And what is that goal ?
Bloom will characterize it , politely , only as a question of " ownership " — as in , " Some people want ownership , and that appears to be the case here . "
It 's ownership , all right .
Thomas ' name and face are everywhere .
Earlier this year , after Thomas ' office spent more than $ 215,000 on a silly 45 - page crime - prevention booklet , State Representative Jim Waring , R - Phoenix , introduced legislation that would have barred public officials from putting their names on fliers and commercials paid for with public money .
It was a good idea ; not coincidentally , it never gained much traction .
It 's time we talk about that idea again .
And it's also time that someone took a hard look at the $ 168,000 that Thomas has gifted to churches around town .
RICO funds are public dollars , not a personal slush fund .
And , frankly , if the children of Maricopa County have to look at Thomas ' face one more time while they 're watching MTV , I have a feeling it 's going to drive them all to drink .
Personally , I 'm already there .

[ The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism .
By Robert P. Murphy .
Regnery , 2007 .
Xii + 206 pages .]
Robert Murphy 's admirable book is much more than a conventional defense of capitalism .
Murphy includes standard material , e.g. , why price controls , minimum wage legislation , and rent control do not work .
Though it was once controversial to point to the inadequacies of these measures , now even mainstream textbooks hasten to condemn them .
Murphy goes far beyond this .
He takes on the most difficult and controversial challenges to the free market , and offers convincing responses to them .
Few matters excite critics of the market to rage as the high salaries of corporate CEOs ; Paul Krugman , e.g. , in his Conscience of a Liberal , makes little effort to conceal his envy at those who dare to earn more than he does .
The response by defenders of the market is obvious : if the market pays the CEOs high salaries , this indicates that those who pay the salaries expect the executives to generate sufficient profits to justify their high compensation .
Critics are often invited to found their own corporations .
But is not this defense of the high salaries open to objection ?
The claim is that financial success justifies the high salaries : how , then , can one justify enormous severance packages to CEOs who fail ?
Surely one cannot here appeal to market efficiency .
Murphy accepts the challenge :
Unlike routine managerial work , the task of a CEO often involves bold innovation .
If the steps necessary to turn a particular company around and earn millions were " obvious , " the company would n't be in trouble in the first place .
When a new CEO comes in with ambitious plans , he knows that failure is entirely possible .
If the shareholders said , " We 'll pay you $ 20 million if you succeed , but nothing if you fail , " it would n't be a very attractive offer at all .
This is because the type of person who gets picked to head a major corporation could easily make hundreds of thousands , if not millions , for certain by consulting or offering other services less glamorous than being CEOs . ( p. 21 )
Murphy continues the same pattern with another issue .
The free market cannot be blamed , an often - repeated argument tells us , for racial discrimination .
Quite the contrary , those who discriminate pay a penalty .
If an employer refuses to hire people of a certain race or religion , he will pay a penalty .
If an employer has an opening that pays $ 50,000 in salary , and the Christian applicant will bring in $ 51,000 in extra revenue while the Muslim will bring in $ 55,000 , then to discriminate against the creed of the latter will cost the employer $ 4000 in potential profits .
( p. 31 )
This point , though expressed characteristically well by Murphy , is well known ; but it must withstand an objection .
The argument relies on the fact that businessmen aim at maximizing profits ; but to do so , must they not endeavor to satisfy consumers ?
Here precisely the problem arises .
What if the consumers themselves hold discriminatory views ?
Will it not be to the interest of businessmen to satisfy them ?
Suppose , e.g. , that customers in a restaurant would prefer not to be served by blacks .
Why would a restaurant owner interested in profit risk the loss of his business by hiring black waitresses ?
Murphy again responds in convincing fashion to this difficult problem .
But in cases like this the free market … still punishes discrimination — only this time the customer pays the " racist fee " : the customer pays extra ( in the form of inferior service ) to be served by a white waitress who is worse at her job than a better - qualified black candidate .
( p. 32 )
It does not follow from this that people will be unwilling to pay the price : but the fact that the market imposes a cost tends to deter discrimination by consumers .
( One might object that this does not cover the case of a black waitress who is an equally good server as her white competitor ; in this situation , will not consumers be able to satisfy their prejudiced tastes without penalty ?
But here the owner has an incentive to hire the black waitress by offering her a lower salary .
So long as his loss of business is outweighed by his lower costs , he will do so . )
Another objection to the free market has enticed even some economists of libertarian views , though not of the strict observance , Tyler Cowen not least among them .
How could the market on its own have gotten us to the moon ?
What private corporation could have supported the Apollo Mission , or the rest of the space program ?
If one counters that a consortium of corporations could eventually have financed a space program , would not the inevitable difficulties of coordination mean that our progress into space would have been much slower ?
Murphy responds by challenging the argument at its suppressed premise .
Why should we think that the space program should have proceeded faster than consumers on an unhampered market were willing to support ?
Following Bastiat , he notes :
To understand if a program is sensible , we must compare the benefits with the costs .
By using up scarce resources in the space program ( or building a sports stadium ) , the government delivers tangible benefits , but also destroys unseen possibilities of the alternative products and services that those resources could have created .
Critics of capitalism think ( wrongly ) that the profit and loss test is arbitrary and crude .
On the contrary , it provides an indispensible barometer of the consumers ' preferences over how resources are deployed .
( p. 119 )
Murphy is at his best in his magnificent defense of free trade against a variety of specious objections .
Many who should know better complain that free trade takes away the jobs of American workers .
Are not supporters of the free market willing to sacrifice the interests of Americans to their single - minded pursuit of profit ?
The view here sketched is a common fallacy , many times refuted ; but Murphy , displaying a remarkable ability for apt illustration , responds exceptionally well .
Tariffs , he notes , may help particular groups of workers , but they hurt the whole population :
To see this , suppose the government fined Americans $ 10 every time they ate dinner at home .
Such a measure would certainly boost sales and wages in the restaurant industry .
Yet does anyone think it would be a good idea for America as a whole ?
Would such a tax on home cooking make us all richer ?
( p. 148 )
This is all very well , modern day Hamiltonians may respond , but the argument can be carried too far .
What if free trade depletes our entire manufacturing sector ?
Consumers may be better off , but our greatness as a nation depends on large - scale manufacturing .
Even if free trade is generally a good idea , it must be practiced with restraint .
Murphy will have none of this :
Even if the claims about the alleged crisis in manufacturing were true , the ultimate response is a big " So what ? "
There is nothing sacrosanct about manufacturing jobs .
Surely we would n't expect hundreds of thousands of Americans to be involved in the assembly of automobiles in , say , the year 2050 …
Yet suppose we accept for argument 's sake that a country ought to have a strong manufacturing sector .
Even so , the real issue would n't be industrial employment but rather manufacturing output …
So when people point to the drop in manufacturing employment since , say , the 1950s , do n't for one second believe that our economy is producing less stuff than it did fifty years ago .
But what about the trade deficit ?
Can America continue indefinitely to increase its deficit , already at an unprecedented height ?
A standard response , which Murphy makes , is to point out that a trade deficit is nothing to be feared : " If foreigners really are stupid enough to send us goodies year after year without buying as many US goods in exchange , why does this constitute a problem for Americans ? " ( p. 156 ) .
But Murphy also has another answer .
What the mercantilists overlook is that the trade balance must always balance .
This is not an economic theory but an accounting truism .
If Americans buy $ 1 trillion of merchandise from Japan while Japanese consumers purchase only $ 850 billion in merchandise from the U.S. , what happens to the missing $ 150 billion ? …
Except for foreigners who literally stockpile hoards of U.S. dollar bills , the money flowing out of the country ( because of trade deficits ) must somehow find its way back in .
( p. 157 )
One way this can happen is for the foreigners to invest in America .
Ironically , often the same people who complain about the deficit also complain about foreign investment : apparently it is bad both when money leaves America and when it comes back .
Murphy conforms to his usual pattern .
He refutes not only the standard antimarket fallacies , but new and difficult arguments as well .
Paul Craig Roberts , for one , has claimed that the standard economic argument for free trade is outmoded .
Free trade , David Ricardo long ago showed , will be beneficial even if one country is superior in all lines of production to its trading partner .
The more productive nation should specialize in what it does best : the less able nation has a " comparative advantage " in the area where it is closest to the superior nation in productivity .
Roberts objects that Ricardo's law of comparative cost holds true only if capital is fixed .
If capital can freely migrate from country to country , as it now can , the general case for free trade is undermined .
To this Murphy has an insightful reply :
What the view of Roberts and others overlooks is that capital mobility enhances the productivity of the capital .
By passing laws that prevent drill presses from being shipped to Bangladesh , yes , the U.S. government can ( at least temporarily ) prop up the wages of American workers who use these drill presses .
But at the very same time , the artificial constraints reduce the earnings of the American owners of the drill presses , and moreover their losses outweigh the ( temporary ) benefits to the workers .
On net , the government restriction makes America poorer … government restrictions on capital export destroy wealth by preventing the most efficient organization of global production .
( pp. 168–69 )
But even if this is right , does not the increased mobility of capital render the situation of many workers untenable ?
It is all well and good to say , in the usual fashion , that workers displaced by imports can find jobs elsewhere ; but does not outsourcing change matters entirely ?
If a corporation ships its entire factory abroad , in order to staff it with low - paid foreign workers , does this not mean that these foreigners have in effect joined the American labor pool ?
How can our American level of wages be maintained at all close to its present level in these circumstances ?
Murphy replies in a similar way as he does to the case of capital export .
[ T ]he laid off U.S. workers are obviously hurt , at least in the short run .
They will have to take jobs that pay less ( or at least are inferior in some other respect ) to their old jobs …
However their loss is more than counterbalanced by the gain of the shareholders of the corporation [ of the factory shipped abroad ] , who are American … if the displaced workers lost more in wages by switching to a different job than the corporation saved in production costs … then the corporation would n't have outsourced the jobs in the first place .
It would have been more profitable to simply cut the wages of the U.S. workers while keeping the operation in America . ( p. 163 )
One might object to Murphy 's argument in this way .
He has shown that capital export is , in economists ' trade jargon , Kaldor - Hicks efficient : winners from exports could compensate losers .
But why should this sort of efficiency be the test of policy ?
To this Murphy could answer that those who demand restrictions on capital exports often claim that the measures they favor will promote efficiency .
Precisely the reverse is the case .
If it is then said that the welfare of the displaced workers trumps economic efficiency , then suitable taxes on the corporation and subsidies to the workers can rectify matters .
Murphy of course does not favor such efforts to " correct " the market .
I bring up the case just in order to show that the objection leaves Murphy 's argument intact , even if one accepts the false assumption , i.e. , that the state should promote the welfare of one social group at the expense of others , on which the objection rests .
This would not be The Mises Review if I failed to find fault with the book , but Murphy has made my task difficult .
In a quiz that begins the book , he asks , " If you are a car producer , how many deaths should your product cause per year ? "
The provocative answer he favors is " Whatever number of deaths makes your firm the most money " ( p. xi ) .
He has in mind an entirely valid point : safety precautions impose costs , and these must be balanced against other considerations .
Car buyers in a free market may choose to purchase less expensive cars that are inferior to other cars in their standard of safety .
But I think it a misuse of language to say that in this situation , car producers " cause " a certain number of deaths .
To cause a death connotes an action aiming at that outcome : Murphy wrongly conflates cause and foreseen consequence .
In one place , his language wrongly suggests that Ricardo , and possibly Bastiat as well , defended free trade in the 18th as well as the 19th century ( p. 147 ) .
Otherwise , I have no complaints .
Murphy has written an outstanding contribution to economics .
When Michael Sachs , founder of the health care consulting firm Sg2 , wants to hold a quick everyday meeting , he heads to the bland boardroom in his Evanston , Ill. , headquarters .
But when big ideas and greater collaboration are needed , Sachs takes a portion of his 80 employees to a whimsical space in downtown Chicago called Catalyst Ranch .
The meeting rooms at Catalyst Ranch have exposed brick and brightly colored walls decorated with paintings by local artists , Polish wycinanki paper cuttings , and rich fabrics from Haiti .
An array of knickknacks — sculptures , figurines , Matchbox cars , finger puppets — line bookshelves .
Kitschy blue couches , purple lamps , and orange , green , and yellow chairs surround throw rugs and coffee tables .
Scattered about are whiteboards , markers , pens , and paper , as well as quirky sundries such as wigs , Hula - Hoops , and Play - Doh .
" If you 're trying to get people to think different , sometimes you 've got to take them someplace different , says Sachs .
A handful of meeting spaces like Catalyst Ranch , most of which have opened in the past few years , operate in the U.S.
Though unaffiliated , they share common decor themes , which is to say they all resemble kindergarten classrooms .
The spaces are awash in natural light , done in bold colors , and filled with comfy chairs and an assortment of toys .
They typically handle groups of about 30 people and rent for between $ 850 and $ 1,800 for a daylong meeting .
That price generally covers audio- visual equipment , snacks and beverages , use of a copier , and free Wi-Fi access .
Some locations will even provide karaoke machines , Foosball tables , and PlayStation 2 consoles ( although it 's unclear how many groundbreaking ideas have come from playing Grand Theft Auto ) .
Kenneth Smith takes employees of his Pittsburgh - based work force training and consulting firm , H.B. Maynard , to a meeting space called Inspiration Point for team - building exercises .
Smith says the relaxed atmosphere helps his staff open up more and forget the pressures of the office .
It seems all it takes is a few Play - Doh snakes .

Project ' Cube 2007
How to construct a 15 " Direct - Servo Subwoofer out of a Rubik 's Cube ... or how to construct a mammoth Rubik 's Cube out of a Subwoofer ... all in 164 easy steps !
Some people disagreed with the piece , some agreed ; some found it funny , some did n't .
For half a nanosecond I was tempted to join in the discussion .
And then I remembered that all internet debates , without exception , are entirely futile .
So I did n't .
There 's no point debating anything online .
You might as well hurl shoes in the air to knock clouds from the sky .
The internet 's perfect for all manner of things , but productive discussion ain't one of them .
It provides scant room for debate and infinite opportunities for fruitless point - scoring : the heady combination of perceived anonymity , gestated responses , random heckling and a notional " live audience " quickly conspire to create a " perfect storm " of perpetual bickering .
Stumble in , take umbrage with someone , trade a few blows , and within about two or three exchanges , the subject itself goes out the window .
Suddenly you 're simply arguing about arguing .
Eventually , one side gets bored , comes to its senses , or dies , and the row fizzles out : just another needless belch in the swirling online guffstorm .
But not for long , because online quarrelling is also addictive , in precisely the same way Tetris is addictive .
It appeals to the " lab rat " part of your brain ; the annoying , irrepressible part that adores repetitive pointlessness and would gleefully make you pop bubblewrap till Doomsday if it ever got its way .
An unfortunate few , hooked on the futile thrill of online debate , devote their lives to its cause .
They roam the internet , actively seeking out viewpoints they disagree with , or squat on messageboards , whining , needling , sneering , over - analysing each new proclamation - joylessly fiddling , like unhappy gorillas doomed to pick lice from one another 's fur for all eternity .
Still , it 's not all moan moan moan in NetLand .
There 's also the occasional puerile splutter to liven things up .
In the debate sparked by my gibberish outpouring , it was n't long before rival posters began speculating about the size of their opponent 's dicks .
It led me to wonder - has the world of science ever investigated a casual link between penis size and male political leaning ?
I 'd theorise that , on the whole , rightwing penises are short and stubby , hence their owners ' constant fury .
Lefties , on the other hand , are spoiled for length , yet boast no girth whatsoever - which explains their pained confusion .
I flit from one camp to the other , of course , which is why mine 's so massive it 's got a full - size human knee in the middle .
And a back .
A big man 's back .
Anyway , if we must debate things online , we might as well debate that .
It 's not like we 'll ever resolve any of that other bullshit , is it ?
Click .
Mine 's bigger than yours .

No it is n't .

REUTERS / Nigel Roddis
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - John Lennon ’s sons and widow , Yoko Ono , are suing the filmmakers of “ Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed ” for using the song “ Imagine ” in the documentary without permission .
Lennon recorded the song in 1971 and in 2004 , Rolling Stone magazine ranked it No. 3 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time , according to the lawsuit .
Ono , her son Sean Ono Lennon , and Julian Lennon , John Lennon ’s son from his first marriage , along with privately held publisher EMI Blackwood Music Inc filed suit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan seeking to bar the filmmakers and their distributors from continuing to use “ Imagine ” in the movie .
They are also seeking unspecified damages .
The documentary , which features Ben Stein , an actor , comedian and former speechwriter for President Richard Nixon , looks at alleged discrimination against scientists and teachers who support so - called intelligent design as an alternative to Darwin ’s theory of evolution .
The suit is against the film ’s producers and distributors : Premise Media Corporation , C&S Production LP and Rocky Mountain Pictures .
The producers cited the fair use doctrine , which allows the use of copyrighted materials for the purposes of commentary and criticism .
“ We are disappointed therefore that Yoko Ono and others have decided to challenge our free speech right to comment on the song ‘ Imagine ’ in our documentary film , ” they said in a statement .
Amy Winehouse Leaves Clinic to Perform at Mandela Bash ( Photos )
temporarily left a medical facility in London to perform in Hyde Park for thebash on Friday evening , June 27th .
She actually looked , dare we say , not bad .
She has been receiving treatment since collapsing on a London street .
Mitch Winehouse , the singer 's father , has told reporters that his daughter has early symptoms of emphysema , a debilitating lung condition .
Her recent medical stay apparently allowed the troubled musician to get her act together , at least long enough to perform at the concert .
The photos are actually quite compelling .
The performance is reminiscent of her appearance at the Grammys , where she picked up five awards for her album Back to Black and sang Rehab via satellite .
The singer was forced into a rehab facility two weeks before the awards show by her record label .
Without that intervention , it is unlikely she could have been able to perform .
Immediately following last nights performance , Winehouse was photographed signing autographs outside of The Clinic , the London medical facility where she had been hospitalized earlier in the week .
She is seen smiling in several photos before becoming visibly upset , at which time she quickly reentered the treatment center .
The talented musician reportedly canceled plans to release another album in 2008 .
Her addiction issues have kept her from working in the studio , according to her friend and record producer Mark Ronson .
Check out Amy 's performance photos and her autograph session .
We also have a photo of the medical facility where she is receiving treatment .

Nanopaper soaks up oily spills
A mat of nanowires with the touch and feel of paper could be used to clean - up oil spills or as a low cost water filter , according to US researchers .
The water - resistant nanopaper , which has the ability to soak up to 20 times its weight in oil , appears in this month 's issue of Nature Nanotechnology .
Assistant Professor Jing Kong , a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and co-author of the paper , says the nanopaper is very similar to traditional writing paper .
" You can even print on it and cut it just like paper , " he says .
Unlike normal writing paper , which is made from cellulose , nanopaper is made from solid potassium manganese oxide nanowires .
Each nanowire is about 20 nanometres in diameter , and together they naturally clump together to form strands several centimetres long .
After being dissolved in water , the nanowires dry rapidly to create a sheet of nanopaper .
" The process of making the nanopaper is the same one you would use to make [ normal ] paper , " study co-author and MIT Associate Professor Francesco Stellacci says .
Polymer coating
By itself , the nanopaper sucks up water just like normal paper .
But by coating the nanopaper with siloxane vapour , a common polymer , the researchers turned it from a super hydrophilic material into a super hydrophobic material , repelling water while attracting oil .
The oil is soaked up and stored in the microscopic nooks and crannies between the individual nanowires , known as capillaries .
The combination of the nanowires and the polymer coating helps the nanopaper absorb oil .
" We tried the polymer coating on different materials , " says Kong .
" But it does n't have as much of a dramatic effect as it does on the nanowires . "
Cleaning up
After an oil spill , workers would lay the paper in the contaminated area .
In areas of heavy contamination , the nanopaper would be saturated with oil in about five minutes .
The nanopaper would then be collected and boiled .
The oil would be re-captured and the nanopaper re-used .
It 's a common maxim that oil and water do n't mix , but they do form emulsions , where the oil breaks up into tiny particles making it difficult to clean up .
" There is a huge environmental challenge there , " says Assistant Professor Joerg Lahann , a researcher at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the MIT work .
" They are able to separate oil from water even in an emulsion , which is very hard , " says Lahann .
The MIT team has patented their nanopaper and plans to commercialise it .
Kong estimates that it will be available in a year and a half and will cost about US $ 4 ( A$ 4.18 ) per kilogram .

Introduction
As regular readers know , I believe the banking and credit crisis has a long way to go .
We are in the 2nd to 3rd inning of a nine - inning ballgame .
The solution the G7 public servants and central banks will propose is they WILL PRINT THE MONEY as they always have and always will .
They are confronted with the reality of INFLATE or die , as to not do so invites a deflationary depression and the complete and total BANKRUPTCY of the financial and banking systems .
The human emotion of SELF - preservation insures they will try to avoid the bullet that is leveled at the head of the G7 financial system .
� They will duck � and let you take the bullet of inflation , the result of letting their financial systems substitute an ever growing financial and banking sector for private sector wealth generation .
The money printing serves many purposes .
It is a stealth tax that confiscates your wealth while it sits in your bank accounts and transfers it to their constituents in the banking and financial system , which are the MOST powerful masters of the public servants .
Contrary to public perception , the G7 central banks are very political animals and are now caught in the web of their own making since Bretton Woods II forever severed REAL backing of money and substituted the full faith and backing of government .
Governments have been making empty promises for decades and these are no different .
Their G7 currencies are worthless promises to pay you nothing .
They are IOU�s of morally challenged �something for nothing � deadbeats , public servants and the central banks they control and socialists .
These pieces of money are of the same caliber as a mortgage of a SUB PRIME mortgage holder .
Ultimately worthless !
At least the sub prime mortgage has the intrinsic value represented by the house ; a G7 currency has little intrinsic value .
Therefore we are in the early stages of a GIGANTIC � Crack up Boom � ( See Ted bits archives at www.TraderView.com) as outlined by Ludvig Von Mises .
The � Crack up boom� is an exercise in growing inflation as the holders of FIAT currencies seek the shelter of the � Indirect Exchange� into �things which can�t be printed� to preserve their purchasing power and value of their holdings .
Argentina and the Weimar Republic are historical examples of this phenomenon , and more recent ones include Venezuela and Zimbabwe .
The final result will be no different .
Inflation of things that are REAL , such as property / real estate , stocks ( units of production which will reprice to reflect the debasing currency in which it is denominated ) and at some point a collapse in economic production .
Commodity inflation is running away as supply is constrained .
Demand - led bull markets combine with deflating G7 currencies ( loss of purchasing power due to printing press ) to move prices of everything considerably HIGHER .
In a four - part edition of the Tedbits 2008 outlook entitled � Thrill Ride� ( See Ted bits archives at www.TraderView.com), we predicted a collapse in incomes in the G7 on all levels of the economies - individual , corporate , municipal , state and federal .
This is happening .
It is a blistering attack on the middle class as they succumb to the lowered purchasing power of the constantly debasing currency in which they are paid and hold their wealth .
Look no further than this chart of REAL inflation versus the statistically fictional inflation measures of government : ( courtesy of John Williams at www.shadowstats.com)
This is a picture of income collapse courtesy of runaway confiscation of purchasing power via FIAT currency and credit creation .
At this rate of inflation consumers , corporations , municipalities , states , and federal governments are suffering a 12 % loss of income yearly and a 50 % loss of income every six years .
The only recipe that slows this growth is the elixir of capitalism , which is the disinflationary �more of everything for less� .
As socialism creeps in this becomes the inflation definition of �less of everything for more� , which is the definition of government , its mandates and taxes .
This decline in the standard of living is what drives people into seeking �something for nothing � as they no longer can afford what they used to pay for themselves .
This decline in income is global , but in places were growth , capitalism , and wealth creation still occurs it is far less of a problem .
For those economies that no longer grow and create rising incomes it is what drives them into populous public servants � arms .
The pattern of the year in the 2008 Outlook was a WOLF wave of the S&P 500 going back to the early 1970�s when FIAT currency and credit creation became the basis of a transition to ASSET BACKED economies , rather the virtuous wealth - generating Austrian ones :
In the 1st quarter of 2008 S&P 500 profits have declined 25.9 % year over year ( so we are now touching or penetrating the bottom trendline ) , primarily reflecting the financial sectors .
Take out oil sector profits and profits are down 30 % year over year , but rising input prices and declining credit availability signal a broadening collapse in business REAL incomes spilling into the real economy from Wall Street .
The collapse in income from the WOLF wave is BITING !
Income - short , heavily indebted G7 economies are just beginning their trials and tribulations .
Reconstructed M3 in the US , M4 in the UK and EU are averaging about 15 % growth .
YOY growth and globally central bank reserves are accumulating at almost a 27 % rate .
It is so much easier for public servants to substitute easy money ( monetary policy and inflation ) and asset inflation for the fiscal policies of growth ( less taxes and innovation stifling regulations and mandates ) .
It pays them more as industries are forced into the arms of government as they fail from its policies .
Once on the subsidy bandwagon permanent political constituencies are the result !
Look no further than the G7 agricultural and GREEN energy sectors to see this .
Money printing drives more and more people into government dependence .
Less taxes , regulations and mandates drive constituents to freedom .
Which do you think government wishes to do ?
Asset - backed economies rely on fixed assets growing faster then the stated rate of inflation , creating the illusion of growth and rising incomes .
It is the way public servants PUSH their constituents into the arms of government solutions , which when implemented serve the government�s elite constituents and ever - growing legion of government bureaucrats at the expense of the broad public which have placed their trust and votes in them .
All solutions lead to more of the government and less in the private sectors .
So it �s less for you , me and our families and more for them .
ALL GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS ARE �less of everything for more money� .
Understand they hold NO value in the practical world , only in the politically correct one .
Politically correct means practically incorrect .
This is a picture of REALITY and something that we are powerless to change it as it will continue until the demise of the G7 EMPIRE , as it has in all empires throughout time .
However , it is identifiable and offers the astute investor great OPPORTUNITIES for those who can look forward rather then in the rear view mirror .
Assumptions which have served investors for decades are in many ways no longer true .
Those that recognize the new REALITIES can benefit from them .
Those that don�t will in all probability be severely diminished by them .
You need to recognize what is unfolding and set your investments in such a way as you would a sailboat so the wind fills the sails of your investing sailboat .
If you invest into headwinds you will find it hard to move forward .
If you invest with them they will drive your portfolio forward with elegance and power .
So let �s look at which way the economic winds are blowing : Reflections
Last week I included a weekly chart of the CRB showing a symmetric pennant breaking out in the direction of the previous BULL trend , and I want to build upon the message in that chart as it is REFLECTED in a number of other markets .
It would appear that after several months of CORRECTIVE activity that many markets are ready to resume their previous long - term trends .
First , let �s review last week�s chart of the continuous Commodity Index as Tuesday�s close was significant confirmation of the patterns message :
Now let�s look at the Swiss Franc , Euro and Australian dollar on a weekly basis :
All three are MIRRORS of each other reflecting Fibonacci retracements of 30 to 62 % , relative strength indexes and slow stochastics retreating to neutral after being overbought and MACD either turning up or giving a buy signal in the Aussie dollar .
The Aussie dollar is giving a buy signal and the pattern signals a move of 8 cents in the direction of the breakout .
In longer term charts such as monthlies and quarterlies all the previous highs were CONFIRMED in the internals shown .
Signaling these are corrective patterns rather then tops .
The next move is PROBABLY higher from these CORRECTIVE patterns .
Now let�s look at the dollar , gold and silver :
The dollar has corrected a weak Fibonacci 38 % of the previous down move and gold has corrected a DEEP 62 % and silver 50 % of the previous up moves .
All have moved back into the neutral territory where resumption of the trend should materialize if still valid .
Relative strength indexes have gone to neutral and slow stochastics are about turndown or turn - up depending on the previous trends .
A PERFECT Elliot wave ABC correction and the downtrend has been broken as can be seen in the gold and silver chart .
Now we have a special treat from John Kosar of Asbury Research ( www.asburyresearch.com), detailing the probable end of the rally in the dollar as measured in bullish or bearish sentiment and the subsequent action :
As you can see the bell is ringing on the dollar , foreign currencies and the precious metals .
It �s off to the races at this point .
The caterwauling on Wall Street , Washington and Brussels can be heard around the world .
I covered the myth of lower oil prices in last weeks Ted bits ( see Archives at www.TraderView.com) so I won�t cover it today .
Public serpents�er , servants are holding hearings in the U.S. Congress today trying to pin the tail on the donkey for their own mismanagement of practical energy policies and long term plans .
SPECULATORS !
SPECULATORS !
SPECULATORS !
Greedy oil companies , OIL cartels , IT IS ALL HOGWASH !
LIES TO FOOL YOU !
G7 public servants haven�t had or implemented practical energy policies for DECADES and now they and YOU are paying the piper for their own poor fiduciary actions .
If you think windmills or ethanol are going to substitute for oil and gas wells , coal and nuclear power plants and new refineries , then you must be prepared to pay $ 2500 for your monthly energy bill rather than $ 300 .
Their solutions are your demise , and a great treat for their SUBSIDIZED constituent�s energy follies .
Who pays ?
Not the public serpents - you do .
It is wishful and fairy tale thinking and nothing else .
There is no such thing as a free lunch .
Don�t let a public serpent�er , servant , tell you there is !
The footprint of the something - for - nothing social trend is all over this problem .
The something for nothings believe you can have cheap energy supplies but never build a domestic power plant , refinery or allow oil and gas drilling .
NIMBY ( not in my back yard ) policies are NOT PRACTICAL !
They outsourced those needs to OFF SHORE suppliers and now wonder why costs are skyrocketing as domestic industry CANNOT deliver today�s requirements !
WINDMILLS are not a solution .
We all want clean energy but it must be at a practical price NOT impossible ones .
The solutions take decades and practical policies lie at MUCH higher prices .
Now let �s look at another picture of the RAW MATERIALS sector from John and Asbury research ( www.asburyreasearch.com), also known as a broad range of industrial materials and commodities :
Talk about a macro pattern .
Corrective activity is OVER .
This little doozy projects a 22 % move higher , confirming ALL the previous charts .
This pattern was almost a year in the making .
It is powerful .
What do you think higher input prices and lower purchasing power mean FOR YOU ?
For the company you work for ?
For your ability to support your family ?
For the ability of your employer to give you a raise ?
Now let�s take a look at the MAIN stock index in the world , the S&P 500 cash : Wow , a PERFECT Fibonacci retracement into the BOX ( the 50 to 62 % retracement level as termed by Dennis Gartman www.thegartmanletter.com).
This is a weekly and in terms of time and price it is poised and ready to rumble DOWN in resumption of the long - term DOWNTREND .
The losses in the financial sectors have hardly BEGUN .
Next up : consumer car and credit card loans , EXPLODING ARMS , and commercial real estate loans .
The average car loan in America is $ 4800 dollars in NEGATIVE equity .
Do you think that may be a problem ?
From mailing in the � Keys to the house� ( see Ted bits archives at www.Traderview.com) to the � Keys to the Car� especially the TRUCKS and SUV�s which have become America �s darlings and now a millstone around their necks !
SUV�s and trucks bought last year are selling at 47 cents on the dollar .
They were bought with NO MONEY down , get low teens MPG and cost a hundred dollars to fill up .
What a recipe for disaster and misery for all involved !
Do you think the people that bought the securitized debt from these car loans might have a few concerns ?
2008
As I said when the correction was looming in the Ides of March ( see Ted bits archives at www.Traderview.com), beware a corrective period , but that nothing has changed .
This technical analysis generally goes back to last summer , and that was the first leg of the moves .
We have now corrected those excesses and the next leg higher and lower depending on the market you are following .
Look for it to equal or exceed the last moves as we are in the fat part of the trends .
�IMPULSE WAVES � .
Interest rates have backed up and you can look for a rally directly ahead .
Grains are in short supply and they will get scarcer .
Those volcanoes in South America are going to wreak HAVOC on this year�s grain production .
Bubbles , tops in commodities , crude going down � experts , my ass .
Bought and paid for Wall Streeters and public serpents are positioning you for ANOTHER fleecing if you follow their HEADLINE illusions brought to you from the MAIN stream financial media and the FAR left main stream press .
Their solutions are always going to be higher taxes and less free markets which ALWAYS cost you money and transfer that money to themselves and their elite campaign supporters .
If you followed their investing advice over the last ninety days you are being severely injured and the carnage to you has just BEGUN !
Say � thank you� to the gang of 545 and the bourgeoisie in Brussels whom manage our economy based on one metric : buying votes , collecting power over others to sell , and the next election .
Predictions :
Gold is going to new highs and then much higher , corn at 10 dollars a bushel , crude oil $ 150 heading to $ 300 , stocks are headed lower ( the blistering debasement of the dollars in which they are denominated create an illusion of high prices as they are nominal ) .
Priced in REAL terms ( basket of commodities , gold or oil ) , they already are plummeting .
The dollar is headed to new lows , but ultimately will go 40 % lower .
The Euro will go to a new high at $ 1.60 but ultimately probably 2 dollars per Euro ( it is $ 1.57 now ) .
Bonds will rally , then at some time in a year or two COLLAPSE to reflect the debasement ( loss of purchasing power from printing press ) of the currency in which they are denominated �
U.K. pounds , euros , dollars , etc .
The fun has just begun �
In conclusion : THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING AND THE LONGER THEY SAY �BUBBLE � , THE FURTHER IT IS GOING TO GO !
And when they say �bubble � or �speculator� , it implies there is not a problem except in respect to greedy evil CAPITALIST markets and PROFITEERS and pushes REAL practical solutions into the future .
These are not the villains .
The public serpents , special interests and entrenched corporate elites , financial and banking industries are the REAL CULPRITS .
When the broad public hears these false , untrue and illusionary headlines they want public serpents�er , servants , to DO SOMETHING !
And of course they will .
They will do something �substituting PRACTICAL solutions to long - term problems for those politically correct ones that accrue to themselves and their elite campaign contributors .
These solutions torture and penalize the FAKE culprits with windfall taxes , price controls , smothering regulations , and the funding of the subsidies for the �politically correct� policies which provide no solutions ; further damaging future prospects for a practical solution .
The public servants and their main stream media stooges are like the �boy who cried wolf� , AKA LIARS !
They are the wolves and the public are their sheep .
Once prices rise to intolerable levels , at that point and only then will they will finally create PRACTICAL solutions rather then politically correct , fairy tale , you can have something for nothing garbage solutions .
MAKE NO MISTAKE : THERE IS SO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH , SOMEBODY ALWAYS PAYS .
And when you look around the table and try to figure out who the patsy is ?
It usually is YOU !
The broad G7 public is about to learn this lesson over and over and over again until they realize these truths .
There is no such thing as free health care , food , mortgage assistance , ethanol subsidies , windmill energy : ALL COME AT A PRICE .
Is it one you can afford ?
In most cases at this time it is NO .
Don�t despair , instead celebrate .
The wonderful reality of this is that you know these things and can create OPPORTUNITIES for yourself and your investment portfolio .
They are multi-generational in nature and economic upheaval is an OPPORTUNITY .
EVERYTHING is mispriced and the new prices must BE FOUND and they are a LONG way from here .
So �make lemonade out of lemons� .
Take these fraudsters to the bank rather then letting them take you .
You can be a winner in this .
Figure it out , and find the methods to benefit from this REALITY .

Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal along with wife Supriya are spending the Memorial Day weekend at Republican presidential nominee John McCain ’s ranch in Arizona .
There is speculation that Jindal might be called Mc Cain ’s Vice President .
Mc Cain may present Jindal with the opportunity to speak at the 2008 Republican National Convention , in a similar fashion to Barack Obama at the 2004 Democratic National Convention , cementing a place for him in the party and opening the gate for a future run for the presidency .
At 36 , this first - generation Indian - American Rhodes Scholar is America ’s youngest governor in a southern state with a long history of racial discrimination .
Why does Mc Cain need Jindal ?
Well , that is quite clear .
To compete against Barack Obama and his message of change , 71 - year - old McCain needs a young vice president and one who is committed to doing things differently .
And Jindal fits in this role very well .
If McCain were to win the presidency , he would be the oldest president ever inaugurated .
Not only age Jindal also brings with him the ‘ diversity card ’ , which again will be very helpful for Mc Cain campaign .
The message would be : ‘ You want generational change ?
You can get it with McCain - Jindal — without risking a liberal and inexperienced Obama as commander - in - chief . ’
What else does Jindal stand for ?
Called next Ronald Regan by many , Jindal is Hindu by birth but took to Roman Catholicism while he was still in high school .
He is an opponent of abortion and embryonic stem cell research .
He has said , ” I am 100 % pro-life , no exceptions .
I believe , all life is precious . ”
He has also stated that he would allow emergency contraception , which some pro-life groups consider morally equivalent to abortion .
Jindal also opposes using taxpayer money to fund embryonic stem cell research that involves the cloning and destruction of human embryos .
Jindal supports the teaching of intelligent design in public schools .
He addressed this issue during a September 2007 televised gubernatorial debate :
Let ’s talk about intelligent design .
I ’m a biology major .
That ’s my degree .
The reality is there are a lot of things that we do n’t understand .
There ’s no theory in science that could explain how , contrary to the laws of entropy , you could create order out of chaos .
There ’s no scientific theory that explains how you can create organic life out of inorganic matter .
I think we owe it to our children to teach them the best possible modern scientific facts and theories .
Teach them what different theories are out there for the things that are n’t answerable by science , that are n’t answered by science .
Let them decide for themselves .
I do n’t think we should be scared to do that .
Personally , it certainly makes sense to me that when you look at creation , you would believe in a creator .
Let ’s not be afraid to teach our kids the very best science .
More about Jindal ?
Jindal was born in Baton Rouge , Louisiana to recently arrived Punjabi Indian immigrants Amar and Raj Jindal , who were attending graduate school .
His father left India and his ancestral family village of Khanpura in the 1970s .
His mother , Raj Jindal , is an information technology director for the Louisiana Department of Labor .
In 1997 , Jindal married Supriya Jolly ( born 1972 ) .
The couple has three children .
Turning down offers from both Yale Law and Harvard Medical , Jindal accepted a Rhodes scholarship and moved to Oxford , earning a master ’s degree in political science .
After Oxford , he joined McKinsey & Company , a consulting firm , where he advised Fortune 500 companies .
Most notable was his work for Indian tycoon Lakshmi Mittal of Arcelor Mittal .
Jindal accepted a position as secretary of Louisiana ’s Department of Health and Hospitals under Republican governor Murphy J. Foster Jr. in 1996 .
During his tenure , Jindal turned a $ 400 million deficit into a budget surplus by cutting per-beneficiary Medicaid spending and reducing the work force by 1000 employees , ultimately attracting the attention of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicine , which appointed him executive director in 1998 .
The following year Jindal was appointed president of the University of Louisiana system by the Board of Trustees , the youngest person ever to hold that position .
In 2001 , President Bush nominated Jindal to be assistant secretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services .
He was confirmed unanimously and became Secretary Tommy Thompson ’s chief policy adviser .
Jindal resigned from HHS to run for governor of Louisiana in 2003 .
After winning the primary with a third of the vote , he went on to lose the general to Democrat Kathleen Blanco , 52 - 48 .
The loss raised Jindal ’s profile in the state , however , and he was able to easily win the congressional seat vacated by newly elected Sen.

Even if a Guantanamo prisoner is acquitted on all counts at his trial , the Pentagon may still not release him on grounds he might return to the battlefield , according to an article in the April 14th issue of The New Yorker .
The magazine ’s Jeffrey Toobin quotes Brig .
General Thomas Hartmann , legal adviser to the Pentagon ’s Office of Military Commissions , as saying , “ What ’s unusual about what we ’re doing is that we ’re having the commissions before the end of the war .
The Nuremberg trials ( of accused Nazi war criminals ) were after World War Two , so there was no possibility of the defendants going back to the battlefield . ”
But , Hartmann continued , “ We still have that problem .
We are trying these alleged war criminals during the war .
So , in order to protect our troops in the field , in general we are not going to release anyone who poses a danger until the war is over . ”
By this reasoning , Toobin writes , “ even those Guantanamo detainees who are acquitted of the charges against them are analogous to Nazi war criminals . ”
Curiously , hundreds of Guantanamo prisoners — once depicted by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld as “ the worst of a very bad lot ” — have already been released .
This raises the suspicion they were innocent victims of dragnet arrests or sold to the U.S. by Afghan bounty hunters to enlarge the picture of thousands of Islamist terrorists seething to attack America .
As historian James Carroll put it in “ House of War ” ( Houghton Mifflin ) , the jails of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo are “ emblems of a new system of legally dubious incarceration that involved more than eleven thousand detainees held in mostly secret ( black site ) locations around the world … ”
As Clive Stafford Smith , a detainees ’ lawyer , told The New Yorker : “ Now that it ’s clear that Guantanamo is such an embarrassment , they are just shipping as many of them ( captives ) out the door as they can , and just keeping enough of them to save face .
It ’s a political process that has little to do with terrorism . ”
Only one prisoner since Gitmo first opened on January 11 , 2002 — ex-kangaroo skinner David Hicks — has been actually brought to trial .
He plea - bargained a nine - month term which he served out in his native Australia and is now free .
About 275 prisoners remain in Gitmo , down from an estimated peak of 680 from 43 countries .
According to Toobin , about 60 have been approved for transfer , if countries can be found to take them , and Hartmann anticipates there is sufficient evidence to bring commission trials against only 80 .
“ In sum , ” Toobin writes , “ there are more than 130 detainees for whom Administration officials acknowledge they have no plan , except indefinite detention without trial . ”
Toobin ’s article is titled “ Camp Justice . ”
After years of delay , a trial was actually scheduled to open May 5th against Omar Ahmed Khadr , a Canadian who was 15 years of age when detained on charges of hurling a hand grenade that killed an American GI .
According to The New York Times of April 12 , military judge Col. Peter Brownback III , pushed back his trial date and instead set May 8th to hear more lawyers ’ arguments on pre-trial issues .
Khadr ’s lead lawyer , Navy Lt. Comdr .
William Kuebler , is quoted as saying , “ I do n’t believe anyone can get an acquittal at Guantanamo Bay . ”
He said some witnesses to the firefight say the U.S. soldier may have been killed by friendly fire — a charge Khadr ’s prosecutor claims will be disproved .
Yet what does it matter ?
Even if proved innocent before his all - military panel , Khadr could be held as long as the occupant of the White House says the War on Terror continues !
For many in the Middle East and elsewhere , the legalized duplicity shaping up at Gitmo wo n’t just give America one black eye but two , plus a broken nose , a fat lip , and a mouthful of loose teeth — as George Bush whacks away at the Statue of Liberty with his war club .

Former White House press secretary Scott McClellan ’s new book , in which he accuses the Bush administration of using propaganda to sell the invasion of Iraq , is being used as a sideshow by the corporate media to " debate " and cast suspicion upon the manifestly provable fact that Bush led America into a war based on lies .
The chicken - necked yellow bellied corporate press whores at the New York Times , Washington Post and elsewhere , who gleefully echoed bellicose propaganda about Iraq ’s non-existent WMD program in the months leading up to the invasion , are now attributing a false sense of controversy to McClellan ’s comments when in reality all he is doing is saying one plus one equals two .
The reason for pontificating on McClellan saying Bush used propaganda to sell the war , which is the equivalent of saying that the sun came up yesterday morning , is clear – to sow seeds of doubt in his statements by associating them with a disgruntled former employee who has an axe to grind .
Current White
House sycophants are playing their part too , going off talking points in claiming they are " puzzled " by McClellan ’s statements in an attempt to foster the stereotype of an unstable and bitter McClellan who is merely spewing nonsense in order to backbite and sell a book .
Whether McClellan spoke out to clear his conscience or so he could sell more books is beside the point – the fact that propaganda was used without recourse in the run-up to the March 2003 invasion is self - evident , but the corporate media is hoping that Americans just ca n’t be bothered to remember that far back .
Here ’s a little refresher course .
A report by the Center for Public Integrity earlier this year concluded that White House officials , including President George W. Bush , Vice - President Richard Cheney , National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , Secretary of State Colin Powell , Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , made " 935 demonstrably false statements made on 532 separate occasions " in relation to Iraq and its alleged WMD program .
" It is now beyond dispute that Iraq did not possess any weapons of mass destruction or have meaningful ties to Al Qaeda , " states the report .
" This was the conclusion of numerous bipartisan government investigations , including those by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence ( 2004 and 2006 ) , the 9/11 Commission , and the multinational Iraq Survey Group , whose " Duelfer Report " established that Saddam Hussein had terminated Iraq ’s nuclear program in 1991 and made little effort to restart it . "
Despite this fact , on nearly 1,000 occasions , White House officials “ stated unequivocally that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction ( or was trying to produce or obtain them ) , links to Al Qaeda , or both .
This concerted effort was the underpinning of the Bush administration ’s case for war . ”
The most infamous of all the examples of Iraq war propaganda was the Niger uranium controversy .
Bush cited a forged document that claimed Iraq ’s Saddam Hussein attempted to purchase yellowcake uranium from Niger .
In his 2003 State of the Union Speech , Bush said , " The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa , " despite the fact that the CIA had directly told the White House in an October 2002 memo that the documents were forgeries .
Bush knew that the documents were not genuine , but he used them to deceive the American people into believing a lie about Iraq ’s weapons capability to beef the case for war .
When Iraq released its 12,000 page dossier to the UN describing the scale of its weapons programs and how biological weapons were disposed of , the U.S. government seized the report , deleted 8,000 pages to censor the fact that U.S. companies provided Iraq with its weapons arsenal at the behest of the U.S. government itself , released the rest and then claimed that Iraq was " hiding " evidence of weapons programs .
On the eve of the war the U.S. cited fabricated and unreliable evidence to try and justify a war in the face of mounting anti-war demonstrations .
Colin Powell ’s speech to the U.N. on February 5 2003 was described as a watershed moment because it firmly divided the world into pro and anti-war camps .
At this point blatantly demonization - driven stories were emerging suggesting that Saddam Hussein ’s spies were running and organizing anti-war protests across the world .
Hussein could barely control his small region of dominance and so how his agents were able to leave the country and infiltrate the anti-war movement is baffling .
Powell ’s ‘ evidence ’ consisted of satellite photographs with arrows drawn on pointing to objects that could have been anything , if the satellite photos were even genuine at all .
The then Secretary of State also outlined that the Islamic terrorist group Ansar al - Islam , which he linked to Hussein , were operating a chemical and poisons factory in north - eastern Iraq .
When journalists from several different countries visited this location , they found out that it was in fact a bakery .
“ It emerged that the terrorist factory was nothing of the kind – more a dilapidated collection of concrete outbuildings at the foot of a grassy sloping hill .
Behind the barbed wire , and a courtyard strewn with broken rocket parts , are a few empty concrete houses .
There is a bakery .
There is no sign of chemical weapons anywhere – only the smell of paraffin and vegetable ghee used for cooking , ” reported the London Observer , concluding that Powell ’s charge was " cheap hyperbole " .
In June 2003 , reports emerged that quoted Powell fuming at the " bullshit " he was being forced to read before the UN and in April 2004 , Powell , " admitted that evidence he submitted to the United Nations to justify war on Iraq may have been wrong " .
During his presentation , Powell also held up a British intelligence dossier that claimed to detail Iraq ’s links to terrorist organizations .
Powell stated , “ I would call my colleagues ’ attention to the fine paper that the United Kingdom distributed … which describes in exquisite detail Iraqi deception activities . ”
The dossier , entitled ‘ Iraq – its infrastructure of concealment , deception and intimidation ’ was revealed just a day after Powell ’s speech to be a compilation of 6 - year - old magazine articles and a graduate student thesis which cited information that was 12 - years - old .
Four of the report ’s nineteen pages were copied verbatim from an Internet version of an article by Ibrahim al - Marashi , a postgraduate student from Monterey in California .
Downing Street copied the text without even removing the spelling mistakes .
The only changes that were made were detailed by U.K. Channel 4 News .
“ In several places Downing Street edits the originals to make more sinister reading .
Number 10 says the Mukhabarat – the main intelligence agency – is " spying on foreign embassies in Iraq " .
The original reads : " monitoring foreign embassies in Iraq . "
And the provocative role of " supporting terrorist organisations in hostile regimes " has a weaker , political context in the original : " aiding opposition groups in hostile regimes . ”
The British government made itself look even more foolish by refusing to apologize and actually defending the material as accurate .
They could n’t see the harm in passing off a student essay as high - level MI6 intelligence – and neither could the U.S. government or Colin Powell .
Former Labour MP Glenda Jackson commented , “ If that was presented to Parliament and the country as being up - to - date intelligence , albeit collected from a variety of sources but by British intelligence agents ….. it is another example of how the government is attempting to mislead the country and Parliament on the issue of a possible war with Iraq .
And of course to mislead is a Parliamentary euphemism for lying . ”
The fraud deepened when it was established that the group who actually put the dossier together were not affiliated with MI6 but were a selection of junior aides from the office of Alastair Campbell , Tony Blair ’s propagandist and spin master .
Immediately after this story began to circulate and build in intensity , the U.S. upped the terror alert level to orange and Tony Blair stationed troops and tanks at Heathrow airport .
The government again terrorized the people into becoming distracted by fear and the story of the fraudulent Iraq dossier never resurfaced again .
There were also numerous attempts to link Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein , despite the fact that the two were arch - enemies , a fact even the usually propaganda - happy New York Times was forced to accept .
“ Like other Middle Eastern rulers , Saddam Hussein has long recognized that Al Qaeda and like - minded Islamists represent a threat to his regime .
Consequently , he has shown no interest in working with them against their common enemy , the United States .
This was the understanding of American intelligence in the 1990’s .
In 1998 , the National Security Council assigned staff to determine whether that conclusion was justified .
After reviewing all the available intelligence that could have pointed to a connection between Al Qaeda and Iraq , the group found no evidence of a noteworthy relationship . ”
And yet we were subjected again and again to people like Tony Blair , George Bush and Jack Straw telling us there were clear links between Al - Qaeda and Hussein but not surprisingly they ‘ could n’t tell us the nature of those links ’ because of national security concerns .
Polls were then released showing that over 50 % of Americans thought Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden were the same person .
Rohan Gunaratna , an expert on international terrorism at St. Andrews University , stated , “ I have examined many thousands of documents from Afghanistan I could not find any links whatsoever with Osama bin Laden or al - Qaeda .
If there are links , they should prove it .
They have an enormous intelligence budget , they have interviewed more than 1,000 al - Qaeda suspects , they have examined thousands of documents , and they have found nothing . ”
Amidst empty accusations of a link between Hussein and bin Laden , angry British intelligence officials leaked a top - secret report saying that there were no links .
There was , according to the BBC , growing disquiet at the way their work was being politicized to support the case for war on Iraq .
George Bush felt no qualms in continually citing discredited evidence from British intelligence sources and presenting it as gospel .
Powell ’s dossier of ‘ evidence ’ , the student essay ‘ intelligence report ’ , the phantom links , the whole facade was an endless stream of bullshit intended to convince people who never look behind the curtain that war was justified .
Bush had decided to invade Iraq long before the dog and pony show of diplomatic attempts to have Saddam expunge his deadly non-existent arsenal of weapons of mass destruction .
As far back as 1999 , before he was even elected President , George W. Bush told Mickey Herskowitz , the ghostwriter of his autobiography , that he craved to invade Iraq and finish the job his father started .
Also in the late 1990 ’s , the ideological framework of the Bush administration , the Project For a New American Century , wrote in their own policy documents , “ The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security .
While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification , the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein . ”
The Downing Street Memo , a transcript of a two hour meeting between Bush and Blair at the White House on January 31st , 2003 , revealed that , " Mr Bush made it clear the US intended to invade whether or not there was a second UN resolution and even if UN inspectors found no evidence of a banned Iraqi weapons programme . "
During the same meeting , Bush proposed flying a U2 spy plane over Iraq painted in UN colors , goading Saddam into bringing the aircraft down in a deceptive and crass attempt to enlist UN support for an invasion .
These examples are just a handful of the hundreds of cases where Bush administration officials spewed propaganda , plotted deception and cited intelligence reports which they knew were false to bolster the case for a war which they had already resolved to wage months and even years before the smokescreen of diplomatic efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein ’s imaginary weapons of mass destruction .
The fact that Scott McClellan is being attacked for pointing out the blindingly obvious is another indictment of the corporate media ’s ploy of whipping up a phony controversy in an attempt to make people forget the true gargantuan scale of the lies they were told to sell the invasion of Iraq .

Scientists in the UK have thought differently about touchpad designs : their system peeks at your fingertips to see what you 're touching .
It can sense when you 're pushing on something and how hard , so everything — even a 3D uneven surface — could be made into a touchpad .
Quite why they chose to demo this with a purring rock we 're not sure .
But we like it .
Apparently the team from Nottingham found it fairly easy to image the blood movements underneath your fingernails as you push on something , so their camera tracks these changes and works out whether you 're touching an object and with what pressure .
Try it out yourself : it 's fairly easy to spot the color moving around beneath your nail .

Since the system does n't require complex touchpad technology , it 's pretty simple and cheap to produce .
Good for tactile museum exhibits thinks the science team ; good for whacky game console controllers think I .
There 's just one flaw : nail polish can confuse the camera , so naked nails it is .

Some of the oxygen we breathe today is being produced because of viruses infecting micro-organisms in the world 's oceans , scientists heard April 2 , 2008 at the Society for General Microbiology 's 162nd meeting .
About half the world 's oxygen is being produced by tiny photosynthesising creatures called phytoplankton in the major oceans .
These organisms are also responsible for removing carbon dioxide from our atmosphere and locking it away in their bodies , which sink to the bottom of the ocean when they die , removing it forever and limiting global warming .
" In major parts of the oceans , the micro-organisms responsible for providing oxygen and locking away carbon dioxide are actually single celled bacteria called cyanobacteria , " says Professor Nicholas Mann of the University of Warwick .
" These organisms , which are so important for making our planet inhabitable , are attacked and infected by a range of different types of viruses . "
The researchers have identified the genetic codes of these viruses using molecular techniques and discovered that some of them are responsible for providing the genetic material that codes for key components of photosynthesis machinery .
" It is beginning to become to clear to us that at least a proportion of the oxygen we breathe is a by - product of the bacteria suffering from a virus infection , " says Professor Mann .
" Instead of being viewed solely as evolutionary bad guys , causing diseases , viruses appear to be of central importance in the planetary process .
In fact they may be essential to our survival . "
Viruses may also help to spread useful genes for photosynthesis from one strain of bacteria to another .
If you are still relying on Google to snoop on your friends , you are behind the curve .
Armed with new and established Web sites , people are uncovering surprising details about colleagues , lovers and strangers that often do n't turn up in a simple Internet search .
Though none of these sites can reveal anything that is n't already available publicly , they can make it much easier to find .
And most of them are free .
Zaba Inc.'s ZabaSearch.com turns up public records such as criminal history and birthdates .
Spock Networks Inc.'s Spock.com and Wink Technologies Inc.'s Wink.com are " people - search engines " that specialize in digging up personal pages , such as social - networking profiles , buried deep in the Web .

Jigsaw Data Corp.'s Jigsaw.com , meanwhile , lets people share details with each other from business cards they 've collected -- a sort of gray market for Rolodex data .
Some people have come across dirt on their loved ones without even looking for it .
Doug Orlyk , a 42 - year - old librarian in Bensenville , Ill. , recently turned to ZabaSearch to find his new boyfriend 's address so that he could send him a card .
Instead , he found out that the boyfriend had been lying about his age -- he was 43 years old , not 35 as he had claimed to be on the dating site where Mr. Orlyk had met him .
" I thought , ' You 're a liar !
You 're older than I am ! , ' " Mr. Orlyk recalls .
His new relationship ended soon thereafter .
Others rely on the Web to gather information on the job .

PARIS , France ( CNN ) --
Interpol is chasing more than 200 leads on the potential identity of a pedophile suspected of molesting young boys , just one day after launching a global manhunt .
Interpol has launched a global appeal to find this man , accused of abusing young boys .
The organization , which facilitates global cooperation among police agencies , said its
Web site logged 30 times more visitors than in an average day after it made its plea for the public 's help Tuesday .
Interpol is trying to locate a man who is pictured sexually abusing young boys in hundreds of images on the Internet .
" ' The public 's response has been very positive , " said Kristin Kvigne , assistant director of Interpol 's Trafficking in Human Beings unit , in a news release .
" The smallest piece of information from anywhere in the world could be crucial in identifying this man . "
The man is featured in 100 photographs sexually abusing at least three boys between the ages of six and 10 , Interpol said .
The organization posted six pictures of the suspect on its Web site .
The pictures came to light in 2006 , when Norwegian authorities discovered them in the possession of a man they arrested .

" While these images were only discovered two years ago , we believe the photographs were taken between April 2000 and May 2001 , so clearly this man will be older than he appears in the pictures , " said Kvigne .
Last October , Interpol disseminated pictures of another man whose face appeared in more than 200 images of sex acts with children .
It dubbed its operation Vico , because the images were thought to have been taken in Vietnam and Cambodia .
Ten days later , Christopher Paul Neil -- a 32 - year - old Canadian man who had been working as an English - language teacher in South Korea -- was arrested in Thailand and charged with child abuse .
Following the success of that operation , the organization 's general assembly approved a resolution allowing Interpol to seek public help in child sex abuse investigations .

Twinkie
The Twinkie is an American snack cake , marketed as a " Golden Sponge Cake with Creamy Filling " .
It was formerly made and distributed by Hostess Brands and is again being sold under the Hostess Brands name .
The brand is currently owned by private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos & Co. Twinkie production in the United States resumed after an absence on American store shelves , becoming available again nationwide on July 15 , 2013 . [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
Twinkies are produced in Canada by Saputo Incorporated 's Vachon Inc. ( at a bakery in Montreal ) which owns the Canadian rights for the product and were still available during the absence in the US market . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
Twinkies are also available in Mexican stores , made by Marinela , a subsidiary of Mexican bread company Bimbo . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
History
Box of Hostess Twinkies by Saputo Incorporated ( in production )
Twinkies were invented in River Forest , Illinois on April 6 , 1930 , by James Alexander Dewar , a baker for the Continental Baking Company . [ 7 ]
Realizing that several machines used to make cream - filled strawberry shortcake sat idle when strawberries were out of season , Dewar conceived a snack cake filled with banana cream , which he dubbed the Twinkie . [ 8 ]
He said he came up with the name when he saw a billboard in St. Louis for " Twinkle Toe Shoes " . [ 9 ]
During World War II , bananas were rationed and the company was forced to switch to vanilla cream .
This change proved popular , and banana - cream Twinkies were not widely re-introduced .
The original flavor was occasionally found in limited - time promotions , but the company used vanilla cream for most Twinkies . [ 10 ]
In 1988 , Fruit and Cream Twinkies were introduced with a strawberry filling swirled into the cream .
The product was soon dropped . [ 11 ]
Vanilla 's dominance over banana flavoring would be challenged in 2005 , following a month - long promotion of the movie King Kong .
Hostess saw its Twinkie sales rise 20 percent during the promotion , and in 2007 restored the banana - cream Twinkie to its snack lineup . [ 12 ]
Hostess bankruptcy
On May 4 , 2012 , [ 13 ] parent company Hostess filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . [ 9 ]
Twinkie sales for the year ended December 25 , 2011 , were 36 million packages , down almost 2 % from a year earlier . [ 9 ]
Hostess said customers have migrated to healthier foods . [ 9 ]
On November 16 , 2012 at 7:00 am ( EST ) , Hostess officially announced that it " will be winding down operations and has filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court seeking permission to close its business and sell its assets , including its iconic brands and facilities .

On November 19 , 2012 , Hostess and the Bakers Union agreed to mediation , delaying the shutdown for two days .
On November 21 , 2012 , US Bankruptcy judge Robert Drain approved Hostess ' request to shutdown , temporarily ending Twinkie production in the United States . [ 15 ]
Return of Twinkies to US market
On March 12 , 2013 , it was reported that Twinkies would return to store shelves in May of that year .
Twinkies , along with other famed Hostess Brands , were purchased out of bankruptcy by Apollo Global Management and Metropoulos & Co for $ 410 million . [ 16 ] [ 17 ]
Twinkies returned to US shelves on July 15 , 2013 . [ 18 ]
The new Twinkies , which contrary to popular belief , were made smaller before Hostess Brands filed for bankruptcy and not afterwards , now contain 135 calories and have a mass of 38.5 grams ; while the original Twinkies contained 150 calories and had a mass of 42.5 grams .
The new Twinkies also have a longer shelf life of 45 days , which was also a change made before bankruptcy , compared to the 26 days of the original Twinkies . [ 19 ]

Deep - fried Twinkie
A deep - fried Twinkie
A deep - fried Twinkie involves freezing the cake , dipping it into batter , and deep - frying it to create a variation on the traditional snack cake .
In a story in The New York Times speaking of the Deep Fried Twinkie with its inventor , Christopher Sell , who is originally from Rugby , England , it was described in this way : " Something magical occurs when the pastry hits the hot oil .
The creamy white vegetable shortening filling liquefies , impregnating the sponge cake with its luscious vanilla flavor ....
The cake itself softens and warms , nearly melting , contrasting with the crisp , deep - fried crust in a buttery and suave way .
The pièce de résistance , however , is a ruby - hued berry sauce , adding a tart sophistication to all that airy sugary goodness " . [ 24 ]
The Texas State Fair had introduced the fried Twinkie to great popular acclaim , and the notion spread to other state fairs across the U.S. , as well as some establishments that specialize in fried foods . [ 25 ]
Fried Twinkies are sold throughout the U.S. in fairs as well as ball games , and in various restaurants .
Cultural references
Twinkie defense
The Twinkie defense is a derogatory term for a criminal defendant 's claim that some unusual factor ( such as allergies , coffee , nicotine , or sugar ) diminished the defendant 's responsibility for the alleged crime .
The term arose from Herb Caen 's description of the trial of Dan White , who was convicted in the fatal shootings of San Francisco mayor George Moscone and city supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978 .
During the trial , psychiatrist Martin Blinder testified that White had suffered from depression , causing diminished capacity .
As an example of this , he mentioned that White , formerly a health food advocate , had begun eating junk food . [ 8 ]
Shelf life
A common urban legend claims that Twinkies have an infinite shelf life or can last unspoiled for a relatively long time of ten , fifty , or one hundred years due to the chemicals used in their production . [ 26 ]
This urban legend is false , although Twinkies can last a relatively long time ( 25 days or more ) .
In reality , Twinkies are on the shelf for a short time ; a company executive told the New York Times in 2000 that the " Twinkie is on the shelf no more than 7 to 10 days . " [ 27 ] Twinkies ' myth of having a long shelf life has been referenced in films and television shows such as Die Hard , WALL-E , Zombieland , Ghost Rider : Spirit of Vengeance , The Simpsons , Lost and Family Guy .
Twinkie diet
In 2010 , Kansas State University professor Mark Haub went on a " convenience store " diet consisting mainly of Twinkies , Oreos , and Doritos in an attempt to demonstrate to his students " that in weight loss , pure calorie counting is what matters most , not the nutritional value of the food " .
He lost 27 pounds over a two month period , returning his body mass index ( BMI ) to within normal range . [ 28 ] [ 29 ]

In the run-up to the Olympics some opponents of China 's regime are boycotting not just the games but all Chinese products .
There have been many boycotts before , but with its dominance in manufacturing , those vowing not to buy Chinese face an especially tough challenge .
Sitting on the bus wending your way to work and wherever you are , you probably have a bit of China with you .
Listening to your iPod. Made in China .
Fiddling with your key ring .
Made in China .
Label on the inside of your underpants irritating you a little bit .
It more than likely says " Made in China " .
If you walk down the high street and every garment 's made in China , what do you do ?
Do you go naked ?
Tim Spencer
Boycotter
When there was a boycott of South African products during the Apartheid era or of France by irritated Americans in the run-up to the Iraq war , those were political statements that might have meant a little privation for those involved .
But they were n't on the same scale as China .
Opponents of China talk of its treatment of Tibet , its appalling record on human rights , jailing of dissidents , and even its attitude towards animal welfare when calling for a boycott .
The Friends of Tibet group has called for such action , but it 's impossible to know how many people are engaged in boycotting .
China 's defenders suggest it is becoming more open and receptive to basic rights .
And there are plenty of people who , while criticising China , regard the idea of a boycott as counter - productive .
There are those who feel boycotts are too crude a device , affecting the lowest - paid labourers rather than just the regime .
There is also a view that , particularly when it comes to China , constructive engagement is a better option than a boycott .
Cheap shops
Those who do choose to boycott can be a resolute bunch .
Tricia
Hall spends a lot of time in charity shops .
A trip to the High Street means a slew of questions and baffled stares from shop assistants .
" Where was it made ? " " Dunno , does n't it say ? "
" When they are labelled it is easy enough , " says Mrs Hall .
" We are very careful .
But they have a very large grip on the market .
China is enjoying massive success in some sectors " We do avoid the High Street .
You can't trust them any more .
I certainly do n't go to the cheap shops . "
Mrs Hall and her husband have boycotted Chinese products for a decade because of human and animal rights issues .
Life has been easier for them as they are not big consumers .
But for those who with an electronic bent , for instance , things are more difficult .
Extra cost John Yelland is struggling to print things out .
He decided to start a boycott after seeing a video of dogs being mistreated in China .
Now he can't find a new printer because they all seem to be made in China , or from Chinese components .
" I would rather pay a few quid more for the same product .
You have got to be extremely careful .
A lot of products do n't specify where they were made .
They might say made in Bedfordshire when the product is shipped in from China . "
Chinese factories are making cars based on British designs
It 's the " component problem " .
Let 's say you buy a television from a big name brand in Korea or Japan .
It may be assembled in the home nation , it may even have been assembled in Europe .
But it 's hard to imagine that of the dozens of different components inside it , some have n't come from China .
Whether it 's chips , LEDs or humble wires , there 's a lot of stuff that could potentially not be from the place it was assembled .
" It 's very difficult to go down to every single transistor or circuit board in every device , " says Stuff magazine editor Fraser Macdonald .
Outsourcing wave A boycott of Chinese products really meets its match in the field of consumer electronics .
There is some production still in Europe , particularly of expensive equipment , says Rob Follis , a public relations consultant for consumer electronics firms , but it is dwindling in the face of outsourcing to China .
Avoiding Chinese toys is difficult for boycotters Follis has clients like hi-fi maker Arcam which manufactures mainly in Britain , and headphones firm Sennheiser , which manufactures in the Republic of Ireland and Europe , but they are no longer the rule .
Clothes do n't have the same hidden mix of components as electronics , but China is coming to dominate the market in a way that makes life hard for the boycotters .
Dalha Tsering of the Tibetan Community in Britain group does n't always find it easy .
" I avoid buying anything made in China , from children 's toys to shoes to all sorts of electronic equipment .
Sometimes it is very , very difficult because the price is very , very different .
I usually buy Italian for shoes . "
Child 's birthday Alternative retailers like Ethical Threads or People Tree do n't have any dealings with China .
And for anyone spending a bit of money there 's clothes made in Britain , and in Italy , as well as slightly cheaper options from the likes of Portugal and Eastern Europe .
Tim Spencer , from Wimborne in Dorset , has only been boycotting for a little over a week , since watching a TV documentary about China .
But he can already see problems on the horizon .
What happens when he needs to go clothes shopping ?
Televisions are often made in Korea or Japan " If you walk down the High Street and every garment 's made in China , what do you do ?
Do you go naked ? "
And when the next child 's birthday rolls round in November there could really be problems .
Because one area of manufacturing where China dominates the world market like a colossus is toys .
There are big brands like Playmobil and Lego , whose production bases are in Europe .
But they are the exception rather than the rule .
Alan Milne , of Equitoy , the Association for Toy Importers , says it is impossible to put a precise figure on the level of Chinese toys imported , with EU trade rules complicating the matter .
But it was estimated last year that of all the toys sold in the UK , 85 % are made in China .
Recent years have seen a steady stream of big names taking their production to China .
British firm Hornby and the Swedish wooden train set maker Brio are among the recent departures .
Avoiding China is hard in the globalised world trade system .
Something of Shanghai or Shenzen is in so much of what we own .
Even the most hardened boycotter may inadvertently be buying the " wrong " thing .
Here is a selection of your comments .
I started trying to avoid Chinese products upon hearing about the business of muscling in on the ( already dubious ) cheap labour , particularly clothing , markets of their struggling neighbouring countries .
It 's not that hard to avoid obvious purchases and a great way of curbing what is beginning to prove an unsustainable rate of consumer spending .
Catherine , Manchester , UK Several years ago I tried to avoid buying clothes I though might be made in poor conditions , but as a plus size student I found it very difficult and eventually gave up .
I thought more clothing products were made outside of China than in China but after checking all my clothes labels I 'm wearing today , only one item was not made in China ( two products did n't say ) , so I 'm surprised .
I 'm not actually boycotting Chinese made products myself but have respect for those who are and wish them luck .
I hear kettles are very hard to find .
Emily , Liverpool , Merseyside I noticed this trend three years ago while shopping for a new pair of sandals in America ; not a single pair was made outside China .
I try not to buy Chinese whenever possible , and I figured there must be other people like me who would be prepared to pay more for things if they only knew where to look .
To address this need , I am starting a website called notchinese.com which will enable ethical consumers to choose products from non-Chinese manufacturers .
Guy , Oxford , England I would support those who boycott China for a good reason - e.g. if they 've seen how bad things are in the country .
But there 's a fine line between believing strongly in something , and simply being self - righteous .
I suspect many boycotters belong to the latter group and do not even know why they are boycotting China .
Andy Wu , Cambridge
Along with thousands of other people , mainly women , my wife lost her job to foreign competition .
She was a sample technician for a large supplier of ladies underwear , which supplied the largest clothing retailer in Britain .
I would love to avoid anything that had effectively created a loss of jobs here , but unfortunately I and my wife find that a near impossibility , but its not for want of trying .
A Royston , Stockport Boycotting chinese made goods it not going to work and playing " hard ball " with them wo n't either .
Engaging them in an open discussing is probably the only constructive way to move forward on the issues of human rights and tibet .
Both of these are complicated issues that can't be solved over night or with the wave of a hand .
People need to be realistic and understand that these things take time and a few generations from now am sure things will be much better for everyone .
Nicola , London People always have something to preach or complain about , the majority of them are either being hypocritical or do not have a real understanding of the problems .
In this particular issue , boycotting is really an insignificant action to instill a bit of self - righteousness in oneself or to feel a little less guilt about what they have ( or even what they are ) .
China as a country has been through too many struggles to care whether a few consumers are boycotting them or not .
Olivia , London
It is possible to buy goods made in other countries .
I have been avoiding Chinese goods for years , but it takes time and trouble to find out the country of origin .
If it is cheap , the chances are that it is Chinese , so look for proof that it is not .
I recently bought a helmet from a Korean manufacturer and only after getting home found the " Made in China " label covered by the lining .
Tim Betteridge , London
Not only is it well nigh impossible to avoid buying Chinese , but it is very unlikely to have any effect , except making the boycoters ' life difficult , so why bother ?
Is it just a sort of " holier than thou " demonstration ?
If we want to influence China , we have to talk to them - kindly - putting aside our own selfish pride and sometimes uninformed opinions .
Nobody is willing to listen to criticism from someone who is abusive , hypocritical and / or does n't know what they are talking about .
Jan , Swindon
Why do n't you argue that the existence of China has helped stabilise the world economy by lowering the production cost on almost everything ?
Without it , people 's everyday expenses will go rocket high .
Rich people can certainly afford few pounds more on non-China made stuff ; how about there are millions who cannot .
You will face starvation if you want things all made over here , because there will be plenty of strikes going on , demanding more money , more holiday , you name it .
The guy who starting boycotts China after just a TV documentary , I feel so sad for him .
It seems that he is the one who has no opinion of his own ; maybe another different documentary will change his mind again .
I certainly can make a documentary by just filming outside the pubs on a Saturday night , and then show to Chinese people , and I am quite sure they will be scared .
I think they will also start to wonder if it is a good idea to send their kids to the UK for education .
People always say that there are two sides on every story ; it seems to me that BBC only has one side when the word China comes alone .
Miao Hao , St Andrews , Scotland
In this age where politicians lack the integrity to do the right thing , a consumer boycott is the most effective way of making your opinions count !
As for China - their greed will hopefully force them to turn the corner .
Mark , London
The ability of consumers to demonstrate their dislike of a countrys politics by not funding their economy should be encouraged .
Much like food products having to list their ingredients , consumer durables should list which countries had input into their manufacture and to what degree .
Money is the real superpower , and this could be the new global democracy .
Jason , London
If I am a Chinese national , I will boycott English , French , German and US products .
To support thugs , arsonists and murderers and claim violation of human rights has got to be height of hypocrisy .
Goh Lip , Petaling Jaya , Malaysia
I 've been boycotting Chinese products for about six months now , in response not only to China 's abysmal human rights record , but also in reaction to US companies outsourcing American manufacturing jobs .
It 's hard , but not impossible .
There are a few good sites online that give the names of products still manufactured in the US , including clothing , toys , and electronics like televisions , washer / dryers , etc .
I 'm sure that there are similar sites for the UK .
By buying products from US manufacturers , I feel that I 'm using my money to support my country 's economy and fair labor practices .
We consumers have a lot of power in our wallets , if we choose to use it .
Cristin , New York , NY
There are two big problems I identify in the China boycott movement .
Firstly , China is regarded as the " in " and " fashionable " country of the Western world 's elite .
If big corporations adopt attitudes of , " China is good for business , so who cares about its human rights record ? " , it becomes difficult to do anything .
Secondly , the biggest problem in the anti-China movement is that its aims do n't fulfil the SMART acronym : - specific , measurable , achievable , realistic and time - bound .
The political correctness movement against apartheid succeeded because it had the very specific aim of legislation being passed to allow people to vote in South Africa regardless of race .
We are n't really sure what we want with China and we are n't sure how to determine when we have succeeded .
Graeme Phillips , London , UK I have long ago boycotted China  since the mid-1980s .
I lived in the US and it was quite easy to boycott because the origin of everything has to be stamped on the product .
In the UK this is not so easy .
There is no law that says goods have to tell you where they were made .
However , you can usually tell from the price .
That darling little number that cost you five quid most likely came from China .
The Olympics only highlights the injustices that China masks to the rest of the world .
Social consciences need to be turned on for more than just for the summer of 2008 .
While my lonely pound doesnt make much of a dent in Chinas GNP I am doing something  what are you doing ?

Just a little follow up about the girl who died because her parents were negligent , crazy religious people .
From the article ;
Her mother , Leilani Neumann , told The Associated Press that she never expected her daughter , whom she called Kara , to die .
The family believes in the Bible , and it says healing comes from God , but they are not crazy , religious people , she said .
Uh , sorry to burst you bubble little lady but healing comes from trained doctors .
You know , the kind you find at HOSPITALS ?
Where you refused to take your precious daughter because you thought your God would help you and her ?
Maybe you would have known it was terminal if you were n’t a moron and took her to get help .
You crazy , religious person , you !
“ We are remaining strong for our children , ” she said .
“ Only our faith in God is giving us strength at this time . ”
I would find it hard to have faith after praying to God ( The same God she ’s talking about up there ) and my daughter dies .
That would tell me a little something .
I would get my head out of my ass and realize that he ’s not helping .
If anything God is the reason your daughter died , he ’s a murderer .
He blindsided you into thinking he could help , so you refused to take your daughter to a professional .
Fuck God and fuck you .
Leilani Neumann said the family is not worried about a police investigation into her daughter ’s death because “ our lives are in God ’s hands .
We know we did not do anything criminal .
We know we did the best for our daughter we knew how to do . ”
Yes , I ’m sure it ’s comforting to put your life in Gods hands after he just took your daughters life .
You did n’t do the best for your daughter or she would be ALIVE AND WELL you ignorant cunts .
The best , as I said would have been to go see a damn doctor .
Vergin said he expect the investigation to wrap up by Friday and the findings to be forwarded to the district attorney to review for possible charges .
I really , truly hope these criminals get locked up .
They deserve more and worse , but jail will suffice .
Mrs. Neumann said she deeply loves all her children and has nurtured them spiritually , emotionally and physically .
All I can and will say is , no you do n’t .
“ Our lives are in God ’s hands and whatever we go through we are just going to trust him , ” she said .
“ We need healing .
We are going through the healing process . ”
Hah .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - The United States has agreed in principle to provide Israel with better “ smart bombs ” than those it plans to sell Saudi Arabia under a regional defense package , senior Israeli security sources said on Sunday .
Keen to bolster Middle East allies against an ascendant Iran , the Bush administration last year proposed supplying Gulf Arab states with some $ 20 billion in new weapons , including Joint Direct Attack Munition ( JDAM ) bomb kits for the Saudis .
The plan has angered Israel ’s backers in Washington , who say the JDAMs , which give satellite guidance for bombs , may one day be used against the Jewish state or at least blunt its power to deter potential foes .
Israel has had JDAMs since 1990 and has used them extensively in a 2006 offensive in Lebanon .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ’s government dropped its objections to the proposed Saudi deal in July after securing U.S. military aid grants worth $ 30 billion over the next decade .
Two Israeli security sources said the United States further mollified the Olmert government with an “ understanding in principle ” that future JDAM sales to Israel would include advanced technologies not on offer to Saudi Arabia .
“ We are checking which of the top - of - the - line JDAMs will become available to us .
The agreement is that Israel ’s qualitative edge will be preserved , ” one source said .
The spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv could not immediately be reached for comment .
Shlomo Dror , spokesman for Israel ’s Defense Ministry , declined to give details on any specific defense deals , saying only : “ The Americans are certainly taking steps to help us preserve our technological superiority , as is Israel . ”
JAMMING
Robert Hewson , editor of Jane ’s Air- launched Weapons , suggested Israel might be interested in American innovations aimed at making JDAMs immune to jamming attempts .
“ The great unspoken fear is that you can come up against an enemy who knows what he is doing when it comes to countermeasures , ” Hewson said .
He added that Israel is currently the only country in the Middle East believed to have JDAMs .
U.S. President George W. Bush was due to visit Saudi Arabia on Monday as part of a Middle East tour he hopes will shore up Washington ’s efforts to isolate Iran over its nuclear projects .
In Israel and the Palestinian territories last week , Bush worked to foster bilateral peacemaking but also discussed Iran , which denies seeking nuclear weapons but whose president has stirred war fears by urging that Israel be “ wiped off the map ” .
Israel used JDAMs extensively in its 2006 offensive against Iranian - backed Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon , requiring urgent U.S. resupplies .
Surprise setbacks in the 34 - day war prompted Israel ’s top brass to order an overhaul of the armed forces .
Believed to have the Middle East ’s only atomic arsenal , Israel has vowed to deny Iran nuclear weapons and hinted at the possibility of a strike like its air force ’s 1981 bombing of Iraq ’s nuclear reactor .
According to the Internet site of JDAM manufacturer Boeing Co , recent enhancements to the kits include laser navigators and glide wings that allow jets to drop the munitions from a distance of more than 40 miles from the target .
Saudi Arabia does not recognize Israel but signaled a softening of this stance by attending a U.S. - hosted conference on Palestinian statehood in November .
There are so many reasons why food prices sky - rocketed during the last twelve months , but more important than blaming , is to find a viable solution .
Jeffrey D. Sachs , head of Columbia University ’s Earth Institute and adviser to the U.N. chief , talked on Monday about the food crisis in developing countries .
He said that simple reforms could double Africa ’s food production in just a few years and this solution may probably cool down food prices .
He also mentioned that the African farmers need help from wealthy countries to invest into better practices including fertilizers , water management systems or drought - resistant seeds .
In an interview in Nairobi , Sachs also mentioned that in his belief , a $ 10 billion aid to small farmers would probably solve the problem which is worse than believed .
During the last year , rice prices went up more than 40 - percent and reached higher values because of the cyclone in Myanmar , a large rice exporter , that devastated the whole area .
According to Sachs , the only solution is to immediately invest in agriculture .
Picture by Frankie Roberto
If every person from a rich country would pay $ 10 , Africa would double its production and help reduce the burden on poor countries , because those are the most affected by high food price .
Riots and protests in Asia , the Caribbean and several African countries , arose last month which means that the food crisis is real .
This is the title of this story , which is also found several times in the story itself
I do n't know the author ; I got it from the net .
This is the first sentence of this story .
This is the second sentence .
This is the title of this story , which is also found several times in the story itself .
This sentence is questioning the intrinsic value of the first two sen- tences .
This sentence is to inform you , in case you have n't already realized it , that this is a self - referential story , that is , a story containing sentences that refer to their own structure and function .
This is a sentence that pro- vides an ending to the first paragraph .
This is the first sentence of a new paragraph in a self - referential story .
This sentence is introducing you to the protagonist of the story , a young boy named Billy .
This sentence is telling you that Billy is blond and blue - eyed and American and twelve years old and strangling his mother .
This sentence comments on the awkward nature of the selfreferential narrative form while recognizing the strange and playful detachment it affords the writer .
As if illustrating the point made by the last sentence , this sentence reminds us , with no trace of facetiousness , that children are a precious gift from God and that the world is a better place when graced by the unique joys and delights they bring to it .
This sentence describes Billy 's mother 's bulging eyes and protruding tongue and makes reference to the unpleasant choking and gagging noises she 's making .
This sentence makes the observation that these are uncertain and difficult times , and that relationships , even seemingly deep - rooted and permanent ones , do have a tendency to break down .
Introduces , in this paragraph , the device of sentence fragments .
A sentence fragment .
Another .
Good device .
Will be used more later .
This is actually the last sentence of the story but has been placed here by mistake .
This is the title of this story , which is also found several times in the story itself .
As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself in his bed transformed into a gigantic insect .
This sentence informs you that the preceding sentence is from another story entirely ( a much better one , it must be noted ) and has no place at all in this particular narrative .
Despite claims of the preceding sentence , this sentence feels compelled to inform you that the story you are reading is in actuality " The Metamorphosis " by Franz Kafka , and that the sentence referred to by the preceding sentence is the only sentence which does indeed belong in this story .
This sentence overrides the preceding sentence by informing the reader ( poor , confused wretch ) that this piece of literature is actually the Declaration of Independence , but that the author , in a show of extreme negligence ( if not malicious sabotage ) , has so far failed to include even one single sentence from that stirring document , although he has condescended to use a small sentence fragment , namely , " When in the course of human events " , embedded in quotation marks near the end of a sentence .
Showing a keen awareness of the boredom and downright hostility of the average reader with regard to the pointless conceptual games indulged in by the preceding sentences , this sentence returns us at last to the scenario of the story by asking the question , " Why is Billy strangling his mother ? "
This sentence attempts to shed some light on the question posed by the preceding sentence but fails .
This sentence , however , succeeds , in that it suggests a possible incestuous relationship between Billy and his mother and alludes to the concomitant Freudian complications any astute reader will immediately envision .
Incest .
The unspeakable taboo .
The universal prohibition .
Incest .
And notice the sentence fragments ?

This is the first sentence in a new paragraph .
This is the last sentence in a new paragraph .
This sentence can serve as either the beginning of the paragraph or end , depending on its placement .
This is the title of this story , which is also found several times in the story itself .
This sentence raises a serious objection to the entire class of self - referential sentences that merely comment on their own function or placement within the story e.g. , the preceding four sentences ) , on the grounds that they are monotonously predictable , unforgivably self - indulgent , and merely serve to distract the reader from the real subject of this story , which at this point seems to concern strangulation and incest and who knows what other delightful topics .
The purpose of this sentence is to point out that the preceding sentence , while not itself a member of the class of self - referential sentences it objects to , nevertheless also serves merely to distract the reader from the real subject of this story , which actually concerns Gregor Samsa 's inexplicable transformation into a gigantic insect ( despite the vociferous counterclaims of other well - meaning although misinformed sentences ) .
This sentence can serve as either the beginning of the paragraph or end , depending on its placement .
This is the title of this story , which is also found several times in the story itself .
This is almost the title of the story , which is found only once in the story itself .
This sentence regretfully states that up to this point the self - referential mode of narrative has had a paralyzing effect on the actual progress of the story itself -- that is , these sentences have been so concerned with analyzing themselves and their role in the story that they have failed by and large to perform their function as communicators of events and ideas that one hopes coalesce into a plot , character development , etc. -- in short , the very raisons d'etre of any respectable , hardworking sentence in the midst of a piece of compelling prose fiction .
This sentence in addition points out the obvious analogy between the plight of these agonizingly self - aware sentences and similarly afflicted human beings , and it points out the analogous paralyzing effects wrought by excessive and tortured selfexamination .
The purpose of this sentence ( which can also serve as a paragraph ) is to speculate that if the Declaration of Independence had been worded and structured as lackadaisically and incoherently as this story has been so far , there 's no telling what kind of warped libertine society we'd be living in now or to what depths of decadence the inhabitants of this country might have sunk , even to the point of deranged and debased writers constructing irritatingly cumbersome and needlessly prolix sentences that sometimes possess the questionable if not downright undesirable quality of referring to themselves and they sometimes even become run-on sentences or exhibit other signs of inexcusably sloppy grammar like unneeded superfluous redundancies that almost certainly would have insidious effects on the lifestyle and morals of our impressionable youth , leading them to commit incest or even murder and maybe that 's why Billy is strangling his mother , because of sentences just like this one , which have no discernible goals or perspicu- ous purpose and just end up anywhere , even in mid

Damn good device .
The purpose of this sentence is threefold : ( 1 ) to apologize for the unfortunate and inexplicable lapse exhibited by the preceding paragraph ; ( 2 ) to assure you , the reader , that it will not happen again ; and ( 3 ) to reiterate the point that these are uncertain and difficult times and that aspects of language , even seemingly stable and deeply rooted ones such as syntax and meaning , do break down .
This sentence adds nothing substantial to the sentiments of the preceding sentence but merely provides a concluding sentence to this paragraph , which otherwise might not have one .
This sentence , in a sudden and courageous burst of altruism , tries to abandon the self - referential mode but fails .
This sentence tries again , but the attempt is doomed from the start .
This sentence , in a last - ditch attempt to infuse some iota of story line into this paralyzed prose piece , quickly alludes to Billy 's frantic cover - up attempts , followed by a lyrical , touching , and beautifully written passage wherein Billy is reconciled with his father ( thus resolving the subliminal Freudian conflicts obvious to any astute reader ) and a final exciting police chase scene during which Billy is accidentally shot and killed by a panicky rookie policeman who is coincidentally named Billy .
This sentence , although basically in complete sympathy with the laudable efforts of the preceding action - packed sentence , reminds the reader that such allusions to a story that does n't , in fact , yet exist are no substitute for the real thing and therefore will not get the author ( indolent goof - off that he is ) off the proverbial hook .

Sorry .
The purpose of this sentence is to apologize for the pointless and silly adolescent games indulged in by the preceding two paragraphs , and to express regret on the part of us , the more mature sentences , that the entire tone of this story is such that it can't seem to communicate a simple , albeit sordid , scenario .
This sentence wishes to apologize for all the needless apologies found in this story ( this one included ) , which , although placed here ostensibly for the benefit of the more vexed readers , merely delay in a maddeningly recursive way the continuation of the by - now nearly forgotten story line .
This sentence is bursting at the punctuation marks with news of the dire import of self - reference as applied to sentences , a practice that could prove to be a veritable Pandora 's box of potential havoc , for if a sentence can refer or allude to itself , why not a lowly subordinate clause , perhaps this very clause ?
Or this sentence fragment ?
Or three words ?
Two words ?
One ?
Perhaps it is appropriate that this sentence gently and with no trace of condescension reminds us that these are indeed difficult and uncertain times and that in general people just are n't nice enough to each other , and perhaps we , whether sentient human beings or sentient sentences , should just try harder .
I mean , there is such a thing as free will , there has to be , and this sentence is proof of it !
Neither this sentence nor you , the reader , is completely helpless in the face of all the pitiless forces at work in the universe .
We should stand our ground , face facts , take Mother Nature by the throat and just try harder By the throat .
Harder .
Harder , harder .

Thirteen years after such legislation was first introduced , the House of Representatives passed the bill , 414 - 1 , and sent it to President George W. Bush , who has promised to sign it into law .
The Senate approved the bipartisan measure last week , 95-0 .
The bill would bar health insurers from rejecting coverage or raising premiums for healthy people based on personal or familial genetic predisposition to develop a particular disease such as cancer , diabetes , heart ailments or many others .
In addition , it would prohibit employers , unions and employment agencies from using genetic information in hiring , firing , pay or promotion decisions .
It would also forbid health insurers from compelling a person to take a genetic test .
Backers of the measure said people have declined genetic tests that could help lead to treatment of their ailments out of fear they could lose their jobs or insurance coverage .
“ By prohibiting the improper use of genetic information , Americans will be encouraged to take advantage of the tremendous life - altering potential of genetic research , ” said Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York , chief sponsor of the bill .
“ This legislation marks the beginning of a new era . ”
Rep. Judy Biggert of Illinois , lead Republican sponsor of the bill , said , “ No one should fear for their job or health coverage because of the genes they were born with , and now they wo n’t have to . ”
“ Make no mistake : this bill will dramatically reduce health care costs while saving or extending human lives , ” Biggert said .
Opposed by some business groups , various versions of the legislation had languished in Congress since 1995 .
But this year , it won broad support on and off Capitol Hill .
The legislation has the backing of the White House and health insurers , although it is opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which represents 3 million small and big businesses .
Scientific and health organizations hailed the House action , saying the legislation will help combat discrimination as well as diseases .
Dr. David Herrington , a representative of the American Heart Association , said : “ With this measure ... we expect more Americans will participate in genetic research and accept genetically directed strategies for treatment and prevention that will ultimately reduce the tremendous burden of heart disease , stroke and many other diseases in the U.S. ”
Research increasingly is revealing the genetic underpinning of many diseases .
Scientists have developed numerous genetic tests to assess people ’s predisposition to various ailments .
The measure is intended to guarantee that results of these tests are not used against people by employers or insurers not willing to shoulder the high cost of treating some diseases .
Doctors can administer a variety of genetic tests and many companies are now offering them direct to consumers , typically at a cost of hundreds of dollars or more .

The idea of regrowing limbs sounds " kind of Star Trek-y , " Russell admits , but he says that it 's within the grasp of science .
He points to his colleague at McGowan , Stephen Badylak , a pathologist and fellow AFIRM researcher , who shocked the medical world last year when he reported that a powder culled from pig bladders helped resprout the severed fingertips of two patients in their 60s .
Normally , when a person loses a limb , scar tissue forms over the wound , leaving a permanent stub .
The pig powder contains signaling molecules that attract cells and proteins known as growth factors and override the scarring process , telling the cells to grow instead .
( Badylak settled on pigs because their molecules are similar to those found in humans and easy to obtain . )
The pig dust was so effective that , with just a light dusting every other day for two weeks , the fingertips grew back entirely — fingernails and all — six weeks later , Badylak reported .
For already scarred - over limbs , researchers have developed an enzyme that eats away scar tissue so they can dust the healthy cells below .
With AFIRM 's backing , Badylak next hopes to figure out how to stimulate the growth of more complicated muscle tissues found in arms and legs .
Obamamania verges on obsession
BALTIMORE — Maryland Congressman Elijah Cummings has held elected office for more than a quarter - century , so he 's seen his fair share of politicians come and go .
But apparently he 's never seen one quite like Illinois Sen. Barack Obama .
Advertisement
" This is not a campaign for president of the United States , this is a movement to change the world , " he said as he introduced Obama last week in Baltimore .
" You do not get 13,000 people in this auditorium with a campaign . "
As over the top as it may have sounded , Cummings ' sentiments were n't all that unusual .
Because when it comes to Obama , hyperbole seems to be the rule , not the exception .
His charms seem tough to resist , even for some of Hollywood ’s biggest names .
" He walks into a room and you want to follow him somewhere , anywhere , " George Clooney told talk show host Charlie Rose .
" I 'll do whatever he says to do , " actress Halle Berry said to the Philadelphia Daily News .
" I 'll collect paper cups off the ground to make his pathway clear . "
Welcome to the cult of Barack Obama .
Many talented politicians attract devoted throngs — but with Obama , the fervency of his following borders on the messianic , and that phenomenon has only increased in recent weeks as Obama has scored 10 consecutive primary and caucus victories over New York Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton , surged into the lead in the delegate count , and claimed the mantle of front - runner for the Democratic nomination .
But is there a downside to being viewed as a political deity ?
Critics , including Clinton , Arizona Sen .
John McCain and members of the Republican chattering class clearly think so .
A competing narrative has formed in recent weeks in which opponents try to turn Obama ’s popularity into a negative by hinting that there ’s something uninformed and empty — or just plain creepy — about his impassioned support .
For weeks , Clinton and her campaign have increasingly centered their critique of Obama on the notion that while he can wax poetic on the stump , she offers more experience and on - the - job training .
Last week , Clinton adviser Sid Blumenthal e-mailed an article from The American Conservative implying that Obama 's support was , at least in part , due to white liberal guilt .
" It 's time to get real about how we actually win this election , " Clinton said Wednesday at Hunter College in New York .
“ It 's time that we move from good words to good works , from sound bites to sound solutions . ”
Her conclusion : “ Let ’s get real . ”
McCain , the presumptive GOP nominee , also has clearly signaled how he would attack Obama should the Illinois senator be his Democratic opponent in the fall .
After McCain ’s victory in Wisconsin Tuesday night , he too cast Obama as long on rhetoric but light on substance .
" I will fight every moment of every day in this campaign to make sure that Americans are not deceived by an eloquent but empty call for change , " McCain said .
Unfortunately for McCain and Clinton , their talking points do n’t seem to matter much to the growing ranks of Obama - maniacs .
Thousands of screaming , cheering , and sometimes even crying supporters regularly come out to hear him talk .
His most fervent backers fall in love with his idealistic message of change — irrelevant of the dry details — his youth , and his powerful presence on the stump .
For some , the affair can border on obsession .
And activist Democrats are n't the only ones swept up in Obamamania .
His campaign events are filled with first - time voters , self - described political slackers , and even a few Republicans who now zealously back the first - term senator from Illinois .
Ross Avila , a senior at The University of Pennsylvania , drove more than 2,200 miles to volunteer in Iowa , New Jersey and South Carolina for the campaign .
" Iowa in January was so miserable , " he says , remembering the single - digit temperatures .
" I can't imagine doing such grueling work for someone that I did n't believe in so much .
I think he 's very unique that way . "
The true believers can “ Obama - ize ” just about anything .
Knitters for Obama crochet for him , Runners for Obama jog for him , and Hold ' Em Barack , well , they bet on him .
In Chicago , a recent art exhibit showed works depicting the candidate on canvas , paper and even in animated videos .
Some of the posters are vaguely reminiscent of classic Soviet propaganda , with a large , benevolent - looking Obama staring out from the paper .
The artists plan to tour their " independent political propaganda campaign " across the country .
The Internet offers a revealing glimpse into the curious scope of Obamamania .
One blog , titled " Is Barack Obama the Messiah ? " cuts right to the chase .
A search on Flickr , a photo - sharing website , turns up pictures of Obama cakes , murals , etch - a - sketch drawings , and even tattoos .
On Etsy , a crafts auction website , you can buy Obama jewelry , paintings , and even a homemade Obama Valentine .
The card shows a sketch of the candidate with the text , " I want to Barack your world . "
The magnitude of the Obama movement has reached such Elvis - like proportions that even the candidate seems to be trying to tone things down .
Last week , he talked much less about his campaign being a social movement and more about concrete policy plans , taxes , energy consumption and education .
On Wednesday , he gave a major economic address at a General Motors plant in Wisconsin , introducing his plan to invest in " green - collar " jobs and create a National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank .
" Today I want to take it down a notch , " he said at the start of his speech , noting that his address would be " a little more detailed , a little longer , with not as many applause lines . "
In Houston Tuesday night , he also seemed to warn his audience that his campaign would rise and fall on hard work and basic political intangibles rather than the appeal of a higher calling .
" The change we seek is still months and miles away , " Obama said .
“ As clear as I am that I am not a perfect vessel , I would not be running if I did not believe that I could lead this country in that new direction that we have a unique moment that we have to seize , ” said Obama , “ but I have to tell you I ca n’t do it by myself .
No president can . ”
So far , none of the change in rhetoric appears to have dulled the ardor of Obama 's fans .
Earlier this month , the campaign raised over $ 7.5 million in less than 48 hours , all through online contributions .
In January , Obama raised roughly $ 32 million to Clinton 's $ 13.5 million .
Last week , Obama attracted a crowd of 19,000 to the Kohl Center in Madison , Wis .
Four days earlier , more than 18,000 voters filled Seattle 's Key Arena to see him .
The 3,000 that did n't get in waited in the cold for over an hour to hear a roughly two - minute version of his stump speech .
When Obama finally took the stage , the crowd roared so loudly that a local reporter in the press section covered her ears .
At an Omaha , Neb. , rally the day before , supporters leaned perilously over railings , screaming and crying , trying to touch Obama as he passed .
During both speeches , a supporter yelled out , " I love you . "
This happens fairly frequently and Obama is always ready with a smooth answer .
" I love you back , " he says , with a quick , almost cocky smile .
The campaign works hard to cultivate the rock star image .
After he 's introduced , Obama routinely waits about 30 seconds to enter the arena .
The excitement grows , until his entrance is perfectly timed with the soaring chords of U2's “ City of Blinding Lights . ”
" I can't really verbalize exactly what it is about him , " says Avila .
" Part of it is just beyond explanation . "
The millionaire next door does a lot to get ahead , but you can be pretty sure the list excludes the following 20 points .
The millionaire next door does NOT :
Pay for Lawn Service –
You could save $ 150 a month , get some healthy exercise and maybe even a bit of a tan just by mowing your own yard .
Go to a Hair Stylist – Even the cheapest barber shops charge men $ 15 – $ 20 for a haircut these days .
If you ’re a woman , it may cost well over $ 50 a visit .
Dying your hair ?
You ’re broke !
Use Time as a Measurement for Success –
The millionaire next door measures success based on output quality , the results .
The amount of time spent on something means nothing if the results do not meet the expectations .
Buy Brand New Cars –
Why would anyone pay the full retail price worth half a year ’s salary for the fastest depreciating assent on Earth ?
We are brainwashed !
Carry a Monthly Credit Card Balance – Carrying a monthly credit card balance only makes sense if you enjoy poverty .
Monthly interest payments can add up to hundreds of dollars over the course of a year .
Do not buy “ stuff ” right now that you cannot afford to pay for in cash right now !
Eat Out on a Regular Basis – With the recent price increases in corn , wheat and dairy products , preparing your own food is already expensive enough .
If you eat out you will pay triple the price .
If done on a regular basis you will waste a few thousand dollars a year .
Think He Knows
It All – People who think they know it all stop learning and thus become unaware of new opportunities .
Once you lose awareness , you lose .
Socialize with People Who Waste Money –
The people you socialize with influence your habits .
It is impossible to save money if you constantly hang around people who blow it all .
Desire Instant Gratification –
You have to think long - term to attain long - term success .
The millionaire next door desires long - term deferred compensation over instant gratification .
Pay Retail for Name Brand Clothing –
You can easily save hundreds of dollars a year on clothing purchases by waiting for sales or shopping at discount retailers like Marshalls .
Better yet , avoid name brand clothing all together .
Keep His Money in a Checking Account –
If you want to increase your wealth you have to set your money up to make more money .
Most checking accounts yield little to nothing in interest .
Think long - term ( 5 years + ) .
Invest in quality stocks , bonds and mutual funds , especially those with high yield dividends and interest .
Or buy some land in an area with growth potential .
Replace
What is Not Broken –
The millionaire next door fixes things .
Fixing something is usually significantly cheaper than buying a brand new replacement , especially if you fix it yourself .
Visit the Tanning Bed – $ 25 a month for skin cancer ?
Where do I sign up ?
If you want a tan , move to Florida .
For those that live in Florida and still go to the tanning bed …
WOW !
Impulse Buy – Impulse buying wastes money and leads to a cluttered house full of “ stuff ” you do n’t need or use .
If you see something you like at the mall , walk away .
Think on it for a day or two .
If it still holds value in your mind , maybe it ’s worth buying .
Never buy something the first time you see it .
Waste Time on Senseless Activities – They say time is money .
In actuality , time is far more important than money .
Time is your life .
If you waste it , you will fail .
Focus His Attention on Negative Obstacles –
If you focus all your attention on negative obstacles , you will lose sight of the finish line .
You ca n’t get there if you ca n’t see it .
Bet The Farm –
The millionaire next door takes evenly weighted , calculated risks on long term investments .
If you go “ all in ” , you ’re gambling , not investing .
Fly First - class – Would you pay $ 400 to sit in a leather chair for a couple of hours ?
That ’s exactly what you do when you fly first class .
Huge waste of money !
Rent –
The millionaire next door has a long - term mindset .
In the long - term , owning something is always more cost effective than renting it .
The key is to purchase quality products for long - standing use .
Earn Every Dollar He Makes at His Day Job – Two words : Passive Income .
You can be sure the millionaire next door invests his money wisely .
These investments create a solid passive income stream that grows over time .
If your money is n’t making you more money , you ’ll never be wealthy .

Enthusiastically proclaiming you would want someone as unpopular as Dick Cheney serving in your administration ?
How mavericky !
Politico :
Asked whether he’d be interested in Cheney had the vice president not already have served under Bush for two terms , McCain said : “ I do n’t know if I would want him as vice president .
He and I have the same strengths .
But to serve in other capacities ?
Hell , yeah . ”
You almost have to feel bad for McCain and the fine line he has to tread .
On the one hand he has to distance himself from the miserable failure that is the Bush years ; on the other hand he has to reassure the dead - enders ( aka the GOP base ) that he really does consider Bush / Cheney a fantastic success .
It 's no wonder why , then , that McCain will find himself praising the Bushies one minute , and running away as quickly as possible the other .
At least it will make for some fun campaign moments .

LONDON , April 8 , 2008 ( LifeSiteNews.com ) -
A pro-life and pro-family Christian lobbying and education organisation is taking the internet giant Google to court over the latter ’s refusal to allow advertisements about abortion that contain religious content .
When the Christian Institute , a UK registered charity , asked Google for site - targeted advertising , the company refused citing the proposed ad for " inappropriate content " .
The Institute is suing , saying the refusal constituted discrimination on the grounds of religious belief , a violation of Britain ’s anti-discrimination laws .
A spokesman for the Institute said , " For many people , Google is the doorway to the internet .
It is an influential gatekeeper to the marketplace of debate .
If there is to be a free exchange of ideas then Google cannot give special free speech rights to secular groups whilst censoring religious views . "
The company told the Institute , " Google policy does not permit the advertisement of websites that contain ‘ abortion and religion - related content ’ " .
The Christian Institute had asked for an AdWords ad , one that offers pay - per- click ( PPC ) advertising .
The refused ad would have read , " UK abortion law : news and views on abortion from the Christian Institute . www.christian.org.uk " .
Had the company accepted the ad , internet users putting the word " abortion " into the search engine would have seen an ad for the Christian Institute on the right side of the search page .
The company , however , has no such qualms when it comes to ads for abortionists such as Marie Stopes International , who have an AdWord ad that appears now when the word " abortion " is typed into the search engine .
Google is the world ’s largest and most successful internet search engine company , with over 80 million users a month .
The UK ’s Equality Act 2006 prohibits discrimination based on religious belief in the provision of goods and services .
The Christian Institute pointed out that Google handles an enormous volume of pornographic materials , and cited the company for hypocrisy .
This is not the first time that Google has come under criticism for a liberal bias in life and family issues .
In 2005 the company turned down requests for ad space by RightMarch.com , a conservative web site that lobbies on a variety of US political issues .
Again in 2007 , the company temporarily blocked the weblog of a Brazilian Christian activist and writer who was using their affiliated Blogger service .
The site ’s contents were removed and replaced with a statement that read , " This blog is being reviewed for possible violations of the Blogger Terms of Service , and can only be opened by the authors . "
The blog ’s author , Julio Severo , said that Google did not inform him of the reasons for blocking the site , but the removal occurred after a bitter campaign against him by homosexual activists on Google ’s partner service , Orkut.com .
Colin Hart , Director of The Christian Institute , said , " Google promotes itself as a company committed to the ideals of free speech and the free exchange of ideas .
It is against this standard that Google ’s anti-religious policy is so unjust . "
" To describe abortion and religion - related content as ‘ unacceptable content ’ , while at the same time advertising pornography , is ridiculous . "

He examined the hidden so - called meta data in the downloaded submission which was posted as a PDF document and found this nugget : " Microsoft Word - 204481916_1_ACCC
Submission by Google re eBay Public _ 2_.DOC " .
Translated it means that the PDF was created from a Microsoft Word document with the filename " 204481916_1_ACCC
Submission by Google re eBay Public _ 2_.DOC " .
A few hours after Bromage 's discovery was posted on the AuctionBytes website yesterday , the PDF submission on the ACC site was taken down .
It returned later on Thursday afternoon , this time without the incriminating meta data .
The submission was made in response to a call last month by the ACCC for interested parties to comment on eBay 's application to grant it immunity from prosecution under the Trade Practices Act ahead of the PayPal changes .
The US - headquartered auction company argues that the public benefits of the move - including enhanced transaction security - would outweigh any detriment to the public caused by a reduction in competition in the online payments market .
PayPal - which is owned by eBay - allows online sellers to accept credit card payments and money transfers without having their own merchant credit card accounts .
Currently , merchants can also accept credit cards , direct debit , money orders and cheques , but from June 17 eBay wants to allow only PayPal or cash on delivery .
The ACCC 's response to eBay 's request is being closely watch around the world .
eBay is using Australia as the guinea pig and a green light by the Australian regulator would lead to the change being rolled out across eBay 's global network of auction sites .
The plan is also not popular with many eBay users because the auction company extracts a fee for use of the PayPal system , in addition to auction fees .
The Google submission was one of scores which have been posted by the ACCC onto its website as downloadable files in the portable document format ( PDF ) .
Most of the submissions are identified as having been made by named individuals and organisations .
Only a few - including the one shown to be bearing traces of Google 's DNA - are listed as either " [ name withheld ] " or " Anonymous " .
The ACCC is able to categorise submissions as anonymous if the submitter can argue that there are commercial - in - confidence reason not to reveal their identity .
An ACCC spokeswoman said the ACCC had received the document from the parties in a PDF form for posting on the public register in that format .
She said it was not the ACCC 's responsibility to check that all the identifiers had been stripped out because the parties insisted it was fine .
It stands to reason that Google would want its submission to remain anonymous .
e Bay pulled its ads from the Google Adwords network in June last year after Google staged a mock party in Boston during a big convention of eBay sellers .
That event was staged to protest the auction company 's refusal to allow traders to use Google 's Checkout payments system - which competes with PayPal .
Google subsequently backed down and the ads were restored .
Checkout is currently available to merchants in UK and US .
Google may have requested anonymity to avoid speculation about the launch of the service in Australia .
" We 're working hard to internationalise Google Checkout but have no timetable to announce in Australia at this stage , " said Google Australia spokesman Rob Shilkin .
The story started to unravel on Tuesday when Ina Steiner the editor the AuctionBytes website , a US - based site specialising in the online auction market , published a story about speculation surrounding the identity of the anonymous submission .
After she invited her readers to post their theories , she received a number responses .
But it was Australian reader David Bromage who finally nailed it .

One remark by a minor Israeli cabinet officer hinting at a possible US or Israeli attack on Iran has sent oil prices up by a record $ 11 / barrel to a record $ 139 per barrel Friday .
That should tell us what would happen if the Bush administration were crazy enough to attack Iran , or to let its vassal state of Israel do it .
Most analysts say an actual attack on Iran would send oil almost immediately to past $ 300 per barrel — a level that would strangle economies worldwide and send the world into an economic collapse not since the Smoot - Hawley Tariffs kicked off the Great Depression .
The repercussions of that would be staggering .
America , which runs on oil , would grind to a halt .
Gasoline and home heating oil would double or triple in price , leading to desperation in the coming winter for those living north of the Mason - Dixon line , and to a mass exodus of the elderly from Florida and Arizona , where air - conditioning would no longer be affordable .
In China , an economy almost wholly dependent upon the manufacture of goods for sale to American consumers , hundreds of millions of workers would suddenly find themselves unemployed .
With their remittances to their peasant relatives halted , half the country would be kicked back to the pre-capitalist era , only without guaranteed wages , homes , food and healthcare .
It is likely that unrest unprecedented since the Cultural Revolution would erupt .
The Middle East would explode .
In Iraq , Shia fighters would rise up in solidarity with their Shia neighbor , Iran , and begin attacking American forces in Iraq in earnest , probably making the Tet Offensive in 1968 Vietnam look like a picnic .
Where the US had half a million troops in Vietnam in that offensive , the military is already stretched to the breaking point in Iraq , with supply lines barely defended .
As I reported earlier on this site and in Counterpunch magazine and American Conservative magazine , there were a half dozen unexplained deaths of US airmen , including two suicides , which occurred just before and after that flight last August 30 , none of which were investigated at least publicly by the Pentagon or the FBI according to local prosecutors and medical examiners contacted .
A number of experts in nuclear weapons handling have said that it would be “ impossible ” for the six warheads to have been removed from guarded bunkers at Minot AFB in North Dakota , mounted on cruise missiles , loaded onto launch pylons under the wing of a B - 52 , and flown to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana , all as a “ mistake . ”
This leads inexorably to the question :
What was being planned for those warheads , if they were not being removed from storage by mistake , and if they were being moved without the knowledge of the top brass , including Gates , at the Pentagon ?
Recall that the only reason anyone learned about the incident was that it was reported outside the military chain of command to a reporter at Military Times newspaper by several Air Force whistle - blowers upset by what they were seeing .
We already witnessed the sudden resignation from the post of CentCom Command of Adm. William Fallon , whose outspoken opposition to the Bush / Cheney administration ’s talk of attacking Iran led to his being pushed aside in favor of the more pliant Gen. David Petraeus .
Fallon was pushed out by Iran war hawks because of his opposition to an attack .
Were the Air Force Secretary and Chief of Staff forced out by Gates because of their pro-attack position ?
Plenty to ponder here , but the concerns of oil speculators , who have driven up the price of oil by 8.6 percent ( and the stock market down by 3.2 percent ) in a single day , in large part on war rumors , should have us all concerned .
It ’s not just about the price of gasoline .

For Immediate Release
Party questions the GOP front man ’s enmity to the “ Great Writ ”
The Libertarian Party is questioning comments made by Sen. John McCain following the recent Supreme Court decision that granted the right of habeas corpus to detainees in Guantanamo Bay .
“ We ’d like to ask John McCain what ’s so wrong with habeas corpus , ” says Libertarian Party spokesperson Andrew Davis .
The presumptive GOP presidential nominee called the ruling “ one of the worst decisions in the history of this country . ”
“ The writ of habeas corpus is one of the key pillars of freedom in Western civilization , ” says Davis .
“ To have the leading figure of any political party come out so strongly against the basic idea that one should have protections against false imprisonment is both puzzling and frightening .
Perhaps Sen. McCain needs a refresher course in civil liberties and the foundations for justice in civilized societies .
Justice will prevail , Sen. McCain .
There is no need for shortcuts . ”
The Libertarian Party has frequently criticized the Bush administration and Congressional Republicans for what the Party sees as rampant abuse of civil liberties that frequently defy the Constitution .
The Libertarian Party calls for the repeal of legislation like the Patriot Act and the Military Commission Act , which increase the power of the federal government at the expense of civil liberties .
‘ The Court ’s habeas corpus decision was a victory for all Americans more than any particular litigant , since it affirmed the duty of the executive branch to obey the law , ’ says former Congressman Bob Barr , who is also the Libertarian Party ’s 2008 presidential nominee .
In fighting terrorism , ‘ we must not sacrifice those liberties which make America the unique nation that it is , ’ Barr adds .
Barr suggests that he and Sen. McCain approach such leading legal organizations as the ACLU and Federalist Society to jointly host a debate on the role of habeas corpus and other constitutional protections for civil liberties in the fight against terrorism .
‘ I ’m ready to meet Sen. McCain any time and any place , ’ says Barr .
The Libertarian Party is America ’s third largest political party , founded in 1971 as an alternative to the two main political parties .

If Clinton Wants VP , Obama Can't Stop Her
Does Hillary Clinton want to be the Democrats vice presidential candidate ?
Probably .
Could she get on the ticket by dropping out before the last states vote on June 3rd ?
Definitely not .
Does Barack Obama want her on the ticket ?
Absolutely not .
Can he stop her if she wants it ?
Probably not .
Why not ?
Super delegates are why not .
When the last pledged delegates are totaled on June 3rd , and assuming the current demographic support continues for both candidates ( and baring a major development they will ) , Barack Obama will have around 1690 delegates and Hillary Clinton around 1550 .
Add in their current super delegate support and Obama will have 1980 total delegates , and Clinton 1825 .
There are roughly 235 undecided or unnamed super delegates , most of whom will pick sides before or shortly after June 3rd .
Given the inevitability of his nomination Obama will get the lion share of these delegates .
An educated guess would be 185 for Obama , 50 for Clinton .
Final count ; Obama 2165 ; Clinton 1875 .
( Assume Michigan and Florida will be seated and be an even split so we can leave the magic number at the current 2026 ) .
It 's all over .
Obama will have about 54 % of the delegates and Clinton 46 % .
( I know there are a few delegates missing .
Some are Edwards , a few uncommitted , and a few refusing to decide - another wash ) .
Hillary Clinton will have come up short by 150 votes .
But this is n't horseshoes .
That said she still comes in a very close second , which puts her among the closest runner - ups in Democratic Party history .
So Barack Obama is free to pick a running mate ?
Not so fast .
Her losing margin of 150 is only 19 % of the super delegates at the convention .
Most of the 795 super delegates have been put under enormous pressure by both candidates for months .
For those that chose Obama the decision was an especially painful one both personally and politically .
Almost all super delegates have had a long history with the Clintons .
Many have only personally known Barack Obama a few months .
Many who sided with Obama have benefited professionally , financially , and politically from their relationship with the Clintons .
Many had jobs , and good ones , in the Clinton Administration .
Many have been the recipients of tens of thousands of dollars raised on their behalf by the Clintons .
Can you imagine how hard it was for most of these super delegates to turn down the former president of the United States ?
It was tough enough turning Hillary down , but their former boss , political godfather , and personal friend ?
I 've talked to many of them ; trust me it was for most the hardest thing they have ever had to do in their political lives .
Just consider for a moment the final phone call with Bill Clinton when the super delegate had to tell him he or she had decided to go with Obama .
Clinton , " It 's time to make a decision .
Hillary needs you and I need you .
We 've been through a lot together .
When you needed me I was there , now we need you " .
Super delegate , " Mr. President , this is the hardest thing I 've ever had to do , but I 'm going with Obama because ( whatever ) .
Ask me for anything else Mr. President , but I 've got to do this " .
Clinton , " I 'm very disappointed and personally hurt , but do what you think you have to do .
So long . "
Now imagine its June 4th and Clinton calls again .
Clinton , " I know Obama has enough votes to win , but I wanted you to know Hillary has decided to run for vice president at the convention .
You know there are two roll call votes at the convention : first president then for vice president .
I know you are voting for Obama for president .
Fine , but I want your commitment to vote for Hillary for vice president . "
You imagine being on the floor in Denver .
Hillary 's delegates , NEARLY HALF THE DELEGATES , are demanding she be on the ticket .
These are true believers who have stuck with Clinton through thick and thin .
To them , putting Hillary on the ticket is a crusade .
Most Clinton delegates are women , most Democratic voters are women , and they 're going to just accept some middle aged white governor that Obama is rumored to want ?
No way .
They are in your face .
Hillary supporters from back home are jamming your Blackberry .
This and more horror scenes flash through your mind in a nano second .
Then it occurs to you ; if the roles were reversed and Obama came close to winning and wanted to be the vice presidential candidate , could you imagine the convention saying no ?
Clinton , " If we get your commitment now ( we 've already got a bunch of Obama super delegates to support her ) we do n't have to take a vote or fight in Denver .
With Hillary 's pledged delegates and a hundred or so super delegates we 'll be over 2026 before the end of June .
Saves Barack the hassle of picking a running mate and we can be united against McCain on day one . "
Are you going to tell the former president of the United States no again ?
Anyway you convince yourself it's a great ticket and will help Obama in those big swing states .
" I 'm with you Mr. President " .
Clinton , " I knew I could count on you " .
You want to bet there are n't 20 % of the super delegates who would buy this deal ?
We 're talking super delegates here , not profiles in courage .
If Hillary Clinton wants the vice presidential nomination , and her loyal delegates demand it , and the Clinton machine puts its full weight behind it , she will be on the ticket .
Count on it .
Bob Beckel managed Walter Mondale ’s 1984 presidential campaign .
He is a senior political analyst for the Fox News Channel and a columnist for USA Today .
Beckel is the co-author with Cal Thomas of the book " Common Ground . "
This guy must really believe in his product to let someone shoot him from a few feet away .
He then shoots himself with a 44 magnum at point blank to demonstrate ... how stupid he is .
" Mitch , I 'd like you to shoot me again , to prove the point of the bullet ... "
AFTER he became notorious as the man who urged God to damn America , Jeremiah Wright claims he wrestled with two impulses .
The first was to heed the proverb : “ It is better to be quiet and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt . ”
The second was to “ come across the room ” and fight back .
Mr Wright 's decision to come across the room with his mouth wide open is proving a disaster for all concerned .
Mr Wright , who was Barack Obama 's pastor for 20 years , has reason to be angry about the way he has been caricatured .
The video clips that made him famous represent mere seconds of the thousands of hours he has spent preaching ( 207,792 minutes on Sunday mornings alone , according to his church , the Trinity United Church of Christ ) .
Mr Wright volunteered to serve in Vietnam and spent six years in the armed forces .
That , as he pointed out , is six years longer than Dick Cheney .
Mr Wright 's appearance at the National Press Club on April 28th before a massed throng of reporters provided him with the perfect opportunity to set those seconds in context .
But he chose to do exactly the opposite .
He surrounded himself with some of the most divisive figures in black America : Marion Barry , Washington 's disgraced former mayor , Malik Zulu Shabazz of the New Black Panther Party , Cornel West of Princeton University and a posse of security guards supplied by the Nation of Islam .
And he hurled a succession of rhetorical bombs .
He defended his remark about “ chickens coming home to roost ” .
He called Louis Farrakhan “ one of the most important voices in the 20th and 21st century ” .
He talked about whites worshipping in church in the morning and putting on white Klan sheets at night .
He defended his assertion that the American government invented the HIV virus to decimate blacks ( “ Our government is capable of doing anything . ” ) .
He even argued that blacks and whites have different learning styles , further proof that he endorses the racist theory that blacks and white have differently wired brains .
This is both a personal and a political tragedy for Mr Obama .
Mr Wright was clearly a father - figure to a fatherless man who was confused about his identity .
He introduced him to Christianity , and later conducted his wedding and baptised his children .
In his speech on race relations in Philadelphia Mr Obama resisted incredible pressure to throw Mr Wright under a bus .
Mr Wright responded by throwing Mr Obama under the bus instead .
He dismissed Mr Obama 's attempt to distance himself from his former pastor as a politician doing what he had to do .
He announced that , if Mr Obama becomes president , he will be “ coming after him ” because he will represent a government “ whose policies grind under people ” .
Mr Obama was said to be “ deeply , visibly angry ” when he was shown transcripts of these remarks .
He responded with a press conference , in which his tone was alternately hard - hitting and elegiac , to make it clear that “ whatever relationship I had with Rev Wright has changed ” .
Whether that will reassure nervous white voters , time will tell .
This was also a tragedy for Mr Wright .
He is far more than the blustering buffoon who was on the stage on Monday .
He has presided over an increase in the size of his congregation from 87 when he arrived in 1972 to 8,000 today .
Trinity is a welfare state in its own right , providing more than 70 welfare programmes for the poor , the unemployed , prisoners and HIV patients .
He is one of the most liberal members of the black church , happy to question Scripture when he thinks that it forsakes common sense and unusually tolerant of gay couples , who can be seen holding hands in his pews .
No less a figure than Martin Marty , who is probably America 's most distinguished historian of religion and who happens to be white , has defended Mr Wright and said how welcome he and his family feel in his congregation .
But Mr Wright could well be remembered as a race - baiter who helped to prevent one of his parishioners from becoming the first black president of the United States .
And finally this is a tragedy for race relations in general .
Mr Wright had a chance to explain how blacks can feel ambivalent about America — how they can volunteer to fight in a war , as he did , but also feel furious about slavery and segregation .
But he furnished the anger without the explanation .
No quiet exit
He also had a chance to explain how blacks are über - Americans when it comes to religion .
They are the most religious people in the country , and black churches are among America 's greatest self - help organisations : they provided slaves with a social framework when they were denied even the right to form families , and they continue to provide support and welfare services .
There were hopes that Mr Wright might have done this ; he was in Washington for a conference on the black church .
But he ended up doing the opposite , arguing that any criticism of him was a criticism of the black church in general .
What inspired this calamitous performance ?
Egomania was clearly part of it .
Mr Wright responded to the applause of the amen corner in his audience with ever more outrageous assertions .
There was probably a touch of jealousy too .
Mr Wright has seen his former protégé rise to heights he himself could never have dreamed of , and he has been caught up in the tailwinds .
But there is also something deeper here : a generational struggle for control of black politics .
Mr Wright belongs to a generation of activists — Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton are other prominent members — who thrived in part by playing to the resentments of their black supporters .
Mr Obama belongs to a much more pragmatic generation , people who want to get beyond racial polarisation and enter the political mainstream .
Mr Wright 's generation is not about to leave the stage quietly .
So much the worse for America .
Hillary Clinton squeaked by with 23,000 votes in Indiana .
The Democratic presidential candidate ran out of money .
Supposedly she has canceled public appearances the next few days .
Matt Drudge and Tim Russert say it 's over .
Who is still standing behind Clinton , chanting " Yes she can ? "
Crazy dead - ender cult people like the ones in the picture above , with goddamned stickers on their foreheads .
After the jump , Gawker videographer Richard Blakeley ( who spotted the stickers ) imagines the conversation that led to this awful visual :
Then , as soon as the cameras went on , BOOM — onto the forehead .
THE END IS NEAR .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A report from the U.S. State Department details " an upsurge " across the world of anti-Semitism -- hostility and discrimination toward Jewish people .
" Today , more than 60 years after the Holocaust , anti-Semitism is not just a fact of history , it is a current event , " the report says .
The report -- called Contemporary Global Anti-Semitism and given to Congress on Thursday -- is dedicated to the memory of the late U.S. Rep .
Tom Lantos , a survivor of the Holocaust , the extermination of 6 million Jews during World War II .
The report details physical acts of anti-Semitism , such as attacks , property damage , and cemetery desecration .
It also lists manifestations such as conspiracy theories concerning Jews , Holocaust denial , anti-Zionism and the demonization of Israel .
" Over much of the past decade , U.S. embassies worldwide have noted an increase in anti-Semitic incidents , such as attacks on Jewish people , property , community institutions , and religious facilities , " the report says .
The report also deals with efforts to combat the bigotry , described by Gregg J. Rickman , the department 's special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism , as " one of the oldest forms of malicious intolerance . "
The report says violent acts and desecration of Jewish property happen whether there are a lot of Jews or only a few living in the region .
Bigoted rhetoric , conspiracy theories regarding Jews , and anti-Semitic propaganda are transmitted over the airwaves and on the Internet .

Swastika daubed on Holocaust memorial Holocaust survivor Lantos dies at 80
It says that although Nazism and fascism are rejected by the West " and beyond , " blatant forms of anti-Semitism are " embraced and employed by the extreme fringe . "
" Traditional forms of anti-Semitism persist and can be found across the globe .
Classic anti-Semitic screeds , such as ' The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion ' and ' Mein Kampf ' remain commonplace .
" Jews continue to be accused of blood libel , dual loyalty , and undue influence on government policy and the media , and the symbols and images associated with age - old forms of anti-Semitism endure . "
New forms of anti-Semitism are reflected in rhetoric that compares Israel to the Nazis and attributes " Israel 's perceived faults to its Jewish character . "
This kind of anti-Semitism , the report says , " is common throughout the Middle East and in Muslim communities in Europe , but it is not confined to these populations . "
The report says various U.N. bodies are regularly asked to launch " investigations of what often are sensationalized reports of alleged atrocities and other violations of human rights by Israel . "
" The collective effect of unremitting criticism of Israel , coupled with a failure to pay attention to regimes that are demonstrably guilty of grave violations , has the effect of reinforcing the notion that the Jewish state is one of the sources , if not the greatest source , of abuse of the rights of others , and thus intentionally or not encourages anti-Semitism . "
The report gives examples of leaders and governments that " fan the flames of anti-Semitic hatred within their own societies and even beyond their borders . "
It cites Syria , Belarus , Venezuela , Egypt , and Saudi Arabia .
" Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has actively promoted Holocaust denial , Iran 's Jewish population faces official discrimination , and the official media outlets regularly produce anti-Semitic propaganda , " the report adds .
It notes " societal anti-Semitism " in places where there have been efforts to fight the problem .
Among the countries are Poland , Ukraine , Russia , France , Germany and the United Kingdom .
" Recent increases in anti-Semitic incidents have been documented in Argentina , Australia , Canada , South Africa , and beyond , " the report said .
The report is a follow - up to the State Department 's January 2005 " Report on Global anti-Semitism . "

The spam and malware tsunami continues to cast a mounting shadow over the Internet .
An announcement from F - Secure warned that malware is growing faster than ever before , while Marshal 's TRACE team claims that the volume of malicious spam in circulation has more than tripled in one week .
Marshal fingered the Srizbi botnet as the chief culprit , currently responsible for 46 percent of all spam sent , helping malicious spam figures jump from 3 to almost 10 percent of all spam traffic so far in June .
The TRACE team lead threat analyst , Phil Hay , said that Srizbi 's criminal controllers are currently on a major expansion drive .
Srizbi is duping recipients by including the first part of their e-mail address in the subject line with the suggestion that they look " stupid " in a video , luring them to a Web site to view the video where they are exposed to malware .
Marshal said Srizbi is also targeting social networking sites like Classmate.com , luring victims to dodgy sites with the promise of messages from long lost school friends .
A Flash video player link is presented to the victim , which downloads an executable file that infects their computer .
" This kind of social engineering tactic is nothing new , " said Hay .
" What is significant is the rapid increase in the volume .
It once again demonstrates the incredible power and dominance that the major spamming botnets have over email traffic .
Very few legitimate businesses could triple their e-mail capacity at the push of a button .
But this is the advantage that the illegal control of thousands of computers gives the spammers .
" We see Srizbi as one of the biggest threats to Internet users today .
Users should be wary of emails that make personal offers such as online friend connections or include inflammatory personalized subjects such as ' you look stupid in this video ' , particularly if they do n't recognize the sender , " he said .
According to F - Secure 's security summary for the first half of 2008 , the unprecedented growth in malware is due to the packing , encryption , and obfuscation of existing families of trojans , backdoors , exploits and other threats now being done with " industrial efficiency " .
The number of malware detections has grown by almost half a million since the end of the year , jumping from 500,000 total detections to 900,000 .
" I have a nasty feeling that the situation is getting worse , not better " , says Mikko Hypponen , chief research officer for the security vendor .
F - Secure cited targeted malware attacks such as the classmates.com con that Marshal reported as key growth areas for dodgy software peddlers over the past six months .
Targeted malware attacks typically involve the attacker profiling their victim and sending an e-mail using the recipients name , title , job function and a subject field related to the victim 's position in order to trick them into opening something they would normally expect to receive via e-mail .
Targeted malware attacks against political or military organizations also increased , such as an e-mail attack against human rights and pro freedom of Tibet groups that aimed to install malware on their PCs that would allow their political opposition to spy on their actions .
F - Secure 's half - yearly security summary also looked at emerging mobile phone threats such as Jailbreaking , growth in SQL injection attacks , and the risks emerging around third party applications like Adobe Flash .

On the night of Feb. 20 , the full moon will pass intoEarth 's shadow in an event that will be visible across all of the United States and Canada .
The total lunareclipse will be made even more striking by the presence of the nearbyplanet Saturn and the bright bluish star , Regulus .
Eclipses in the distant past often terrified viewers whotook them as evil omens .
Certain lunar eclipses had anoverwhelming effect on historic events .
One of the most famous examples is thetrick pulled by ChristopherColumbus .
Shipwrecked
On Oct. 12 , 1492 , as every schoolchild has been taught , Columbus came ashore on an island northeast of Cuba .
He later named it San Salvador ( HolySavior ) .
Over the next ten years Columbus would make three more voyages to the " New World , " which only bolstered his belief that he reached the Far East by sailing West .
It was on his fourth and final voyage , while exploring thecoast of Central America that Columbus found himself in dire straits .
He left C?diz , Spain on May 11 , 1502 , with the ships Capitana , Gallega , Vizca?na and Santiago de Palos .
Unfortunately , thanks to an epidemic ofshipworms eating holes in the planking of his fleet , Columbus ' was forced toabandon two of his ships and finally had to beach his last two caravels on thenorth coast of Jamaica on June 25 , 1503 .
Initially , the Jamaican natives welcomed the castaways , providing them with food and shelter , but as the days dragged into weeks , tensions mounted .
Finally , after being stranded for more than six months , halfof Columbus ' crew mutinied , robbing and murdering some of the natives , who , themselves grew weary of supplying cassava , corn and fish in exchange forlittle tin whistles , trinkets , hawk 's bells and other rubbishy goods .
With famine now threatening , Columbus formulated adesperate , albeit ingenious plan .
Almanac to the rescue
Coming to the Admiral 's rescue was JohannesM?ller von K?nigsberg ( 1436-1476 ) , known by his Latin pseudonym Regiomontanus .
He was an important German mathematician , astronomer and astrologer .
Before his death , Regiomontanus published analmanac containing astronomical tables covering the years 1475 - 1506 .
Regiomontanus ' almanac turned out to be of great value , for his astronomical tables provided detailed information about the sun , moon and planets , as well as the more important stars and constellations bywhich to navigate .
After it was published , no sailor dared set out without acopy .
With its help , explorers were able to leave their customary routes andventure out into the unknown seas in search of new frontiers .
Columbus , of course , had a copy of the Almanac with him when he was stranded on Jamaica .
And he soon discovered fromstudying its tables that on the evening of Thursday , Feb. 29 , 1504 , a totaleclipse of the moon would take place soon after the time of moonrise .
Armed with this knowledge , three days before the eclipse , Columbus asked for a meeting with the natives Cacique ( " chief " ) and announced tohim that his Christian god was angry with his people for no longer supplyingColumbus and his men with food .
Therefore , he was about to provide a clear signof his displeasure :
Three nights hence , he would all but obliterate the risingfull moon , making it appear " inflamed withwrath , " which would signify the evils that would soon be inflictedupon all of them .
Bad moon rising
On the appointed evening , as the Sun set in the West and themoon started emerging from beyond the eastern horizon , it was plainly obviousto all that something was terribly wrong .
By the time the moon appeared in fullview , its lower edge was missing !
And , just over an hour later , as full darkness descended , the moon indeed exhibited an eerily inflamed and " bloody " appearance :
In place of the normally brilliant late winter full moon therenow hung a dim red ball in the eastern sky .
According to Columbus ' son , Ferdinand , the natives were terrified at this sight and " . . . with great howling andlamentation came running from every direction to the ships laden withprovisions , praying to the Admiral to intercede with his god on theirbehalf . "
They promised that they would gladly cooperate with Columbus andhis men if only he would restore the moon back to its normal self .
The greatexplorer told the natives that he would have to retire to confer privately withhis god .
He then shut himself in his cabin for about fifty minutes .
" His god " was a sandglass that Columbus turned every half hour to time the various stages of the eclipse , based on thecalculations provided by Regiomontanus ' almanac .
Just moments before the end of the total phase Columbus reappeared , announcing to the natives that his god had pardoned them and wouldnow allow the moon to gradually return .
And at that moment , true to Columbus ' word , the moon slowly began to reappear and as it emerged from the Earth 'sshadow , the grateful natives hurried away .
They then kept Columbus and his menwell supplied and well fed until a relief caravel from Hispaniola finallyarrived on June 29 , 1504 .
Columbus and his men returned to Spain on Nov. 7 .
Another side to the story
In an interesting postscript to this story , in 1889 , Mark Twain , likely influenced by theeclipse trick , wrote the novel , A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court .
In it , his main character , Hank Morgan , used a gambit similar to Columbus ' .
Morgan is about to be burned at the stake , so he " predicts " a solar eclipse he knows will occur , and in the process , claimed power over the sun .
He gladly offers to return the sun to the sky inreturn for his freedom and a position as " perpetual minister andexecutive " to the king .
The only problem with this story is that on the date that Mark Twain quoted — June 21 , 528 A.D. — no such eclipse took place .
In fact , the moon was three days past full , a setup that can't generate aneclipse .
Perhaps he should have consulted an almanac !

The process of making silicon chips is as complex as the chips themselves .
Each manufacturing plant , or " fab " , may cost billions of dollars and is a triumph of engineering .
But working inside these hi-tech plants can be a surreal experience , says Dr Peter Wilson of the University of Southampton .
" Fab world " is like no other place on earth .
Its pristine white walls , secure air locks , sterile air and ethereal yellow lighting makes it seem like you have arrived in the belly of an orbiting space station .
I can still remember the first time I went there .
It was set in classic " tumbleweed " territory - a small town in Arizona with just one road and the factory .
The temperature was over 100 degrees outside , with dust everywhere , but when you crossed the threshold into the plant , the air - conditioning kicked in and you felt like you were in a different world .
This is a common experience to anyone who works in the silicon manufacturing sector .
The world outside and the fab world inside are on two different planes .
The boundary can transcend geographic and political boundaries - it can become impossible to tell which country you are in , when everyone is wearing a mask , and is dressed head to foot in shapeless , white hooded - suits .
' Bunny men '
Outside , we worry about dirt on our shoes and wipe our feet , or perhaps wipe some dust off our laptop screen .
In fab world , we worry about a few atoms contaminating the environment .
If dust falls on the delicate silicon wafers on which chips are printed it can render them useless .
HOW A MICROCHIP IS MADE Microchips are built from wafers that consist of 99.9 % pure silicon .
The silicon is made from common beach sand .
The chips are made in incredibly clean environments - the air is more than 1000 times purer than that of a hospital .
The silicon wafers are produced by a specialist company and sent to the chip manufacturer for processing .
The Silicon wafer consists of 4 layers .
A mask that is created during the design phase defines the cicuit pattern .
A mask is placed over the wafer , under a UV light .
Patterns are repeatedly projected on the wafer , light can only reach the wafer through the openings .
The UV light reacts with the photoresist to create the circuit patterns .
Impurities are then implanted into areas of the wafer to alter the electrical properties of specific regions .
This is called doping .
Electrical contacts are formed by masking and etching the wafer to provide links between the different layers .
Multiple layers of metal are applied to form the electrical connections between the chips 's layers .
The final chip is housed in a protective case that contains wires to connect it to the computer 's circuit boards .
BACK NEXT 1 of 11 Modern transistors - the tiny switches at the heart of these devices - are described in terms of the smallest feature sizes that can be made , such as a 45 nanometres , or 45 billionths of a meter .
To put this in perspective , the average human hair will be between 20 and 100 micrometers across - over a thousand times larger - and a typical dust particle will be anything from 1 to 100 micrometres .
Dust and contaminants must be kept out .
The fab is a place for chips , not for people .
As a result , only the pure and the clean are given permission to penetrate its ' inner chambers .
Anyone that enters must go through a strict set of procedures .
All of the trappings of the outside world must be left behind , whether clothes , jewellery or even make - up .
A series of ante-chambers serve as prep rooms where workers change into a series of gowns and gloves , collectively known as a " bunny suit " .
Sticky floors make sure that no one treads in any contaminants and an air shower before entry makes certain that any loose particles are stripped away .
Skin flakes , lint , hair and anything else gets sucked into the grate in the floor .
Pure products
And then it 's onwards into the hum of the clean rooms .
Stark white walls reflect the yellow sodium lights from above and a constant breeze blows down from the ceiling taking any particles through the gridded floor .
Fab world is an expensive place and , hence , it never stops
Peter Wilson
Sand to silicon chip
In modern fabs , ultra high tech chips are manufactured in what are known as class 1 rooms that contain just one tiny particle per metre cubed .
In contrast , a room where open heart surgery takes place may have as many as 20,000 .
Everything taken in either needs to be cleaned with alcohol or specially designed .
Even the paper we use to take notes is designed from a special lint - free material .
Inside , humans very rarely come into contact with the rainbow - streaked discs of reflective silicon on which the chips are cut .
Instead , they are there to trouble shoot and monitor that everything goes correctly .
The silicon wafers are handled on monorails that move above the fab floor and the processing is done by complex vacuum sealed robots .
The wafers enter one end of the line costing a couple of hundred dollars and appear at the other - weeks later - patterned with billions of transistors and worth tens of thousands of pounds .
The silicon itself is not made at the fab - the ultra pure ingots ( up to 99.99999999 % pure ) are produced and cut by specialist companies and sold to the chip makers .
The fab world 's magic is creating the incredibly complex patterns of wires and circuitry on chips the size of a postage stamp time and time again
That alchemy can cost billions of dollars .
Non-Stop
Each layer of a processor is constructed using a mask which is like a stencil , to highlight the areas to be deposited , etched or doped .
Each plant can cost billions of dollars
Nano chip designer Doping involves adding impurities to the silicon to change its electrical characteristics - something which has to be done with astonishing precision .
Each mask used to cost several thousand pounds but as the complexity of chips has increased , and the smallest possible feature size has reduced , the number and intricacy of these masks has increased .
In addition , the size of individual features is now smaller than the wavelength of light that used to be used to pattern them , which means the use of some clever optics is required .
The yellowish lights used inside the fab are to make sure that they do not interfere with this process .
The result of all of this is that an individual silicon integrated circuit may require masks that cost hundreds of thousands of pounds , or perhaps even millions of pounds , to produce and machines that cost a similar amount .
Fab world is an expensive place and , hence , it never stops .
The plants churn out chips every single day of every year .
So called giga - fabs may process more than 100,000 wafers every month , each containing hundreds of chips .
Each one of the 10 mm by 10 mm silicon squares is a triumph of design .
As a chip designer , the impact of the incredible complexity of fab world has led to an amazing transformation in what we can do on a single chip .
The products of this strange and surreal place have burst out of its confines and have pervaded every facet of the outside world from computers and mobile phones to aircraft and microwave ovens .
Yet , incredible as it is to visit , fab world is also a place that is blissful to leave .
At the end of the day there 's no better feeling than being able to rip off the itchy bunny suit , step outside into the searing heat and once again get dirty .

The village is located on the semi-tropical island of Jeju-do .
Near the village , Halla Mountain , a volcano and the tallest mountain in South Korea , rises from the island ’s center amidst a patchwork of small farms .
The village ’s forty houses and the school all have large solar panels covering their roofs .
A typical roof will have a two kilowatt solar installation .
In 2004 , the government subsidized the solar systems in Donggwang , paying 70 % of the installation fees .
Jeju - du island also has a large wind farm .
Last year , the local government announced its plan to raise the island ’s wind power generation capacity to 500 megawatts ( MW ) by 2020 , in order to replace 20 percent of conventionally generated electricity .
It also had said it will replace 26 percent of existing fuel used in transportation to environmentally friendly fuel .

SOUTH CHICAGO HEIGHTS , Ill .
( AP )  Bill Bramanti's favorite beer is Pabst Blue Ribbon .
He loves it .
Really loves it .
So much so that he 's already had his coffin specially made , and it 's designed to look like a can of the trendy brew .
Bramanti is n't sick , so he does n't plan on needing it just yet .
For now he plans to use it as a cooler .
At 5 - feet - 9 inches tall and weighing 280 pounds , Bramanti has tried it out though .
" I actually fit , because I got in here , " Bramanti , 67 , of South Chicago Heights said .
He threw a party Saturday for friends , featuring his coffin filled with ice and , what else , Pabst Blue Ribbon .
" Why put such a great novelty piece up on a shelf in storage when you could use it only the way Bill Bramanti would use it ? "
Bramanti's daughter , Cathy Bramanti , 42 , said .
Bramanti ordered the casket from Panozzo Bros. Funeral Home in Chicago Heights and Scott Sign Co. of Chicago Heights designed the beer can .
The silver coffin is designed with red , white and blue , just like a Pabst can .

" Of course , humans do n't need to eat meat at all — vegetarians are less likely to get heart disease , diabetes , or various types of cancer or become obese than meat - eaters are — and a terrific array of vegetarian mock meats already exist .
But as many people continue to refuse to kick their meat addictions , PETA is willing to help them gain access to flesh that does n't cause suffering and death .... "
" Why is PETA supporting this new technology ?
More than 40 billion chickens , fish , pigs , and cows are killed every year for food in the United States in horrific ways .
Chickens are drugged to grow so large they often become crippled , mother pigs are confined to metal cages so small they can't move , and fish are hacked apart while still conscious — all to feed America 's meat addiction .
In vitro meat would spare animals from this suffering .
In addition , in vitro meat would dramatically reduce the devastating effects the meat industry has on the environment .
While PETA 's aim here seems to be to be to publicise their opposition to the consumption of animals ( as shown in the quote below ) , there is another angle to this story which is perhaps more interesting for those interested in energy issues - which comes back to " the oil we eat . "
The Oil We Eat
The link between oil and gas production and agriculture is one that should be well understood by now - and has been covered by a diverse range of writers including Dale Allen Pfeiffer ( Eating Fossil Fuels ) , Richard Manning ( The Oil We Eat ) , Stuart Staniford ( Food To 2050 ) , Sharyn Astyk ( Is Relocalization Doomed ? ) as well as my review of Herman Kahn 's book " The Next 200 Years " ( The Fat Man , The Population Bomb And The Green Revolution ) .
While I do n't want to restart the debate about " reversalists " , I think its worth looking at where a large amount of the grain we produce goes - meat production .
Feeding grain to livestock
Corn , wheat and rice prices have all soared in recent years - this has been attributed to a number of factors , including :
- rising input prices for fertiliser , pesticides and diesel fuel
- the use of grain to produce biofuels
- adverse weather events like the Australian drought significantly reducing production
- commodity funds and other speculators on the markets
- " hoarding " and export restrictions being put in place ( particularly for rice )
- productive land being built over by expanding cities
- increasing demand for grain courtesy of an increasing population
- increasingly affluent consumers in Asia increasing their meat consumption
While there is a lot of debate about which factors are the dominant ones in the price rises that have occurred so far , it seems clear that reducing demand would go some way to keeping prices down , and that finding alternative sources of protein would be one way of achieving this .
The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN publishes a World Food Outlook in May and November each year .
The November 2007 edition shows that about a third of the grain produced ( 750 Mt ) is used as animal feed - compared to around 350 Mt that was used for biofuels ( hat tip to Kiashu for providing the data ) .

Mt of oilseeds ( out of 404 Mt total ) is turned into " oil meals and cakes " , which is primarily eaten by livestock .
It is worth noting that not all of the animals fed end up on our dinner plates ( or in hamburger wrappers ) - dairy cattle are also included here and their milk production is another output from the use of these agricultural commodities .
Artifical Meat and science fiction
Artificial meat is a topic usually left to science fiction writers ( see Kornbluth & Pohl , H Beam Piper , Samuel R Delany , Frank Herbert , Rudy Rucker or John Brunner for some examples ) , with a " meat beast " ( or some other form of artificial protein produced in a vat ) gracing the bowels of many spaceship kitchens and basements of remote arcologies , where raising livestock is n't an option .
Soylent Green is probably the example that comes most readily to mind , but this is n't really appropriate , as that meat was n't artificially grown of course .
Where 's the beef ?
Is anyone seriously trying to make this stuff ?
Science fiction is n't usually meant to be predictive , so its surprising to see this sort of idea being ( somewhat ) seriously considered here on Earth in the present .
While PETA may or may not just be performing a publicity stunt , there does appear to be some research underway in this area , which is known as " In vitro meat " .
There are basically two approaches for producing in vitro meat ; loose muscle cells and structured muscle , with the creation of structured muscle being far more challenging than the former .
According to Wikipedia :
Muscles consist of muscle fibers , long cells with multiple nuclei .
They do n't proliferate by themselves , but arise when precursor cells fuse .
Precursor cells can be embryonic stem cells or satellite cells , specialized stem cells in muscle tissue .
Theoretically , they can be relatively simple to culture in a bioreactor and then later made to fuse .
For the growth of real muscle however , the cells should grow " on the spot " , which requires a perfusion system akin to a blood supply to deliver nutrients and oxygen close to the growing cells , as well as remove the waste products .
In addition other cell types need to be grown like adipocytes , and chemical messengers should provide clues to the growing tissue about the structure .
Lastly , muscle tissue needs to be trained to properly develop .
A number of teams are actively pursuing the cultivation of in vitro meat .
In 2001 , dermatologist Wiete Westerhof from the University of Amsterdam and businessmen Willem van Eelen and Willem van Kooten announced that they had filed for a worldwide patent on a process to produce in vitro meat .
A matrix of collagen is seeded with muscle cells , which are then bathed in a nutritious solution and induced to divide .
They have now set up the InVitroMeat Foundation to promote the idea .
Jon Vein of the United States has secured a patent for the production of tissue engineered meat for human consumption , where muscle and fat cells would be grown in an integrated fashion to create food products such as beef , poultry and fish .
A group at the University of Maryland has participated in some experiments for NASA looking to grow meat during space flight , and is also looking to develop processes for terrestrial application .
This group of researchers started the non-profit organization New Harvest , with the goal of promoting development of in - vitro meat .
They claim cultured meat in a processed form , like sausage , hamburger , or chicken nuggets may become commercially available within several years .
In April 2005 , a research project into cultured meat started in The Netherlands .
It is carried out under the lead of Henk Haagsman at the University of Amsterdam , the Eindhoven University of Technology and Utrecht University , in cooperation with sausage manufacturer Stegeman .
The Dutch government granted a two million euro subsidy for the project .
In Amsterdam the culture medium is studied , while the University of Utrecht studies the proliferation of muscle cells and the Eindhoven university will research bioreactors .
A tissue engineer at the Medical University of South Carolina has proposed a countertop device similar to a bread maker that would produce meat overnight in your kitchen .
In recent weeks we have even had the world 's first international conference on manufacturing meat .
Advocates for in vitro meat claim it is safer , healthier , more humane and less polluting to produce - as well as being one way of adapting to rising demand for food and constraints on the supply of inputs to traditional industrial agriculture .
But one question remains , should a commercial meat production process ever be put into action - can we get past the " yuck " factor ?

If you ’ve read any of my submissions about hemp , you know I ’m a staunch supporter of legalizing industrial hemp in this country .
It has many uses , but I ’d never thought of decorative until seeing the story about the “ Pastie Lady ” .
You want to publicize hemp and other natural resources , take a cue from 32 year old Jennifer Moss of Ojai , California .
That ’s her on the left , decked out in a g - string , skirt and pasties , all made of hemp .
Now , who could turn down a better reason for letting our farmers grow hemp , and establishing an infrastructure to produce such interesting clothing items ?
Jennifer is a native of a small town near Corvallis , Oregon , but sought out a more eclectic , forward thinking place to live , like Southern California .
She finally chose Ojai , and has been causing a stir ever since .
She ’s been arrested twice and ticketed several times while bicycling down Ojai ’s main street with a small trailer containing earth - friendly signs and a smiley - face pillow .
She used that to do a head stand and kick her legs in the air one day .
She received a lot of attention .
Jennifer also celebrated Easter Sunday by showing up at a Catholic church while parishoners were leaving the sanctuary .
She admits it was poor judgement , but felt it necessary to send a message that there are many bad people who are destroying the Earth , and yet many of them go to church .
It ’s said that before moving to Ojai , she entertained parade goers in Ventura , California during the Fourth of July parade in 2007 .
By - standers were shocked to see Jennifer zipping past on in - line skates , wearing only suntan oil .
She ’s quoted in the article as saying :
“ Nudity is natural , but a lot of people are uncomfortable with it , ” she said .
“ It ’s OK for children to play video games where they are killing each other , and it ’s patriotic to murder people in a war .
But women ’s breasts in public ?
You better watch out ! ”
Pasties , in case you do n’t know , are used to cover the nipples on a woman ’s breasts .
Somehow , you can show naked large or small breasts , but the nipples must be covered .
What ’s wrong with nipples ?
After all , nearly all of us have dined there in our earliest days .
Well , I for one hope Jennifer , known in town as the Pastie Lady , remains safe as she parades her causes in Ojai , and think I ’ll start a petition drive to legalize industrial hemp .
Hey , it ’s gotta start somewhere .

Microsoft Corporation will focus on growing its own advertising and Internet search business after it withdrew its takeover offer for Yahoo , chairman Bill Gates said yesterday .
Microsoft has not presented an alternative strategy to compete with its dominant rival in the Internet business , Google , since withdrawing a $ 47.5 billion bid for Yahoo last weekend .
Analysts have been left wondering how the world ’s largest software maker will increase its share of that multibillion dollar market without a major tie -up .
“ We have always felt we could do very well on our own and now that ’s the path we are focused on , ” Gates said .
“ The standard strategy for us is to just hire great engineers and surprise people at how well we can compete , even with a company that ’s got a strong lead , ” he said .
Gates says Microsoft remained open to making acquisitions , but declined to comment on possible candidates , such as networking sites like Facebook in which Microsoft already holds a 1.6 per cent stake .
“ You never know if there ’s going to be a deal that makes sense , ” he said .

Microsoft has developed its own search - ad platform and bought aQuantive , an Internet advertising company , for $ 6bn , but its US online operations are making loss .
It has captured just 10 pc of US Internet searches , compared to Google ’s 58 pc and Yahoo ’s 22 pc .
“ We are in software very broadly , but that advertising piece , we think , is a very exciting area , ” he said .
Gates also said that Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated $ 3 million for emergency relief efforts in Myanmar and will provide software to help reunite family members separated in the cyclone .
Gates was in Indonesia to meet government leaders , including President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , at The Government Leaders Forum .
After heading Microsoft for more than three decades , Gates will resign his chairmanship in July .
The founder and chief executive of Linden Lab on Tuesday testified before House legislators that his virtual world of Second Life does not serve as a playground for terrorist activity .
The founder and chief executive of Linden Lab on Tuesday testified before House legislators that his virtual world of Second Life does not serve as a playground for terrorist activity .
" Though there has certainly been discussion [ about terrorism in virtual worlds ] , we have never seen any evidence that there is any such activity going on in Second Life , " Philip Rosedale , founder and CEO of Linden Lab , told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on telecom and the Internet .
Given that virtual worlds like Second Life have the ability to track their members ' activity quite closely , Rosedale suggested that virtual activity was " somewhat more police - able " than activities in the real world , which might make virtual worlds a less attractive prospect for terrorists .
Rosedale 's comments come after a February report from the director of national intelligence called for an examination of emerging social , behavioral , and cultural norms in virtual worlds and gaming environments to see if terrorism - related patterns might emerge .
Rep. Jane Harman , a California Democrat , called for a clear understanding of how virtual world activity might help the U.S. fight new trends in terrorism .
She stressed that she was not advocating censorship .
" I want to make sure these glorious tools are not abused or changed into tools that facilitate the use of terrorist attacks , " she said .
To prevent money laundering or financial crimes , Second Life polices the financial activity of its members , and scrutinizes any withdrawals over $ 10 , Rosedale said .
" We believe that the degree of scrutiny that is created by [ policing methods ] is quite rich and the pattern recognition of non-standard behavior is easy enough to spot , " according to Rosedale .
The average withdrawal from Second Life -- from Linden dollars into U.S. dollars  is one dollar , so it 's " relatively easy to spot larger transactions , " Rosedale said .
" We have managed to maintain a fraud rate that is a fraction of a percentage point .
The industry average is closer to 1 percent . "
Virtual community Entropia Universe last year earned $ 400,000 after it auctioned off banking licenses to several well - known virtual world players .
The licenses allow their owners to lend cash to the community 's participants for the virtual purchase of anything from game - fighting weapons to real estate .
Second Life celeb Anshe Chung was among those who purchased a license .
Lawmakers on Tuesday denied that they were looking to regulate the virtual world .
Virtual reality is " going to be a highly competitive world .
We just want to make sure it's not highly regulated , " said ranking member Cliff Stearns of Florida .
As virtual worlds increase in popularity , " policy issues will inevitably arise that mirror the issues that confront policymakers in the real world  consumer protection , personal privacy , intellectual property protection , banking issues , online gambling , or child protection concerns , " said subcommittee chairman Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat .
" We want to foster the best of what this medium has to offer , [ so ] we must consider the policies that will be conducive to such growth , " Markey said .
That includes " upgrading our broadband infrastructure and speed , fostering openness and innovation in our Internet policies , and ensuring that we bridge the digital divides in our country so that all Americans can benefit , " Markey said .
In February , Markey introduced Net neutrality legislation that calls on the FCC to open a proceeding on broadband services and consumer rights .
Rep. John Shimkus , an Illinois Republican , took umbrage with the suggestion that the U.S. is lagging behind Europe in broadband penetration .
" I 'm ticked off about us being compared to Europe , " he said .
" You can drive across Europe in five hours .
I can't drive across the state of Illinois in five hours .
It 's just unfair to do a comparison .
It 's like apples and oranges .
We 're doing great . "
Stearns also expressed concern about child safety on Second Life , and grilled Rosedale about how the community prevents adults from entering sections designated for teenagers .
Second Life does not require Social Security numbers or driver 's license information , but instead checks credit card and telephone information for age verification purposes , Rosedale said .
The FBI has also been actively and pro-actively involved in investigations , though that has mainly concerned adult and cyber - crime related activity .
Second Life also encourages teenagers to " actively identify and warn us about anyone 's language and behavior that might suggest they 're not teenagers , " Rosedale said .
He did acknowledge , however , that there is " only so much you can do . "
Larry Johnson , CEO of the New Media Consortium , testified that virtual world residents are very protective of their surroundings .
" I think the strongest asset against [ harmful ] activity is the residents themselves who would simply stand up as one if they saw things of real concern , " Johnson said .
" They 're not shy about what they see in that world if they do n't think it 's proper behavior . "
Rosedale announced on March 14 that he would step down as Linden Labs CEO as soon as a replacement is found .
When asked why he was resigning , Rosedale said that he while enjoyed the " detailed design and skeletal construction " of Linden Labs in the beginning , he is " less interested in large company management . "
At precisely five minutes before high noon on March 6 , 1970 , the emergent radical - fringe bombers the Weather Underground had a terrifying and lethal showdown with its own cackhandedness .
In a townhouse on leafy , prosperous West 11th Street in Greenwich Village , close by houses once occupied by Poe , Melville and Whitman , there was , at 11.55 am , a series of horrifying explosions ; first one , then two more of equally shocking force .
The detonations collapsed the three - storey house in on itself , leaving a ragged hole in the street 's facade , as though a tooth had been torn from a smile .
A nearby neighbour - and our story is filled with odd connections like this - was one Susan Wager , who had briefly been the stepmother of sometime Weather - fan Jane Fonda .
Emerging into the street , Wager was astonished to see two young women , one clad in jeans and soot , the other in just soot , staggering from the wreckage and narrowly escaping death a second time when the front of the building collapsed yards behind them .
Offering them clothes , Wager then called the police , but returned to find the women had vanished .
They were Kathy Boudin , daughter of a progressive lawyer , and Cathy Wilkerson , daughter of the radio- station owner whose house had been destroyed .
Unbeknownst to Wager , the pair were both on bail - Wilkerson for $ 20,000 , Boudin for $ 40,000 - for destructive acts committed during the infamous Days of Rage protests fomented by a radical section of Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) in Chicago the previous autumn .
If the Days of Rage - which involved a minority of students tooling themselves up with bats and helmets and vandalising shopfronts along Chicago 's Gold Coast - had seemed like anti-war politics at the very end of its tether - they were nothing compared to the campaign of bombings that the hardcore SDS splinter group that soon dubbed itself the Weathermen would commit during the early 1970s after announcing their decision to go underground to fight the power .
Contradicting Bob Dylan , these young people believed that in fact you did need a weatherman to know which way the wind blew .
By then Dustin Hoffman , who lived in the house next door , was also outside examining the wreckage , a mild exemplar of the counterculture ( since The Graduate ) , looking into the gaping maw left by members of the wilder peace movement .
What police found inside the ruins was evidence of an accidental holocaust , arising from preparations for another , fully intentional one .
Sixty sticks of dynamite were found , plus pipe bombs , a live anti-tank shell and stolen student ID cards from campuses across the country .
One bomb - maker had inadvertently closed a circuit and immolated himself and two others .
One corpse , identifiable only by the print on a severed finger , was that of Diana Oughton , daughter of an Illinois state politician , and granddaughter of the founder of the Boy Scouts of America .
Ted Gold , a leader of the 1968 Columbia University shutdown , was also found in pieces , and of Terry Robbins there was only a torso remaining .
It was understood later that the bombs were to have been detonated at a non-commissioned officers ' dance at Fort Dix : apocalypse here and now , bringing the war home , indeed .
The end for the Weather Underground came 11 years later , with a botched armoured - car robbery in Nyack , upstate New York , that went even more horribly wrong .
Still a fugitive , Boudin and her partner David Gilbert , another Columbia ' 68 veteran , had agreed to act as white getaway drivers for members of the Black Liberation Army ( BLA ) , a formation composed of politicised street criminals and convicts radicalised in the aftermath of the 1970 Attica prison uprising .
Although Gilbert and Boudin were unarmed , their cohorts killed three policemen , including the first black cop in the county .
Another had his arm severed by machine - gun fire but survived , only to die in the World Trade Centre on September 11 .
Boudin pleaded guilty and received 25 years - to - life .
Gilbert bought two life terms and will die in prison .
In Attica , as it happens .
As documentarian Emile de Antonio asked in 1975 : " What the hell is an essentially white , middle - class revolutionary group doing in America ? "
It 's this question that fascinated film - makers Sam Green and Bill Siegel , whose remarkable documentary The Weather Underground now tells the whole story , or as much of it as can safely be related .
In the early 1970s , the group , operating in cells across the country , claimed up to 300 members , and planted over two dozen pipe bombs .
They bombed the Pentagon , the US Capitol , NYPD HQ , the New York Board of Corrections ( after Attica ) , and the offices of companies invested in Chile and Puerto Rico .
The gruesome lesson of the Townhouse explosion ensured they always struck at night , in empty offices , and gave detailed advance bomb - warnings .
They never killed anyone .
They nevertheless expressed their solidarity with weird revolutionary groups like the Symbionese Liberation Organisation , which kidnapped Patty Hearst , and the BLA .
In 1976 , they appeared on film , heavily disguised , for De Antonio and his cameraman Haskell Wexler .
The resulting documentary , Underground , became a cause célèbre a year later when the FBI tried and failed to seize De Antonio 's raw footage .
By the end of the 1970s , most Weather people had surrendered themselves and , ironically , most were acquitted , or never charged , because the FBI itself had violated so many laws while hunting them down .
After three years of research , Green and Siegel persuaded several eminent Weathermen to speak , people once seen as fresh - faced young radicals in the SDS , and later glimpsed on the FBI 's Ten Most Wanted list .
Appearing in the movie are Bernadine Dohrn , la pasionara of the 60s student left , who - cue more surreal connections - had been a law school classmate of rightwing US attorney general John Ashcroft , Dohrn 's husband Bill Ayers , whose memoir Fugitive Days - including his account of planting a bomb in the Pentagon - had the misfortune to be reviewed on page one of the New York Times on September 11 2001 ( d'oh ! ) , and David Gilbert , described by Green as " an absolute sweetheart , which is amazing since he 's been locked up for 20 years " .
Kathy Boudin declined to participate because she was facing a parole hearing - it was denied in 2002 .
Green and Siegel were also careful to include the dissenting opinions of SDS founder Todd Gitlin , who rightly says the Townhouse debacle proves that some Weathermen " were ready to be mass murderers " , and of members of FBI Squad 47 , who came to admire the Weather folks ' ingenuity , but who used some fairly despicable methods in their hunt .
Then there is Mark Rudd , glimpsed as a beautiful young man yelling to a crowd of students , " We gotta knock these motherfuckers right on their asses ! " and now a portly maths teacher at a community college in Albuquerque .
Rudd says that when his students ask him what he did in the 1960s , he always announces , " I was a leading figure in a violent leftwing revolutionary organisation dedicated to the overthrow of the United States government . "
You can imagine those teenage jaws all dropping in unison .
It 's Rudd 's way of making himself face the music , and of all the Weathermen , he seems the most conflicted and contrite .
" I was drawn to the romance of the outlaw revolutionary . " he told Newsweek recently , " But remember , we 're talking about a 20 - year - old kid .
I 'm not a violent person .
I think I was posturing .
I wanted to be tough . "
The outlaw revolutionary : it was indeed a potent image .
Weather activists often raved about Bonnie and Clyde as countercultural role models , and Gitlin recalls that Ayers and fellow SDS - er Jeff Jones comported themselves " like Butch and Sundance " .
Dohrn infamously congratulated the Manson Family in late 1969 for killing Leno and Rosemary LaBianca , saying : " Dig it !
first they killed those pigs , then they ate dinner in the same room with them .
Then they even shoved a fork into the victim 's stomach .
Wild ! "
John Jacobs , another Columbia 1968 veteran : " We 're against everything that 's ' good and decent ' in honky America .
We will burn and loot and destroy . "
And as if to prove that , in the slogan of the time , " We 're the people our parents warned us against , " the Weathers abolished monogamy and embraced the acid- inflected orgy .
One unpublished memoir quoted in the movie recounts a van ride into Chicago with a dozen revolutionaries fucking - for - chastity in the back .
To us today , and especially since September 11 , these people and events have an almost Martian foreignness .
Though the Weather Underground were the last in a long line of left - inclined bombers and violent insurrectionists - like John Brown the abolitionist , the Molly Maguires of the Pennsylvania coalfields in the 1870s , and the McNamara brothers , who killed 20 people when they dynamited the Los Angeles Times offices in 1910 - they still seem to defy comprehension .
But as Sam Green says , " It 's all about the context .
Take away the context and what they did does seem insane , but given five years of the Vietnam war , years of nationwide protests and student anger , and it may simply have felt to them that all other rational avenues had been utterly exhausted . "
Look at the events of the months before they disappeared .
The Chicago police murdered the charismatic , highly effective Black Panther leaders Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in their beds ; the My Lai massacre became public , the most gruesome images many Americans had ever seen ; Nixon entered the White House and immediately escalated the war to insane levels ; the Manson murders ; Altamont - nothing but bummers and downers .
" There seemed to be , " says Brian Flanagan , " a mass mania in society . "
These were molten times , and something had to give .
The Weather people had no home but the struggle .
They were inspirational figures in many ways , dedicated , visionary and effective activists in the mid- to - late - 60s , but somehow got tangled up in sectarian infighting that isolated them from SDS and sent them finally underground .
There they essentially deluded themselves on several fronts .
Though they alone pointed up the centrality of race in American politics , they also developed a specious , patronising self - identification with developing - world revolutionary movements and domestic black groupings that they , as extremely privileged middle - class whites , had little in common with .
They also spurned the labour left , believing American workers had been " bought off " by consumer durables and bad TV .
Rudd dissociated himself from the bombers early on and lived on the run , incognito within the working - class , people he suddenly realised he knew nothing about .
Until then , he says in the movie , he'd been gripped " by this terrible , demented logic .
I was seized by hate .
I cherished it as a badge of moral superiority . "
After Saigon fell in April 1975 , the Weather Underground was deprived of its primary raison d'être .
All they were left with were sunglasses , wigs , safehouses , internecine struggles , criminal records and a debilitating sense of impotence .
It was time to surface .
Twenty years later , they come across as intelligent , concerned citizens , justifiably proud of what they achieved before disappearing underground , less sure of their subterranean activities , but not altogether ashamed of them .
There is something deeply reassuring about seeing ex-Weatherman Brian Flanagan , a working - class Irish - American , back behind the bar in the Manhattan saloon he owns , and something utterly surreal about seeing him on Jeopardy , the squarest TV game show ever , and winning $ 23,000 in the process .
I 'm guessing he did n't spend it on handguns or blasting caps , maybe just a few drinks on the house .
# 183 ; The Weather Underground will be screened at the London film festival in the autumn .

The idea that hydrogen is a source of energy is really a bit misleading .
One does n't find free hydrogen lying around that we can burn to get energy .
Essentially all the hydrogen on this planet is bound up with other elements .
When hydrogen atoms bond to other elements ( for example , when two hydrogen atoms bind to an oxygen atom to make water ) , energy is released .
To get the hydrogen back out , energy has to be put in , and that energy has to come from somewhere .
For example , an electrical current can split water into hydrogen and oxygen , but energy is needed to make that electricity .
It might come from nuclear , solar , wind , geothermal , or whatever , but it has to come from somewhere .
It would really be better to think of hydrogen as a means for storing and transporting energy than as a source per se .
For example , if you have a generating station you could use the electricity locally to split water into hydrogen and oxygen .
The hydrogen you stored up could be burned at any time in the future to provide energy , and that burning could happen anywhere you shipped the hydrogen to .
That said , you would never get any more energy out of burning the hydrogen than it cost you to make it in the first place .
There is an exception to the above argument , and that 's if you use hydrogen in fusion .
In this case you push hydrogen atoms together to make helium plus a lot more energy than you used to get the hydrogen in the first place .
This is not easy to accomplish .
The sun does it , and so do hydrogen bombs , but we do n't really know how to make it go at a nice rate for commercial applications - yet !

What made it so dangerous was that , to be successful , the Dambusters had to fly at a height of 60ft , so the specially - adapted mines they were carrying - codenamed Upkeep - would bounce over the water before hitting the dams ' walls and sinking 30 ft
Tiger Woods sounded off on the NHL on Monday after he was asked if he is rooting for Detroit or Pittsburgh in the Stanley Cup finals : " I do n't really care .
Let 's talk about the Dodgers , " he laughed .
" I do n't think anybody really watches hockey anymore . "
Boo-yah !
Woods ' salvo prompted a response from NHL spokesman Frank Brown : " The National Hockey League has enormous respect for Tiger Woods , for all his accomplishments and for his work with the community .
We think he 's a great golfer . "
Very civil .
But Page 2 has uncovered the original draft of the NHL 's response .
I ’m so freaking excited to announce the details of our Columbus Conference today !!
But first , I want to tell you how this came about … and why it took so long to get here today .
I am actually based out of the ( ridiculously sunny ) Sacramento , CA area , but I am familiar with Columbus .
I started out my career working at the Miami Valley Regional Planning Commission in Dayton , OH .
My wife ( then girlfriend ) attended graduate school at OSU for City Planning , and I used to visit nearly every weekend .
We both loved Columbus , but she landed a great job out here and we decided to give California a try .
We had enough with ice scrapers .
Fast forward several years , and I created a Facebook page related to Walkable Neighborhoods .
The page was taking off , and I noticed that our # 2 fanbase behind LA was Columbus .
At the same , I was kicking around an idea in my brain I ’ve had for a long time : I really wanted to host a walkability conference .
Some of you have been following Walkable Neighborhoods since 2005 , and I thought a conference would be a great way to connect and learn from each other and people that have been doing this for a long time .
I remember I was having a particularly bad day in January .
One of those types of days where you just want to go out and do something crazy because you just do n’t care .
So , I did what any other irrational person would do in that state of mind , and I said , screw it , I ’m going to ask the Facebook fans if they ’d be interested in attending a conference in Columbus !!
( I guess I really wanted to see my Ohio friends that day 😉 )
I just had a hunch from watching the posts on Facebook that folks in Columbus were going to be really interested .
And boy , were you ever !
According to Facebook , my posts announcing the Columbus conference were viewed over 250,000 times .
Yes , 250,000 .
By count today , over 1,300 joined the conference email launch list .
And over 1,800 folks within the city limits of Columbus alone have joined the Facebook page .
I had a good feeling that the demand was there .
Now it was time to find a walkable venue in Columbus .
It took a lot of back and forth with folks , but I finally found a venue I was comfortable with , and the dates that would allow me to attend my fantasy football draft IN PERSON with my friends in Dayton !!
I even had a keynote speaker all set to come .
I was literally a couple of days away from signing contracts for the venue and speaker .
Then , I get a jaw - dropper of an email .
It said that another conference with very similar topics was being planned in Cbus for September 2014 .
There was already substantial support , dates and venue were set , and speakers were coming together .
But the email did say that he ’d like to speak and look into collaboration .
Still , I have to admit I was crushed .
I had promised all of you that I was bringing a conference to Columbus , and now that was in jeopardy .
And so was my fantasy football draft attendance 🙁
I knew that it would be hard to get folks out to two conferences , and if the other hosts were not interested in partnering , it could be the end for this year .
But after a long phone conversation with Matt Shad ( whom many of you know ) that weekend , we were both convinced that we had to work together .
There was so much synergy between our two efforts that it made perfect sense to combine efforts .
It took a few weeks of back and forth of trying to get everything solidified , but I think it was well worth it .
And so here we are today , announcing the 2014 Great Placemakers Lab , September 16 - 19 at the Westin Columbus Hotel in Downtown Columbus .
The event will be jointly presented by the German Village Society and Walkable Neighborhoods .
Now , we do n’t have every last detail worked out yet , but the Lab is planning to go a bit like this :
– Tuesday , September 16 – Welcome Reception & Keynote Speaker
– Wednesday , September 17 – Track - based conference seminars and workshops
– Thursday , September 18 – A day out on tours of Columbus neighborhoods !!
– Friday , September 19 – A Walkability Summit
One thing that I ’m really excited about for Friday is that the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission ( MORPC ) is organizing two audits where participants will walk around downtown Columbus … blindfolded !!
MORPC has ( safely ) led these tours in the past and they really help folks get a small sense of what it ’s like to not be able to see and navigate a city .
You can “ sense ” if downtown lives up to the challenge .
On top of this , we ’re going to do some incredible tours and bring in some of the top experts in placemaking and walkability .
Best of all , most , if not all of the workshops will be included as part of the registration fee !!
Do n’t think that I ca n’t see that you just started dancing .
Space is going to be extremely limited on some of the workshops so it ’s important you register quickly .
The tours will be first come , first serve .
So , make sure you go register now to make sure you get on these tours .
As I mentioned , we have thousands of people within the city of Columbus alone on our lists ( which people opted to join ) , so our roughly 250 spots for the conference could go very quickly .
You can also click here to join our registration info and updates list .
And now I ’ll leave you with a classic line from a song by The Happenings : See you in September !!

“ Interview in Baghdad , ” “ Interview in Najaf , ” “ Interview in Basra , ” “ Interview in Amara ” :
The endnotes at the back of Middle East correspondent Patrick Cockburn ’s new book read like an atlas of Iraq .
Such is the depth of reporting in Cockburn ’s Muqtada : Muqtada al - Sadr , the Shia Revival , and the Struggle for Iraq , a political biography - cum - war chronicle due out April 8 .
As the U.K .
Independent ‘s correspondent , Cockburn has spent about half of the last five years reporting , unembedded , around Iraq , a country he ’s been visiting since 1977 .
His subject is the real Iraq , and Iraqi voices predominate in his work .
British and American officials rarely appear in the book .
( He assiduously avoids the U.S. military ’s Green Zone press briefings . )
When Cockburn does give airtime to the official line , he ’s usually debunking it .
It was this irreverent attitude that got him barred from entering Iraq in the late 1990s when the regime was displeased with Out of the Ashes : The Resurrection of Saddam Hussein , a collection of Iraq reportage focusing on the aftermath of the Gulf War , which Cockburn wrote with his brother .
In Muqtada Cockburn both explores the rise of al - Sadr , undoubtedly one of the most important men in Iraq today , and traces the disintegration of Iraq through five years of American occupation .
After several failed attempts , I reached Cockburn by phone at the Al - Hamra Hotel in Baghdad March 17 , just before the start of the recent fighting in Basra .
In between broken connections and over the loud whir of a military helicopter above the hotel , I asked him what al - Sadr ’s role will be in the future Iraq and if , on the fifth anniversary of the invasion , he sees any reason for hope .
Mother Jones :
In the beginning of your book , you write that Muqtada al - Sadr leads “ the only mass movement in Iraqi politics . ”
Can you elaborate on that , especially given that in the American media we still hear more about the official Iraqi government than some of these other factions ?
Patrick Cockburn :
It ’s always sort of amazing , sitting here in Baghdad , to watch visiting dignitaries — today we had Dick Cheney and John McCain — being received in the Green Zone by politicians who have usually very little support and seldom go outside the Green Zone .
Muqtada leads the only real mass movement in Iraq .
It ’s a mass movement of the Shia , who are 60 percent of the population , and of poor Shia — and most Shia are poor .
Otherwise the place is full of sort of self - declared leaders , many of whom spend most of their time outside Iraq .
You know , if you want to meet a lot of Iraqi leaders , the best places are the hotels in Amman or in London .
In general the government here is amazingly unpopular .
MJ : What are the roots of his credibility among the people ?
PC : Muqtada belongs to the most famous religious family in Iraq , which is the al - Sadr family .
He ’s really the third in line .
[ Muqtada ’s father ] drew his power from the first really important al - Sadr , Muhammad Baqir , who was executed by Saddam in 1980 , together with his sister .
So it ’s really a family of martyrs , and that ’s why Muqtada suddenly emerged from nowhere with the fall of Saddam .
If you had passed around a picture of him in Washington at the time of the overthrow of Saddam , I doubt if any of them would have heard of Muqtada .
MJ : Did anyone outside or inside the country predict Muqtada ’s rise ?
PC : No , absolutely not .
His father was dead along with two of his brothers , assassinated by Saddam in 1999 .
His father - in - law had been executed .
He was under sort of house arrest in Najaf and was just within inches of getting executed himself .
So everybody — those who knew the family history — thought that the whole organization had been destroyed .
What Muqtada had going for him was that he had been a senior lieutenant of his father , so he had street experience of politics from the 1990s .
Also he had a sort of core of people who revered him who were politically experienced , and he brought this together very fast just in the days after the fall of Saddam .
His father was a very interesting character because he ’s almost the only person who persuaded Saddam to trust him .
Saddam thought it would be a really smart political move after the great Shia uprising of 1991 if he could have his own Shia religious leader who’d be in his pocket .
So he chose this guy , Muqtada ’s father , who came from the right family .
Muqtada ’s father used this to promote a mass movement .
And then at the last movement Saddam discovered he had been fostering this extremely dangerous enemy , who was refusing to use Saddam ’s name when he called for prayers , so Saddam had him murdered in Najaf .
MJ : Is the Western media epithet for Muqtada as the “ firebrand cleric ” accurate ?
PC : The idea that he ’s a maverick is 100 percent contrary to his track record over the last five years .
In fact he ’s very cautious , never pushing things too far , trying not to be pushed into a corner .
[ L. Paul ] Jerry Bremer tried to arrest Muqtada and ignited a tremendous uprising over most of southern Iraq in 2004 .
You could see all these Americans in the Green Zone had completely failed to realize the kind of support he could get .
They announced they were going to arrest him and suddenly the whole of southern Iraq erupted and Bremer [ could n’t ] control it anymore — but Muqtada did .
Then there was a big siege of Najaf .
But Muqtada always sort of looked for a way out .
So the idea of him as a maverick cleric , a firebrand , is one of these absurd journalistic clichés that takes on a life of its own , despite the fact that its contradicted by everything that happens .
MJ : Another thing you see is journalists frequently describing him as a “ radical cleric . ”
Is there anything radical about al - Sadr ?
PC : Well , it ’s slightly more accurate .
He ’s radical in the sense that he wants the U.S. occupation to end and has always said so from the beginning .
Secondly , his support among the Shia really runs along class lines ; it ’s mainly the poor who support him .
His organization runs an enormous social network .
Despite the fact that there ’s billions of dollars sitting in the Iraqi government reserves , somehow they are incapable of getting it out to the people .
There are a very large number of people here who are on the edge of starvation .
For those sort of people — a sizable chunk of people — that service makes them regard Muqtada as a sort of god .
Another thing is that he ’s always been able to call on a core of young men .
Young Shia who have been brought up with nothing , who are pretty anarchic , pretty dangerous .
My book begins with a run-in I had with them in 2004 when they came close to killing me , and of course they have killed very large numbers of other Iraqis .
That ’s a major source of strength for Muqtada .
MJ : You write that from the U.S. perspective , Muqtada looks too much like a younger version of Ayatollah Khomeini .
Is there anything to that ?
PC : There ’s an element of truth to it .
But from the moment George Bush decided to overthrow Saddam , the people who were going to benefit here were the Shia , who are 60 percent of the population .
So if you were ever going to have an election , then the Shia would take over .
An awful lot of the American problems in Iraq over the last five years come from the U.S. thinking that in some way it can devise a formula here that Saddam would be gone and the Shia religious parties — guys who look a bit like Khomeini , not just Muqtada , but all the other clergy — would n’t take over .
The U.S. never found it .
I do n’t think it ’s there .
MJ : So if the Democrats win the election in the United States , and they make good on their promise to pull out or mostly pull out from Iraq , what role would al - Sadr play in that scenario ?
PC : A very critical role .
Here is sort of the biggest Shia leader with the most popular support .
If there were elections tomorrow he would probably sweep Shia Baghdad and most of the south .
He ’s not going to take over the whole of Iraq because Iraq is such a divided place these days .
The Kurds are never going to let the Arabs take over their chunk , and the Sunni are going to fight like tigers to keep the Shia from taking over their areas .
MJ : What would an Iraq under al - Sadr look like ?
PC : I do n’t think the whole of Iraq would be under al - Sadr , but I think he would be the predominant force on the Shia side .
Quite contrary to his sort of maverick , firebrand image , he ’s shown a propensity to deal with the other side , to look for compromises , to negotiate .
You might have a loose federation [ in Iraq ] .
There are some things that could hold it together , notably oil revenues .
But at the moment , the much vaunted surge has had a measure of success primarily , to my mind , because Sunni and Shia Iraqis hate and fear each other more these days than they hate and fear the Americans .
MJ : You write in the book that the U.S. as well as Iraqi politicians habitually fail to recognize the extent to which hostility to the occupation drives Iraqi politics .
How much of al - Sadr ’s popularity do you ascribe to him speaking against the occupation ?
PC : I was doing a lot of interviews today with ordinary Iraqis , and they all bring it up , the question of the American occupation .
The latest opinion polls show that seven out of ten Iraqis want foreign forces to leave Iraq , and most want them to leave now .
One of the problems of the Iraqi government sitting in the Green Zone [ is that ] being associated with the occupation taints them and reduces their authority .
Lots of people you talk to here , particularly Sunni , do n’t just say “ the government , ” they say “ the traitor government . ”
In some ways this is extremely simple and obvious .
There are very few countries in the world that welcome being occupied .
And it ’s sort of strange that this very obvious fact — which has probably been a critical fact for why the U.S. is in such trouble here — has never really penetrated Washington .
MJ : In your piece marking the fifth anniversary of the invasion , you describe Iraq as “ a collection of hostile Sunni and Shia ghettoes divided by high concrete walls . ”
That ’s a pretty grim picture .
Do you see any reason for optimism on the horizon ?
PC : Well , not greatly .
Because it seems to me that all the things that have led to the violence are still there .
The current situation reminds me of the war in Lebanon , which went on really from the mid-70s to 1990 .
You had periods where there was kind of an unstable balance of power .
Baghdad has the same feeling at the moment .
Sunni and Shia are n’t coming together ; they do n’t go into each other ’s areas .
The Sunni-Shia dispute , the Arab - Kurd dispute , the Iraqi - American dispute — none of these things are resolved and any of them could ignite at any moment , and almost certainly will .
One of the problems with the media covering this place is that there are stereotypes of news , one of which is “ war rages ” and the other is “ peace dawns . ”
And there is n’t much in between .
When I talk to foreign journalists , often they are gritting their teeth because they ’ve been asked for a piece about how shops are reopening and restaurants are reopening and so forth — happy pieces .
And it just ai n’t so .
Tuesday ’s Washington
Post reports that FBI investigators “ with the click of a mouse , [ can ] instantly transfer key data along a computer circuit to an FBI technology office in Quantico . ”
Last month , I wrote that evidence of the Bureau ’s massive spying operations on Americans had been uncovered and “ that a new FISA whistleblower has stepped forward with information about a major wireless provider apparently granting the state unrestricted access to all of their customers ’ voice communications and electronic data via a so - called ‘ Quantico Circuit ’ . ”
According to whistleblower Babak Pasdar , a telecom carrier he worked for as a security consultant , subsequently named as Verizon by the Post , said the company maintained a high - speed DS - 3 digital line that allowed the Bureau and other security agencies “ unfettered ” access to the carrier ’s wireless network , including billing records and customer data “ transmitted wirelessly . ”
Verizon denied the report that the FBI has open access to its network ; a denial belied by documents obtained by the San Francisco - based Electronic Frontier Foundation describing the Bureau ’s Digital Collection System .
When these allegations first surfaced they were stonewalled by major media .
Nevertheless , the reports continued and we now have learned that electronic connections between major telecom firms and FBI personnel scattered across the country provide the Bureau with real - time access to who is speaking to whom , the time and duration of each call as well as the locations of those so targeted .
Despite half - hearted protests by Congress , the FBI ’s budget for these operations have increased significantly .
According to Post reporter Ellen Nakashima ,
The bureau says its budget for the collection system increased from $ 30 million in 2007 to $ 40 million in 2008 .
Information lawfully collected by the FBI from telecom firms can be shared with law enforcement and intelligence - gathering partners , including the National Security Agency and the CIA .
Likewise , under guidelines approved by the attorney general or a court , some intercept data gathered by intelligence agencies can be shared with law enforcement agencies .
But who ’s “ watching the watchers , ” or in this case , the listeners ?
Since 1994 , under rules mandated by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ( CALEA ) , passed by the “ liberal ” Clinton administration , federal rules are in place “ to make clear a telecommunications carrier ’s duty to cooperate in the interception of communications for Law Enforcement purposes , and for other purposes . ” [ emphasis added ]
These rules specify that telecom carriers and manufacturers design their equipment , facilities and services so as to guarantee they have the necessary surveillance capabilities .
This onerous piece of legislative flotsam specifies that common carriers , broadband internet access providers and providers of Voice Over Internet Protocol ( VOIP ) service are designated “ telecommunications carriers ” under federal law and thus , are capable of interception by the state ’s “ security ” bureaucracies .
The FBI has since created a network of links and electronic hubs for collection purposes amongst the nation ’s largest telecom carriers and internet providers “ and about 40 FBI offices and Quantico , according to interviews and documents describing the agency ’s Digital Collection System , ” according to the Washington Post .
These revelations mirror those of AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein , who revealed that the super secretive National Security Agency had been given access by AT&T management to install “ splitters ” for the Agency hard - wired to an NSA “ secure ” room in the company ’s central office in San Francisco .
According to Klein ,
In short , an exact copy of all internet traffic that flowed through critical AT&T cables–emails , documents , pictures , web browsing , Voice over - internet phone conservations , everything –was being diverted to equipment inside the secret room .
In addition the documents reveal the technological gear used in their secret project , including a highly sophisticated search component capable of quickly sifting through huge amounts of digital data ( including text , voice and images ) in real time according to pre-programmed criteria .
It ’s important to understand that the internet links which were connected to the splitter contained not just foreign communications but vast amounts of domestic traffic , all mixed together .
Furthermore , the splitter has no selective abilities –it ’s just a dumb device which copies everything to the secret room .
And the links going through the splitter are AT&T ’s physical connections to many other internet providers ( e.g. , Sprint , Qwest , Global Crossing , Cable & Wireless , and the critical West Coast Internet Exchange Point known as Mae West ) .
Since these networks are interconnected , the government surveillance affects not only AT&T customers but everyone else–millions of Americans .
I also discovered in my conversations with other technicians that other “ secret rooms ” were established in Seattle , San Jose , Los Angeles and San Diego .
One of the documents I obtained also mentions Atlanta , and the clear inference in the logic of this setup , and the language of the documents , is that there are other such rooms across the country to complete the coverage –possibly 15 to 20 or more .
As a key networking hub of the national security state ’s electronic driftnet , the “ Quantico circuit ” enables the FBI and their CIA and NSA partners in crime to literally target any one or any group with highly - intrusive and silent monitoring of all electronic communications .
Under the Bush administration ’s repressive “ public - private ” police state architecture , privacy rights join Geneva Convention prohibitions against torture as yet another “ quaint ” notion , a “ phantom of lost liberty , ” in the memorable phrase uttered by former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft in 2001 .
While the Bureau claims that the content of a phone call or e-mail must be authorized by a court order showing “ probable cause , ” as with other abusive FBI practices such as the issuance of so - called “ national security letters ” to obtain financial or other private records , the legal bar undoubtedly is set very low .
These latest revelations of FBI abuse of Fourth Amendment protections , follow on the heels of new initiatives undertaken by the Department of Homeland Security to utilize U.S. spy satellites for domestic “ law enforcement and counterterrorism ” investigations .
According to Nick Juliano ,
DHS plans to create a new office that would expand law enforcement and other civilian agencies ’ access to data gathered by powerful intelligence and military satellites orbiting the earth .
The National Applications Office [ NAO ] will oversee who can access such satellite data , which is typically used to monitor climate change and track hurricane damage , among other uses .
DHS still has not laid out legal frameworks or standard operating procedures for the office , according to a letter from three members of the House Homeland Security Committee .
First floated last August , then delayed over civil liberties concerns , DHS is now moving full speed ahead with the project .
In a letter to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff , Reps. Bennie G. Thompson , Jane Harman and Christopher P. Carney wrote , “ merely mentioning Posse Comitatus and other laws in the NAO Charter does not provide needed assurances that the Department will not transform NAO into a domestic spying platform . ”
Tepid protests by congressional Democrats who have systematically enabled these repressive measures by granting unlimited budgetary increases to Bushist spymasters , will have virtually no effect on an administration hell - bent on turning the entire country into a “ free spy zone . ”
Until he was an ex-president , I never felt any special fondness for Bill Clinton .
From the start , he seemed a bit skeevy to me .
On the night in 1992 that he accepted the nomination , as he dined in midtown with Hillary and the Gores , he was introduced to a reporter from Spy , of which I was then editor .
The future president smiled , popped to his feet , and ushered the reporter off for a private chat .
Spy had just published a cover story called “ 1,000 Reasons Not to Vote for George Bush — No. 1 : He Cheats on His Wife . ”
“ I want to thank you guys , ” Clinton told the man from Spy , “ for leveling the playing field with that piece you did on Bush ’s girlfriends . ”
But were there more women ?
he asked repeatedly in the course of a several - minute - long chat .
Nor did my admiration increase , six years later , when he obliged me to answer questions from my daughters , then 8 and 10 , about semen stains —
“ How did the stuff get on the dress , Daddy ? ” and “ But why did n’t she take it to the cleaners in three years ? ”
( And people wonder why the latest generation of Democrats is not bedazzled by Clinton nostalgia . )
Yet despite all his sleazoid tendencies , he was , of course , a pretty good president — and he turned out to be an absolutely exceptional ex-president , the best of our lifetimes .
The William J. Clinton Foundation is an ambitious , effective mega-NGO , with pragmatic approaches to tackling the problems that beset the poorest countries — HIV / AIDS , tropical diseases , foul water , undercapitalization .
It is to the U.N. what HBO is to PBS , nimble and exciting instead of elephantine and ungovernable .
Each of the last three summers , I saw Clinton interviewed live onstage , and each time I was agog .
The breadth and depth of his extemporaneous command of information and nuance — about green economics and technology , Iraq , Israel and Palestine , electoral politics — were extraordinary .
He was supersmart , nuanced , witty , casually eloquent .
In other words , so not George Bush .
Clinton ’s Energizer Bunny philanthropism since he left office would have rehabilitated him on the merits , but by comparison to his successor he seemed like some golden demigod , a living reminder of what an American president could be .
Until this year .
For me and most of the people I know , the postpresidential love for Bill Clinton has evaporated completely and breathtakingly fast .
No matter how many mosquito nets and microloans he helps supply to the Third World , I ’m out of love .
I found Bill Richardson ’s endorsement of Obama two weeks ago especially gratifying not in spite of its fuck - you to his former patron but because of it .
And this swing of sentiment is n’t just some elite coastal phenomenon .
According to NBC News / Wall Street Journal polling , from Clinton ’s impeachment until the end of his presidency , his approval number never sank below 44 percent , but in the latest survey it ’s down to 42 percent — and his “ very negative ” number , 32 percent , is nearly at an all - time high .
The other polls tell similar stories :
People feel more negatively toward Bill Clinton than at any time in at least the last five years .
For me the clarifying moment of disgust was his dishonesty concerning one of Barack Obama ’s refreshing moments of truth - telling .
“ I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America , ” Obama told a newspaper editorial board , “ in a way that Richard Nixon did not , and in a way that Bill Clinton did not .
[ Reagan ] put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it .
I think the Republican approach has played itself out , [ but ]
I think it ’s fair to say that the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there . ”
Bill ( and Hillary ) Clinton distorted and demagogued this bit of plain truth to try to cast Obama as some kind of crypto-Republican .
The former president has since gone on to besmirch Obama as a merely black candidate ( “ Jesse Jackson [ also ] won South Carolina in ’ 84 and ’ 88 ” ) and as less patriotic than his wife and John McCain ( “ two people who love this country ” ) .
Bill may believe sincerely that Hillary would make the better president .
However , I agree with the suggestion that what ’s driving him is not so much spousal loyalty as his own desperate narcissism , less a determination to get Hillary in the White House than to keep Obama out of it .
How dare Obama say , he whined , that Reagan “ had a more lasting impact on America than I did ” ?
Indeed , an Obama presidency would be an unacceptable affront to Bill Clinton ’s sense of his own historic gloriousness , for Obama is the new , highly improved version of Bill Clinton .
Like Clinton in 1992 , Obama is the thoughtful , oratorically brilliant 46 - year - old new - style progressive who seems more pragmatist than ideologue .
Whereas Clinton in 1998 was called “ the first black president ” in a metaphorical , mack - daddy sense — for his pleasure - loving appetites that had run afoul of the Man — Obama would be the post - ironic real thing .
Obama ’s speech about race was , among other things , a sublime and successful feat of political triangulation — which no doubt redoubled Clinton ’s jealousy about the new guy ’s stealing his act .
For Bill , it ’s all about Bill .
It was obviously the same desperate competitiveness with Obama that led Clinton , for instance , to concoct his revisionist history of their respective positions on the invasion of Iraq .
He , Bill Clinton , “ opposed Iraq from the beginning , ” while Obama ’s bona fide claims of opposition are “ the biggest fairy tale that I have ever seen . ”
I do n’t think the “ fairy tale ” remark was racist , or meant as a dismissal of Obama ’s Cinderella rise ; it was simply untrue .
Bill Clinton is our great living exemplar of Sam Goldwyn ’s great epigram :
If you can fake sincerity , you ’ve got it made .
The joke , of course , is that sincerity is supposed to be more or less synonymous with honesty — truthfulness with a buttery frosting of earnestness .
And although the honesty we want our presidents to embody is n’t merely ( or even mainly ) the literal Jimmy Carter kind ( “ I will never lie to you ” ) , it ’s an important part of the package .
Telling the truth , or not , has turned out to be a leitmotif of this election .
“ [ Bill ]
Clinton ’s an unusually good liar , ” his fellow Democrat ( and Hillary endorser ) Bob Kerrey said of the president back around the time the First Lady was visiting postwar Bosnia .
Thanks to the news footage of her unremarkable , sniper - free landing on the tarmac in Tuzla , we now know that Hillary Clinton is an equally brazen but unusually bad liar .
( And her gratuitous fibbing has also served to turn one of her husband ’s most significant accomplishments , imposing peace on the former Yugoslavia , into a setup for a joke . )
It was the stink of falsehood as well that queered the candidacies of Rudy Giuliani ( the fakey public phone calls from his wife , the security - budget monkey business when she was his mistress ) and Mitt Romney ( the rightward flip - flops , the wholly synthetic gestalt ) .
But just as striking have been this season ’s startling outbursts of candor , which have alternately damaged and propelled the various campaigns .
On the one hand , as Jack Nicholson shouted in A Few Good Men , we ca n’t handle the truth — at least when it ’s vitriolic .
“ She is a monster , ” Obama ’s foreign - policy adviser Samantha Power said of Mrs. Clinton .
Power was immediately obliged to resign .
The Reverend Jeremiah Wright ’s disturbing theory of the 9/11 attacks as imperial blowback was no more untrue than Susan Sontag ’s formulation of the same idea at the same time in The New Yorker .
And the snipe by Geraldine Ferraro that required her purge last month from the Clinton campaign —
“ If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position ” — was graceless , but not untrue .
Yet on the other hand , a different sort of surprising honesty — displays of vulnerable , please - do n ’t - hate - me candor by the candidates themselves — has worked like a charm .
Hillary Clinton ’s candidacy is probably still alive thanks to her moment of choked - up honesty the day before the New Hampshire primary .
Just as Obama ’s latest comeback is due to the complicated , carefully wrought honesty of his speech about racial mistrust and misunderstanding .
A couple of days after that speech , when some Fox News hosts , of all people , got all p.c. about Obama ’s glancing , benign ( and inarguably true ) bit of stereotyping of his grandmother as “ a typical white person , ” their colleague Chris Wallace could n’t abide the intellectual dishonesty .
“ It seems to me that two hours of Obama - bashing on this ‘ typical white person ’ remark is somewhat excessive , ” he said to them on the air , “ and frankly I think you ’re somewhat distorting what Obama had to say . ”
In fact , there ’s been a heartening uptick in face - the - facts honesty among Republicans during the last few years , as the incompetence and bad faith of the Bush administration have come to look more undeniably like an M.O. rather than accidents .
I knew something strange and beautiful was astir eighteen months ago , when The Washington Monthly published “ Time for Us to Go , ” a portfolio of essays by prominent conservatives on the inexcusable failures of the Republican regime .
That was about the same time that Republican senator Chuck Hagel ’s criticism of the war in Iraq blossomed into passionate , scabrous condemnation .
John McCain , given the burden of his Vietnam past , seems tragically unable to admit that Iraq is not “ winnable , ” but it ’s telling , I think , that the GOP nominated the candidate ( unelectable Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul aside ) who seems least inclined to dissemble .
Maybe we can handle some truth .
Maybe the reality - based fractions of red and blue America are reaching a sort of consensus : Just as Republicans are beginning to get why George Bush makes so many Americans want to rip their hair out , a lot of Democrats have finally , viscerally come to understand Clinton - loathing .
Mutual , symmetrical disillusionment ; it ’s a start .

Queensland Brain Institute ( QBI ) neuroscientists at The University of Queensland have discovered a fundamental component of the process that regulates memory formation .
QBI Director Professor Perry Bartlett said the discovery explains , for the first time , how new nerve cells form in an area of the brain associated with learning and memory -- which is known to deteriorate in people with stroke and dementia .
" The hippocampus is the region of the brain involved in important brain functions such as learning and memory and loss of neuronal production in the hippocampus is associated with a range of neurodegenerative conditions , and is particularly evident in ageing dementia . "
Professor Bartlett said .
" Surprisingly , however , studies have so far failed to identify a resident stem cell population in the hippocampus that 's capable of providing the renewable source of these essential nerve cells . "
Research by Professor Bartlett and his QBI colleague Dr Tara Walker -- published May 14 in the Journal of Neuroscience -- has identified the resident stem cell in the hippocampus and , even more importantly , has discovered how it can be activated to produce new neurons .
According to Dr Walker , an understanding of the activation process should enable the development of therapeutics that can stimulate the production of new neurons and reverse or prevent the cognitive decline that occurs during ageing dementia .
" These significant advances in determining the molecular regulation of nerve production will also have a major impact on our understanding of more complex areas such as behaviour , cognition , neurological disease and mental illness , " she said .
One has to wonder at the depths of deception engaged in by this administration when even their own spokesman turns against them .
Scott McClellan , in his recent book , What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception , avers that the White House ’s effort to sell the Iraq war was " less than honest and candid "  and , more , that the administration ’s public pronouncements amounted to a “ political propaganda campaign to sell the war to the American people . ”
Karl Rove ’s response  that McClellan " sounds like a left - wing blogger "  is hardly a refutation of the former White House official ’s contention .
Indeed , it underscores the irony : after all , here is someone who was , in his words , a " believer , " a loyal foot - soldier in the War Party ’s relentless campaign to drag us into an unnecessary and disastrous war .
If he now sounds like Atrios  or , more credibly , Glenn Greenwald  then what does that say about this White House ?
“ I gave them the benefit of the doubt just like a lot of Americans , ” says McClellan .
“ Looking back and reflecting on it now , I do n’t think I should have . ”
Yet the White House did not conduct its campaign of deception in a vacuum .
It had plenty of accomplices , first and foremost in the " mainstream " media .
While today everybody knows that there were no " weapons of mass destruction , " at the time only Scott Ritter , a few others , and Antiwar.com dared contradict the received wisdom that Iraq was on the verge of going nuclear .
While people now routinely scoff at the  on the face of it  counterintuitive claim that Saddam Hussein was collaborating with Osama bin Laden , during the run-up to war this was another administration talking point aided and abetted by " mainstream " reporters , who simply repeated those talking points as if they were fact .
While it ’s quite popular , today  even fashionable  to be against the war , and to treat the administration ’s pre-war twisting of " intelligence " with disdain , you ’ll remember that  at the time  very few stood up against the war drum - beaters .
Back then , anyone who questioned the administration ’s rationale for invading was treated like some sort of Benedict Arnold  including by some who are now loudest in their condemnations of the war and the President who launched it .
Andrew Sullivan , you ’ll recall , was calling the antiwar movement a " fifth column , and branding Antiwar.com , in particular , as being tied to alleged Islamic terrorists .
Another blogger for The Atlantic , Matthew Yglesias  today an articulate opponent of the administration ’s foreign policy , and author of a trenchant book on the subject  was for the war when it was the safe thing to do .
That ’s one thing that separates Antiwar.com from the rest of the crowd : we do n’t predicate our editorial stance on what ’s safe , and what ’s not .
We were right from the beginning about this war , and were n’t afraid to say so .
Indeed , we were afraid not to say so  because we knew the stakes were high , and that the costs would be higher than hardly anyone imagined .
The " mainstream " media  both the reporters and the pundits  were the reason all too many ordinary Americans gave the administration the benefit of a doubt .
If all these newsmen were the chorus to the war cries of the neocons , then surely there must ’ve been something to it  except there was n’t .
Americans had to turn to the " alternative " media to gain any real perspective on the War Party ’s outrageously obvious lies , which were being repeated on the front page of the New York Times and taken as gospel truth by the arbiters of the conventional wisdom .
First and foremost of these non-" mainstream " sources was and is Antiwar.com .
While it may be in somewhat dubious taste to say " I told you so , " the reality is that we did tell you so  consistently and loudly , warning that a wider war against Iraq ’s neighbors ( namely , Iran and Syria ) was also in the cards .
We do n’t have the material resources at the disposal of the mainstream media , nor do we have anything that even begins to approach the clout and big bucks available to the War Party ’s propaganda outlets , and yet we brought the truth to the American people and the world .
Our audience grew , as the truth began to dawn  and yet , today , we are struggling to survive , while the War Party ’s pet pundits prosper .
Bill Kristol , the little Napoleon of the neocons , has been rewarded for his catalytic role in setting this cavalcade of lies into motion with a prominent spot as a columnist on the New York Times op ed page .
Thomas Friedman , another Times denizen , who declared that the war was both necessary and winnnable , was charging less than fifty thousand bucks a pop for speaking engagements before he got his wish ; today , he ’s charging $ 65,000 - plus , and getting it .
Unlike most Americans , he ’s not having any trouble paying his mortgage : but , then again , unlike most Americans , he ’s living in a $ 9.3 million mansion .
He may have been wrong , but he ’s far from broke .
So much for the merits of America ’s alleged meritocracy .
Then there ’s the ubiquitous Peter Beinart , the gap - toothed boy wonder of left - neoconnery , whose prewar prognostications included the assertion that opponents of going to war were " abject pacifists . "
According to him , anyone who questioned the Saddam - has - WMD doctrine was being " disingenuous . "
Beinart was rewarded for his stubborn wrongheadedness with a gig at the Washington Post as a regular columnist .
He retains his post as editor of The New Republic  in spite of a vertiginous drop in that magazine ’s circulation  and has since become a regular talking head at MSNBC , where he ’s allowed to babble on as if his prewar pontifications had never been uttered .
And in the rogues gallery of prewar purveyors of puerile propaganda , surely Jeffrey Goldberg of the New Yorker deserves a special place .
His " The Great Terror " was cited by both Bush and Cheney as confirming their contention that Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq posed a terrible danger , a 16,000 - word compendium of every half - cooked bit of ersatz " intelligence " that came out of the Office of Special Plans somewhat extravagant imagination .
According to Goldberg , Saddam was conspiring with Osama , Arab terrorists were about to take over Paraguay , and the Iraqis were building a " super weapon " that would exterminate 100,000 Israelis  out of bread mold !
It sounds funny now , if you like your humor black , but at the time the public was taking this sort of nonsense seriously  egged on by the " mainstream " media , which reduced itself to the role of court stenographer .
In the grisly aftermath of it all , as thousands fall in the bloodstained sands of Iraq , and a new war  this time with Iran  is being ginned up by the usual suspects , fools prosper , while prophets go broke : Antiwar.com is scrounging for pennies , while the Kristol - Friedman - Goldberg axis of asininity is laughing all the way to the bank ?
Are we to be spared nothing ?
Where oh where is justice ?
Look here : this just is n’t right .
Why should we be behind  waaaay behind  in our online fundraising campaign this quarter , while the liars , the ass - kissers , and the preening pusillanimous pundits are floating in dough ?
Yes , times are tough financially : I know that .
I also know that Antiwar.com is the single most valuable resource for antiwar activists , and , indeed , for anyone who wants to know the truth about American foreign policy .
As such , it ’s worth paying for  and it ’s not at all expensive .
Unlike your average nonprofit foundation , we run a very tight ship .
No frills , no pretensions , and no nonsense : that ’s our journalistic credo as well as our organizational style .
For over a decade , we ’ve been bringing you the real news and the best commentary on the foreign policy front  but we just wo n’t be able to continue if we do n’t get a huge surge of support from you , our readers and supporters .
Unless you come through for us , we ’ll be out of business in fairly short order .
No kidding .
No exaggeration .
Just the hard truth .
So do n’t just sit there  act !

Newly unsealed court records have revealed that the U.S. government issued a subpoena to Amazon.com seeking to obtain the identities of customers purchasing books through the Amazon marketplace .
The snooping attempt was blocked by U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Crocker who wrote in a recently - unsealed ruling , " Well - founded or not , rumors of an Orwellian federal criminal investigation into the reading habits of Amazon 's customers could frighten countless potential customers into canceling planned online book purchases .
" Is the U.S. government trying to profile the psychology of its citizens by secretly data mining their book purchasing habits ?
Since 9/11 and the passage of the ill - designed Patriot Act ( which , if anything , is traitorous , not patriotic ) , it seems that the U.S. government is aggressively expanding its powers to search records , tap phones and surveil electronic messages , all in an effort to conduct Gestapo - like profiling operations on its own citizens .
It is now a well - known fact , for example , that domestic phone calls and e-mails are now tracked and recorded by the U.S. government , then mined for " dangerous " words which are linked back to those callers .
"
The subpoena is troubling because it permits the government to peek into the reading habits of specific individuals without their knowledge or permission , " Judge Crocker wrote in his ruling .
" It is an unsettling and un-American scenario to envision federal agents nosing through the reading lists of law - abiding citizens while hunting for evidence against somebody else . "
This News.com story by Declan McCullagh documents how AT&T opened up its massive telecommunications network to U.S. government security agents who used it to profile the telecomm behaviors of AT&T customers .
Curiously , the Bush Administration jumped in and classified key AT&T documents , preventing them from being presented in federal court ( so we 'll never know what they really said ) .
For years , the FBI has been operating its ultra-secret Carnivore program that surveils emails , capturing keywords in e-mail communications across the internet .
You can read about it on this Wikipedia page .
There 's also the Total Information Awareness program from DARPA which sought to create a massive domestic surveillance system that would keep tabs on virtually every electronic transaction made by Americans .
Congress defunded the project once its existence was made known by a New York Times reporter .
In response , the Feds simply renamed it , refunded it from other " shadow " funding sources , and continued to build the project .
It is now up and running behind the scenes here in America .
( You can keep tabs on this program and other shadow government operations at the ultra - popular www.Rense.com website , which posts daily headlines on this topic . )
Increasingly , the U.S. government is operating in secret , using greatly expanded police state power to spy on its own citizens .
This attempt at acquiring Amazon.com book records is just the latest round in an ongoing campaign of secret police tactics being used against the American people by its own government ... a government that was once created " Of the People , By the People and For the People " but now seems a lot more interested in terrorizing the people through fear - based politics and war mongering propaganda .
None of this is " fringe " information or conspiracy theory guesswork .
Every statement made in this article is a matter of fact that 's easily verified through publicly - available records and news reports ( not to mention common sense observation skills of what 's really happening ) .
It 's not even a secret anymore :
The U.S. government openly admits it is spying on U.S. citizens through various programs , but claims it 's all necessary to protect the public from " terrorism . "
Remarkably , most U.S. citizens actually agree with the government on these points , and they happily surrender their privacy and freedoms in exchange for the ( empty ) promise of security .
These people claim , " If you have n't done anything wrong , there is nothing to be afraid of when it comes to domestic surveillance . "
In doing so , they firmly establish themselves as the reincarnated ghosts of Nazi Germany war criminals , who used the same distorted logic to justify police state laws and round - em - up policies that eventually led to the mass murder of millions of innocent civilians .
Speaking from historical fact , there is no entity more dangerous to the safety of human beings than a government .
More people have been murdered , tortured and imprisoned by governments than by any other definable group ( including those involved in the religious crusades ) .
This is precisely why the founding fathers of the United States of America were careful to place the People in charge , establishing a system where the government answered to the People , and where power was never centralized in any single government office or department .
Examine this list of the worst genocides in the 20th century , and you 'll notice one fact that stands out :
Even more importantly , these were all committed by governments where power became too centralized and the People were stripped of their freedoms , rights and privacies .
Do you notice the pattern throughout history , and do you see where the U.S. is logically headed ?
The stripping away of the power of the People is , historically , a consistent prelude to mass genocide .
That 's why keeping power distributed throughout society was crucial to the engineers of the original United States of America .
Shared power is safe power .
A government with checks and balances that actually work is a much safer government than one where the President , for example , can bypass the legislative process by issued Executive Orders .
( How many executive orders has Bush issued ?
Click here to see the list yourself .)
Concentrated power is almost universally dangerous , and the use of executive orders to bypass Congress and create whatever laws one person wants to create is a dangerous sign of a growing dictatorship .
Shared power is essential in any free society .
But today 's U.S. federal government has long since abandoned any ideas of shared power .
Today , it steamrolls over the People of this country , tapping their phone lines without warrants , searching them without probable cause , arresting and imprisoning them but not charging them with any crime , arbitrarily adding their names to " no fly " lists used by commercial airlines , and engaging in other serious transgressions .
This example of the U.S. government attempting to acquire customer records from Amazon.com is not any real deviation from the consistent behavior of the U.S. government today :
It wants to gather information on the People , surveilling everyone and then selectively declaring who is a " criminal " and who is n't .
Many people , when faced with these facts about domestic surveillance and the dangers of a police state society , simply cannot believe any of it is true .
They naively think their government would never violate their rights .
The U.S. government is here to protect the People , right ?
It 's an incredibly naive belief .
To get the facts on how the U.S. government really treats its people , step back a few decades and look at the U.S. Civil Rights movement .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation , as well as local government police and law enforcement personnel , repeatedly engaged in heinous crimes against the " Black Power " leaders of the day .
They planned and carried out literally hundreds of attacks , bombings and executions of black leaders .
( This is not conjecture : It 's all on - the - record testimony from former FBI agents . )
And when the Freedom Riders boarded buses and drove through the American South to protest the accelerating violence against the black people , law enforcement personnel took part in the beatings , shootings and violence perpetrated against these innocents .
And the FBI ?
It said that it would do nothing to protect the rights of these black civilians against racial violence , but that if black people were actually killed in the attacks , it would " investigate .
"
The history of the Civil Rights movement is a damning indictment of the State .
It shows , in gruesome detail , the way in which the U.S. government protected itself at the expense of the freedoms of its people .
Even U.S. Congresspeople , Senators and Presidents stood by and did nothing while blacks were being shot , stabbed , beaten and bombed all across the nation .
For decades , the U.S. government passed empty laws making racism illegal then did absolutely nothing to enforce those laws .
( Read more gruesome historical details in the eye - opening book A People 's History of the United States by Howard Zinn . )
Can a government really treat people in this way ?
The answer is a resounding YES !
And it 's not just any government , it 's the American government .
Today , the U.S. government stands as the only first world government on the planet that openly condones the kidnapping and torturing of civilians from other nations , neither charging them with crimes nor declaring them war criminals under which they would be protected by the Geneva Convention ( which the U.S. openly ignores ) .
Today , Guantanamo
Bay holds prisoners who have been held for six years and never charged with a crime !
It is a violation of both domestic and international law , and that 's why the Bush Administration chose to kidnap and imprison these people on non-U.S. land -- it was a way to attempt to avoid adhering to U.S. laws establishing the basic rights of those charged with criminal acts .
( Yes , even criminals have basic rights , like the right to legal representation and the right to know what crime they 're being charged with . )
The behavior of the U.S. in these matters is very much like Nazi Germany and is nothing less than a series ofbeing perpetrated against not just men from Middle Eastern nations , but also U.S. citizens .
The U.S. government is also the only government in the world to have ever dropped nuclear weapons on predominantly civilian populations ( Japan , World War II ) , and today , the U.S. government is openly engaged in the widespread use of weapons of mass destruction against civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan through the use ofshells .
They will irradiate the Iraqi soils for generations to come , destroying the genetic code of an entire race .
This is a case of mass genocide against civilians being carried out right now by the U.S. government , with the full awareness of the President , the Congress and the mainstream media .
The long sought - after Weapons of Mass Destruction have finally been found :
They 're being used by the U.S. military !
Heard enough ?
We 've barely scratched the surface .
As far as the crimes of the U.S. federal government go , tapping into Amazon.com 's records is little more than a drop in the bucket .
It 's just a tiny glimpse of the outright betrayal of the U.S. Constitution and the American People that 's going on every day in our nation 's capitol .
As citizens we have both the right and the responsibility to take our power and freedoms back from the hands of the corrupt , pro-war , fear - mongering tyrants who now operate it .
I have consistently advocated non-violent protests and grassroots action campaigns that can work towards a better future for all Americans .
I believe that we must do everything in our power -- in a non-violent way -- to take back our freedoms , our privacy and our power .
And we must do it NOW , before the United States of America collapses into a bankrupt police state , drowning in a worthless U.S. dollar , with rampant hyperinflation and a massive expansion of police powers .
There is only one Presidential candidate who even has a shot at delivering this , and his name is Ron Paul .
It does n't matter if you 're a Republican , a Democrat , a Green Party member , a Libertarian or Independent :
If you believe that power should be returned to the People , and that America should cease to be an imperialist , police state nation , then there is only one candidate in the running right now that can even come close to delivering the kind of changes that matter to you .
That 's Ron Paul .
In fact , I will offer a prediction right here : , having suffocated under terminal debt , its currency worthless , its international reputation in shambles , its people impoverished and starving , and its leaders fleeing indictment for their crimes against their own people .
We have one last desperate effort to turn this around , and that 's the ballot box .
It is our last hope to save this nation from near - certain collapse .
It is also the last way to avoid the inevitable violence and crimes against humanity that will sadly emerge from the economic and political turmoil that 's almost certainly in our future if something does n't radically change for the better .
We CAN create a better future for ourselves and our children , but not if we keep electing tyrants and ignoring the increasingly thunderous march of government - sponsored tyranny that seems to set the tone in Washington today .
Skeptical of all this ?
Look around you .
The U.S. dollar is collapsing faster than a skyscraper packed with demolition charges .
China is threatening to dump the U.S. currency and start selling all the debt it has purchased from the wild - party - spending United States government -- a move that would send the dollar into a tailspin .
A secret meeting among OPEC members revealed that they , too , are fleeing the dollar and looking to trade oil in Euros .
The collapse of the U.S. dollar means there will be no more buyers in the world for U.S. debt , and that means immediate hyperinflation of the currency as the government tries to bail itself out of endless debt .
Hyperinflation will wipe out the savings of every person in the country with money held in banks .
Retirement accounts ?
Gone .
Savings ?
Wiped out .
FDIC insurance ?
Worthless .
Real estate ?
Collapsed into a decades - long depression .
( Think the FDIC will save you ?
Do n't be so gullible :
The FDIC can only bail out a tiny percentage of failed banks in a massive , national bank run , perhaps 2 to 3 percent . )
Just last week , Citibank itself reached out to the Abu Dhabi government , desperately seeking a loan of cash to bail it out of a house - of - cards debt collapse scenario .
It agreed to pay a whopping 11 percent interest on a loan to save it from collapse .
That technically makes Citibank a sub - prime borrower itself !
( When the largest banks desperately need high interest rate loans to bail themselves out of bankruptcy , you know something is seriously wrong with the debt bubble ... )
Oil is now flirting with $ 100 a barrel , a price level that virtually all economists and politicians thought was laughable just two years ago .
But smart - minded economics like Stephen Leeb saw this coming well ahead of the masses .
If you want to know what 's in the picture for the near future , I recommend Leeb 's newest book : The Coming Economic Collapse : How You Can Thrive When Oil Costs $ 200 a Barrel .
You can get it , ironically , at Amazon.com , the very online retailer where the feds were trying to snoop into customer records :
Meanwhile , the Fed is pumping money into the economy in a desperate move to delay the inevitable popping of the massive U.S. debt bubble .
It 's buying up bad bank debt as fast as it can , much like a group of frantic sailors trying to bail water out of a rapidly sinking ship .
Only a financial fool could look at the current situation and have any degree of confidence in the future of the U.S. economy , and much of this has been caused by outrageous national debt spending by our current pro-war president .
Ron Paul cannot reverse all this overnight , but if the People use their voting power to eject all the criminals , hucksters , war mongers and corrupt fat cats that currently run this country , we could begin the economic and political healing processes that , in fifty years or so , might return this country to something resembling an honest society .
It will take at least two generations to pay off the national debt , and that 's if we radically slash government spending on war and health care right now .
Of course , there is no candidate other than Ron Paul who has any intention of even thinking about paying off the national debt .
The issue is simply ignored from one presidency to the next in a great pass - the - buck game that can only end in a sudden a total collapse of the U.S. economy ( and its currency ) .
Recent news reports reveal the U.S. debt is now increasing at the rate ofRon Paul believes in honest currency ( having the currency backed by gold , so that savings cannot be stolen from the People through the Fed 's planned hyperinflation ) .
He believes in health freedom and in getting the U.S. out of wars in the Middle East .
He believes in returning America to its Constitutional roots , where the People do n't have to live in fear of the U.S. Gestapo police who wiretap their phones , surveil their e-mails and steal their Amazon.com book purchasing records .
If you believe in freedom at all , there 's only one candidate to vote for : Ron Paul .
Sure , Paul has some downsides .
He 's not up to speed on global warming and the role of governments in aggressively regulating corporations .
I do n't agree with Paul on everything .
But for the core issues -- war , the money supply , taxation , health freedom -- he 's so right on that there 's simply no other candidate that even comes close .
If you believe in corruption , endless debt , secret police , a collapsing economy and an endless stream of government lies , vote for the popular , mainstream , corporate - backed candidates .
But if you believe in returning honesty to government , there is only one sensible choice , and his name is Ron Paul .
There 's also something else happening in society today that might have a chance of helping us all win back our freedoms : People - powered surveillance and the YouTube phenomenon !
YouTube is amazing .
That 's where regular people can post videos of things they 've video recorded in society .
The police hate YouTube because it puts them on the record beating innocents , tasering students , and violating people 's civil rights
Watch how the police assault this woman with a taser :
Do n't forget the " Do n't Tase Me Bro " incident at the University of Florida :
In this next video , Canadian police EXECUTE a Polish man with a taser :
Here 's a video about a 78 - year - old man being tasered by L.A. cops :
Here 's a frightening compilation of numerous police brutality videos : ( Warning : GRAPHIC , contains profanity ) Most of this video was taken by amateurs .
And do n't forget these amateur photos taken by idiot U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib : .
That 's why authorities hate YouTube so much .
Just this week , a group of Canadian health researchers slammed YouTube , claiming it had too many videos from people giving out " false " information about vaccines .
( That " false " information , it turned out , was urging parents to avoid vaccinating their children due to the link between mercury in vaccines and autism . )
There are a lot of good cops out there , and local law enforcement is , of course , a necessary thing .
But there are bad cops , bad soldiers and bad tyrants out there , too , and it's the job of reasonable people everywhere to catch these perpetrators on video , post it on YouTube , and share it with the world .
A surveillance society can work both ways , you see .
While the tyrants are surveilling the People , the People can also surveil the tyrants .
Plus , we 've got the internet on our side ( because information WANTS to be free ! ) , which gives us the ability to bypass the mainstream media and share information directly with the people .
The internet could be the single most important tool in the regaining of freedom and civil liberties in America and other countries .
So keep those cell phone videos rolling .
Keep a compact video camera handy for all occasions .
When the authorities step out of line , press the record button and try not to get your ass arrested .
Book it back home , upload it to YouTube , and send me the link .
We 'll spread the word .

A type of plastic that exhibits metallic and semi-conductor - like properties will be described in an inaugural doctoral lecture at the University of Leicester on Wednesday June 4th ( * ) .
In his lecture , Dr. M. A. Mohamoud will discuss a novel class of materials called “ conducting polymers . ”
Conducting polymers are smart materials that can mimic biological systems and can be used as components of artificial nerves , electronic noses / tongues , drug - release - and - delivering systems , and artificial muscles .
They can also be used as energy storage devices in battery technology , electrochromic display devices ( in smart window technology and light emitting diodes ) , and biological sensor technology .
Dr Mohamoud commented : “ In this lecture , I will show real time movies of free standing conducting polymers at a nanoscale level ( 1000 times less than the size of human hair ) functioning as micro-muscles that have potential applications in medical surgical operations .
“ I shall be explaining their properties ; how they function and conduct electricity and how their properties can further be improved and exploited . ”
He will also discuss the many potential applications these new materials offer as an economic alternative to precious metals ( e.g. gold , silver and platinum ) with the added advantage of being able to tune their electronic and optical properties .
Dr Mohamoud added : “ Traditionally , plastics have been regarded as insulators and used by the electronics industry on the basis of these properties .
However , in the year 2000 , the scientific community celebrated this field of materials chemistry by awarding the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Heeger , Shirakawa and MacDiarmid for their work in the discovery of conducting polymers .
“ In this presentation , I strongly highlight our contribution to the recent research in the advancement of these systems .
The optimization of these systems fully relies upon the understanding of the basic principles that govern the physico - chemical processes underpinning the operations of conducting polymer systems . ”
During his PhD studies , Dr Mohamoud carried out fundamental research of the correlations between composition , structure and properties of conducting polymers .
He is now a post - doctoral researcher in the Scionix laboratory in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Leicester .
His current research involves metal deposition using ionic liquids ( solventless liquids of mixed ions ) .
This lecture will be based on work carried out during his postgraduate studies at the University of Leicester , where he was awarded his PhD in July 2007 .
(*) 5:30 pm at Ken Edwards Lecture Theatre 3 .
Dr Mohamoud ’s lecture is open to the public and free of charge .
LONDON —
They were shaped like cigars , saucers , coffins and amorphous blinking blobs .
They hovered in a menacing manner , traveled at impossible speeds and vanished into the netherworld , or , in one instance , a hedge in Cornwall .
A few carried humanoid life forms , or so it seemed .
A few materialized courtesy of the observers ’ possibly having had a drink too many , as in the case of an unidentified flying light cluster witnessed loitering in the sky by the patrons of a pub in Kent .
Whatever they were , these phenomena reported to Britain ’s Ministry of Defense over the years and made public this month were almost certainly not actual alien aircraft piloted by actual alien beings .
“ The government has been telling us the truth , ” declared David Clarke , a senior lecturer in journalism at Sheffield Hallam University , who has a side interest in U.F.O.’s .
“ There are a lot of weird things in the sky , and some of them we ca n’t explain , but there ’s not a shred of evidence for a single alien visitation . ”

The issue of beef imports has become a crucial symbol of opposition to a free trade deal that the Korean government has negotiated with the US .
Thousands of young people have been gathering every night in Korea 's capital , Seoul , staging a candlelit vigil against the free trade deal .
They have been there nearly every night for the last week , occupying one of the capital 's main squares .
They sit in the streets on neatly folded newspapers , filling every road leading up to the busy intersection , while slogans are being belted out on a public address system .
Police stand - off
The streets around the area have been packed with buses full of riot police .
So far , the police have been sitting it out just like the protesters .
There has been no violence , but the mood is angry and it has been having an effect on the government .
This week , South Korea had planned to resume quarantine inspections on more than 5,000 tonnes of US beef which have been languishing in storage at the country 's ports since last October .
But now the government has announced it will delay the resumption of US beef imports , in the face of mounting public concern over the safety of the product .
" I think we need a week to 10 days , " Korean Agriculture Minister Chung Woon - chun told parliament .
Top importer Korea , once one of the top three importers of US beef , banned the product in 2003 after an outbreak in America of BSE , or mad cow disease .
President Lee favours free trade and economic reform
The row rumbled on until last month , when South Korea 's new president Lee Myung - bak made a state visit to the US and was told Congress would refuse to ratify a crucial Free Trade Agreement until beef imports were resumed .
He agreed , but the decision has led to a plunge in his popularity back home , where a US - linked mad cow scare is sweeping the country .
One locally - conducted opinion poll suggests that 78 % of Koreans think US beef is unsafe .
Most of the protesters taking to the streets are students and in this techno - savvy nation , they are swapping information via the internet and mobile phone text messages .
The country is alive with rumours - that drugs and cosmetics and babies ' nappies could contain BSE - infected products , or that that Koreans have a gene that makes them more susceptible to CJD , the human form of mad cow disease .
Caving into pressure Government assurances that US beef is safe and that reports of its dangers are grossly distorted are falling on deaf ears .
Korean farmers have been protesting free trade deals around the world Although there have been only three reported cases of BSE in the United States , public alarm here has reached such a peak that South Korean newspapers are reporting that food distributors , schools and restaurants plan to boycott US beef .
But there is more to this controversy than the health scare or the widespread public perception that President Lee caved in to US demands over the Free Trade Agreement .
Farmers under threat Korean farmers say it threatens their livelihoods .
South Korea suspended most US beef imports after concerns about BSE Two hours ' drive south of Seoul is a beef farm run by Lee In - sai .
He started out when he left agricultural college 20 years ago with one cow .
Now he has built up a herd of 250 animals .
But he wonders how long he and his fellow farmers can keep going .
Standing beside his cows and their calves , a local breed called Hanwoo , he says : " The Free Trade Agreement means we have more competition and to be competitive we 've had to expand our farms .
That means we 've had to take out loans , expand the facilities , buy more cows - a very difficult situation .
" On top of that , grain prices have gone up and so have fuel prices .
The government should raise the price of beef to compensate , but the price of beef has been going down , which makes things very hard for farmers .
" This is the sort of situation that drives farmers to suicide . "
Economic benefits South Korea has signed free trade agreements with the United States and Europe , but they have yet to be ratified .
And although the farming sector might suffer , the government believes the rest of the South Korean economy could reap big benefits .
It seems to have been taken by surprise by the strength of the public reaction .
Korea wants to ensure it can continue to export its cars to the US Hyun Jung - taik , president of the government 's economic policy think - tank , the Korea Development Institute , says : " There is a very irrational , emotional reaction on the part of the Korean general public .
It is a pity , I think .
We have to go through this ratification of the Free Trade Agreement soon and it is really very essential . "
Deal - breaker
And the US farm lobby is equally keen to get the deal ratified .
The US Department of Agriculture says it is potentially the most significant trade agreement for the sector in 15 years .
The US government says US beef is safe and the deal is based on sound science .
American producers , meanwhile , accuse Korean farmers of protectionism .
Opposition politicians in South Korea continue to lobby for changes to the Korea - US Free Trade Agreement , and the Korean government has now promised to suspend US beef imports if there is any new outbreak of BSE in the United States .
But few people doubt the free trade deal will eventually be ratified by Korea , whose economy depends on exports .
Although the Bush administration says it is committed to implementing the deal this year , with a Presidential election imminent in the US , and a Democratic Congress , that is looking increasingly unlikely .

Japanese chemists have made a molecule that could easily become part of a magic act .
In a short movie , paired with their formal report to the journal Organic Letters , the scientists showed off a solution that momentarily turns dark green when struck by a UV laser beam .
Jiro Abe , and his team at Aoyama Gakuin University , made several derivatives of — brace yourself for a big word — hexaarylbiimidazole .
Molecules in that family are known to have photochromic abilities , which means that they change color when blasted with the right wavelength of electromagnetic radiation .
Other photochromic chemicals are used to make sunglasses that darken when they are taken outside — into bright sunlight .
They could also be used for optical data storage .
When these special chemicals are struck by ultraviolet light , they break in half , forming two colorful and highly - reactive smaller molecules called radicals .
Eventually , the radicals re-combine to form the original molecule , and the color goes away .
Abe and his colleagues discovered a compound that reverts to its clear appearance within milliseconds .
Kyle Finchsigmate , founder of The Chem Blog , watched the amazing footage , uploaded it to YouTube , and wrote a short commentary .
My best guess is that many amazing science movies remain hidden on journal websites and have been completely overlooked by the press .

A federal judge is trashing UMG Recordings ' claim that it retains perpetual ownership of promotional CDs it sends out before an album 's release .
The case was brought by the recording label against a California man who was auctioning off the promo discs on eBay .
The music concern claimed Troy Augusto was violating its copyright because the discs were labeled with messages that they could not be resold .
But U.S. District Judge James
Otero said the so - called " first sale " doctrine applied because persons in lawful possession of copyrighted material , whether they paid for it or whether it was gifted , have the right to sell the material .
The decision set aside UMG's claim that recipients of the promotional CDs were not even free to throw them away .
" UMG 's distribution of promo CDs provides the recipient with many critical rights of ownership , including the right to perpetual possession and the freedom from obligations to UMG , " the judge ruled Tuesday .
The judge said the distribution of the promotional CDs " is properly characterized as a gift or sale , not a license , and title to the CDs transferred . "
The Electronic Frontier Foundation said a contrary ruling could have given copyright owners too much power .
" This is a very important ruling for consumers , and not just those who buy or sell used CDs , " said EFF attorney Corynne McSherry .
" The right of first sale also protects libraries , used bookstores , and businesses that rent movies and videogames . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Robert Shiller ,
Yale finance professor and author of the highly touted “ Irrational Exuberance ” book on asset bubbles , said gradually falling home prices are nothing to fear .
Robert Shiller , Yale professor , and chief economist and co-founder of financial firm MacroMarkets LLC . , speaks during the Reuters Housing Summit in New York February 21 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brendan McDermid
It ’s the more swift and sharp slide that can undermine housing , and thus consumer confidence and the economy , he said here at a Reuters Housing Summit .
“ There ’s nothing troubling about a gradual correction of home prices .
If we keep our incomes at the current level and home prices go down we are richer , we can buy more housing , ” Shiller said .
“ On the other hand , if they fall suddenly and fast then that can bring on recession and that is the worry right now . ”
A housing boom that lasted nine years is now unraveling .
The economy is “ probably on the brink of recession , ” Shiller said .
The most recent Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller 20 - city home price index released in late January showed an annual 7.7 percent price drop in November .
Still , that slide pales in comparison with the surge registered in the nine years of the housing boom .
From December 1997 to December 2006 , home prices spiked up 147 percent , an S&P spokesman said in a telephone interview .
The value of U.S. homes has eroded by about $ 1 trillion from the peak through the third quarter , Shiller estimated .
Without forecasting the ultimate drop during this cycle , Shiller said there is a tendency for momentum in house prices .
But a slow price descent could put the market and the economy back on the right path .
“ We want a gradually declining market , we do n’t want a collapse in our institutions , ” Shiller said .
“ The purpose of this should be to try to maintain confidence , which is a dangerous thing to lose , and we want to also maintain a sense of fair dealing , that we ’re a society that cares about its people , ” he added .
The subprime mortgage meltdown spawned a much broader housing downturn , but it has hurt many low - income people , many of whom were taken advantage of by lenders .
“ We ca n’t have millions of low - income people be thrown on the streets because of some financial dealings .
That would be disastrous to our sense of fairness and cause damage for years to come . ”
Years of double - digit price gains put homes out of the reach of many consumers , and a correction is necessary .
“ In major cities , we see often the service people can’t live there any more , the firemen , school teachers .
This is not the way we want our society .
We want affordable housing , ” he said .
Shiller said it ca n’t be all or nothing , and that there has been a big misperception that houses will constantly appreciate .
“ Some times people will try to imagine that we can have both high home prices and affordable housing .
But I can tell you that does n’t add up , ” he said .
“ You either have high home prices or lower home prices and lower home prices are what we want , and people should n’t be afraid of that , ” said Shiller .
“ Most of us care about our children and grandchildren , and these people have to buy houses so why would we want high home prices .
We want economic growth , we do n’t want high home prices . ”
Suspicious Phone Messages Target Black Voters in North Carolina
Calls tell voters to expect a voter registration packet in the mail .
April 30 , 2008  --
Misleading automated phone messages that have targeted African American voters in North Carolina have been linked to similar phone calls made in Virginia , say election officials .
The messages , from a caller who identifies himself as " Lamont Williams , " tell voters to expect a voter registration packet in the mail .
" All you need to do is fill it out , sign it , date and return your application .
Then you will be able to vote and make your voice heard , " says the caller with no additional identifying information .
North Carolina election officials and watchdogs say the calls are confusing and misleading , since North Carolina 's mail - in voter registration deadline passed more than two weeks ago .
Listen to the automated call .
Similar calls went out to voters in central and southern Virginia before that state 's presidential primary in February .
The Virginia State Police , concerned that the calls could be a part of a identity theft scam , investigated and traced the calls to Women 's Voices Women Vote , a Washington , D.C. - based nonpartisan voter outreach group .
The state police dropped the investigation after the calls and registration packets were determined to be legitimate .
" Whatever the intent , the practical effect is to confuse people , " said Bob Hall of Democracy North Carolina , a nonpartisan election watchdog group .
" This is a terrible time for it be happening . "
Hall is concerned that the calls may discourage voters from voting during the current early voting period , where they can register and vote on the same day .
A spokesperson for Women 's Voices Women Vote did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Transcript of the call :
" Hello , this is Lamont Williams .
In the next few days , you will receive a voter registration packet in the mail .
All you need to do is fill it out , sign it , date and return your application .
Then you will be able to vote and make your voice heard .
Please return your registration form when it arrives .
Thank you . "

Time Magazine Cover Depicts Democratic Split - Shades of The Wisdom of Solomon
This weeks cover of Time Magazine shows the current plight of the Democratic party as they try to bring the primary season to closure .
This cover is shades of the wisdom of Solomon in splitting each candidate in half to create the standard bearer who can move forward and launch a successful presidential bid against Republican
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have proven to be formidable opponents .
Both have made a compelling case for receiving the support of the undecided Superdelegates .
It does n't look like Florida and Michigan voters will get an opportunity to see their votes counted .
This travesty will in effect punish private citizens for the sins of their elected officials .
Has anyone else wondered why the media talking heads have not reared up in righteous indignation over the disenfranchising of over 2 million voters ?
There was a day when that would have been the story .
With a black man and white woman running for the highest office in the land , the big picture seems to have taken precedence over the plight of the citizens of two key states .
For me , the most difficult part of this fierce battle between the first woman and the first black man is the way the media has blatantly tried to sway public opinion with their over the top bias reporting .
Oh for want of the good old days when reporters and anchors told the stories and let their audiences decide for themselves .
No spin back then , just the facts .

The American lifestyle guru Martha Stewart has joined the radical Islamic preacher Yusuf al - Qaradawi and US rap star Snoop Dogg on the list of high - profile figures to be denied entry to the UK by the Home Office .
Ms Stewart , 66 , who turned her home catering business into a multi-million pound media empire and is regarded in the US as the leading authority on " homemaking " , was due to fly to Britain for a business trip next week but is thought to have been refused entry because she has a criminal record .
In 2004 she was sentenced to five months in prison after being found guilty of lying to investigators during an investigation into whether she and her stockbroker had been involved in insider trading .
The UK Border and Immigration Agency released a statement saying the Government " continuesto oppose " entry to the UK for those who have been found guilty of " serious criminal offences abroad " .

Lying to government agencies is a federal crime in the United States and could easily be considered a serious enough crime in Britain to warrant exclusion from the country .
Ms Stewart had been due to speak at the Royal Academy during her trip as well as hold meetings with a number of businesses .
Ms Stewart was planning to meet executives from the Wedgwood china company in Stoke - on - Trent .
The company has a product line which bears her name .
Andrew Stanistreet , communications executive at Wedgwood , confirmed that their meeting had been postponed .
" I can't really shed much more on the situation but it is true that Martha was intending to visit Wedgwood as part of a business trip she was making and , at the moment , we are unsure whether she will be allowed access into the UK , " he said .
He added : " It 's very disappointing and we hope it will be resolved soon . "
Andrew Neil , the former Sunday Times editor , who had been due to have dinner with Ms Stewart in London next week , also confirmed he had been told the celebrity homemaker had been denied an entry visa .
" I 've seen a letter to her saying she is not being allowed in , " he said .
The celebrity was also hoping to film episodes of her television programme , The Martha Stewart Show , in Britain .
A spokesperson for Ms Stewart , who has visited Britain on numerous occasions , said her client hoped to resolve the issue soon .

The FBI briefing slides on the case stated that while there are “ intelligence gaps ” on why the Chinese made the counterfeit equipment it could have been for profit or as part of a state - sponsored operation .
Additionally the scope of the Chinese counterfeit equipment may extend beyond routers to include fake IT equipment such as PCs and printers .
Under a section titled “ The Threat , ” the FBI described the effort as “ IT subversion / supply chain attack ” that could “ cause immediate or premature system failure during usage . ”
The counterfeit equipment also could be used to “ gain access to otherwise secure systems ” and to “ weaken cryptographic systems . ”
The briefing slide said the Chinese information warfare efforts require “ intimate access to target systems . ”

IN November , I was found guilty of “ racial harassment ” for reading a public - library book on a university campus .
The book was Todd Tucker ’s “ Notre Dame vs. the Klan : How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan ” ; I was reading it on break from my campus job as a janitor .
The same book is in the university library .
Tucker recounts events of 1924 , when the loathsome Klan was a dominant force in Indiana – until it went to South Bend to taunt the Irish Catholic students at the University of Notre Dame .
When the KKK tried to rally , the students confronted them .
They stole Klan robes and destroyed their crosses , driving the KKK out of town in a downpour .
I read the historic encounter and imagined myself with these brave Irish Catholics , as they street - fought the Klan .
( I ’m part - Irish , and was raised Catholic . )
But that did n’t stop the Affirmative Action Office of Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis from branding me as a detestable Klansman .
They did n’t want to hear the truth .
The office ruled that my “ repeatedly reading the book . . . constitutes racial harassment in that you demonstrated disdain and insensitivity to your co-workers . ”
A friend reacted to the finding with , “ That ’s impossible ! ”
He ’s right .
You ca n’t commit racial harassment by reading an anti-Klan history .
For months , I felt isolated and dejected .
Yet I knew that most of the faculty , staff and students at Indiana University were good people .
The campus is a growing , thriving part of Indy , where people of all colors and religions come to study .
But the $ 106,000 - a- year affirmative - action officer who declared me guilty of “ racial harassment ” never spoke to me or examined the book .
My own union – the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees – sent an obtuse shop steward to stifle my freedom to read .
He told me , “ You could be fired , ” that reading the book was “ like bringing pornography to work . ”
Shame on the affirmative - action people and my union for displaying their ignorance and incompetence .
Their pusillanimous actions , in trying to ban Tucker ’s anti-Klan history book , played into the hands of the hateful KKK .
After months of stonewalling , the university withdrew the charge , thanks to pressure from the press , the American Civil Liberties Union and a group called the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education , or FIRE .
Let me be clear : I do n’t view this episode as a black - against - white or conservative - vs. - liberal issue .
It ’s a basic civil - liberties issue .
Martin Luther King Jr. wanted a world where people “ will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character . ”
The affirmative - action people at Indiana University never saw past the color of my white skin .
( Ironically , I detest the Klan and I have dated a woman of color . )
Abolitionist Charles Sumner said , “ Prejudice is the child of ignorance .
It is sure to prevail where people do not know each other . ”
The people at the Affirmative Action Office were so myopically intent on finding a Klansman , they failed to see a natural ally standing before them .
The unchecked power of such campus bureaucrats needs to be restrained .
And if a union like AFSCME wo n’t protect its workers ’ constitutional rights , it should go out of business .
If they can stop me from reading one book , then they can stop any American from reading any book .

Security technology : A new scanning technology , which can see things X - rays cannot , could help to beef up the inspection of air freight
AIRLINE passengers might be forgiven for thinking that security inspections are already quite tight enough , thank you .
For accompanied luggage , they probably are .
But accompanied luggage is only a fraction of what aircraft carry around .
The rest is commercial freight , which is harder to examine with the rigour that is applied to passengers ' baggage .
Part of the reason is that when an X - ray machine is faced with a containerful of cargo , the image it produces may be confused by the large number of objects packed inside .
In addition , X - rays are poor at distinguishing between objects of identical shape but different composition .
That is particularly true if the objects are made of material with a low density — as both explosives and drugs are .
Moreover , something hidden in a container that is opaque to X - rays will not be noticed at all .
Of course , other security measures , such as explosive sniffers , can be employed , and often are .
But the most reliable alternative to X - ray scanning , hand - searching everything , is slow and expensive .
The upshot is that contraband is frequently smuggled in cargo and one day a bomb may be , too .
A joint venture just announced by Australia 's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ( CSIRO ) and Nuctech Company , a security - equipment maker based in Beijing , is setting out to improve the situation by combining traditional X - ray scanning with a second scan using neutrons .
In combination , the two techniques should be better at spotting threats than X - rays are alone .
The new system , adapted from mineral - analysis technology , exploits differences in the amount of X - ray and neutron energy absorbed by different types of material .
By combining two sources of data it is easier to understand the nature of an object than if only one is employed .
The container to be examined passes on a conveyor belt into a tunnel shielded by steel and concrete to protect operators from radiation .
The X - rays come from a standard X - ray machine .
The neutrons are generated by bombarding a heavy form of hydrogen , called tritium , with a lighter isotope of the gas , called deuterium .
The resulting collisions create helium atoms and a stream of neutrons .
The X-ray and neutron beams pass across the tunnel through the cargo and are detected on the other side .
The detectors measure how much of each type of radiation got through .
A computer then compares the results with the known absorption properties of different types of materials , to work out what the objects in the container are made from .
It adds this information , suitably colour - coded , to the image .
The whole process takes about a minute , and the scanner can be slotted into existing airport freight - handling systems .
Security personnel can thus detect suspicious objects at a glance , and either clear the container for loading or redirect it for close inspection .
In trials conducted last year at Brisbane Airport , a prototype was able to detect a range of explosives , drugs and other contraband .
The system can also distinguish nuclear materials , such as uranium , from other heavy metals , according to Nick Cutmore , a CSIRO researcher who is leading the project .
And it can spot non-metallic materials , such as drugs and explosives , hidden inside large metal objects that are opaque to X - rays .
The CSIRO and Nuctech plan to conduct trials on the next version of the scanner in Beijing at the end of the year .
If it works there , it will be offered for general sale , and a potential loophole in airport security will thus gradually be closed .
The words " domestic violence " typically invite images of bruised women and children -- and male perpetrators .
But the real picture of domestic violence is n't so clear - cut .
And the solution to family violence is far more complex than our current criminal justice approach can handle .
For about 30 years now , we 've been throwing money and punishment at domestic violence with not enough to show for it .
Estimates are that more than 32 million Americans are affected by domestic violence each year , with many of those in need of help never reporting their abuse .
These are among the important findings of Linda Mills -- attorney , social worker , survivor of a violent relationship , as well as professor and senior vice provost at New York University -- whose new book , " Violent Partners , " tackles the myths of domestic violence and suggests new ways of dealing with the problem .
One of the primary myths -- and the one that meets with the most resistance -- is that only men are violent .
As I point out in my own book , " Save the Males , " women and children indeed suffer the worst injuries and more often die as a result of those injuries .
But women initiate violence as often as men .
Ignoring or downplaying that fact both obscures the real problem of intimate violence and makes solutions less likely .
Yet even people who know better are afraid of speaking up lest they be accused of undermining feminist efforts to help women and children in danger .
Feminism deserves credit for putting domestic violence on the radar back when what happened in a " man 's castle " was considered no one else 's business .
But we now know a great deal more about what happens behind closed doors , and progressive feminists such as Mills are trying to open America 's mind to new ideas and innovative approaches .
According to Mills , studies now confirm that women initiate violence in 24 percent of cases in which the husbands do n't fight back , while men initiate violence in 27 percent of cases in which women do n't fight back .
In the other 49 percent of cases , both partners actively participate in the violence .
What this tells us is that violent partners frequently have a relationship problem that is never addressed under our system of arrest - and - punish .
Moreover , says Mills , a majority of families with violence issues do n't want to shatter the family , as our criminal system often encourages .
They just want the violence to stop .
Yet many states have a " must- arrest " policy if a call to police is made .
Many also take a " primary aggressor " approach in determining who should be arrested .
Even if the man calls the police , says Mills , he 's often the one hauled off and charged , based on the assumption that he , the physically stronger , is more dangerous .
Consequently , the underlying problem of violence is n't addressed and people needing help wo n't call police for fear of the draconian measures likely to follow .
In fact , according to Mills , 75 percent of women and 86 percent of men do n't call the police when their partner is violent .
The solution to domestic violence , says Mills , begins with recognizing it as a cyclical , intergenerational family problem that usually begins in childhood .
Mills provides some devastating statistics to highlight how early this cycle begins and how hard it is to break the trend once begun : 35 percent of parents hit their infants when they believe they 're misbehaving ; 94 percent of parents spank their 3 - to 4 - year - olds for the same reason .
Research shows that children raised by violence are more likely to become violent or be the victim of violence in their own adult relationships -- and so it goes from one generation to the next .
Allowing exceptions for the most violent abusers , Mills proposes a broad , systemic approach to domestic violence that includes counseling and at least the option of restorative , rather than punitive , justice .
The current approach to " treatment " usually consists of sending men to classes on how to be less sexist .
Mills is testing an alternative program in Nogales , Ariz. , that brings the whole family together to learn how the cycle of abuse works within families .
Without blaming the victim , Mills insists that everyone has to take responsibility for his or her role in the dynamic that leads to violence .
It is brave of Mills to invite these challenges .
But if we 're really serious about reducing domestic violence , we have to recognize that demonizing men is n't the answer and that sexism is n't the only question .
It 's at least time for a new conversation .
Susan Sarandon is Photoshop Gorgeous at 61
is an Academy Award winning actress who graces the July cover of Woman & Home .
The 61 year old actress has obviously had some airbrush help for this British magazine .
We 've got a recent photo taken at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival that is in sharp contrast to the gorgeous shot that is displayed above .
The actress continues to make several films a year .
Her latest release was Speed Racer .
Another set to release in 2008 is the romantic comedy Middle of Nowhere .
Her latest is The Lovely Bones , currently in post production and slated for 2009 release .
The Sarandon cover states that the actress believes that ' looking good is about saying yes to life ' .
She has been in a long term relationship with actor Tim Robbins .
The couple have two sons , Jack , 19 , and Miles , 15 .
Check out more photos below .
Twenty - six - year - old Jamila Merhi was forced from her family ’s home in Akbara village near Safad , Palestine in 1948 .
Now , 86 , she lives in the Shatila refugee camp in Beirut , Lebanon and still holds onto a copy of her family ’s deed for their land in Palestine .
( Matthew Cassel )
Official Israel remains in complete denial that the birth it celebrates is inextricably linked with the near destruction of the vibrant Palestinian culture and society that had existed until then .
It ’s not an unfamiliar dilemma for settler states .
The United States , where I live , has found that even the passage of centuries cannot absolve a nation from confronting the crimes committed at its founding .
As the noted Israeli historian and staunch Zionist Benny Morris put it in 2004 , “ a Jewish state would not have come into being without the uprooting of 700,000 Palestinians .
Therefore it was necessary to uproot them . ”
He went on , “ there are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing . ”
But if one is not prepared to openly justify ethnic cleansing , there ’s only two real options : to deny history and take comfort in an airbrushed story that paints Israelis as brave , divinely inspired pioneers in a desert devoid of indigenous people and beset by external enemies , or to own up to the consequences and support the enormous redress needed to bring justice and peace .
Just before Israel ’s founding , Palestinians of all religions made up two thirds of the settled population of historic Palestine , while Jewish immigrants , recently arrived from Europe , made up most of the rest .
Among those uprooted was my mother , then nine years old .
Now living in Amman , she remembers a happy childhood in her native Jerusalem neighborhood of Lifta .
My grandfather owned several buildings and many of his tenants were Jews , including the family who rented the downstairs apartment in their house .
Early in 1948 — before any Arab states ’ armies got involved — she and her entire family , indeed all the inhabitants of several neighboring West Jerusalem areas , were forced out by Zionist militias .
On 7 February that year , Israel ’s founding prime minister , David Ben-Gurion told members of his party , “ From your entry into Jerusalem , through Lifta - Romema , through Mahane Yehuda , through King George Street and Mea Shearim — there are no strangers [ i.e. Arabs ] .
One hundred percent Jews . ”
So it was that the Palestinians became “ strangers ” in the land of their birth .
Since that time millions of refugees and their descendants who lost their homes , farms , groves , livestock , factories , stores , tools , automobiles , bank accounts , art work , insurance policies , furniture and every other possession have lived in exile , many in squalid refugee camps maintained by Israel and Arab states .
Over 80 percent of the Palestinians now besieged and starved in the Gaza Strip are refugees from towns now in Israel .
But what Palestinians could never be forced to part with — and this we do celebrate — is our attachment to our homeland and the determination to see justice done .
Palestinians all over the world are commemorating the start of our ongoing tragedy , but we are also looking forward .
We are at an important turning point , where two things are happening at once .
First , despite ritual declarations of international support , the prospect of a two - state solution has all but disappeared as Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are caged into walled reservations by growing Israeli settlements and settler - only roads — a situation that resembles the bantustans of apartheid South Africa .
Second , despite Israel ’s efforts to keep Palestinians in check , the Palestinian population living under Israeli rule is about to exceed the five million Israeli Jews .
Today there are 3.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , and another 1.5 million Palestinians who are nominally citizens of Israel .
Sometimes called “ Israeli Arabs , ” Palestinians in Israel are increasingly restive about their second class status in a Jewish state that regards them as a hostile fifth column .
While Palestinians in Israel call for equal rights in a state of all its citizens , some Israeli Jewish politicians threaten them with expulsion to the West Bank , Gaza Strip or beyond .
Official projections show that by 2025 , Palestinians , due to their much higher birth rate , will exceed Israeli Jews in the country by two million and though few in the international community have woken up to this reality , a surgical separation between these populations is impossible .
Israeli leaders understand what they are up against ; Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said last November : “ If the day comes when the two - state solution collapses , and we face a South African - style struggle for equal voting rights , then , as soon as that happens , the State of Israel is finished . ”
This struggle has already begun as more and more Palestinians , recognizing that statehood is unrealistic , debate and adopt the one - state solution , offering Israelis and Palestinians equal rights in the land they share .
Last year , I was part of a group of Palestinians , Israelis and others who published the “ One State Declaration . ”
Inspired partly by South Africa ’s Freedom Charter , we set out principles for a common future in a single democratic state .
Most Israelis , unsurprisingly , recoil at comparisons with apartheid South Africa .
The good news for them is that the end of apartheid did not bring about the disaster many feared .
Rather , it was a new dawn for all the people of the country .

It 's always seemed inescapable to me that a conservative reading of the Constitution of the United States , let alone California , would be forced to concede the complete legality , the inalienable right , of gays to marry .
And I 'm so darn happy thinking of Republicans actually making real American decisions that do n't exactly serve their party .
What a damn relief !
Here 's hoping it 'll cease being so rare ....

It 's a good day for all freedom lovin folks , regardless of sexual preferences or orientations .
And THIS Laure offers a hat tip and a big and hearty toast to the LGBT 's for whom this IS such a big occasion .
A win for you , is a win for us all .
Rights are rights .
They take yours , then they take mine .
As said above , eyes wide open , the next attack is soonly forthcoming , no doubt .
In the meantime , joke 'em if they can't take a fuck !

" cap ' i 'tal 'ism ( k'p ' ' - tl - 'z ' 'm ) n .
An economic system in which the means of production and distribution are privately or corporately owned and development is proportionate to the accumulation and reinvestment of profits gained in a free market . " --
The American Heritage Dictionary
" so 'cial 'ism ( s ''sh ' - l 'z ' 'm ) n. 1.a .
A social system in which the means of producing and distributing goods are owned collectively and political power is exercised by the whole community .
b.
The theory or practice of those who support such a social system .
2 . The building of the material base for communism under the dictatorship of the proletariat in Marxist - Leninist theory . " -- Ibid
- 1 -
There are other definitions for " capitalism " and " socialism " than those shown above .
The Encyclopedia Britannica says that socialism is a " system of social organization in which property and the distribution of income are subject to social control rather than individual determination or market forces . "
That is n't quite the same as the American Heritage Dictionary 's definition , and the differences , in practice , could be extreme .
The National Socialist German Workers Party , also known as the Nazi Party , certainly had a different take on the word " socialist " than do most self - proclaimed socialists today , for another example .
Likewise , the word " capitalism " can mean a great many and sometimes contradictory things to different people .
America is often called a capitalist country , but today 's America is more a mix of capitalism , socialism , fascism , and corporatism -- run by a veiled oligarchy and housed in the faded ruins of a democratic republic .
- 2 -
Using the most common definitions , capitalism is a market arrangement , not a political system .
Capitalism is not imposed coercively and is not specifically concerned with human well - being , beyond offering potential returns to those with capital and potential jobs to those with labor to offer .
Risk is handled in the market by insurance , charity , and friends or family .
The political structure can be a democracy , a republic , a monarchy , a dictatorship , or any number of things , as long as the market itself remains somewhat free .
In contrast , socialism is a coercive political system imposed by force ( in terms of high taxation forced upon citizens , like it or not , even if the government is democratically elected ) and explicitly focused , at least in theory , on benefiting the less fortunate by taking from the rich and giving to the poor .
Protecting against risk is the main justification for the whole enterprise ; government safety nets cover every possible contingency from medical need to job loss , from grief counseling to dietary assistance .
Non-coercive , non-State , voluntaryist forms of socialism exist ( e.g. , the commune your sister - in - law joined for a few years after college ) , but this is n't what people typically mean when they say " socialism . "
In theory , capitalism is free - market , materialistic , and coldly Darwinian ; individuals may be rich or poor or anywhere in between , but social and economic mobility are high and even the poorest at least have their freedom .
Socialism is somehow more compassionate despite the high taxes and other coercion and is consciously aimed at creating a good life for all ; extremes of wealth are largely evened out .
In practice , things can be very different for both systems .

This line of thought intruded on my sleep recently in an early - morning musing triggered by a report I 'd read the night before of slavery for the underclass in Dubai .
The problem ranges from " guest workers " lured to the kingdom only to have their passports and visas confiscated and every promise made to them broken , to girls and women kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery , to children enslaved ( and nearly starved to keep their weight down ) for use in local camel races .
Researching the problem gives the sense of a nightmare dystopia for the majority of those living in Dubai , who have almost no rights , no recourse , no power , no money , no hope for improvement , and little or no freedom of action .
Dubai is a shockingly wealthy playground for the rich ( or see CBS video here ) , but gangsters and businessmen and the ruling elite in that country are turning the lives of many thousands into hell -- not to make money , but simply to make more money than they would otherwise be raking in .
Paying market wages ( including providing conditions workers would voluntarily tolerate ) costs money , but not so much that prostitution , construction , and other boom - town work is n't profitable .
Using slaves is not necessary for these businesses to survive and prosper : it is just a way to boost the bottom line .
The government is complicit and , for that matter , Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al - Maktoum , the Big Cheese himself , " has been accused of enslaving thousands of young children for camel races in a class - action lawsuit filed in the US . "
Dubai is often described as a shining example of capitalist success , yet outright slavery is apparently a very real problem in Dubai .
The United States was in a similar position for almost a century after its break from England ; " freedom " was , to some extent , at least in the South , financed by the use of slave labor , and even many of our revered " founding fathers " were slave owners .
Market freedom ( and almost any other freedom ) was denied to slaves in the old American South , just as freedom is denied to the slaves and semi-slaves of modern Dubai .
We all want to think the world has moved beyond such barbaric treatment of the downtrodden , and yet we all know better : slavery , torture , tyranny , and evil of every type are commonplace around the globe -- not everywhere , thank goodness , but in far more places than we want to believe .
Imagine life in a U.S. or Australian SuperMax prison or in Guantanamo , for example .
Imagine life as an Untouchable on the streets of Calcutta or as a refugee in Darfur or as a Falun Gong member being tortured in a Chinese prison camp -- or murdered in such a camp so one 's organs can be harvested and sold .
How could such evil exist in the modern world ?
Why would anyone even consider treating others in such fashion ?

Government socialism , like capitalism , is not always as advertised or hoped for .
This is hardly surprising , given that coercive State power is no different than any other form of coercion -- except that the State is stronger , more pervasive , and harder to resist .
The ultimate expression of coercive State socialism is Communism , and Communism has been a nightmare of tyranny , poverty , and epic mass - murder every time it has been tried .
For supporting data , see the heavily - researched Black Book of Communism : Crimes , Terror , Repression -- written not by " conservatives " but by European Marxist scholars , who were as stunned as anyone by what they found while digging through archives and other material that became available after the fall of the Soviet Union .
The authors went on to research Communism throughout the Twentieth Century and found a consistent pattern of thuggery , mass murder , calculated atrocity , and resulting widespread misery .
The Black Book is hardly the only source for information on the true nature of Communist governments ; consider R. J. Rummel 's Death by Government or his vast website with a claimed 5,000 pages of documentation on not only Communist governments but governments of all types .
Rummel points out that it is power itself , not a particular structure of power , which is the problem , although he believes democratic institutions can restrain the growth and misuse of power -- something I see increasingly disproved in my own nation of the United States .
Socialist nations that already have significant wealth and infrastructure , and which leave enough of the market in place to maintain some wealth - generating capacity , can do well for decades , although wealth erodes as incentives for non-productivity and penalties for being productive change the actions and character of the population .
One sees this even in Sweden and other " enlightened " socialist nations , while in others -- Cuba , Belarus , and North Korea , for example -- the quality of life is simply abysmal .

The determination to create a truly compassionate world -- which is the essence of what people want , at their core , from socialism -- is both healthy and necessary .
Yet use of coercion to create compassion betrays that desire , because coercion itself is cruel and unhealthy .
Coercion is the opposite of compassion ; more of one leads to less of the other .
Ultimately , coercion is destructive of the healthy goals of socialism , which is why State socialism fails to live up to hopes and expectations .
( There are unhealthy goals associated with socialism also -- the goals typically found among those in power , especially -- but that is a topic for another day ) .
The desire for freedom and the understanding of freedom 's importance in creating healthy and prosperous societies -- the foundation for uncorrupted , non-corporatist free - market " capitalist " societies , if we ever have any -- is every bit as important as the desire for compassion and brotherhood .
Love without freedom is a fraud ; freedom without love is also a fraud .
Love and freedom are a duality in human life , and having only one is not an option .
Each of those two qualities depends upon the other .
Love comes from emotional health , which in turn comes from compassionate , loving , and respectful treatment early in life .
Likewise , a willingness to live and let live comes from having our own needs and desires respected in childhood .
Sensitive dependence on early conditions is a powerful human reality -- " As the twig is bent , so grows the tree . "
Genuine freedom and deep emotional health -- two qualities beyond even the imagination of most people presently on this Earth -- will be the only salvation for our kind , assuming we can manage such a feat .
The memes of capitalism and socialism are but faint , unfocused images of the love and freedom we truly want and will need for survival in the coming years .

Yes and no .
If you mean does it hum with its voice like a person , then the answer is no .
But the hummingbird does produce a humming that comes from the rapid movement of its wings in the air .
Even though this bird is the smallest in the world , it can move its wings so fast that the movement cannot be detected by the human eye .
So the hummingbird actually appears to be standing still as it hovers in the air above a flower .
A hummingbird beats , or flaps , its wings up to 70 times a second , or over 4,000 times a minute !
What an intelligent man , I 'm on my way to look for more of his work .
Wish me well .
But Mr. Castro ’s early tinkering has already laid bare an uncomfortable , and potentially destabilizing , reality in a country that for 50 years has been run as one of the world ’s most rigid socialist systems : that some Cubans are far better off than others , whether because of remittances from relatives abroad , ties to the ruling class or unauthorized money - making ventures on the side .
Image Cubans in Havana recently bought DVD players , among newly available appliances .
Credit ... Jose Goitia for The New York Times
For now , his government seems willing to accept those disparities , tolerating the notion of class differences while continuing to cling to a Cuban vision of socialism that includes food subsidies , free education and health care for all , Mr. Castro ’s backers in the government say .
Whether that approach will satisfy Cubans , who are quickly becoming more aware of their relative consumer deprivation , is another question .
A rice maker alone costs more than three times the average monthly state salary here .
Conversations on the street , away from the lines of people buying what is newly available to them , reveal discontent .
Javier , a 25 - year - old computer programmer , has made up his mind to leave Cuba for California as soon as he can .
“ Come on , these changes are only in favor of a very tiny part of the population , ” he said , sitting along a coastal wall and staring into the ocean .
“ We , who get up early in the morning to get the bus , we , who have sacrificed ourselves , we ca n’t afford all this , ” he added .
“ I ’d love to go to a fancy hotel with my girlfriend for a night or two .
But , hey , I simply can’t .
I could n’t afford it , even in my dreams . ”
Even for those who can , it is a journey into another world that was all but off limits just weeks ago .
The other day , a young woman struggled for 20 minutes to get into a Havana hotel room , jamming her key card in the slot haphazardly and shoving the door with all her might .
She could be excused , though , since it was her first time using such a contraption .
In her case , her foreign boyfriend paid the $ 175 - a - night bill .
“ Different classes have always existed but they are more visible now , ” explained María Ileana Faguaga , a Havana - based anthropologist who specializes in Cuba ’s struggling black population .
“ Now you just look at who has a cellphone . ”
A taxi driver barreling along the seaside Malecón , who like most Cuban workers is paid by the state , pulled out a Nokia from his pocket this week .
“ This one has a camera and Bluetooth , ” he said , boasting that he was one of the first in line when Mr. Castro recently ended the restrictions .
A major climate - change measure goes before the Senate this week for the first time since Democrats declared it a priority after taking control of Congress , but the long - awaited debate is ranging beyond the effects of global warming .
It also is focusing on Washington ’s most primal issue , money .
The bill would impose new pollution regulations on industries while significantly expanding another business , carbon “ offsetting . ”
Billions of dollars would potentially be available for farmers who offered polluters a way to make amends for excess emissions -- a provision that could attract crucial support from farm - state lawmakers .
“ I definitely think this debate will be primarily about economics , because there are very few voices left who want to argue about whether or not global warming is really a problem , ” said Dan Lashof , director of the Natural Resources Defense Council climate center , a bill supporter .

Given the financial stakes , agricultural interests from Georgia pecan growers to Montana wheat growers are among those weighing in as lobbyists fortify their positions .
“ The global warming fight is not only a battle over big pollution -- it ’s a battle over big bucks , ” said Frank O’Donnell of Clean Air Watch .
The shift in the focus of the debate reflects two changes :
The sense of urgency about climate change has grown , and businesses are more open to federal rules in order to avert future uncertainties .
A longshot , but odds rise

The bill , sponsored by Sens. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) and John W. Warner ( R - Va. ) , seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 66 % below 2005 levels by midcentury .
Companies that cut gases even more than that could sell pollution rights to those having difficulty meeting caps .
Although the odds of passing such legislation climbed when Democrats won control of Congress in 2006 , President Bush opposes mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions .
The Senate measure is considered a longshot for passage this year .
Bill supporters say that even if they can’t reach the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster , amassing majority support would provide momentum for next year .
( In 2003 , 43 senators voted in favor of an emissions cap , not enough for passage . )
All three major presidential candidates -- Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois -- support mandatory reductions , and the bill is expected to form the framework for action when a new administration takes over .
Advertisement
Backers and opponents have been turning up the heat .
If the U.S. imposes emissions caps when big polluters like China and India have not , critics contend , the American economy will be devastated , with more jobs heading overseas and energy prices rising further , especially in states that rely on coal power .
Lashof and other supporters counter that there is also “ the cost of failing to address global warming . ”
Senate Environmental Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) , who will lead the fight for the bill , sought Saturday to rally public support .
Advertisement
“ There are some in the Senate who insist that global warming is nothing more than science fiction , ” she said in the Democrats ’ radio address .
“ These are the same kind of voices who said that the world was flat , cigarettes were safe , cars did n’t need air bags -- long after the rest of us knew the truth . ”
Cultivating farmers ’ help
Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) said sponsors were trying to “ buy -- excuse me , win -- the support of groups all across this country . ”
“ We should win support based on it being good policy , ” he said .
“ Instead , the authors of this bill have tried to win support by spreading money around . ”
Advertisement
For example :
The auto industry would receive aid so it could build cleaner - burning engines , the coal industry to develop emissions - reducing technology .
For farmers , the bill offers a new opportunity to make money .
After taking steps to keep carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere -- practicing no - till farming , for example , or planting trees on crop land -- they could sell so - called carbon offsets to polluters .
Sponsors hope those provisions will attract farm - state votes , much as an ethanol mandate generated pivotal Corn Belt support for 2005 energy legislation .
“ We see the enthusiastic support of the ag community as being a critical element in piecing together the 60 votes we need , ” said energy lobbyist Eric Washburn , a former Senate aide .
Advertisement
Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) said offsets were one reason he was now supporting the legislation , which would give Montana farmers “ a chance to be part of the climate - change solution . ”
He previously opposed emissions caps .
Businesses can already buy carbon offsets , but Washburn said mandatory reductions would “ immensely ” expand the number of industries involved .
In a sign of farmers ’ interest in offsets , Sen. Richard G. Lugar ( R - Ind . ) himself registered as an offset provider on the Chicago Climate Exchange after planting more trees on his own farm .
Farm groups are concerned that bill revisions will limit offset opportunities , and are working on proposed changes .
Advertisement
But environmental groups are concerned about overemphasizing offsets .
Erich Pica , domestic policy director for Friends of the Earth , said offsets give companies a “ cheap out ” for polluting .
Lashof agreed : “ Unlimited use of offsets would delay investments that are needed to clean up the primary sources of global warming pollution . ”
And Daniel J. Weiss , senior fellow and director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress , said , “ We must be sure that companies that buy offsets to avoid their own emissions reductions are not paying for something that would have happened anyway . ”
Advertisement
Boxer , meanwhile , has been working to find ways to round up votes .
Among her ideas : billions of dollars for tax relief to help consumers with any increase in energy bills resulting from the regulations .
“ That is what I knew I had to do to build support for the bill , ” she said in an interview .
“ Now , we may not be there yet .
But this is a landmark piece of legislation , and we need to take it as far as we can . ”

ソフトウェアアーキテクトであ るGustavo Duarte氏 ( source ) が、物理学 者Richard Feynman氏によるスペースシャトル・チャレンジャーの爆発事故に関する調査結果について、優れたソフトウェアの工学的側面との関連を論じたところ(source)、そのことが物議をかもした( source ) 。
エンジニアリングはマネジメントと協力しないと機能しない。
前払いの大規模な設計をするのは愚かだ。
ソフトウェアは他の工学分野とたくさんの共通点がある。
信頼できるシステムを構築するには、「最高の品質を、という姿勢」でなされた厳しいテストとインクリメンタルでボトムアップのエンジニアリングが必要である。
続けて書いた記事で 、Gustavo氏は 「 現実駆動開 発 ( source ) 」の考えを紹介して、経験的証拠の考え方について詳しく述べている。
この考え方( 進化論から出てきた考え方 )
は、適者生存の考え方を取り入れている。要するに、なにか試してみて、うまくいったらば残し、そうでなければ捨て去る。Gustavo氏はこう説明する。
よいソフトウェア開発プロセスは実験を最大限に活用し、現実からのフィードバックに磨きをかけるべきです。これが現実駆動開発の意図するところです。そして、ソフトウェアにとってもっとも重要な現実とはユーザ体験と技術的な品質です。しかし一方で、主な実験はソフトウェアとコードを動作させることです。これは「形式モデル(笑)」ではありません。ソフトウェア開発について私が好んで使う単なる例え話です。私は、「現実駆動」という名前を気に入っています。なぜなら、現実について話すときは、ユーザーのことが頭に浮かぶからです。
このアイデアはアジャイルの中心的な主張や技術のうちいくつかと相通じるところがある。しかしながら、Gustavo氏は(ありがたいことに)新しい方法論を主張しているわけではない。
gustavo氏のやり方はユーザと品質に重きを置いている。
このモデルに基づくと、私たちが関心のある2つの現実は、ユーザ体験(ソフトウェアの実用性を含む)と技術的な品質です。ユーザ体験はアジャイルかウォータフォールかに関係なく、軽視されがちです。
Gustavo氏はボトムアップのやり方を改良する話で締めくくります。
分析よりも実験を好んでください(両者ともそれぞれにいいところがあるのは分かっています ) 。
実験を最大限に活用してください。できるだけ早い時期に、手早く、お金をかけずに、大まかに作ってみるのです。ここで分析が役に立ちます。
精力的に実験してください。 現実(ユーザ体験と技術的な品質)を評価することについて賢く前向きであってください。
フィードバックに反応してください。そして、現実によって駆動してください。

OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - Building more and smaller ethanol plants could help overcome concerns that production of the biofuel consumes more in energy than it provides , Canadian Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said on Friday .

Moczulski
One of the reasons so much energy is used to make ethanol is that trucks travel long distances carrying corn , chaff or other plant material to ethanol plants .
“ Smaller and locally owned I think are the right way to go , ” Ritz said as he kicked off debate in the House of Commons on the final stage of a bill that would ensure that gasoline contains 5 percent ethanol by 2010 .
Dennis Bevington of the opposition New Democratic Party said one study showed that ethanol made from Canadian corn would lead to a net reduction of only 21 percent in greenhouse gases compared with the use of gasoline .
If the corn actually had to be imported from the United States to make ethanol , it would actually lead to a net increase in emissions of the greenhouse gases blamed for climate change .
The Conservative government is proceeding with plans to mandate more ethanol use despite questions that have been raised both about ethanol ’s efficiency and about whether it would contribute to rising food costs .
The opposition Liberals and Bloc Quebecois both voted in favor of the government legislation at an intermediate stage on Thursday , leaving the smaller New Democratic Party as the only opponent .
Ritz said farmers were able to increase food production at the same time as boosting ethanol output .
“ Due to the innovation and industriousness of Canadian agriculture and Canadian forestry , we have the capacity to do this and in no way affect our food lines , ” he said .
“ A lot of people say we can not do both .
They say we cannot grow food for energy and for consumption .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Anyone who has analyzed food production in this country knows that we are growing more , that it is better quality , and that it is safer . ”
He also said there were many factors behind higher food prices unrelated to the production of biofuels .
Among them is the increased meat consumption by emerging middle classes in India and China , Ritz said .
The government ’s biofuel bill faces one more vote in the House .
It will then move to the Senate , dominated by the Liberal Party , which has lent its support to the measure .
In addition to ethanol in gasoline , the bill will also provide for diesel to contain 2 percent renewable fuels by 2012 .

Economics reporter , BBC News
Doug Holtz - Eakin is ex-director of the Congressional Budget Office John McCain 's top economic adviser has attacked Congressional Republicans , saying they have brought " shame and disgrace " on the party .
In a BBC interview , Doug Holtz - Eakin accused them of busting the budget with profligate spending programmes .
The comments are part of a strategy by Senator McCain 's camp to distance themselves from the Republicans and avoid blame for the economic downturn .
Mr McCain will stick to his principles even if it costs him votes , he said .
Straight - talking
The US economy is in freefall , facing the sharpest housing slump on record and rising unemployment and prices .
And with economic conditions continuing to deteriorate , it is likely to dominate the US presidential election in November .
The Democrats are widely perceived to have a huge advantage on the economy .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Senator Obama has already begun campaigning on the issue , accusing Senator McCain of offering no hope for millions of people who fear losing their homes , their jobs and their health care .
Mr Holtz - Eakin said that in the end , voters would trust Mr McCain more on the economy because of his straight talking to the public on issues like free trade and social security reform .
In the battle for the middle ground of American voters , Mr McCain 's camp is doing its best to distance itself both from the Republicans in Congress and from Mr Bush 's economic policies .
Economic issues dominate
With the vast majority of the public believing that the US is in recession , it does not seem to be a good year to be a Republican running for office .
Mr McCain 's straight talking to American workers was controversial
In the last national opinion poll , carried out by ABC News and the Washington Post last week , only 29 % approved of the way Mr Bush was handling the job as president , while 84 % of voters think the country is going in the wrong direction .
The economy is considered the most important issue by 33 % of voters , and it has stayed the top issue since the beginning of the year .
And 50 % of the public trust Mr Obama more to handle the economy , as opposed to just 36 % who trust Mr McCain .
Even more back Mr Obama on health care , gas prices , and the environment .
Free trade battle But Mr Holtz - Eakin believes that Senator McCain 's support for free trade and globalisation could actually gain him votes , because of the disarray in the Obama camp over this issue .
He accused Mr Obama of flip - flopping on this issue , and said that it was " better to have a view and stick to it than change your view every time you show up at a new location " .

However , free trade is not that popular among the American public .
When Mr McCain told car workers in Michigan they would have to retrain because there were not going to be any jobs left in the car industry , he lost the primary .
Social security fears Senator McCain has also taken a controversial position on reforming the US government pension system , known as social security .
US workers depend on government - funded social security in retirement
It is facing a potential financial crisis as the large number of baby - boomers start retiring around 2015 , and is predicted to run out of money within a generation .
Doug Holtz - Eakin refused to be drawn on the details of how Senator McCain would reform social security , but he did accept that his plan would bear some resemblance to Mr Bush 's proposal to partially privatise social security by allowing people to put some of their social security taxes into special private investment accounts .
This proposal was soundly defeated when it was proposed by Mr Bush , and any such talk is bound to mobilise the millions of members of the strongest lobby group in the US , the AARP , which represents retired people .
Tax and spending cuts Mr McCain has also done a U - turn on tax cuts , moving from criticising the first set of tax cuts introduced by Mr Bush in 2001 for not helping the poor , to endorsing further tax cuts for small businesses in the future in an attempt to preserve jobs .
Mr Obama is campaigning hard on the economy But " any tax cuts need stringent fiscal controls " , says Mr Holtz - Eakin .
And that implies pretty swingeing cuts in Federal government spending .
He said that a McCain administration would aim to balance the budget in his first four years in office , by reducing government spending by 1.5 % to 2 % of GDP .
That cut would amount to nearly $ 200 bn - equivalent to a substantial chunk of the whole of the Federal discretionary budget , excluding social security and defence .
Gas prices at the pump Mr McCain does have one populist measure he has proposed however - a temporary suspension of the 18 cents per gallon federal gasoline tax , to help drivers and truckers over the summer to cope with the " increasing distressed economic conditions " .
Drivers across the US are facing higher gasoline bills
And gas prices have a mythical significance in American political life , as the queues at petrol stations and high prices during the 1980 election campaign are widely believed to have led to the defeat of President Jimmy Carter and the election of Ronald Reagan .
But on the broader state for the economy , it is perhaps another famous question by Mr Reagan during the debate with Mr Carter - " Are you better off now that you were four years ago ? " - that was more decisive .
With the US economy in freefall , few voters will be able to answer this question in the affirmative .
The issue for Mr McCain is whether he will be tarred with the same brush as the Republican administration for the economic hardships that are likely to intensify by the time of the election in November .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Holtz - Eakin , however , said that the key question should be forward looking rather than backward looking .
" Who do you believe will make you better off in four years ' time , " he said .
" The government does n't create jobs .
Only the private sector does . "
Uniquely among most Western countries , America tends to mistrust its government and believe it is more likely to be part of the problem , rather than part of the solution , to the country 's economic problems .
So Mr McCain 's appeal to rely on the private sector to get the US out of recession could just fall on fertile ground .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush and his top policymakers misstated Saddam Hussein ’s links to terrorism and ignored doubts among intelligence agencies about Iraq ’s arms programs as they made a case for war , the Senate intelligence committee reported on Thursday .
President George W. Bush speaks about the benefits of his 2003 tax relief act in Washington June 2 , 2008 .

The report shows an administration that “ led the nation to war on false premises , ” said the committee ’s Democratic Chairman , Sen. John Rockefeller of West Virginia .
Several Republicans on the committee protested its findings as a “ partisan exercise . ”
The committee studied major speeches by Bush , Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials in advance of the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , and compared key assertions with intelligence available at the time .
Statements that Iraq had a partnership with al Qaeda were wrong and unsupported by intelligence , the report said .
It said that Bush ’s and Cheney ’s assertions that Saddam was prepared to arm terrorist groups with weapons of mass destruction for attacks on the United States contradicted available intelligence .
Such assertions had a strong resonance with a U.S. public , still reeling after al Qaeda ’s September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the United States .
Polls showed that many Americans believed Iraq played a role in the attacks , even long after Bush acknowledged in September 2003 that there was no evidence Saddam was involved .
The report also said administration prewar statements on Iraq ’s weapons programs were backed up in most cases by available U.S. intelligence , but officials failed to reflect internal debate over those findings , which proved wrong .
PUBLIC CAMPAIGN
The long - delayed Senate study supported previous reports and findings that the administration ’s main cases for war -- that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and was spreading them to terrorists -- were inaccurate and deeply flawed .
“ The president and his advisors undertook a relentless public campaign in the aftermath of the ( September 11 ) attacks to use the war against al Qaeda as a justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein , ” Rockefeller said in written commentary on the report .
“ Representing to the American people that the two had an operational partnership and posed a single , indistinguishable threat was fundamentally misleading and led the nation to war on false premises . ”
A statement to Congress by then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld that the Iraqi government hid weapons of mass destruction in facilities underground was not backed up by intelligence information , the report said .
Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said Rumsfeld ’s comments should be investigated further , but he stopped short of urging a criminal probe .
The committee voted 10 - 5 to approve the report , with two Republican lawmakers supporting it .
Sen. Christopher Bond of Missouri and three other Republican panel members denounced the study in an attached dissent .
“ The committee finds itself once again consumed with political gamesmanship , ” the Republicans said .
The effort to produce the report “ has indeed resulted in a partisan exercise . ”
They said , however , that the report demonstrated that Bush administration statements were backed by intelligence and “ it was the intelligence that was faulty . ”
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said : “ We had the intelligence that we had , fully vetted , but it was wrong .
We certainly regret that and we ’ve taken measures to fix it . ”
PUBLIC SUPPORT
U.S. public opinion on the war , supportive at first , has soured , contributing to a dive in Bush ’s popularity .
The conflict is likely to be a key issue in the November presidential election between Republican John McCain , who supports the war , and Democrat Barack Obama , who opposed the war from the start and says he would aim to pull U.S. troops out within 16 months of taking office in January 2009 .
Rockefeller has announced his support for Obama .
The administration ’s record in making its case for Iraq has also been cited by critics of Bush ’s get - tough policy on Iran .
They accuse Bush of overstating the potential threat of Iran ’s nuclear program in order to justify the possible use of force .
A second report by the committee faulted the administration ’s handling of December 2001 Rome meetings between defense officials and Iranian informants , which dealt with the Iran issue .
It said department officials failed to share intelligence from the meeting , which Rockefeller said demonstrated a “ fundamental disdain ” for other intelligence agencies .

The man is dirty .
Yeah , we get it , all you mainstream media types think he ’s “ nice . ”
Well , that ’s nice , but it ’s kind of irrelevant to you doing your job .
The man has a history of being crooked , and that history keeps growing , first with his campaign finance law - breaking , then with the funny business with that lobbyist who looks an awful like a younger version of his wife , and now this .
And let ’s not forget the Keating Five – hardly a youthful indiscretion – McCain was already in his 50s at that time .
At least the Washington Post gets it ( as has the Times in the past ) :
Sen .
John McCain championed legislation that will let an Arizona rancher trade remote grassland and ponderosa pine forest here for acres of valuable federally owned property that is ready for development , a land swap that now stands to directly benefit one of his top presidential campaign fundraisers .
Initially reluctant to support the swap , the Arizona Republican became a key figure in pushing the deal through Congress after the rancher and his partners hired lobbyists that included McCain ’s 1992 Senate campaign manager , two of his former Senate staff members ( one of whom has returned as his chief of staff ) , and an Arizona insider who was a major McCain donor and is now bundling campaign checks .
More rumors of war with Iran are circulating here ( via Juan Cole ) , with inside scuttlebutt from inside the neoconservative network :
" They [ the source ’s institution ] have instructions ’ ( yes , that was the word used ) from the Office of the Vice - President to roll out a campaign for war with Iran in the week after Labor Day ; it will be coordinated with the American Enterprise Institute , the Wall Street Journal , the Weekly Standard , Commentary , Fox , and the usual suspects .
It will be heavy sustained assault on the airwaves , designed to knock public sentiment into a position from which a war can be maintained .
Evidently they do n’t think they ’ll ever get majority support for this  they want something like 35 - 40 percent support , which in their book is plenty . "
This comes via Barnett R. Rubin , Director of Studies and Senior Fellow at New York University ’s Center on International Cooperation , and a leading expert on Afghanistan , who has it from " a friend who has excellent connections in Washington and whose information has often been prescient . "
According to Rubin ’s anonymous sibyl  or is that seer ?
 we can look forward to " a big kickoff on September 11 . "
This pretty much comports with what we ’ve been reporting on Antiwar.com for the past few months , and with recent reports of an imminent US assault on Iran : see my last column on this subject .
So have a nice vacation , soak up as much sun as you can , because dark days lie ahead .
The propaganda campaign is already picking up , but this time the battle is going to be less one - sided .
In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq , the War Party had the field practically to themselves .
Not a single major politician or political figure rose to question the " patriotic " lies that flooded the airwaves and inundated readers of newspapers and blogs  not a one .
This time , however , it is going to be different : the War Party may win , in the end , but they wo n’t triumph without a fight .
It ’s true that none of the major Democratic presidential candidates have dissented from the " approved " script on Iran , and that all are kowtowing long and low to the Israel lobby , which is the powerhouse behind this latest rush to war .
It is also true that  naturally  the major Republican presidential candidates are even more vehemently calling for an attack  and they wo n’t rule out using nukes .
The only sane Republican in the lot 
Ron Paul , of course  is plainly horrified by this , but the Republicans ’ willingness to contemplate a nuclear Armageddon in the Middle East is hardly surprising , coming from a party effectively in the grip of deranged " born - again " dispensationalists  for whom rumors of nuclear war are part and parcel of the " good news " that Christ is returning .
It has been widely noted that the Republicans have become a party of authoritarians , but it ’s much worse than that : they ’ve morphed into a party of lunatics , as well .
The Democrats , however , are n’t taking advantage of this : indeed , Hillary Clinton , her party ’s leading candidate for the presidential nod , refuses to rule out using nukes in any situation  even when it comes to Pakistan , and , for god ’s sake , Afghanistan .
The Lobby is just as firmly ensconced in the supposedly " antiwar " party as it is in the GOP , as the stripping of a provision from the recent defense appropriations bill that would have required the President to come to Congress for authorization for a strike on Iran made all too clear .
The war whoops are scheduled to reach a crescendo on September 11 , at which point I expect the War Party to roll out a new narrative that portrays Iran as the protector and enabler of al - Qaeda , or even the real author of the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
Perhaps they ’ll run the complete works of Laurie Mylroie through a word processor , and , in true Orwellian fashion , insert Ahmadinejad ’s name where Saddam ’s once appeared , replacing " Iraq " with " Iran . "
Presto , change -o!  and we have yet another war myth , a fresh load of prefabricated propaganda with which to bamboozle the masses , befuddle the media , and defuse dissent in the leadership of the major political parties .
The media , and the political leadership wo n’t give them too many problems , although a few dissidents may protest loudly enough to provoke retaliation ( a smear job , perhaps a firing or three , and the sudden loss of campaign funding in the case of candidates for office ) : but , really , not a whole lot of discipline will be required to yank the elites into line .
The real problem for the neocons is going to come with the supposedly indifferent and ignorant antiwar majority , which is firmly opposed [ . pdf ] to attacking Iran .
Say all you want about the advanced state of decadent torpor that seems to define the 21st century American , but ordinary citizens are unlikely to sit idly by while the price of gas skyrockets and the Middle East goes up in flames .
It is hard to say what form public outrage will take , but one can easily imagine the return of the kind of domestic unrest that roiled the 1960s and almost tore this nation apart .
Massive demonstrations that turn into major riots : the unleashing of the vast spying - and - repression machine created with the passage of the PATRIOT Act , the Military Commissions Act [ .pdf ] , and all the post - 9/11 legislation that limited our rights in the name of " security " and the " war on terrorism "  and worse .
Much worse
The War Party is playing for keeps .
Are we ?
There is one hope , and one hope only , that could save us , albeit it ’s only a stop - gap measure , and that is the passage by a veto - proof margin of a congressional resolution explicitly forbidding the President from launching an attack on Iran without a vote by the people ’s representatives .
As noted above , this was present in the defense appropriations bill as approved by the Democratic leadership but deleted from the final bill at the insistence of AIPAC  the primary instrument of Israeli influence in Washington  and with the complicity of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
In the Senate , Democrat Jim Webb introduced a separate resolution 
Senate bill 759  at the beginning of the year that would have established the same let ’s - vote - on - it requirement for an attack on Iran , but that seems to have gone nowhere .
House Resolution 3119 , introduced in the House by Rep. Mark Udall ( D - CO ) on July 19 of this year , is virtually identical , and is similarly stuck in committee .
Speaker Pelosi , who faces increasing discontent within Democratic ranks over the Iraq issue , could easily rescue it , but presently shows no inclination to do so .
The strategic conundrum the antiwar forces face is underscored by the current campaign of a group called " Americans Against Escalation , " which is running television ads exclusively in Republican - held congressional districts taking legislators to task for their support of the Iraq war  as the administration gets ready to bomb Tehran with very little interference from the Democrats .
Yet war with Iran would be the most extreme escalation imaginable  so why the silence from " Americans Against Escalation " ?
Sustained public pressure to move the Webb - Udall legislation forward could slow down , if not entirely stop , the rush to war with Iran  but we do n’t have much time for the antiwar movement to get its act together .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
So , what about those alleged Iranian nukes that are supposedly being prepared by the New Saddam , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ?
Well , if you read the headlines , you get two entirely different stories  the International Herald Tribune reports " Iran expanding its atom program , UN agency reports , " which takes three paragraph to blurt out the truth , or at least an approximation of it :
" More than 650 more centrifuges are being tested or are under construction .
That number is far short of Iran ’s projection that by now it would be running 3,000 of the machines , which produce fuel useful either to make electricity or in a bomb program , raising questions whether Iran is facing technical difficulties or has made a political decision to slow down its expansion effort . "
So , the story encapsulated in the headline is the exact opposite of the real story : the Iranian nuclear program is contracting , not expanding , and furthermore Tehran has agreed to a timetable for making their entire program transparent , and bringing it within the parameters established by the IAEA .
As Reuters put it : " Iran atom work at slow pace and not significant : IAEA . "
Before the conflict takes shape on the ground in Iran and environs , the battle of competing narratives will be fought here in the States , and Antiwar.com is on the front lines .
This is , first and foremost , an information war , and the winner will get to determine the fate of the Middle East  and the US  for many years to come .
That ’s why Antiwar.com is playing a key role in the fight against this latest lunacy  perhaps the key role .
And that ’s why your continued support is so important .
We ’re thrilled that our last fundraising campaign was a success , but with these latest war moves against Iran we realize that Antiwar.com needs to expand its operations , and its coverage : we must to make an all - out effort to stop this new war before it starts .
Wo n’t you help ?
If you contributed to our summer fundraising drive , then you might want to consider signing up to make a monthly contribution .
Our Sustainers ’ program is the core of our support : it means we can count on a certain income in the months to come .
That gives us vital breathing space to plan a strategy in line with our resources .
It ’s really the best way to contribute to Antiwar.com , and these kinds of donations are needed now more than ever .
You can help avert war with Iran in two vitally important ways  call your congressional representatives after the Labor Day holiday in support of the Udall - Webb resolutions , and continue to support Antiwar.com with your tax - deductible donation .
It ’s a twofer for peace .
In the back of the latest Newsweek there ’s a Q&A with Patrick Stewart who is doing The Scottish Play on Broadway soon ( or now ) .
Mostly Newsweek Q&As are boring and stupid because whoever is asking the Qs ( for this one it ’s Nicki Gostin ) is a really bad interviewer , for one , and is also insipid and dull .
Generally the result is that the interviewees give boring , dull answers themselves , but Patrick decided to liven things up .
The funny :
Q : Did you ever get sick of the jumpsuit on “ Star Trek ” ?
A : Sick of it ?
I came to loathe it .
We actually got rid of it after the second season thanks to my chiropractor , who said if they do n’t take you out of that costume we are going to slap a lawsuit on paramount for the lasting damage done to your spine .
Q : How does a jumpsuit damage your spine ?
A : They were made from Lycra and one size too small .
The producers wanted to have a smooth , unwrinkled look .
It put a terrible amount of strain on the shoulders , neck , and back .
HAHAHAHAHA
What the hell !
Lycra and one size too small ?
This is almost as bad as trying to pretend those things did n’t have zippers .
Oh Paramount , you never cease to astound me with your dumb .
Now the pwning :
Q : When you ’re onstage , are n’t you worried about weird Trekkie fans in the audience ?
A : Oh , come on , that ’s just a silly thing to say .
Q : But they are weird .
A : How many do you know personally ?
You could n’t be more wrong .
Here ’s the thing : if you say the fans are weird , that means there ’s something essentially weird about the show , and there is nothing weird about it .
I ’m very passionate when people like you snigger .
Game .
Set. Match .
Thank you , Patrick Stewart .
I did n’t think I could respect you any more but you blew the ceiling off respect and built a superdome .
Also : fuck you , Newsweek ( and Nicki Gostin ) .
( p.s. check out the comments at the link . )
ETA : Nicki got a bit fed up with the commentary , so provided her own :
Nikki Gostin here .
Having read all of your comments regarding my interview with Patrick Stewart , all I can say is this :
Get a life , people .
If you do n’t like my calling you weird , then stop acting weird .
I ’ve yet to meet a single Star Trek fan who was n’t incredibly strange and obsessive , and I stand by my characterizatoin [ sic ] .
Mr Stewart will always be Picard in my eyes , and in most people ’s eyes , and so that was what I chose to focus on .
I have years of experience as a journalist , and those of you taking me to task for how I chose to conduct myself in this particular interview are just jealous because I got to meet your god and you did n’t .
If you think I ’m at all insulted by any of your words , then you ’re even weirder than I originally thought .
There is nothing a flabby freak in an ill - fitting poiyester [ sic ] costume and pointy rubber ears could possibly say that would ever have any affect on me other than to make me laugh hysterically .
I ca n’t believe you all took the time to write such nerdy and embarrassing responses to what was never intended to be more than a fluff piece .
I ’m a fluff writer .
This is a fluff magazine .
Hence , it ’s a fluff piece–and the fact that none of you recognize this says far more about all of you than it says about me .
And the reason my editor never responded to your e-mails is that you do n’t rate .
Accept it and move on , because I ’m still here at Newsweek , and you ’re still in your parents ’ basements , wearing space pajamas .
Peace out .
What a silly idiot she is .
Unprofessional , too .
Seriously , she ’s calling other people out for their behavior when she ’s responding like a 12 year old ?
Pfft .
What an ass .
( Thanks for the tip and emphasis , Rose ! )
Not content with trying to bring peace to the Middle East - as well as advising an insurance company on the risks of climate change , a bank on crisis management and Rwanda on good governance - Tony Blair is to add another job to his portfolio : teaching God and politics at one of America 's most prestigious universities .
Yale , the Ivy League alma mater of his good friend George Bush , confirmed yesterday that the former prime minister is to join the schools of management and divinity at the campus in New Haven , Connecticut , in the autumn .
He will teach a course on faith and globalisation , looking at religion in the modern world .
This will also be the theme of his Faith Foundation , which he is to launch in London before his Yale commitment starts .
It is intended to promote understanding between Christianity , Judaism and Islam .
The deans of Yale 's management and divinity schools are discussing with Blair how much time he will spend on campus .
A spokesman for Blair insisted yesterday that his position would not require him to spend extended periods in Connecticut .
But even before yesterday 's announcement , his aides were expressing concern about his workload next year .
Blair is in the US this week and met Bush on Tuesday ; he is due to return to the UK early next week .
He will combine his academic role with his duties as a special envoy for the Quartet , an international body committed to peace in the Middle East , which represents the UN , the US , the EU and Russia .
That job of shuttling between London , New York and Jerusalem demands his attention for 10 days a month .
He will also have to fit into his schedule his advisory role with Zurich Financial Services Group Insurance , for which he is said to be paid £ 50,000 a month , his unpaid job as adviser to the Rwandan government , and worldwide speaking engagements arranged by Washington Speakers Bureau Inc .
Then , of course there is his part - time advisory role to bankers JP Morgan , said to be worth somewhere between £ 500,000 and £ 2.5 m a year , for which he works no set number of days but is at the beck and call of company executives .
When still in Downing Street , Blair devoted time to pondering his future , given his relative youth .
He liked the model established by Bill Clinton in setting up the Clinton Foundation , which raises millions for international development ; Blair 's Faith Foundation is partly based on that idea .
The academic world was always a strong draw .
In 2006 , Blair and his then chief of staff , Jonathan Powell , sounded out the London School of Economics about setting up a school of government , but backed off after news leaked out and he encountered resistance from staff and students because of his role in the Iraq war .
Blair remains a controversial figure , and , reflecting this sensitivity , Yale had not been planning to announce the post until later this year .
It rushed out a press release after being contacted by the Guardian to confirm he was to be given tenure .
In the release , Richard Levin , president of Yale , said : " The appointment of Mr Blair provides a tremendous opportunity for our students and our community .
As the world continues to become increasingly inter-dependent , it is essential that we explore how religious values can be channelled toward reconciliation rather than polarisation . "
But the appointment will raise many eyebrows .
Blair 's decision to teach religion as well as politics highlights how important Christianity is in his life .
He became interested at university and then , as a Labour frontbencher , contributed to a book on socialism and Christianity .
In the run-up to the 1997 general election and during his premiership , he played down his beliefs after being advised that it could be a turn - off for non-religious voters .
His interest in religions never abated , and in the aftermath of 9/11 he read the Qur'an .
He converted to Catholicism this year .
His son , Euan , has been at Yale since 2006 , taking a master 's degree in international relations .
The two may not overlap , as he is due to graduate this summer .
Blair 's search may not end with Yale .
Speculation about him seeking the presidency of Europe has yet to abate .
Political afterlife
June 2007 Appointed Middle East envoy on behalf of the Quartet , which is made up of the EU , UN , US and Russia
November 2007 Hired by Washington Speakers Bureau Inc for worldwide speaking tour .
Blair reportedly received £ 300,000 in the first week of his tour of North America but was panned by the Chinese media after allegedly being paid £ 237,000 for a speech in Guangdong that revealed " nothing new "
January 2008 Retained by JP Morgan Chase &
Co as part - time adviser ; unlikely to be given an office , but will be on call when needed
January 2008
Advisory role on climate change and international politics to the Swiss insurer Zurich .
Believed to be paid more than £ 500,000 a year to be accountable to chief executive and participate in seminars for Zurich 's clients
January 2008
Appointed unpaid adviser to Rwandan government
February 2008
Linked with job of EU president , backed by the French president Nicolas Sarkozy .
It is thought the German chancellor Angela Merkel is not so keen
McElroy , Bill Bradford and Sam Konkin III on voting Share This :
At the time , my speech sparked a counter article by Liberty editor Bill Bradford and a heated rebuke to Bill from founder of Left Libertarianism Samuel E. Konkin III , both of whom are now deceased .
Their responses are printed in the extended text below or they can be accessed by clicking on the following hyperlinks :
by R.W. Bradford and
by Samuel E. Konkin III
From Liberty , November , 1996 .
Voting no more legitimizes the state than scratching legitimizes an itch .
Over the past two years , a lot of Liberty 's ink has been devoted to arguing that participation in the political process is immoral .
First , in the March 1995 Liberty , John Pugsley offered an eight - page argument against voting in general and Harry Browne 's presidential campaign in particular .
In the very next issue , Wendy McElroy presented a more concise argument against voting , which she emphatically restated in " Why I Would Not Vote Against Hitler " ( May 1996 ) .
" At the last Liberty Conference , " she writes , " a question was posed : ' If you could have . . . cast the deciding vote against Hitler , would you have done so ? '
I replied , ' No , but I would have no moral objection to putting a bullet through his skull . ' "
To date , these arguments have gone virtually unanswered in our pages .
As the person who posed the question to McElroy at the Liberty Conference , I reluctantly have decided to take up the issue here .
My reluctance grows out of my admiration for McElroy and for Pugsley , both of whom have demonstrated a courageous willingness to advance a rather lonely and unpopular opinion , and both of whom honestly carry their logic to its conclusions .
But as much as I admire them , I am not convinced by their argument .
McElroy 's willingness to put " a bullet through [ Hitler 's ] skull " demonstrates her revolutionary zeal .
But her elaboration makes it clear that she considers voting the kind of serious sin that mere assassination , apparently , is not : A ballot can never be " an act of self - defense . . . [ It ] attacks innocent third parties who must endure the consequences of the politician [ who has been ] assisted into a position of power over their lives .
Whoever puts a man into a position of unjust power -- that is , a position of political power -- must share responsibility for every right he violates thereafter . "
For McElroy , if a candidate is elected , all who have voted for him become guilty of any crimes he might commit .
This logic , it seems to me , would lead in very strange directions if it were applied to a voluntary association or corporation .
By McElroy 's argument , if she voted for someone to be chair of , say , her local Association of Voluntaryists , she would share guilt for any evil that individual might do in office , up to and including encouraging people to vote in political elections .
Of course , such thinking , if adhered to by members of voluntary organizations , would simply eliminate any such association not run by administrative fiat .
For Pugsley , the voter shares guilt for elected officials ' crimes even if he voted against them : " Those who vote in the next presidential election will share responsibility for the theft , coercion , and destruction the next administration will wreak on all Americans as well as on innocent people around the world who fall victim to American intervention .
Every person in the lynch mob is as guilty as the person who pulls the rope .
Since a voter appoints an agent and empowers that agent to aggress against others , the act of voting is immoral .
It is wrong . "
The notion that by taking a certain action , one accepts responsibility for all sorts of diffuse antecedent events , is fairly widespread .
Hence the 1960s boycott of inoffensive table grapes because they were harvested by non-union labor , the 1950s boycott of Polish hams by anti-Communists , and certain yuppies ' preference for hamburgers made from cows raised by farmers who give them names and treat them humanely ( at least until they are slaughtered ) -- not to mention U.S. government ordered embargoes of trade with Mongolia , Vietnam , Cuba , South Africa , the Soviet Union , China , North Korea , etc .
Such actions may or may not have the intended moral effect .
They certainly provide comfort both for the well - meaning and the self - righteous .
But they are no substitute for the real business of the world .
If one must investigate the antecedents of everything one buys and verify that it was produced in accordance with one 's ethical values , trade will halt and society will cease to exist .
McElroy even opposes going to the polls only to vote no on tax increases : " It seems like I should be saying that you should vote against things , " McElroy said in response to a question at the conference .
" But one of the big problems that you have in terms of dealing with the state , and dealing with people who believe in the state , is the state has legitimacy .
And perhaps the biggest thing that gives the state legitimacy is that it is considered a democratic process in which we can all vote .
. . .
If in fact you deal with the political system and vote , even against something , you 're saying they have the authority , or you 're participating in a system that says the state has the authority . "
Her view is that all voting is wrong -- which is what prompted my question about casting a deciding vote against Hitler .
" Thou shalt not vote " is a universal moral commandment that must be obeyed under any and all circumstances .
But why is voting wrong ?
" Voting is an act of implicit violence , because it is an essential aspect of a system that binds others to the will of the state .
Moreover , voting provides the legitimacy upon which the state lives and breathes .
. . .
Just as totalitarian states go through the charade of ' free elections ' to justify their rule , Western democratic states base their claim to legitimacy upon consent via the ballot box [ because ] most people . . . accept the notion that by ' participating in the electoral process , ' they have given consent in one important matter . "
The crux of McElroy 's argument , I believe , is that the power of the state rests on its claim to legitimacy , and its claim to legitimacy rests on its subjects ' participation in democratic elections ; so by refusing to participate in elections , we can deny the state 's legitimacy and reduce ( or destroy ) its power .
Q.E.D. A nifty argument .
But not , I believe , a valid one .
The problem with this argument is that it accepts as true a key proposition of the modern statist : that voting confers legitimacy on the state .
I can see no more reason to accept this claim at face value than to accept many modern statists ' claims that a social " contract " binds us to obey the law and that government ownership of the means of production renders them more productive , more just , and more humane than means of production that are privately owned .
There is a glimmer of truth to the legitimacy argument .
The power of any state does depend on the opinions of its subjects ; if enough of them view it as good or inevitable or too powerful to resist , the state achieves a certain viability .
Ultimately , power is in the hands of individual human beings , and the most powerful states are those with the widest support .
Like all governments , the modern democratic state rests on the support of its subjects .
It seeks this ( and asserts its legitimacy ) by holding elections .
The democratic state that gains widespread support by this method can become extremely powerful , able to command huge resources .
But elections are not the only means states have used to assert legitimacy .
In medieval Europe , states asserted a legitimacy that came from the Christian religion , and demonstrated that legitimacy by sharing power with the organized church .
Democratic elections played no part in the process .
In much of the Muslim world today , states derive their legitimacy from Islam .
In countries controlled by Communists , states claimed legitimacy from scientific , Marxist thought .
I am no more willing to accept the notion that voting confers legitimacy on the democratic state than I am willing to accept these other supposed sources of legitimacy .
And just as I need not condemn rational , scientific inquiry to deny legitimacy to the Marxist state , or condemn religious belief to deny legitimacy to the medieval state , so I see no need to condemn voting to deny legitimacy to the modern , democratic state .
Casting about for a way to interpret McElroy 's argument in a more plausible way , it occured to me that perhaps she fears that exercising my moral freedom to vote may lead other people to believe that the state is a morally legitimate authority .
But allowing neighbors ' interpretations to determine your behavior is absurd .
Suppose , for example , that McElroy 's neighbor believes that walking upright is evidence that she agrees that all her property should be forfeited to the state .
Would McElroy agree that it ought to be ?
Or -- to take a less absurd notion -- suppose that your use of public streets leads your neighbors to believe the state is morally legitimate .
Must you then stop using the roads ?
As a matter of fact , many people do believe that if you use the streets , or sidewalks , or government schools , or postal service , or any other state - owned or state - controlled entity , you confer legitimacy on our massively coercive government .
Yet few of those who oppose the omnipotent state try even to reduce our use of such things .
They do n't walk on the grass , or buy bottled water , or stop driving .
They 're not really worried about the bad example they give their neighbors .
I suspect McElroy is n't either .
Nor should she be .
What McElroy misses is that when our neighbors interpret our behavior as granting legitimacy to the state , they are wrong .
The simple fact is that people 's motives for voting do matter .
Just as we treat the little girl who trespasses on our property while chasing a butterfly differently from the vandal who enters our property with intent to damage , so we must treat those who vote as a way of gaining personal power or wealth differently from those who vote in order to reduce the power of the state .
But for McElroy , the proposition that voting confers legitimacy on the state is an established fact that cannot be denied ; neither a voter 's motive nor the consequences of his act are relevant against the perfidy of his legitimizing the state .
She removes voting from its social context -- not realizing that in the process she is robbing it of its actual meaning .
And so , off in this fantasy world where refusing to cast a ballot that would prevent Hitler from taking power is an act of virtue and voting against Hitler is evil , McElroy is secure in her own heroism .
And ironically , she accuses voters of removing their arguments from the real world .
She asserts that my question about Hitler " postulated a fantasy world which canceled out one of the basic realities of existence : the constant presence of alternatives .
In essence , the question became , ' If the fabric of reality were rewoven into a different pattern , would you still take the same moral stand ? '
Since my morals are derived from my views about reality , it was not possible for me to answer this question . . .
I can address only the reality in which I live and , in a world replete with alternatives , I would not vote for or against Hitler . . .
Voting for or against Hitler would only strengthen the institutional framework that produced him -- a framework that would produce another of his ilk in two seconds . "
What reality is McElroy living in ?
When Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet allowed himself to be voted from office in 1988 , did " another of his ilk " take power in two seconds ?
How about when Jaruzelski was voted from office in Poland ?
Or the Sandinistas in Nicaragua ?
I suppose someone might argue that all the succeeding governments continued to collect taxes , regulate the economy , enact unjust laws , etc. , and are therefore of the same " ilk " as their predecessors .
To this I respond : Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin were both statists , but Stalin was far more destructive of human life , liberty , and property , and the difference is very important .
My guess is that by characterizing my question as fantastic , McElroy wanted to free herself from dealing with this sort of objection .
Of course , I do n't believe that the situation I specified is likely to occur .
All I suggested is that it is plausible that at some point a person might have an opportunity to cast a ballot that would keep a very bad person from political power .
But McElroy is arguing for a universal moral imperative .
The whole purpose of such commandments is to tell you what to do in extreme cases .
So she must deal with every plausible case , not simply those likely to occur .
Well , I do n't live in Wendy McElroy 's world .
In my world , I do n't claim to understand the inherent moral significance of voting , let alone accept the notion that it confers legitimacy on aggressive force .
And in my world , if I had an opportunity to cast the deciding vote against Hitler , I would do so .
I would do so because Hitler was a very bad man who advocated policies that would do a terrible amount of harm to millions of people , including , presumably , me .
Even if I were somehow immune to the future harm done by Hitler , I 'd have jumped at the chance to cast a deciding ballot against him because I feel benevolent toward my fellow human beings and because the cost of voting against him is slight .
So what action can one take to reduce the power of government and increase human liberty ?
To answer that question , we must remember that government power rests on the opinions of our fellow human beings .
It will be reduced or eliminated only when there is widespread conviction that it ought to be reduced or eliminated .
The means by which such a change takes place may be democratic ( as in New Zealand over the past decade ) or revolutionary ( as in the United States in late eighteenth century ) , or somewhere in - between ( as in Poland in the 1980s ) .
But the one undeniable precondition for such a radical transformation is a change of opinion .
In our society , there are many means of convincing our fellows to change their opinions .
We can try to educate them .
We can try to stimulate others to educate them .
We can set good examples by trying to live exemplary lives .
We can organize debating societies .
We can write books about feminism , or publish magazines .
We can do research , or explore the frontiers of social thinking .
And , if we choose , we can run for office , using our campaign to spread the proposition that liberty is good .
There are many roads that lead to a freer world .
Some of us prefer one over another .
Some of us progress further along some roads than we would by following others .
But it behooves us to remember that the road we choose is not the only road .

The Damnation of Bill Bradford by Samuel E. Konkin III
It Was Written
Last Fall , R.W. Bradford , editor of Liberty ( the magazine , not the Ideal ) , decided that he could no longer stand the heresies he was publishing , and he promulgated the Bull , " Voting Is No Sin " ( henceforth , VINS , first published in November 1996 issue and posted on the Liberty web site --- with which we would be glad to trade links , should Liberty deign to consider the offer ) .
Unfortunately , these alleged heresies were not his but of others , and have been considered bedrock libertarian principles since the 1850s --- in short , Orthodoxy .
Thus , Editor Bradford ( I would like to say , " fellow Anarchoeditor , " but , as shall be seen , he may object to this implicit embrace ) is himself the heretic and he fears damnation by the Goddess Liberty ; he attempts to defend himself by means of this article .
Alas , one is advised to bet on the Flames .
Politics and voting have had no place in Libertarian history for a century ; to list every major figure in the Libertarian Movement between Josiah Warren and Frank Chodorov --- and I will : Lysander Spooner , Benjamin Tucker , Albert J. Nock , H.L. Mencken , Rose Wilder Lane , Isabel Paterson , and Leonard Read --- is to list anti-voters .
There were exceptions , of course ; Spooner debated Senator Thomas Bayard in a long published letter and Benjamin Tucker 's Original Liberty contained letters from many sympathizers with Liberty , if not liberty , who exhorted the immovable Tucker to throw his support behind some Reform or Socialist candidate or other , most often a follower of Henry George .
Ayn Rand , who strayed furthest from libertarianism to the point of denouncing the label and its followers , supported such stellar candidates for freedom as the first pure P.R. nominee offered by the Power Elite , Wendell Willkie , to that Master of Lesser Evil , Richard M. Nixon .
But the major figures , the " hard - core " ones we remember , the ones whom others rallied around for a century and a half , opposed voting and running candidates .
Thus , not voting is the norm , the standard , the orthodoxy which , if it is to be challenged , a compelling argument must be mounted .
Necessary Distinctions
There are three distinct positions in This Movement of Ours concerning voting and politics .
Interestingly enough , Mr. Libertarian , Murray N. Rothbard , Ph.D. , embraced all three .
In his early writings ( I have a delicious issue of Perspectives from the early 1960s denouncing voting and candidates ; of course , he was extolling the late Frank Chodorov at the time ) Rothbard was a pure , anti-political anarchist .
He had supported Strom Thurmond for President in 1948 , but he saw it as a student prank with bite ; after all , the rest of Columbia University students were divided between Communist - backed Henry Wallace , and the New Deal heir , Harry S. Truman .
While Thomas Dewey ( a Liberal Republican precursor of Nelson Rockefeller ) supporters hid in closets , Rothbard 's Thurmond support was in - your - face New York attitude .
He knew Thurmond could not win electoral votes in New York and hence his " vote " was irrelevant on all levels .
But by the 1964 election , Rothbard took the choice between Goldwater and Johnson seriously .
Hard - core libertarians , such as Robert LeFevre and Leonard Read , remained opposed to choosing the Lesser of Evils , even if Goldwater appeared lesser than most .
Rothbard , reacting against compromise to follow Barry , went so far as to extol Lyndon Johnson ( I have saved that issue of the Liberal Innovator as another prize for my collection . )
Rothbard , and his sidekicks Joe Peden and Leonard Liggio , brought his Circle Bastiat and brighter young students ( all of whom could fit in his living room ) into the Students for a Democratic Society on the grounds that they were run by Anarchists and Decentralists --- true enough in 1965 , but false within two years of his move .
Thus , Rothbard 's subsequent voting including support of Progressive Labor ( Maoist ) candidates in exchange for their voting for him for Governor ( on the Freedom and Peace ticket ; he lost the nomination ) .
So in 1968 , Rothbard was participating in the process only to the extent of furthering The Revolution .
But by 1972 , he had bounced back so far as to choose Richard Nixon even over the anti-war ( an issue he considered crucial ) candidate George McGovern , Bircher John Schmitz ( with whom he sympathized on many levels philosophically ) , and " Libertarian " Party candidate John Hospers .
Perhaps it might put all this tactical wandering in perspective to remember that Wrong - Way Murray refused to register to vote as part of his jury - draft resistance ; hence , his endorsements only jeopardized other souls , not his .
Anyways , to sum up , one can believe that the State can be placated , petitioned , or purchased , at least to some useful extent , and thus one 's ballot ( among millions ) , might be part of that supplication .
Or one rejects that argument and feels that dealing with the political system in any way other than rejection of temptation is in error and impure .
The third way ( which happens to be the Agorist position ) is that voting is statist ( evil , to continue our ecclesiastical metaphor ) and should be fought .
Burn the polls ye sons of freedom !
It is neither accident nor unideological spite that revolutionaries in the jungles and forests of the Third World actively oppose balloting to the extent of leading raids against polls and voters themselves .
Most of these revolutionaries are not anarchist and might even bring in election machinery to ratify themselves once in power ; the point here is that they realize that electoral participation is counter - revolutionary .
When the guerrillas are in power and want to keep it , they will institute voting mechanisms .
Impracticality of Voting
Bradford is not really advocating the ballot as a revolutionary tool .
He does seem to want it to accomplish something , at least some small Reform , and , if he cannot have that , then he will settle for the position that it does no harm .
His targets are the unyielding Wendy McElroy ( most identified with NEW LIBERTARIAN , though she writes for Cato , Reason , and even Liberty ) and John Pugsley ( author of the populist - agorist The Alpha Strategy and Founding Advisor of The Agorist Institute ) .
Pugsley , a long - time friend of Harry Browne and his campaign manager , Doug Casey ( yet another AI Founder ) , refuses to go along with their picaresque voyage ( which Casey has publicly confessed he sees as a jest ) in search of the Libertarian Party nomination ( which they , indeed , won , exhibiting the incredible level of bankruptcy of said Party - -- or maybe the delegates consider it all to be an amusing lark as well ) .
McElroy is more theoretical and hence , possibly , more threatening .
Let us then first deal with the argument that voting might " accomplish something . "
It should be stated in fairness that nowhere in VINS does Bradford actually argue that it might , only that some may be deluded into thinking it might .
Perhaps we can save some time untangling the many threads of argument from the historical , strategic , tactical , economic , short - and long - term , emergency ethics and whatever , by asking what political voting is and is meant to accomplish .
Thus we can avoid silly little pitfalls such as Bradford 's bringing up " voting " for chair of the Association of Voluntaryists ( a very obscure purist libertarian group which makes the Movement of the Libertarian Left look like a broad popular front ) as an example of the offense .
Let 's start with our Movement 's grandfather , Lysander Spooner .
Spooner 's opposition to voting is well - known ; he perceived ( as did Rothbard et al. ) the State as a " band of murderers and thieves " who compared unfavourably to highwaymen .
( At least the highwayman will take your money and leave you alone afterwards , instead of lecturing you incessantly on what a virtue his banditry is . )
For Spooner the State is a secret gang of bandits who select their muscle and divided the spoils without revealing publicly who they are .
How ?
By the secret ballot , which was still an issue in the 1860s and 1870s .
Spooner , Tucker , and the others saw clearly at the time that various propertied classes settled their differences ( usually who should get what privilege or tariff at the expense of the others ) through their political gladiators in the congressional arena : Daniel Webster , Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun fitting this description most aptly .
The power elite , over time , realized that they could dilute the vote by allowing those with little property and less to lose ( and glad to gain anything ) and lose nothing themselves .
But no matter how much water you pour in the whiskey , you do not transmute it into milk or orange juice , though it may no longer be much use for inebriation .
So though voting is so diluted as to make a single vote meaningless , it still serves the function in aggregate of assisting the ruling class in selecting their representatives ( not yours ) to sort out the high - level conflicts they have not been able to settle like gentlemen ( or ladies ) .
Thus , in the sense of maintaining the mechanism of oppression over the American ( and other people with similar structures ) , voting has a " practical " application .
In the sense of co-opting those who think that by helping a faction of the power elite against another faction , they have some political freedom , the Succubus Democracy has a " practical " application .
But surely those are not the " practices " that libertarians support --- or else many of us need to start another Movement .
Understanding the nature of political voting , we can now quickly deal with other issues that may have seemed formidable a moment ago .
What is a " Libertarian " Party 's function ?
To join the feeding trough dividing up the spoils of taxation , inflation and tariff protection .
and to assist the rulers in deciding who is most fit to serve them .
Why would any real libertarian devote an iota of his or her resources to that goal ?
Now Bradford was shocked by Ms. McElroy 's refusing to go to the polls ( and getting herself duly registered by the State , he fails to mention ) even to vote no on tax increases .
Counter - economically , Ms. McElroy ( and the hard - money entrepreneur Bill Bradford , as well ) are far better off remaining off the State 's books and practicing their respective trades than by stamping themselves as " prime sheep " for the State 's records to get a piece of paper or a pull at the lever to be one of a million or so saying yea or nay to being fleeced .
For one thing , they could avoid the tax ; for another , they could be shining examples ( as Ms. McElroy and many around NL are ) for those others to emulate .
Perhaps Editor Bradford holds himself in such little self - esteem that he cannot see how he could be an example to anyone else ; nonetheless , his very ability to accumulate wealth through Austrian principles is example enough to many , and should he be unable or unwilling to trumpet his own success , why , NEW LIBERTARIAN will step into the breach and be proud to do it for him .
But maybe Editor Bradford feels he is arguing for others who have not even his level of entrepreneurship going for him ; these near - worthless adherents to libertarianism can conceive of nothing better than throwing themselves on the State 's Altar of Registration to give that lever a feeble yank against a particular tax ( though the State and its minions have a million others ) .
Surely even these anarcho - wretches would better serve themselves and the rest of the movement by picking themselves up , spurning the State and de-registering , get themselves a decent entrepreneural endeavour ( no demeaning job , of course ) , and standing as an example , no matter how small or industrially infant , of individualism .
Better a heroic schoolyard dope - dealer than a ( gasp ! ) vile voter as an example to Future Anarchist Youth !
Back to Moral Theory
It should be noted in passing that Bradford brings up various boycotts against grapes and Polish hams by Right and Left during his ( and my ) youth ; he is opposed to them and so am I .
They not only accomplish little besides raising the price of grapes and ham , they also encourage economic tunneling ( the basis of Counter - Economics ) by the Other Side .
But these are economic issues ; what in the ( political ) world do they have to do with voting ?
A political vote would be represented in micro something like this : you can choose someone who will shoot A ( or break his promise and do something else ) or choose someone else who will let A live but torture him ( or break his promise and shoot him ) or maybe a radical third choice who will let A live and torture him for only a reasonable , definite period ( or break his promise , etc . ) .
The choice you are looking for , of letting A go or giving him a medal for his subversive acts , is not and can not be offered .
In the famous libertarian slogan of the 1960s , if voting could change anything , it would be illegal .
Exactly .
Hence , when Bradford confronts Wendy McElroy with what he perceives as a strange choice of shooting Adolph Hitler ( assuming one has full knowledge of the statist acts he will commit and that doing so will somehow lessen those acts --- or maybe just because he has many times over forfeited his right to life and it will feel good to eliminate his existence ) rather than voting against him , it is Bradford who wallows in absurdity .
Editor Bradford may assert that WMcE has the deciding vote , but that situation is itself fantastic in the real world ; sooner you would see simians ejected rectally .
She would need both time - travel knowledge of the degree of evil ur - Hitler represents ( as any revisionist could tell you , about the same order of magnitude as FDR ) and the knowledge that her one vote could topple him from power ( whereas a well - aimed bullet is known by all to have that effect ) .
Bradford goes on desperately to argue that voting does not confer any legitimacy on the State .
In one sense he is right ; the correct phrase should be that it casts the illusion of legitimacy on the State which can never have true , natural - law legitimacy .
But I thought Bradford did not " believe " in Natural Law ( or anything else to do with reality , it seems ) ; hence , why should he worry about the subtle distinction between legitimacy and legitimization ?
The depth of his desperation is in the following paragraph of Editor Bradford :
I am no more willing to accept the notion that voting confers legitimacy on the democratic state than I am willing to accept these other supposed sources of legitimacy .
And just as I need not condemn rational , scientific inquiry to deny legitimacy to the Marxist state , or condemn religious belief to deny legitimacy to the medieval state , so I see no need to condemn voting to deny legitimacy to the modern , democratic state .
Where is the parallel , Bill ?
Rational , scientific inquiry disproves the legitimacy of the Marxist state .
We fought them on their own grounds and won .
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism all have strong anarchist factions ; we lose nothing by using them as well .
But voting is an act of Statism ; it has no other meaning .
How about " we need not deny the legitimacy of taxation or the legitimacy of warmaking to deny the legitimacy of the Marxist / Medieval State " ?
Why not ?
They must be denied for every State and all States .
Similarly , the means of plunder and its distribution must be denied legitimacy .
And the means of selection of its rulers and so on .
Wherein lies the problem , Editor ?
There is nothing to be gained by voting by any moral person ; hence , why should one do so ?
One real howler was the attempt by Bradford to shame WMcE ( she worried about Hitler being replaced by another Nazi ) by saying , " What reality is McElroy living in ?
When Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet allowed himself to be voted from office in 1988 , did another of his ilk take power in two seconds ?
How about when Jaruzelski was voted from office in Poland ?
Or the Sandinistas in Nicaragua ? "
In all these cases , the answer was a clear YES , Bill .
Pinochet remains in control of the Chilean state .
Jaruzelski was replaced by another statist who continued and continues to this day the oppressively huge role of the State in Polish affairs that even Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was unable to reverse once he succumbed to incumbency .
And the Sandinistas remain armed and in control of as much of Nicaragua as they had before the election they lost ( before they realized that they had lost the support of the masses ) , poised to regain all at a slip from the opposition .
( Again , the only contender who had libertarian support , Eden Pastora , was marginalized out of serious contention . )
Bradford 's subsequent comparison of Stalin and Roosevelt are even more ahistorical ; talk about being caught with a dropped context in public !
A reasonable argument would be of the form was Stalin , relative to the Czars , worse than Roosevelt , relative to Hoover and Coolidge ?
( The argument is less interesting , actually , if you compare them to their respective , relatively libertarian predecessors , who were considered incompetent by Statist court intellectuals : Czar Alexander II and President Warren G. Harding , both of whom actually reduced the size of the State they inherited and both of who died early in office or were assassinated ) .
Yeltsin may be better than Stalin , but who would have known they would ever get anything better than Khruschev ?
Come to think of it , when they finally did do in Stalin , they got Khruschev .
And FDR 's death led to Hiroshima Harry .
These are significant moral choices ?
The End of Bill Bradford
Bradford , a bit earlier in his argument , insisted that voters were not responsible for their acts under the criterion that one needs to know the consequences of what one does to be blamed for them .
Libertarians are not interested in blame but in assigning guilt ( that is , responsibility and liability ) for the purposes of Restitution .
If you trip and fall through a pane of glass or if you throw a rock through it , you owe the glass owner the cost of replacing the glass plus the time it was out of his possession .
Your motive is far less interesting to the victim than the promptness of your restitution .
Bradford excites us , as did Lyndon Johnson 's 1964 handlers , with images of a young girl chasing butterflies onto someones property and that of a burglar trespassing with different motives .
Did she pick any daisies , Bill ?
Set off any nukes ?
But why would any Libertarian oppose the reasoning that if the girl did only a dollar 's worth of damage to the grass and daisies , she should be liable for it ?
And if all the burglas did was to step on the grass and daisies , then he owes a dollar ( or tenth - gram of gold , or whatever ) ?
Finally , if the little girl chasing butterflies spotted the Mazarin Stone lying on a garden table and walked off with the pretty object , is she exempt from returning the million - dollar diamond because of her age , gender , or her appeal to Editor Bradford ?
Similarly , if the burglar grabs the diamond and runs , and is caught , then he too is liable for restoring it to the rightful owner .
Voters are participating in the spoils of statism and they are surely aware of it .
One only need skim the columns with which Bradford fills the pages of Liberty , of supposedly hard - nosed political experts who analyse voting patterns in terms of interests and pay - offs , for verification .
They , by and large , know what they are doing and they ( morally ) should stop .
Most to the point , thanks to Bob LeFevre , Wendy McElroy , George H. Smith , Sy Leon , not to mention Victor Koman 's and my own humble contributions , there are no libertarians beyond ideological infancy who are unaware of the arguments against voting , parties and collaboration with the State .
Anyone aware of the argument , that is , anyone assumed to be reading Bradford 's article , is no innocent .
The other paragraph in which Editor Bradford reveals his moral three - card monte is his penultimate one .
Even most " voting is tolerable " libertarians concede that the act is corrupt , disguesting , vile and we would be better off without it .
Hence , the last thing we would want anyone whom we are trying to influence is to see us in this compromising position .
But what does Editor Bradford counsel ?
In our society , there are many means of convincing our fellows to change their opinions .
We can try to educate them .
We can try to stimulate others to to educate them .
We can set good examples by trying to live exemplary lives .
We can organize debating societies .
We can write book about feminism , or publish magazines .
We can do research or explore the frontiers of social thinking .
And , if we choose , we can run for office , using our campaign to spread the proposition that liberty is good .
No , Editor Bradford , we cannot , whether or not we chose .
An election campaign is not an educational endeavour , it is the opposite .
Candidates cash in on the prior education done by activists , and then distort and dilute it to pick up a few marginal votes .
No one who voted Libertarian ever was educated into Libertarianism via a political campaign .
First , they read Robert Heinlein , Ayn Rand , Thomas Szasz , Wendy McElroy , or maybe even NEW LIBERTARIAN or Liberty .
THEN they went out and voted --- or not .
I could let Editor Bradford 's argument collapse at this point but these non-arguments Bradford himself heard demolished a quarter century ago when Don Ernsberger ( since sold out and run for office ) made them .
The question arises as to why he is motivated to pursue this error even though he knows better .
To be blunt , what 's in it for Bill ?
Perhaps he wants Liberty to be a big tent ?
But he is familiar with NEW LIBERTARIAN 's history and that we have no trouble getting writers from all factions by the simple expedient of not editing them .
Apparently , an open publishing policy is far more to be feared by Editor Bill .
And he could have kept his party / anti-party neutrality by simply saying nothing .
Yet he says , " I reluctantly have decided to take the issue up here . "
As an editor myself , I am aware of the possibilities ; the main one is that the editor gets the last word .
( Remember , in the Natural Law debate in NL , I put forward no argument until the debate was to be concluded and that issue is yet to be published . )
Hence , Editor Bradford may be motivated by having the last word and letting the more gullible libertarians assume that he somehow won the argument and they can now go and vote .
Coincidentally , the issue came out at election time .
But this does not answer why he was motivated to use editorial trickery against WMcE .
The voting issue is not trivial ; if it were , he would not have wasted Liberty 's precious space .
On one side are revolutionary agorism , counter - economics , the rapid abolition of the State and permanent elimination of voting ; on the other are conservatives who like sex and drugs , continuation of taxation , imperialism , incarceration , regulation , and . . . voting .
Counter - Economics brought down the Berlin Wall ; the most Bradford himself can see voting has accomplished is a cut in the New Zealand income tax from 66 % to 33 % ( Liberty , March 1997 , p.14 ) .
If that is the most you can imagine libertarians achieving , Bill Bradford , you do n't need Wendy 's or my utterances of damnation ; you 're already in Hell .
Now , if you dodge that pitchfork and leap over that fiery pit , you can still register in time to select your chief tormentor : I hear Screwtape is running against Wormwood on a platform of 33 % fewer lashes . . .

Voting Is No Sin by R.W. BradfordFrom Liberty , November , 1996 .
Voting no more legitimizes the state than scratching legitimizes an itch .
Over the past two years , a lot of Liberty 's ink has been devoted to arguing that participation in the political process is immoral .
First , in the March 1995 Liberty , John Pugsley offered an eight - page argument against voting in general and Harry Browne 's presidential campaign in particular .
In the very next issue , Wendy McElroy presented a more concise argument against voting , which she emphatically restated in " Why I Would Not Vote Against Hitler " ( May 1996 ) .
" At the last Liberty Conference , " she writes , " a question was posed : ' If you could have . . . cast the deciding vote against Hitler , would you have done so ? '
I replied , ' No , but I would have no moral objection to putting a bullet through his skull .
'" To date , these arguments have gone virtually unanswered in our pages .
As the person who posed the question to McElroy at the Liberty Conference , I reluctantly have decided to take up the issue here .
My reluctance grows out of my admiration for McElroy and for Pugsley , both of whom have demonstrated a courageous willingness to advance a rather lonely and unpopular opinion , and both of whom honestly carry their logic to its conclusions .
But as much as I admire them , I am not convinced by their argument .
McElroy 's willingness to put " a bullet through [ Hitler 's ] skull " demonstrates her revolutionary zeal .
But her elaboration makes it clear that she considers voting the kind of serious sin that mere assassination , apparently , is not : A ballot can never be " an act of self - defense . . . [ It ] attacks innocent third parties who must endure the consequences of the politician [ who has been ] assisted into a position of power over their lives .
Whoever puts a man into a position of unjust power -- that is , a position of political power -- must share responsibility for every right he violates thereafter .
" For McElroy , if a candidate is elected , all who have voted for him become guilty of any crimes he might commit .
This logic , it seems to me , would lead in very strange directions if it were applied to a voluntary association or corporation .
By McElroy 's argument , if she voted for someone to be chair of , say , her local Association of Voluntaryists , she would share guilt for any evil that individual might do in office , up to and including encouraging people to vote in political elections .
Of course , such thinking , if adhered to by members of voluntary organizations , would simply eliminate any such association not run by administrative fiat .
For Pugsley , the voter shares guilt for elected officials ' crimes even if he voted against them : " Those who vote in the next presidential election will share responsibility for the theft , coercion , and destruction the next administration will wreak on all Americans as well as on innocent people around the world who fall victim to American intervention .
Every person in the lynch mob is as guilty as the person who pulls the rope .
Since a voter appoints an agent and empowers that agent to aggress against others , the act of voting is immoral .
It is wrong .
" The notion that by taking a certain action , one accepts responsibility for all sorts of diffuse antecedent events , is fairly widespread .
Hence the 1960s boycott of inoffensive table grapes because they were harvested by non-union labor , the 1950s boycott of Polish hams by anti-Communists , and certain yuppies ' preference for hamburgers made from cows raised by farmers who give them names and treat them humanely ( at least until they are slaughtered ) -- not to mention U.S. government ordered embargoes of trade with Mongolia , Vietnam , Cuba , South Africa , the Soviet Union , China , North Korea , etc.
Such actions may or may not have the intended moral effect .
They certainly provide comfort both for the well - meaning and the self - righteous .
But they are no substitute for the real business of the world .
If one must investigate the antecedents of everything one buys and verify that it was produced in accordance with one 's ethical values , trade will halt and society will cease to exist .
McElroy even opposes going to the polls only to vote no on tax increases : " It seems like I should be saying that you should vote against things , " McElroy said in response to a question at the conference .
" But one of the big problems that you have in terms of dealing with the state , and dealing with people who believe in the state , is the state has legitimacy .
And perhaps the biggest thing that gives the state legitimacy is that it is considered a democratic process in which we can all vote .
. . .
If in fact you deal with the political system and vote , even against something , you 're saying they have the authority , or you 're participating in a system that says the state has the authority .
" Her view is that all voting is wrong -- which is what prompted my question about casting a deciding vote against Hitler .
" Thou shalt not vote " is a universal moral commandment that must be obeyed under any and all circumstances .
But why is voting wrong ?
" Voting is an act of implicit violence , because it is an essential aspect of a system that binds others to the will of the state .
Moreover , voting provides the legitimacy upon which the state lives and breathes .
. . .
Just as totalitarian states go through the charade of ' free elections ' to justify their rule , Western democratic states base their claim to legitimacy upon consent via the ballot box [ because ] most people . . . accept the notion that by ' participating in the electoral process , ' they have given consent in one important matter .
" The crux of McElroy 's argument , I believe , is that the power of the state rests on its claim to legitimacy , and its claim to legitimacy rests on its subjects ' participation in democratic elections ; so by refusing to participate in elections , we can deny the state 's legitimacy and reduce ( or destroy ) its power .
Q.E.D. A nifty argument .
But not , I believe , a valid one .
The problem with this argument is that it accepts as true a key proposition of the modern statist : that voting confers legitimacy on the state .
I can see no more reason to accept this claim at face value than to accept many modern statists ' claims that a social " contract " binds us to obey the law and that government ownership of the means of production renders them more productive , more just , and more humane than means of production that are privately owned .
There is a glimmer of truth to the legitimacy argument .
The power of any state does depend on the opinions of its subjects ; if enough of them view it as good or inevitable or too powerful to resist , the state achieves a certain viability .
Ultimately , power is in the hands of individual human beings , and the most powerful states are those with the widest support .
Like all governments , the modern democratic state rests on the support of its subjects .
It seeks this ( and asserts its legitimacy ) by holding elections .
The democratic state that gains widespread support by this method can become extremely powerful , able to command huge resources .
But elections are not the only means states have used to assert legitimacy .
In medieval Europe , states asserted a legitimacy that came from the Christian religion , and demonstrated that legitimacy by sharing power with the organized church .
Democratic elections played no part in the process .
In much of the Muslim world today , states derive their legitimacy from Islam .
In countries controlled by Communists , states claimed legitimacy from scientific , Marxist thought .
I am no more willing to accept the notion that voting confers legitimacy on the democratic state than I am willing to accept these other supposed sources of legitimacy .
And just as I need not condemn rational , scientific inquiry to deny legitimacy to the Marxist state , or condemn religious belief to deny legitimacy to the medieval state , so I see no need to condemn voting to deny legitimacy to the modern , democratic state .
Casting about for a way to interpret McElroy 's argument in a more plausible way , it occured to me that perhaps she fears that exercising my moral freedom to vote may lead other people to believe that the state is a morally legitimate authority .
But allowing neighbors ' interpretations to determine your behavior is absurd .
Suppose , for example , that McElroy 's neighbor believes that walking upright is evidence that she agrees that all her property should be forfeited to the state .
Would McElroy agree that it ought to be ?
Or -- to take a less absurd notion -- suppose that your use of public streets leads your neighbors to believe the state is morally legitimate .
Must you then stop using the roads ?
As a matter of fact , many people do believe that if you use the streets , or sidewalks , or government schools , or postal service , or any other state - owned or state - controlled entity , you confer legitimacy on our massively coercive government .
Yet few of those who oppose the omnipotent state try even to reduce our use of such things .
They do n't walk on the grass , or buy bottled water , or stop driving .
They 're not really worried about the bad example they give their neighbors .
I suspect McElroy is n't either .
Nor should she be .
What McElroy misses is that when our neighbors interpret our behavior as granting legitimacy to the state , they are wrong .
The simple fact is that people 's motives for voting do matter .
Just as we treat the little girl who trespasses on our property while chasing a butterfly differently from the vandal who enters our property with intent to damage , so we must treat those who vote as a way of gaining personal power or wealth differently from those who vote in order to reduce the power of the state .
But for McElroy , the proposition that voting confers legitimacy on the state is an established fact that cannot be denied ; neither a voter 's motive nor the consequences of his act are relevant against the perfidy of his legitimizing the state .
She removes voting from its social context -- not realizing that in the process she is robbing it of its actual meaning .
And so , off in this fantasy world where refusing to cast a ballot that would prevent Hitler from taking power is an act of virtue and voting against Hitler is evil , McElroy is secure in her own heroism .
And ironically , she accuses voters of removing their arguments from the real world .
She asserts that my question about Hitler " postulated a fantasy world which canceled out one of the basic realities of existence : the constant presence of alternatives .
In essence , the question became , ' If the fabric of reality were rewoven into a different pattern , would you still take the same moral stand ? '
Since my morals are derived from my views about reality , it was not possible for me to answer this question . . .
I can address only the reality in which I live and , in a world replete with alternatives , I would not vote for or against Hitler . . .
Voting for or against Hitler would only strengthen the institutional framework that produced him -- a framework that would produce another of his ilk in two seconds .
" What reality is McElroy living in ?
When Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet allowed himself to be voted from office in 1988 , did " another of his ilk " take power in two seconds ?
How about when Jaruzelski was voted from office in Poland ?
Or the Sandinistas in Nicaragua ?
I suppose someone might argue that all the succeeding governments continued to collect taxes , regulate the economy , enact unjust laws , etc. , and are therefore of the same " ilk " as their predecessors .
To this I respond : Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin were both statists , but Stalin was far more destructive of human life , liberty , and property , and the difference is very important .
My guess is that by characterizing my question as fantastic , McElroy wanted to free herself from dealing with this sort of objection .
Of course , I do n't believe that the situation I specified is likely to occur .
All I suggested is that it is plausible that at some point a person might have an opportunity to cast a ballot that would keep a very bad person from political power .
But McElroy is arguing for a universal moral imperative .
The whole purpose of such commandments is to tell you what to do in extreme cases .
So she must deal with every plausible case , not simply those likely to occur .
Well , I do n't live in Wendy McElroy 's world .
In my world , I do n't claim to understand the inherent moral significance of voting , let alone accept the notion that it confers legitimacy on aggressive force .
And in my world , if I had an opportunity to cast the deciding vote against Hitler , I would do so .
I would do so because Hitler was a very bad man who advocated policies that would do a terrible amount of harm to millions of people , including , presumably , me .
Even if I were somehow immune to the future harm done by Hitler , I 'd have jumped at the chance to cast a deciding ballot against him because I feel benevolent toward my fellow human beings and because the cost of voting against him is slight .
So what action can one take to reduce the power of government and increase human liberty ?
To answer that question , we must remember that government power rests on the opinions of our fellow human beings .
It will be reduced or eliminated only when there is widespread conviction that it ought to be reduced or eliminated .
The means by which such a change takes place may be democratic ( as in New Zealand over the past decade ) or revolutionary ( as in the United States in late eighteenth century ) , or somewhere in - between ( as in Poland in the 1980s ) .
But the one undeniable precondition for such a radical transformation is a change of opinion .
In our society , there are many means of convincing our fellows to change their opinions .
We can try to educate them .
We can try to stimulate others to educate them .
We can set good examples by trying to live exemplary lives .
We can organize debating societies .
We can write books about feminism , or publish magazines .
We can do research , or explore the frontiers of social thinking .
And , if we choose , we can run for office , using our campaign to spread the proposition that liberty is good .
There are many roads that lead to a freer world .
Some of us prefer one over another .
Some of us progress further along some roads than we would by following others .
But it behooves us to remember that the road we choose is not the only road .****** The Damnation of Bill Bradford by Samuel E. Konkin IIILast Fall , R.W. Bradford , editor of Liberty ( the magazine , not the Ideal ) , decided that he could no longer stand the heresies he was publishing , and he promulgated the Bull , " Voting Is No Sin " ( henceforth , VINS , first published in November 1996 issue and posted on the Liberty web site --- with which we would be glad to trade links , should Liberty deign to consider the offer ) .
Unfortunately , these alleged heresies were not his but of others , and have been considered bedrock libertarian principles since the 1850s --- in short , Orthodoxy .
Thus , Editor Bradford ( I would like to say , " fellow Anarchoeditor , " but , as shall be seen , he may object to this implicit embrace ) is himself the heretic and he fears damnation by the Goddess Liberty ; he attempts to defend himself by means of this article .
Alas , one is advised to bet on the Flames .
Politics and voting have had no place in Libertarian history for a century ; to list every major figure in the Libertarian Movement between Josiah Warren and Frank Chodorov --- and I will : Lysander Spooner , Benjamin Tucker , Albert J. Nock , H.L. Mencken , Rose Wilder Lane , Isabel Paterson , and Leonard Read --- is to list anti-voters .
There were exceptions , of course ; Spooner debated Senator Thomas Bayard in a long published letter and Benjamin Tucker 's Original Liberty contained letters from many sympathizers with Liberty , if not liberty , who exhorted the immovable Tucker to throw his support behind some Reform or Socialist candidate or other , most often a follower of Henry George .
Ayn Rand , who strayed furthest from libertarianism to the point of denouncing the label and its followers , supported such stellar candidates for freedom as the first pure P.R. nominee offered by the Power Elite , Wendell Willkie , to that Master of Lesser Evil , Richard M. Nixon .
But the major figures , the " hard - core " ones we remember , the ones whom others rallied around for a century and a half , opposed voting and running candidates .
Thus , not voting is the norm , the standard , the orthodoxy which , if it is to be challenged , a compelling argument must be mounted .
There are three distinct positions in This Movement of Ours concerning voting and politics .
Interestingly enough , Mr. Libertarian , Murray N. Rothbard , Ph.D. , embraced all three .
In his early writings ( I have a delicious issue of Perspectives from the early 1960s denouncing voting and candidates ; of course , he was extolling the late Frank Chodorov at the time ) Rothbard was a pure , anti-political anarchist .
He had supported Strom Thurmond for President in 1948 , but he saw it as a student prank with bite ; after all , the rest of Columbia University students were divided between Communist - backed Henry Wallace , and the New Deal heir , Harry S. Truman .
While Thomas Dewey ( a Liberal Republican precursor of Nelson Rockefeller ) supporters hid in closets , Rothbard 's Thurmond support was in - your - face New York attitude .
He knew Thurmond could not win electoral votes in New York and hence his " vote " was irrelevant on all levels .
But by the 1964 election , Rothbard took the choice between Goldwater and Johnson seriously .
Hard - core libertarians , such as Robert LeFevre and Leonard Read , remained opposed to choosing the Lesser of Evils , even if Goldwater appeared lesser than most .
Rothbard , reacting against compromise to follow Barry , went so far as to extol Lyndon Johnson ( I have saved that issue of the Liberal Innovator as another prize for my collection . )
Rothbard , and his sidekicks Joe Peden and Leonard Liggio , brought his Circle Bastiat and brighter young students ( all of whom could fit in his living room ) into the Students for a Democratic Society on the grounds that they were run by Anarchists and Decentralists --- true enough in 1965 , but false within two years of his move .
Thus , Rothbard 's subsequent voting including support of Progressive Labor ( Maoist ) candidates in exchange for their voting for him for Governor ( on the Freedom and Peace ticket ; he lost the nomination ) .
So in 1968 , Rothbard was participating in the process only to the extent of furthering The Revolution .
But by 1972 , he had bounced back so far as to choose Richard Nixon even over the anti-war ( an issue he considered crucial ) candidate George McGovern , Bircher John Schmitz ( with whom he sympathized on many levels philosophically ) , and " Libertarian " Party candidate John Hospers .
Perhaps it might put all this tactical wandering in perspective to remember that Wrong - Way Murray refused to register to vote as part of his jury - draft resistance ; hence , his endorsements only jeopardized other souls , not his .
Anyways , to sum up , one can believe that the State can be placated , petitioned , or purchased , at least to some useful extent , and thus one 's ballot ( among millions ) , might be part of that supplication .
Or one rejects that argument and feels that dealing with the political system in any way other than rejection of temptation is in error and impure .
The third way ( which happens to be the Agorist position ) is that voting is statist ( evil , to continue our ecclesiastical metaphor ) and should be fought .
Burn the polls ye sons of freedom !
It is neither accident nor unideological spite that revolutionaries in the jungles and forests of the Third World actively oppose balloting to the extent of leading raids against polls and voters themselves .
Most of these revolutionaries are not anarchist and might even bring in election machinery to ratify themselves once in power ; the point here is that they realize that electoral participation is counter - revolutionary .
When the guerrillas are in power and want to keep it , they will institute voting mechanisms .
Bradford is not really advocating the ballot as a revolutionary tool .
He does seem to want it to accomplish something , at least some small Reform , and , if he cannot have that , then he will settle for the position that it does no harm .
His targets are the unyielding Wendy McElroy ( most identified with NEW LIBERTARIAN , though she writes for Cato , Reason , and even Liberty ) and John Pugsley ( author of the populist - agorist The Alpha Strategy and Founding Advisor of The Agorist Institute ) .
Pugsley , a long - time friend of Harry Browne and his campaign manager , Doug Casey ( yet another AI Founder ) , refuses to go along with their picaresque voyage ( which Casey has publicly confessed he sees as a jest ) in search of the Libertarian Party nomination ( which they , indeed , won , exhibiting the incredible level of bankruptcy of said Party - -- or maybe the delegates consider it all to be an amusing lark as well ) .
McElroy is more theoretical and hence , possibly , more threatening .
Let us then first deal with the argument that voting might " accomplish something . "
It should be stated in fairness that nowhere in VINS does Bradford actually argue that it might , only that some may be deluded into thinking it might .
Perhaps we can save some time untangling the many threads of argument from the historical , strategic , tactical , economic , short - and long - term , emergency ethics and whatever , by asking what political voting is and is meant to accomplish .
Thus we can avoid silly little pitfalls such as Bradford 's bringing up " voting " for chair of the Association of Voluntaryists ( a very obscure purist libertarian group which makes the Movement of the Libertarian Left look like a broad popular front ) as an example of the offense .
Let 's start with our Movement 's grandfather , Lysander Spooner .
Spooner 's opposition to voting is well - known ; he perceived ( as did Rothbard et al. ) the State as a " band of murderers and thieves " who compared unfavourably to highwaymen .
( At least the highwayman will take your money and leave you alone afterwards , instead of lecturing you incessantly on what a virtue his banditry is . )
For Spooner the State is a secret gang of bandits who select their muscle and divided the spoils without revealing publicly who they are .
How ?
By the secret ballot , which was still an issue in the 1860s and 1870s .
Spooner , Tucker , and the others saw clearly at the time that various propertied classes settled their differences ( usually who should get what privilege or tariff at the expense of the others ) through their political gladiators in the congressional arena : Daniel Webster , Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun fitting this description most aptly .
The power elite , over time , realized that they could dilute the vote by allowing those with little property and less to lose ( and glad to gain anything ) and lose nothing themselves .
But no matter how much water you pour in the whiskey , you do not transmute it into milk or orange juice , though it may no longer be much use for inebriation .
So though voting is so diluted as to make a single vote meaningless , it still serves the function in aggregate of assisting the ruling class in selecting their representatives ( not yours ) to sort out the high - level conflicts they have not been able to settle like gentlemen ( or ladies ) .
Thus , in the sense of maintaining the mechanism of oppression over the American ( and other people with similar structures ) , voting has a " practical " application .
In the sense of co-opting those who think that by helping a faction of the power elite against another faction , they have some political freedom , the Succubus Democracy has a " practical " application .
But surely those are not the " practices " that libertarians support --- or else many of us need to start another Movement .
Understanding the nature of political voting , we can now quickly deal with other issues that may have seemed formidable a moment ago .
What is a " Libertarian " Party 's function ?
To join the feeding trough dividing up the spoils of taxation , inflation and tariff protection .
and to assist the rulers in deciding who is most fit to serve them .
Why would any real libertarian devote an iota of his or her resources to that goal ?
Now Bradford was shocked by Ms. McElroy 's refusing to go to the polls ( and getting herself duly registered by the State , he fails to mention ) even to vote no on tax increases .
Counter - economically , Ms. McElroy ( and the hard - money entrepreneur Bill Bradford , as well ) are far better off remaining off the State 's books and practicing their respective trades than by stamping themselves as " prime sheep " for the State 's records to get a piece of paper or a pull at the lever to be one of a million or so saying yea or nay to being fleeced .
For one thing , they could avoid the tax ; for another , they could be shining examples ( as Ms. McElroy and many around NL are ) for those others to emulate .
Perhaps Editor Bradford holds himself in such little self - esteem that he cannot see how he could be an example to anyone else ; nonetheless , his very ability to accumulate wealth through Austrian principles is example enough to many , and should he be unable or unwilling to trumpet his own success , why , NEW LIBERTARIAN will step into the breach and be proud to do it for him .
But maybe Editor Bradford feels he is arguing for others who have not even his level of entrepreneurship going for him ; these near - worthless adherents to libertarianism can conceive of nothing better than throwing themselves on the State 's Altar of Registration to give that lever a feeble yank against a particular tax ( though the State and its minions have a million others ) .
Surely even these anarcho - wretches would better serve themselves and the rest of the movement by picking themselves up , spurning the State and de-registering , get themselves a decent entrepreneural endeavour ( no demeaning job , of course ) , and standing as an example , no matter how small or industrially infant , of individualism .
Better a heroic schoolyard dope - dealer than a ( gasp ! ) vile voter as an example to Future Anarchist Youth !
It should be noted in passing that Bradford brings up various boycotts against grapes and Polish hams by Right and Left during his ( and my ) youth ; he is opposed to them and so am I .
They not only accomplish little besides raising the price of grapes and ham , they also encourage economic tunneling ( the basis of Counter - Economics ) by the Other Side .
But these are economic issues ; what in the ( political ) world do they have to do with voting ?
A political vote would be represented in micro something like this : you can choose someone who will shoot A ( or break his promise and do something else ) or choose someone else who will let A live but torture him ( or break his promise and shoot him ) or maybe a radical third choice who will let A live and torture him for only a reasonable , definite period ( or break his promise , etc . ) .
The choice you are looking for , of letting A go or giving him a medal for his subversive acts , is not and can not be offered .
In the famous libertarian slogan of the 1960s , if voting could change anything , it would be illegal .
Exactly .
Hence , when Bradford confronts Wendy McElroy with what he perceives as a strange choice of shooting Adolph Hitler ( assuming one has full knowledge of the statist acts he will commit and that doing so will somehow lessen those acts --- or maybe just because he has many times over forfeited his right to life and it will feel good to eliminate his existence ) rather than voting against him , it is Bradford who wallows in absurdity .
Editor Bradford may assert that WMcE has the deciding vote , but that situation is itself fantastic in the real world ; sooner you would see simians ejected rectally .
She would need both time - travel knowledge of the degree of evil ur - Hitler represents ( as any revisionist could tell you , about the same order of magnitude as FDR ) and the knowledge that her one vote could topple him from power ( whereas a well - aimed bullet is known by all to have that effect ) .
Bradford goes on desperately to argue that voting does not confer any legitimacy on the State .
In one sense he is right ; the correct phrase should be that it casts the illusion of legitimacy on the State which can never have true , natural - law legitimacy .
But I thought Bradford did not " believe " in Natural Law ( or anything else to do with reality , it seems ) ; hence , why should he worry about the subtle distinction between legitimacy and legitimization ?
The depth of his desperation is in the following paragraph of Editor Bradford :
Where is the parallel , Bill ?
Rational , scientific inquiry disproves the legitimacy of the Marxist state .
We fought them on their own grounds and won .
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism all have strong anarchist factions ; we lose nothing by using them as well .
But voting is an act of Statism ; it has no other meaning .
How about " we need not deny the legitimacy of taxation or the legitimacy of warmaking to deny the legitimacy of the Marxist / Medieval State " ?
Why not ?
They must be denied for every State and all States .
Similarly , the means of plunder and its distribution must be denied legitimacy .
And the means of selection of its rulers and so on .
Wherein lies the problem , Editor ?
There is nothing to be gained by voting by any moral person ; hence , why should one do so ?
One real howler was the attempt by Bradford to shame WMcE ( she worried about Hitler being replaced by another Nazi ) by saying , " What reality is McElroy living in ?
When Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet allowed himself to be voted from office in 1988 , did another of his ilk take power in two seconds ?
How about when Jaruzelski was voted from office in Poland ?
Or the Sandinistas in Nicaragua ?
"
In all these cases , the answer was a clear YES , Bill .
Pinochet remains in control of the Chilean state .
Jaruzelski was replaced by another statist who continued and continues to this day the oppressively huge role of the State in Polish affairs that even Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was unable to reverse once he succumbed to incumbency .
And the Sandinistas remain armed and in control of as much of Nicaragua as they had before the election they lost ( before they realized that they had lost the support of the masses ) , poised to regain all at a slip from the opposition .
( Again , the only contender who had libertarian support , Eden Pastora , was marginalized out of serious contention . )
Bradford 's subsequent comparison of Stalin and Roosevelt are even more ahistorical ; talk about being caught with a dropped context in public !
A reasonable argument would be of the form was Stalin , relative to the Czars , worse than Roosevelt , relative to Hoover and Coolidge ?
( The argument is less interesting , actually , if you compare them to their respective , relatively libertarian predecessors , who were considered incompetent by Statist court intellectuals : Czar Alexander II and President Warren G. Harding , both of whom actually reduced the size of the State they inherited and both of who died early in office or were assassinated ) .
Yeltsin may be better than Stalin , but who would have known they would ever get anything better than Khruschev ?
Come to think of it , when they finally did do in Stalin , they got Khruschev .
And FDR 's death led to Hiroshima Harry .
These are significant moral choices ?
Bradford , a bit earlier in his argument , insisted that voters were not responsible for their acts under the criterion that one needs to know the consequences of what one does to be blamed for them .
Libertarians are not interested in blame but in assigning guilt ( that is , responsibility and liability ) for the purposes of Restitution .
If you trip and fall through a pane of glass or if you throw a rock through it , you owe the glass owner the cost of replacing the glass plus the time it was out of his possession .
Your motive is far less interesting to the victim than the promptness of your restitution .
Bradford excites us , as did Lyndon Johnson 's 1964 handlers , with images of a young girl chasing butterflies onto someones property and that of a burglar trespassing with different motives .
Did she pick any daisies , Bill ?
Set off any nukes ?
But why would any Libertarian oppose the reasoning that if the girl did only a dollar 's worth of damage to the grass and daisies , she should be liable for it ?
And if all the burglas did was to step on the grass and daisies , then he owes a dollar ( or tenth - gram of gold , or whatever ) ?
Finally , if the little girl chasing butterflies spotted the Mazarin Stone lying on a garden table and walked off with the pretty object , is she exempt from returning the million - dollar diamond because of her age , gender , or her appeal to Editor Bradford ?
Similarly , if the burglar grabs the diamond and runs , and is caught , then he too is liable for restoring it to the rightful owner .
Voters are participating in the spoils of statism and they are surely aware of it .
One only need skim the columns with which Bradford fills the pages of Liberty , of supposedly hard - nosed political experts who analyse voting patterns in terms of interests and pay - offs , for verification .
They , by and large , know what they are doing and they ( morally ) should stop .
Most to the point , thanks to Bob LeFevre , Wendy McElroy , George H. Smith , Sy Leon , not to mention Victor Koman 's and my own humble contributions , there are no libertarians beyond ideological infancy who are unaware of the arguments against voting , parties and collaboration with the State .
Anyone aware of the argument , that is , anyone assumed to be reading Bradford 's article , is no innocent .
The other paragraph in which Editor Bradford reveals his moral three - card monte is his penultimate one .
Even most " voting is tolerable " libertarians concede that the act is corrupt , disguesting , vile and we would be better off without it .
Hence , the last thing we would want anyone whom we are trying to influence is to see us in this compromising position .
But what does Editor Bradford counsel ?
In our society , there are many means of convincing our fellows to change their opinions .
We can try to educate them .
We can try to stimulate others to to educate them .
We can set good examples by trying to live exemplary lives .
We can organize debating societies .
We can write book about feminism , or publish magazines .
We can do research or explore the frontiers of social thinking .
And , if we choose , we can run for office , using our campaign to spread the proposition that liberty is good .
No , Editor Bradford , we cannot , whether or not we chose .
An election campaign is not an educational endeavour , it is the opposite .
Candidates cash in on the prior education done by activists , and then distort and dilute it to pick up a few marginal votes .
No one who voted Libertarian ever was educated into Libertarianism via a political campaign .
First , they read Robert Heinlein , Ayn Rand , Thomas Szasz , Wendy McElroy , or maybe even NEW LIBERTARIAN or Liberty .
THEN they went out and voted --- or not .
I could let Editor Bradford 's argument collapse at this point but these non-arguments Bradford himself heard demolished a quarter century ago when Don Ernsberger ( since sold out and run for office ) made them .
The question arises as to why he is motivated to pursue this error even though he knows better .
To be blunt , what 's in it for Bill ?
Perhaps he wants Liberty to be a big tent ?
But he is familiar with NEW LIBERTARIAN 's history and that we have no trouble getting writers from all factions by the simple expedient of not editing them .
Apparently , an open publishing policy is far more to be feared by Editor Bill .
And he could have kept his party / anti-party neutrality by simply saying nothing .
Yet he says , " I reluctantly have decided to take the issue up here .
" As an editor myself , I am aware of the possibilities ; the main one is that the editor gets the last word .
( Remember , in the Natural Law debate in NL , I put forward no argument until the debate was to be concluded and that issue is yet to be published . )
Hence , Editor Bradford may be motivated by having the last word and letting the more gullible libertarians assume that he somehow won the argument and they can now go and vote .
Coincidentally , the issue came out at election time .
But this does not answer why he was motivated to use editorial trickery against WMcE .
The voting issue is not trivial ; if it were , he would not have wasted Liberty 's precious space .
On one side are revolutionary agorism , counter - economics , the rapid abolition of the State and permanent elimination of voting ; on the other are conservatives who like sex and drugs , continuation of taxation , imperialism , incarceration , regulation , and . . . voting .
Counter - Economics brought down the Berlin Wall ; the most Bradford himself can see voting has accomplished is a cut in the New Zealand income tax from 66 % to 33 % ( Liberty , March 1997 , p.14 ) .
If that is the most you can imagine libertarians achieving , Bill Bradford , you do n't need Wendy 's or my utterances of damnation ; you 're already in Hell .
Now , if you dodge that pitchfork and leap over that fiery pit , you can still register in time to select your chief tormentor : I hear Screwtape is running against Wormwood on a platform of 33 % fewer lashes . . .

Some years ago , I converted the text of a talk I gave at a 1995 Liberty conference into the article
Why I would not vote ... even against Hitler .

At the time , my speech sparked a counter article by Liberty editor Bill Bradford and a heated rebuke to Bill from founder of Left Libertarianism Samuel E. Konkin III , both of whom are now deceased .

One British person said , " America did n't become the nation it did with guns and tanks ; it became the nation it did with ideas .
An Obama presidency represents everything that America has told the world about itself in the past century -- and what the rest of the world wanted to expect out of America .
The idea that you talk before acting , the idea that you make friends , not enemies , and the idea that anything is possible . "
Another Italian told me , " Obama will cause my country to fall in love with America again . "
Soft power ?
Oil prices leaped to another record high yesterday as Israel warned Iran about its nuclear sites and the dollar slumped on news of the biggest jump in US unemployment for 22 years .
Global crude ended a run of lower prices as it jumped by more than $ 11 a barrel to more than $ 139 - it has risen more than $ 17 in two days .
The price eventually settled at $ 138.54 .
On Wednesday the price had fallen to as low as $ 122 .
Already jittery oil markets were sent into spasm by remarks from Israel 's transport minister that an attack on Iranian nuclear sites looked " unavoidable " .
Any attack on the country would threaten supplies from the whole region .
Prices were also boosted by a prediction from investment bank Morgan Stanley that crude may reach $ 150 by July 4 .
Earlier in the day the dollar had fallen against the euro partly on speculation that the European Central Bank may consider raising interest rates to curb inflation .
Then markets were rocked by a report showing US unemployment suffered its biggest monthly rise for 22 years .
Shares dived after the US unemployment rate unexpectedly jumped to 5.5 % , intensifying fears that the world 's biggest economy is sliding into recession .
The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 400 points , more than 3 % , to close at 12,209 .
In London , the FTSE 100 closed the week down 1.5 % , or 88 points , at 5,906 .
The US Labor Department said non-farm payrolls fell by 49,000 in May from the month before .
That was broadly in line with expectations but the department revised its April figure to show a drop of 28,000 rather than the 20,000 estimate it made last month .
The unemployment rate jumped from 5 % in April to 5.5 % , the biggest rise since February 1986 and the highest rate since October 2004 .
As stocks tumbled , so did the dollar , which shed nearly a cent against the euro .
Bond prices moved sharply higher as expectations of any near - term increase in interest rates subsided .
Gold futures jumped 2 % , to $ 891 an ounce as investors , taking fright , sought a safe haven .
There were substantial job losses last month in construction industries , where 34,000 cuts were made , in manufacturing , where 26,000 jobs were lost , and among providers of professional services , where 39,000 jobs went .
" The overall trend is clearly weakening , with the unemployment rate having increased by a full percentage point over the past 12 months , " said James Knightley , an economist at ING Financial Markets .
" This will continue to depress consumer spending - the fiscal package is being fully swallowed by higher gasoline prices - and will , in our view , help to keep activity depressed for longer than financial markets are currently discounting . "
Nigel Gault , chief economist at Global Insight , said : " The rise in unemployment throws some cold water on the idea that the Fed will soon raise interest rates to prop up the dollar and rein in inflation .
The Fed is in a difficult spot with first - half growth not far above zero , but inflation climbing .
We believe that the economy is too fragile for a rate hike before 2009 . "
The two faces of modern religion were on stark display in Britain this week .
In Canterbury , the much - abused anti-war archbishop , Rowan Williams , used his Easter sermon to launch a powerful attack on individualist consumerism and " the greed of societies that assume there will always be enough to meet their desires - enough oil , enough power , enough territory " .
Meanwhile in Edinburgh , the conservative Cardinal Keith O'Brien , leader of Scotland 's Catholics , denounced the government for a " monstrous attack on human rights " through its " evil " endorsement of " Frankenstein " experiments .
There are clearly serious arguments about the government 's embryology bill and its licensing of the use of empty animal eggs for short - term human stem - cell research into life - destroying diseases , but the message from the cardinal 's outburst was plain : in his wing of the church , the policing of sexuality and procreation trumps the cause of human suffering and liberation every time .
For the militant secularists whose voices have grown ever louder in recent years , O'Brien 's is the only face of religion that matters .
This has been the decade of liberal rage against religion , reflected in the runaway success of books like Richard Dawkins ' The God Delusion and Christopher Hitchens ' God Is Not Great .
In the eyes of secular absolutists - whose attitudes uncannily mirror those of religious literalists - religion is simply an intellectual travesty , a perverse belief in a supernatural being and an affront to the enlightenment that refuses to die .
As the novelist Martin Amis declared recently : " Opposition to religion occupies the high ground , intellectually and morally . "
Entirely missing from their perspective is the social context and significance of the religious resurgence they are so anxious to beat back .
Panicked by the rise of radical Islamism and the newly assertive religious identity of migrant communities in a secular Europe , the anti-religious evangelists are increasingly using atheism as a banner for the defence of the global liberal capitalist order and the wars fought since 2001 to assert its dominance .
At the same time , they are unable to recognise the ethnic dimension of their Islamophobia , let alone the deeper reasons why people continue to search for spiritual meaning in a grossly destructive economic environment where social alternatives have been pronounced dead and narcissistic consumption is king .
Historically , of course , it was the left , rather than liberalism , that was most hostile to religion .
From Tsarist Russia to Tibet , after all , organised religion stood with the established order , preaching social deference to the powers that be and leaving hope of justice to the hereafter .
But as religion has declined in Europe and elsewhere and capitalism has eroded the ties binding religious institutions to ruling elites , that has become ever less true .
In the wake of the cold war , the pressure on the Catholic church to struggle against godless communism disappeared , and the pope who had played such a key role in its demise became one of the few international figures in the 1990s to speak out against " savage capitalism " and western warmongering .
At the same time , Islamist groups which had provided crucial support for conservative pro-western regimes around the Muslim world in the postwar era began to fill the political space left by the decline of Arab nationalism and the left , increasingly drawing their support from the poor and marginalised .
Religion cannot but now find itself in conflict with the unfettered rule of money - a capitalism that seeks to dominate exactly the social and personal arena which religion has always regarded as its own preserve .
And as it becomes less useful as an ideological prop for power , religion 's more radical and anti-establishment strains have become stronger .
That is the context in which , for example , Hugo Chávez of Venezuela declares Jesus as the first socialist and Che Guevara - style images of the founder of Christianity are carried on demonstrations in Caracas .
Not that there should be any difficulty in extracting a radical social message from religious traditions , though you 'd never know it from grim textual exegesis favoured by the militant secularists .
The rightwing bishop Michael Nazar - Ali - who recently blamed multiculturalism for supposed " no - go " Muslim areas - tried to argue at the weekend that Jesus had been guilty of " typical Middle Eastern exaggeration " when he warned that " it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God " : a hard case to sustain , given the similar message of downfall for the rich and liberation for the poor in the Magnificat , the sermon on the mount , Jesus 's exhortatory quotations from the prophet Isaiah , or the even more militant epistle of James .
No wonder the medieval church tried so hard to prevent people reading such incendiary stuff in their own language .
But similar demands for equality and social justice can of course also be found in Judaism ( " you shall not oppress a stranger " ) , Islam ( " a white has no superiority over a black nor a black over a white " ) , and other religions .
None of that is to deny the strength of regressive trends within religion and its texts , from the Vatican 's opposition to contraception in Aids - blighted Africa , to Hindu nationalism , takfiri Islam , or the power of rightwing US evangelicals ( though that is mercifully now loosening ) .
Nor does it in any way imply compromise with social conservatism over women 's or gay rights .
But it does highlight the scope for stronger alliances between the secular left and religious progressives against poverty , capitalism and war - an engagement that has the potential to change both sides in other ways , too .
The National Union of Teachers ' proposal for secular schools to offer religious instruction as a way out of the faith school controversy is one such positive attempt at engagement .
Just as the French republican tradition of liberation came to be used as a stick to beat Muslims in a completely different social context from which it emerged , so the militant secularists who fetishise metaphysics and cosmology as a reason to declare the religious beyond the liberal pale are now ending up as apologists for western supremacism and violence .
Like nationalism , religion can play a reactionary or a progressive role , and the struggle is now within it , not against it .
For the future , it can be an ally of radical change .

Terry Holt , a spokesman for Mr. Zell , referred all questions about the deal to Gary Weitman , a spokesman at Tribune .
Mr. Weitman declined to comment .
In an e-mail message to employees , the chief executive , Dennis J. FitzSimons , said Tribune still hoped to close the transaction by the end of the year .
He also said that the company would “ seek an expansion of cross - ownership relief ” beyond what was contained in Mr. Martin ’s plan .
Commission officials said that Tribune representatives had been in discussions with officials to try to come up with a way for the commission to provide enough of a signal of its intentions to satisfy the bankers .
But for media deals in the future , it is unclear whether the new rules will make it significantly easier for conglomerates to own both a newspaper and a station in most markets .
In telephone briefings with reporters , Mr. Martin said the commission would consider granting exemptions if other combinations were in the public interest , but that the “ presumption would be against them . ”
The proposal would require the commission in granting exemptions to consider the level of media concentration and make a finding that the companies involved would increase the amount of local news .
It would require a commitment that both the newspaper and the station exercise independent news judgment .
Finally , the commission would be obliged to consider the financial condition of the newspaper , and whether the owner was committed to invest significantly in the operations of a paper in distress .
In announcing his plan , Mr. Martin said he sought to strike a compromise that would assist what he said was a financially ailing newspaper industry while trying to be sensitive to concerns about the effects of media consolidation on the quality of news coverage .
“ The newspaper industry has faced significant challenges recently and I feel we have to do all we can to ensure we continue to have a vibrant industry , ” Mr. Martin said .
The telecoms who are being sued for their cooperation in the government 's illegal warrantless surveillance program have received billions in government contracts .
According to Washington Technology magazine , Verizon received $ 1.3 billion , Sprint $ 839 million and AT&T $ 505 million in federal prime contract revenue for fiscal 2007 , for a total of $ 2.6 billion .
While the companies have been government contractors for a long time , it still represents a significant increase in revenue .
Telecom apologists like to suggest that the communications companies ' motivation was not financial .
As Judge Walker noted when examining EFF 's allegations of dragnet surveillance : " AT&T cannot seriously contend that a reasonable entity in its position could have believed that the alleged domestic dragnet was legal . "
Yet , the prospect of $ 2.6 billion per year can go a long way to explaining why an industry might cooperate with a program far outside the limitations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) , despite the difficulty of believing it was legal .
Note that the numbers represent publicly available information for prime contracting only and do not include subcontracting revenue .
Any monies paid for the secret NSA surveillance program would be in addition to the public contracting numbers .
According to former Qwest chief executive Joseph Nacchio " the government withdrew opportunities for contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars after Qwest refused to participate in an unidentified National Security Agency program that the company thought might be illegal . "
In light of these allegations and the vast sums awarded to the participating telecoms , before Congress votes on the pending FISA legislation or considers any form of immunity for the telecoms , it should hold thorough hearings , and find out if there was any quid pro quo .
When the next president takes office in January , he or she will likely receive an intelligence brief warning that Islamic terrorists will attempt to exploit the transition in power by planning an attack on America , intelligence experts say .
After all , that is what happened to Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush at a time when their national security teams and their counterterrorism plans were in flux .
Islamic terrorists bombed the World Trade Center in February 1993 , in Mr. Clinton ’s second month as president .
Al Qaeda ’s Sept. 11 attacks came in the Bush presidency ’s first year .
The strikes on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon happened as the White House national security director was formulating a comprehensive plan for combating Osama bin Laden ’s terror network , which had declared war on the United States .
The pattern is clear to some national security experts .
Terrorists pay particular attention to a government in transition as the most opportune window to launch an attack .
“ If I were asked by the newly elected president , I would strongly encourage him to be extremely vigilant during the transition period and within the first six months of his administration against an attack by al Qaeda on American interests at home or abroad , ” said Bart Bechtel , a retired CIA operations officer and assistant chief academic officer at Henley - Putnam University .
Mr. Bechtel said he thinks al Qaeda operatives will debate a future course based on who is elected .
Both Sens. Hillary Clinton and John McCain serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain , a former Navy fighter pilot , have had extensive exposure to military security issues .
Both have attacked first - term Sen. Barack Obama ’s ability to handle national security .
Mr. McCain , Arizona Republican , has focused on Mr. Obama ’s stated willingness to meet with any world leader , including Iran ’s , without preconditions .
Mrs. Clinton , New York Democrat , ran TV ads implying Mr. Obama is not qualified to manage an international crisis .
“ I could see al Qaeda waiting to determine who was going to be the president and depending on which it is , taking an initial measure , ” Mr. Bechtel said .
“ For instance , Obama may be viewed as someone who will accomplish what al Qaeda would like him to do , which is get out of the Middle East , and give him an opportunity to move in that direction .
Failing that , they may decide to test him with a substantial attack on America or some American interest and see how he reacts . ”
A U.S. intelligence official declined to comment on how the next president will be briefed .
Mr. Obama , Illinois Democrat , has vowed to remove all combat troops from Iraq within 16 months .
He regularly has referred to the war against terror as centered in Afghanistan , while the Bush administration takes a broader view and sees Iraq as an opportunity to inflict a battlefield loss on al Qaeda .
The White House has trumpeted the fact that the county has suffered no homeland terror strikes since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Retired Gen. Merrill McPeak , a former Air Force chief of staff and an Obama campaign co-chairman , told The Washington Times that Mr. Obama ’s rivals are underestimating his ability to meet a challenge .
Gen. McPeak likened him to Abraham Lincoln .
“ I think people are only now beginning to realize that Barack is not your run -of - the - mill , ordinary Illinois politician , ” he said .
“ He ’s more like another Illinois politician who everybody underestimated . ”
Gen. McPeak added , “ I feel bad about giving Barack advice because every time I do , I know that he ’s thought about it already .
So I would draw him aside and say , ‘ The minute you ’re inaugurated , you will be tested . ’
He ’ll say , ‘ Oh , you mean like Kennedy was with the Bay of Pigs ? ’
He ’ll show me some way that he ’s thought about that some time ago .
The guy is absolutely scary smart .
The real mistake al Qaeda can make is the one everybody else makes of underestimating the man . ”
Mr. Bechtel said bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders are likely weighing their next step right now .
“ They are in a wait - and - see situation right now , ” he said .
“ They run the risk , if they attack before the election , of really influencing the way the election goes , to their detriment .
If there ’s an attack , I really believe McCain is going to run away with the election , and I do n’t think they want that .
I think they really would like Obama as their first choice and Clinton as their second . ”
Kenneth Katzman , a terrorism specialist at the Congressional Research Service , said “ Al Qaeda has a pattern of testing new American leaders . ”
“ Even now , al Qaeda is probably trying to plan something for after the U.S. inauguration , ” he said .
“ I think to a certain extent , al Qaeda tested President Clinton ’s administration several times .
The response was ineffective .
I think al Qaeda concluded it could attempt something as ambitious as 9/11 , but concluded the time was better after a new president , who would not have time to review his strategy on al Qaeda .
The time settled on was the summer or early fall , after a new president was inaugurated .
They chose September because they wanted all the officials to be back at their desks from summer vacations . ”
A Congressional Research Service report last month noted that January will mark the first change in administrations since the 2001 al Qaeda attacks .
“ Whether an incident of national security significance occurs just before or soon after the presidential transition , the actions or inactions of the outgoing administration may have a long - lasting effect on the new president ’s ability to effectively safeguard U.S. interests and may affect the legacy of the outgoing president , ” the report states .
The report urges the Bush administration to deliver extensive threat briefings to the president - elect ’s national security team .
Congress foresaw such a need when it wrote the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 .
The law allows for presidential candidates to obtain pre-election security clearances for its chosen transition officials so they can immediately be briefed on security threats by the outgoing administration .
On al Qaeda ’s ability to attack America again , Mr. Bechtel said , “ I think they are still somewhat fractured .
If you want to look at it as a piece of window glass , it ’s broken , but there are lots of sharp pieces out there .
I think within the tribal areas of Pakistan , they feel pretty darn comfortable . ”

Life is a marriage ; to your wife , your family , your job , or your addiction .
In managing the relationships we form , we need to be very aware that the decisions made early on can be the most critical to their longevity and value .
Sensing that this already reads like a how - to book , the lesson is over .
To paraphrase a philosopher , “ the rest is commentary . ”
Learn it , learn from it .
Most of us tend to be at our very cores a little selfish .
Nothing is wrong with that – it ’s life .
We all want to get ahead and be happy , so we find ways of making that happen .
Is money the key to happiness ?
We are always taught that it most certainly is not , yet money seems to drive us anyway .
We work ; some of us even slave ( it ’s an East Coast thing , Californians seem to have a better grasp on the work - life balance concept ) , because we need to pay the bills necessary to survive ; if we are lucky we can even make enough to have a few things we want as well .
Is that happiness ?
Emphatically No !
But the alternative of living without the basics is certainly not appealing and unquestionably not a recipe for joy .
So here we are .
As my rich uncle used to tell me when we still spoke to one another – before family financials caused our relationship to be tested before a probate judge – “ Money wo n’t buy happiness , but it makes being unhappy a hell of a lot easier . ”
His own story is proof of that .
He ’s an ass , but he was right .
So my relationship with my uncle , who was essentially a father to me , soured with money as a catalyst – but I venture it had more to do with his maternal abandonment psychoses than anything else .
To say blood is thicker than water may be truthful , but while a simple compound of hydrogen and oxygen may not be sufficient to break family bonds , evidently those same bonds often prove to be no match against the more complex compound mixture of highly classified paper , cotton , and green and black ink .
Family is perhaps the toughest set of relationships to maintain .
Culture trains us to give more love to and accept more abuse from family .
What we do for our siblings , parents , children , spouses and related blood lines , and even for good friends , are things we may never consider doing for our neighbors .
Yet , we sometimes extend some of those courtesies in business for the purely selfish reasons of wanting a return on the investment .
For family , the return is often purely emotional .
When it comes to blood we allow a lot more leeway .
Actual marriage is different ; with the divorce rates soaring , it is obvious that the bonds between a husband and wife are often as tenuous as those with the people we have casual contact with .
It should n’t be that way , but we live in a disposable world today ; paper cups , cell phones , cameras and utilitarian unions between two people .
When it no longer makes us feel good , rather than struggling to make it work , we ’re just done with it .
So how do we make marriage work for both today and tomorrow ?
If I knew that answer I could replace Dr. Phil , making his kind of money .
Relationships are hard ; marriage is hard .
Why not just move on when it gets rough ?
We tend to thrive when our relationships are rooted in honesty .
Anyone without the moral courage to just deal with the truth and trust that it will serve his interests best will eventually get caught in his own web .
Without fail , we see it every day .
In politics , for example , we witnessed the fall of the former New York Governor , Attorney General and pursuer of truth and justice , the mighty Eliot Spitzer .
Congress members , senators , mayors , and presidents alike have all fallen because the lie they told became too broad and deep to cover .
Businessmen too have fallen ; take the executives at Enron and more recently with Société Générale , when a young futures trader Jérôme Kerviel lied about $ 7.18 Billion in losses for years , trying to maintain his status of looking good , driving nice cars and impressing the women .
Watch E !
Entertainment just once to see how the rich and famous marry and divorce one another .
It ’s like they ’re swapping Topps Company ’s Garbage Pail Kids trading cards .
Personal unions fail everyday because of dishonesty ; not necessarily cheating or adultery at first .
Sure , there are those who are just impetuously attracted to every pair of legs that walk into a room .
But for most , whose marriage starts with a genuine will to make it work and an understanding that we leave the urges and lusts behind us at the alter , the straying in those often begins after the romance and warmth have eroded over time due to smaller infractions , usually little white lies that grew .
What we often fail to do is truly be honest for fear that the hidden truths may scare away that perceived love of your life .
So we date , we court and we present an image that attracts .
We keep at bay the darkness we believe will cause a tipping point , tipping the wrong way of course .
That is the first mistake .
Someone may be smart , pretty , and loving , but if you believe she will turn on you if ‘ she really knew ’ whatever nefarious piece of history you ’re hiding , than I am afraid that you ’re in for a rude awaking .
You are also either underestimating your ‘ true love ’s ’ ability to love you , or in - fact , deluding yourself into believing that she is that love .
If you do n’t have enough trust and faith to share , it is hard to expect much in return when you ’re in dire need of the same .
Cleary there are always minor exceptions to every rule , but for the most part , if your relationship is not built on trust , perhaps it is not the relationship you want to believe it is .
The lines between success and failure can often feel fragile as an eggshell and as easily broken as a child ’s heart .
The ability to walk that line rests on one ’s own sense of right and wrong .
Honesty is crucial .
Goodness is necessary .
Business relies on it .
Deal honestly and in time , those you were upfront with may become your closest business allies .
When people spend their money to make money , they want to do it with people whom past positive experiences shone bright .
The adage of being nice to those you meet on the way up because they ’ll be the ones you may see on the way down is right , but not enough .
They ’ll also be the ones who help you continue rising .

It is almost impossible to mention religion without some debate issuing forth .
Fundamentalist Christians like to use the Bible as their sole source of “ revelation ” and will argue for hours from its pages .
Over history , people have developed strange misconceptions about the Bible and the tales it tells .
This list hopes to put down some of the more obvious misconceptions people have about the Bible .
10 Adam and Eve’s Fruit
Contrary to popular belief , Adam and Eve did not eat an Apple in the book of Genesis .
The fruit is not actually named at all – it is referred to only as the fruit of “ the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil ” .
The reason this misconception has come about is most likely due to the fact that in Middle English , the word “ apple ” was used to refer to all fruit and nuts ( except berries ) .
Over the centuries , this word has stuck in reference to the Genesis fruit .
[ Genesis 2:17 ]
9 Devilish Serpent
The serpent that convinced Eve to take the fruit from the tree of Knowledge and Evil is not referred to as Satan in Genesis .
He is known only as the serpent who was “ more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth ” .
Additionally , the term “ Lucifer ” used in reference to Satan comes from the Vulgate translation of Isaiah 14:12 – at no point in the Bible is Satan directly referred to by the name Lucifer .
[ Genesis 3 ]
8 Noah ’s Ark
We all know that the “ animals went in two by two ” … right ?
Wrong !
In fact , all clean animals went in in groups of seven , and unclean animals in groups of two .
According to Jewish dietary law , there are far more clean animals than unclean , so the majority of creatures entering the ark went in as a group of 7 .
[ Genesis 7:2-3 ]
7 The Ten Commandments
Considering the importance of the ten commandments to so many people , you would think they would have a clear idea of how they are defined , but most people do not .
The Bible does not list a consistent set of 10 commandments at all .
In Exodus , the list includes 14 or 15 “ statements ” .
Though the Bible does refer to a set of “ 10 ” rules , it does not mention them in the same sections as the list commonly known as the ten commandments .
Different Christian sects have divided the list of commandments up differently .
The Catholic Church combines the first 3 statements in to one commandment , and the Protestants combine the final two in to one statement .
You can see a complete list of the differences here .
To add to the confusion , there is also another set of 10 commandments called the Ritual Decalogue which includes laws such as “ Do not cook a kid in its mother ’s milk ” .
[ Exodus 20 ]
6 The Immaculate Conception
The immaculate conception is not a reference to Jesus being born without sin , but to his mother Mary .
Most Christians believe that all people are conceived with original sin ( the sin inherited from Adam and Eve ) but that Jesus was not .
Additionally , the Catholic Church teaches that Mary was also conceived without sin and this is where the term “ Immaculate Conception ” has come from .
[ Luke 1:28 ]
The Immaculate Conception is the conception of Mary , the mother of Jesus without any stain of original sin , in her mother ’s womb : the dogma thus says that , from the first moment of her existence , she was preserved by God from the lack of sanctifying grace that afflicts mankind , and that she was instead filled with divine grace .
You can read more about this on Wikipedia .
5 The Three Kings
No doubt most of us have heard the Christmas Carol “ We three kings of Orient are ; ” but in fact , the three “ kings ” are never referred to as Kings in the Bible .
Additionally , they are not referred to as a group of three .
The only reference to the number ‘ 3 ’ is the number of gifts they carried .
[ Matthew 2:7-11 ]
4 Mary Magdalene ’s Career
Nowhere in the Bible does it say that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute .
In fact , she is barely mentioned at all .
Aside from her presence at the ressurection , the only other thing that the Bible does say is that she was possessed by seven demons .
[ Luke 8:2 ]
3 The Prodigal Son
Contrary to popular belief , “ Prodigal ” means “ characterized by a profuse or wasteful expenditure ” – it is not a reference to leaving or returning .
[ Luke 15:11 - 32 ]
2 Emperor Constantine and the Bible
The Emperor Constantine did not define the canon of the New Testament at the first Council of Nicaea in 325 AD – in fact , the Council did not even make mention of the Biblical canon .
It was already defined by common use by the early 2nd century in the form in which it is still found in Catholic Bibles .
Another little known fact is the Emperor Constantine had no voting power at the council – he was there merely as an observer .
[ Canons of the Council of Nicaea ]
1 Changing Text
Some people believe that over the centuries , the Bible text has been altered to suit the ideologies of the editors .
In fact , there are only a very small number of textual alterations that modern philologists and critics consider intentional changes ; most are simply errors in spelling or copying .
Bart D. Ehrman ( a New Testament textual critic ) says :
“ It would be a mistake . . . to assume that the only changes being made were by copyists with a personal stake in the wording of the text .
In fact , most of the changes found in our early Christian manuscripts have nothing to do with theology or ideology .
Far and and away the [ sic ] most changes are the result of mistakes , pure and simple — slips of the pen , accidental omissions , inadvertent additions , misspelled words , blunders of one sort or another . ”
Aside from the removal of a number of books in the 16th Century , the text of the books that now comprise the full canon of the Bible , is essentially the same now as it was in the 2nd century .
[ EDIT : ]
Due to some comments , I thought it would be useful to add these notes :
The Old Testament was decided by the apostles and Jesus as they both used the Septuagint ( LXX ) :
“ Though the Early Church used the Old Testament according to the canon of the Septuagint ( LXX ) , the apostles did not otherwise leave a defined set of new scriptures ; instead the New Testament developed over time . ” [ Wikipedia ]
The New Testament as it is found today in the Catholic Bible ( not the Protestant bible – such as the King James Version – as they removed books in the 16th century ) :
“ Thus , while there was a good measure of debate in the Early Church over the New Testament canon , the major writings were accepted by almost all Christians by the middle of the second century . ”
Ibid .
For those who doubt the fact that changes have not been substantially made , I would suggest a comparison of the Vulgate ( 5th Century ) with the Douay Rheims – Challoner edition ( 18th Century ) which is the official English version of the Catholic Bible .
You can find the Vulgate here , and the Douay Rheims here .
Child Online Protection Act Would Impose Harsh Penalties For Using Protected Speech Online
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
PHILADELPHIA - The American Civil Liberties Union is in court today , once again urging the courts to uphold a ban on a law that criminalizes constitutionally protected speech on the Internet .
The Child Online Protection Act ( COPA ) would impose draconian criminal sanctions , with penalties of up to $ 50,000 per day and up to six months imprisonment , for online material acknowledged as protected for adults but deemed " harmful to minors . "
" The right to free speech online and off is a bedrock of American values , " said Aden Fine , staff attorney with the ACLU First Amendment Working Group .
" It is not the role of Congress to censor what information people can read and access on the Internet . "
Previously , a federal district court and a federal appeals court found the online censorship law unconstitutional .
The Supreme Court upheld the ban on enforcement of the law in June 2004 , sending the case back to the district court to determine whether there had been any changes in technology that would affect the constitutionality of the statute , such as whether commercially available blocking software was still as effective as the banned law might be in blocking material deemed " harmful to minors . "
In March 2007 , U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed , Jr. once again struck down COPA , finding the law violates the First and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution .
Judge Reed issued an order permanently prohibiting the government from enforcing COPA , commenting that " perhaps we do the minors of this country harm if First Amendment protections , which they will with age inherit fully , are chipped away in the name of their protection . "
The government again appealed , and the case , ACLU v. Gonzales ( originally ACLU v. Reno , then ACLU v. Ashcroft ) is again before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit today .
" For an entire decade , courts have been striking down the so - called Child Online Protection Act as unconstitutional , " said Catherine Crump , staff attorney with the ACLU First Amendment Working Group .
" COPA is fatally flawed and unconstitutional today , just as it was ten years ago and as it has since been found several times in the courts . "
The ACLU charges COPA is marred by unconstitutional flaws that are similar to the flaws that led the Supreme Court in 1997 to strike down Congress ' first attempt to censor the Internet , the Communications Decency Act .
Chris Hansen , senior staff attorney with the ACLU , will argue today at 2:00 p.m. EDT before Judges Thomas Ambro , Michael Chagares and Morton Greenberg of the Third Circuit .
The other attorneys on the case include Fine , Crump and Ben Wizner of the ACLU and Christopher Harris and Jeroen van Kwawegen with the law firm Latham & Watkins .

More than 61 % of women doing time in federal prison are behind bars for nonviolent drug offenses .
Women are now a fast growing segment of the U.S. prison population , largely because of draconian drug laws .
More than 61 % of women doing time in federal prison are behind bars for nonviolent drug offenses .
Women , and particularly women of color , are disproportionately affected by social stigma , by a plea bargaining system that punishes those unable or unwilling to inform on others , by regulations that bar people with a drug conviction from obtaining ( or that require a drug test to receive ) public assistance , and by a drug treatment system designed for men .
Women of Color
Black women are almost twice as likely – and Latinas are 20 % more likely – to be incarcerated than white women .
Native American women are incarcerated six times the rate of their white counterparts .
Drug use occurs at similar rates across racial and ethnic groups , but racialized women are far more likely to be criminalized for drug law violations than white women .
Black women are no more likely than white women to use illicit drugs during pregnancy , but they are far more likely to be reported to child welfare services for drug use .
Mothers
Roughly 60 % of women in state and federal prisons are mothers of minor children , many of them sole caregivers .
Removing a parent ( perhaps the only parent ) from a household is immediately destabilizing , and over the long - term , it ’s devastating .
Children with a parent in prison are several times more likely than other children to end up in foster care , to drop out of school and to become involved in the criminal justice system themselves .
Parents , once released from prison , may be barred from public assistance and housing and face significantly reduced employment opportunities .
Even women who do not use drugs may be required to submit to invasive and embarrassing monitored drug testing in order to obtain public assistance .
Pregnant Women
Pregnant women are uniquely vulnerable to criminal justice or child welfare involvement especially if they have admitted to drug use or have had a positive drug test at birth .
Prosecutors across the country have targeted pregnant women accused of drug use , supposedly in the interest of protecting their fetuses .
The criminalization of pregnant women is not only an affront to women ’s rights , but it puts both mother and fetus at greater risk by creating barriers to child custody , drug treatment and prenatal care .
Prisons and jails commonly use restraints ( handcuffs and shackles ) on women in labor and during delivery , putting the mental and physical well - being of the woman and fetus at risk .
Many prisons and jails also deny new mothers the right to breastfeed or express milk for their babies , stripping them of the choice in how to feed their own children , as well as the medical benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and child .
Medical professionals recommend that women who have been receiving Medication - Assisted Treatment ( MAT ) during pregnancy for problematic substance use should continue that treatment after birth in order to prevent relapse .
But some prisons and jails deny them this continued treatment , forcing them to go through rapid , painful withdrawal while they are recovering from childbirth and greatly increasing the chances of relapse after their release .
Women Charged with Conspiracy
Conspiracy charges represent one of the most egregious examples of the drug war ’s inequitable treatment of women .
Although conspiracy laws were designed to target high - level members of illicit drug organizations , they have swept up many women for being guilty of nothing more than living with or not cooperating as an informant against a partner or family member involved in some level of drug sales .
Harsh mandatory minimum sentencing may keep them behind bars for 20 years , 30 years , or life , even if they were never directly involved in drug sales or distribution .
Voices from the Front Lines of the Drug War : Susan Burton
Susan Burton is the founder and executive director of A New Way of Life , an organization that provides support and resources for women recently released from prison .
After her son was killed by the Los Angeles Police Department , Susan medicated her grief with alcohol and drugs .
Instead of receiving the support and services she needed , she cycled in and out of the criminal justice system for nearly fifteen years .
In 1998 , Susan gained her freedom and sobriety and founded A New Way of Life Reentry Project , which has served over 800 women and is a national leader in the struggle to break the cycle of addiction and incarceration .
Our Priorities
The Drug Policy Alliance is working to reduce the devastating effects of the drug war on women , particularly women of color .
We advocate for :
Regenerative medicine holds great - albeit not unlimited - promise for extending healthy life by replacing age - damaged tissue , and ultimately replacing age - damaged organs .
However , as for everything involving our biology , the path forward is not as simple as it might appear .
Repairing the damage of aging by simply replacing tissue - even assuming you 've repaired any age - related damage in the stem cells taken from the patient to use in therapy - runs into the interconnected nature of the body 's systems :
Tissue engineering for a new heart , plus the necessary understanding to repair any damage in your stem cells ?
One problem you quickly run into in this sort of thought experiment is that everything of importance is influenced by everything else .
New cells will be damaged by the old intracellular environment , as well as by the actions of old cells next door .
An age - damaged immune system can't protect rejuvenated cells in a new heart .
And so on ; I 'm sure you could list many more important connections that will trip you up if you replace only one component of the aging body .
This is a challenge for the near future of regenerative medicine - also known as cell therapy in its present form - as this paper reminds us :
Cell therapy is a promising option for treating ischemic diseases and heart failure .
Adult stem and progenitor cells from various sources have experimentally been shown to augment the functional recovery after ischemia , and clinical trials have confirmed that autologous cell therapy using bone marrow - derived or circulating blood - derived progenitor cells is safe and provides beneficial effects .
However , aging and risk factors for coronary artery disease affect the functional activity of the endogenous stem / progenitor cell pools , thereby at least partially limiting the therapeutic potential of the applied cells .
In addition , age and disease affect the tissue environment , in which the cells are infused or injected .
The present review article will summarize current evidence for cell impairment during aging and disease but also discuss novel approaches how to reverse the dysfunction of cells or to refresh the target tissue .
Pretreatment of cells or the target tissue by small molecules , polymers , growth factors , or a combination thereof may provide useful approaches for enhancement of cell therapy for cardiovascular diseases .
A challenge , but not an impassable barrier .
As I 've said before , present directions in research and funding culture suggest that the regenerative medicine research community - large and well funded - will soon be branching out into attempts to repair the damage of aging at the cellular level .
That is a natural outgrowth of trying to make cell therapies and tissue engineering work more effectively in the aged :
At 32 , Sheryl Grossman still shops for clothes at GapKids .
She drives her own car , a Toyota Scion , even though at 46 pounds she ought to be riding in a car seat .
She 's 49 inches tall and her hazel eyes , slightly tilted , give her an elfin appearance .
Her voice is light and high - pitched .
It is easy to mistake her for a little girl , and many people do , including the occasional pedophile — whose name she 'll record and pass on to authorities .
Grossman has Bloom 's syndrome , one of the rarest diseases the world has ever known .
Since its discovery in 1954 by a New York dermatologist named David Bloom , fewer than 300 people have been diagnosed with it worldwide .
Bloomies , as the afflicted call themselves , seldom grow taller than four and a half feet or weigh more than 90 pounds .
Their heads are small , their faces long and narrow .
Ultraviolet light , even on cloudy days , makes them break out in painful sores on their lips and butterfly - shaped rashes across their cheeks .
Most Bloomies develop cancer by their mid-twenties , usually in the colon or respiratory tract .
They are prone to diabetes , allergies , asthma , pulmonary disease , ear infections and immune disorders .
The men are sterile .
Bloomies die young , many well before reaching adulthood .
There is no cure , and no one with this genetic disorder has ever lived past 48 .
The Bloom 's gene is recessive and carried by just one person in a thousand .
Two carriers have a 25 percent chance of having a child with Bloom's .
One - third of all sufferers are Ashkenazim , Jews of Eastern European descent .
More than half live in North America and very few have ever met another Bloomie .
Neither have their doctors .
The scientists who study the disease concentrate on DNA and blood samples .
When it comes to navigating daily life with Bloom 's , patients are pretty much on their own .
Sheryl Grossman , one of an estimated 162 Bloomies alive today , was determined to change that .
A year and a half ago , she created a Web site called Bloom 's Connect , a place where victims worldwide could come together to compare their experiences and provide counsel on everything from disability benefits to where to buy shoes .
Through Bloom 's Connect , Grossman found 69 other Bloomies and their families .
They talked over the phone and by e-mail .
Last month in Chicago , Grossman staged the first annual Bloom 's Connect conference .
Seven Bloom 's patients managed to attend .
They came from four countries .
It was the first time more than two Bloomies had ever gathered in the same room .
Sheryl Grossman has 29 doctors .
She visits four or five of them every week .
She must balance 200 - plus doctor visits a year with a full - time job as a social worker and several part - time baby - sitting and teaching gigs .
She never goes anywhere without her datebook .
" It 's very tiring , " she says .
" Pain management is my main issue , but a lot of the visits are because everyone keeps shuffling me around . "
Most of her doctors are oncologists who monitor her closely , particularly after her bout with colon cancer three years ago .
There 's also her primary - care physician , the ear , nose and throat doctor , pain management and pulmonary specialists , the endocrinologist , the allergist , the neurologist , the ophthalmologist , the dermatologist and the ob - gyn .
When she has a mammogram , she needs an MRI because she 's too small to fit into the machine .
She has asthma and is so sensitive to cold that she keeps the thermostat in her University City apartment at 88 degrees year - round .
" Any air or water less than 76 degrees bothers me , " she says .
" It feels like millions of pinpricks .
The pain is the background of my life . "
Grossman also suspects it contributes to her constant fatigue , which at one point was so severe that she considered buying a motorized scooter to get around .
But she gave up on that idea when she could n't find a scooter small enough .
The colon cancer , meanwhile , has not returned , and she 's seen no signs of the diabetes , arthritis or thyroid problems that have plagued others with the disease .
" I 'm pretty healthy for someone with Bloom 's , " she says .
But because Bloom 's is so rare , many doctors have never heard of it , let alone treated it .
As a result , Grossman sometimes has trouble getting the medical care she needs .
" Once I was at an out - of - town conference , " she recalls , " and I started coughing up blood .
It was tangentially related to Bloom 's , a bronchial infection .
I went to the emergency room and they made a note in my file that I had come in because I was throwing up blood because I was anorexic . "
Even for a Bloomie , Grossman is unusually thin .
She has a small stomach and a bird - like appetite .
Her mother , Karen , says it can take her half an hour to eat a piece of chicken .
As far as liquids go , " I do n't like water , " says Grossman .
" The texture bothers me .
I 'll drink hot chocolate , though . "
An observant Jew , Grossman keeps kosher , which further restricts the food she 'll eat .
She hates to cook , mainly because she can barely reach the kitchen stove and countertops in her one - bedroom apartment .
Like other Bloomies , she relies on step stools and avoids the high shelves .
" It 's annoying , " she says .
" As soon as I buy my own place , I 'm getting the kitchen customized . "
Her size makes it difficult to buy clothes appropriate for her job .
" I have to be in business dress or business casual , " she explains .
" If I were a man , I could wear a boys ' suit , but all the dresses for five - year - olds are so frilly .
I 'm really picky .
I pay a lot for custom stuff .
I tell people they should learn to sew , which I , um , can't . "
Grossman 's wardrobe is a mishmash of finds from department stores and hand - me - downs from the girls she baby - sits .
She gets her hats at babyGap , size 12 to 24 months .
Whenever she or her mother finds a skirt or jacket that 's the right size , they buy two .
One of the unforeseen benefits of Bloom 's Connect has been the opportunity to swap clothes and shopping advice with other Bloomies .
Fashion discussions invariably return to shoes .
Grossman wears a child 's size 13 , too small even for custom shoemakers .
At the Bloom 's Connect conference , a flurry of excitement ensues over a store in New York that supposedly sells adult shoes , even high heels , in child sizes .
" Do they do mail order ? " asks Karen Grossman .
Alas , the store has closed .
The disappointment in the room is palpable .
" I hate walking down the street , especially on St. Patrick 's Day , " Sheryl Grossman confides .
" People pat me on the head and ask for wishes , like I 'm a leprechaun .
It 's hard to go to public places where there are exhibits .
I become one .
People are there to look at things that are unusual , only I 'm not in a cage or behind glass . "
Bloomies have devised various ways of coping with the constant staring .
Jason Hesch of Washington , D.C. , takes an agreeable approach : " When someone says , ' You 're short , ' I say , ' Yes , I am . ' "
" If someone makes fun of me , I 'll stare them down , " says Stacey Dentz of Monroe , New York .
" And then they 'll shut up . "
" I get it most in public spaces , like the mall , " recounts Grossman .
" A child with a parent will ask , ' Why is she so small ? '
Kids get it , but do n't .
I 'll go over and get down on the child 's level and say , ' I 'm short because God made me this way .
I 'm OK with it .
We 're all different . ' "
Still , Grossman admits it 's tiring to get stared at " 10,000 times a day . "
She tries to be philosophical .
" When someone has a very obvious physical difference , it can take more time to move beyond that , " she says .
" Normal may look different , but life can still be normal .
We go to school , have jobs , date , get our hearts broken , just like anybody else . "
Grossman encourages her fellow Bloomies to lead as normal lives as possible and insists that they apply for jobs that are not beneath them .
" The hard part here is convincing ourselves we can do high power work , " she wrote on Bloom 's Connect .
" Once this hurdle is overcome , convincing the workplace of the same becomes easier . "
Among the Bloomies in Bloom 's Connect , Stacey Dentz , 35 , is the only one who is married .
She met Eric , her husband of three years , on JDate , the Jewish dating Web site .
On her profile , she wrote that she had light brown hair and was four - foot - three , but did n't mention she had Bloom's .
" They do n't need to know , " she says .
As it was , JDate was difficult .
" Some people were so rude , " she says .
" They 'd be like , ' Omigod , you 're so short ! ' and I 'd be like , ' Screw you . '
Then there would be some guys who just wanted to see if they could get with a small chick . "
Sheryl Grossman has encountered men who pursue her mainly because of her tiny stature .
" These people recognize that they can get away with things with me that they can't get away with a child , " she says .
" They 're really looking for a child , and settling for me .
I can usually figure it out and then I string them along , just enough to get their name and phone number .
I jot it down as if I 'm interested , and then I turn them in later to the police . "
Stacey Dentz says height has never been an issue with her five - foot - eight - inch tall husband .
" He did n't see me as short .
He just saw me as me .
I mean , he cared that I have Bloom's , but he saw me for who I am . "
Dentz does her share of the household chores , including grocery shopping and laundry , and like Grossman and Hesch , drives her own car , a Subaru .
All three must raise the seats so they can see over the dashboard and push themselves forward with cushions so they can reach the pedals .
While Dentz has no plans for children , the unmarried Grossman wants a " tribe . "
" If I have a child with Bloom 's , " she says , " I 'll learn how to deal .
If I have a child without a disability , that 's OK , too . "
Grossman was a year old when she was diagnosed with Bloom's .
She was born at full - term , but small — Bloom 's babies weigh between two and four pounds — and she did n't grow .
Her parents did n't begin to worry , though , until the following summer .
" The first thing we noticed , " says her mother , " was when we took her out in the sun , she would get sores on her mouth and face . "
The Grossmans ' pediatrician referred them to a dermatologist .
" I give a lot of credit to that dermatologist , " Karen Grossman says .
" The first thing out of her mouth was , ' I do n't know , but I will find out . ' "
The doctor consulted with colleagues on the East Coast , and after three months of testing , they had a diagnosis .
Grossman had a relatively normal childhood in Flossmoor , Illinois , a suburb of Chicago .
She went to public schools and summer camp .
Her parents tried to hide the news that she had Bloom 's for as long as they could .
" We told her that she was small and would always be small , " her mother recalls .
" We told her what she needed to know , like that she needed to wear sunscreen .
We never went into all the aspects until she needed information . "
Grossman did n't learn the full truth until she was fourteen .
" It was traumatic , " she remembers .
" I was angry at the world .
I knew I had this condition and I was wallowing in self pity . "
In her sophomore year at Washington University , Grossman discovered Paraquad , a St. Louis organization that helps disabled people live independently .
" I did n't know I had the right to have the light switches in my room lowered instead of jumping up and down every time I tried to turn on the light , " she says .
" I felt validated .
Finally , I had the tools to mitigate my condition . "
That same year she met Alex Turtletaub through friends in the local Jewish community .
Turtletaub , three years older than Grossman , lived in Albuquerque , New Mexico , and was also a Bloomie .
" My eyes bugged out , " Grossman recollects .
" It was so rare of an experience , like finding a parent who gave you up for adoption .
We were more like each other than our families .
It was an instant bond . "
They compared their experiences and devised ways to live a normal life .
They refused to participate in medical experiments or take part in what they considered unnecessary preventative treatments .
" I was in college , " Grossman explains .
" I wanted to live my life instead of going from doctor to doctor . "
Most of all , Grossman says , " Alex and I were committed to forming a support group of other Bloomies .
We knew we were getting older .
Not many of us make it to adulthood . "
Turtletaub died of cancer five years ago .
He was 30 .
Grossman continued her search for other patients .
A year and a half ago , her friend Rabbi Hershey Novack of Wash .
U. Chabad , a Jewish student organization , suggested she set up a Web site .
He lent her his computer and helped her buy the domain name .
Within a week , she had her first contact , from Israel .
When Grossman learned that the University of Chicago planned to host a conference in late May for the scientists who study Bloom 's syndrome , she seized the opportunity to try and bring the entire far - flung Bloom 's community together for the first time — not just those with the malady , but also their doctors .
Grossman 's plan did n't work out as she 'd hoped .
The medical conference , with its presentations on genes and proteins , proved far too technical for anyone but seasoned researchers to understand .
Besides , the Bloomies were more interested in getting to know each other .
So while the scientists met at the University of Chicago 's Gleacher Center downtown , the Bloom 's contingent gathered at the University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center .
" The doctors ' research is n't really relevant to my life , " Grossman says .
But the scientists do have two things she needs : information the patients can pass on to their doctors at home and money .
Grossman put together the Bloom 's Connect conference on a $ 4,500 budget , most of it raised from registration fees .
But if Bloom 's Connect does not find financial support soon , it will die .
Jason Hesch , 26 , had never met another Bloomie , but now on this blustery Tuesday morning after Memorial Day , he 's about to meet six of them .
Hesch is nervous .
He does n't know what to expect .
He 's dressed formally in a suit and tie , and sits at a folding table with Sheryl Grossman , Stacey Dentz and Melissa LaCouvee of Ontario .
The conversation progresses haltingly , and when things turn silent , they glance across the room at their parents and siblings who are introducing themselves .
For the parents , the meeting is more emotional .
It is like a reunion of a family whose members have been separated far too long .
Looking over at the adult Bloomies , Sandra Mysler , whose twelve - year - old son with Bloom 's stayed home in Argentina , is too overwhelmed to speak .
Anne - Marie van den Hurk , from the Netherlands , begins to cry .
" I just want to bring up a normal child , " she says , wiping her eyes .
" It means so much to them to see an adult with this condition , " Grossman will say later .
" Bloom 's syndrome is not a death sentence .
We can live well while accepting our limitations and dealing with them . "
LaCouvee , eighteen , cannot stop staring at Grossman , Dentz and Hesch .
She looks delighted .
" She 's had a hard year , " LaCouvee 's mother , Linda , tells the other parents .
" She has no friends . "
As in other families , the Bloomies ' parents compare the growth and medical problems of their children and marvel at the strong physical resemblances between them .
" Melissa looks just like Sheryl did ten years ago , " Karen Grossman exclaims , " the spitting image . "
The adult Bloomies appear embarrassed to hear the personal details of their lives discussed so frankly by their parents .
" Sheryl had a lot of trouble getting her mammogram , " Karen Grossman announces to the group at large .
" Do you want to tell the story , honey ? "
Sheryl waves her hand wearily .
" No , Mom , go ahead . "
The three Bloom 's children have been spared the awkwardness of discussing how they feel about meeting other people who look like them .
Instead , Lindsay Zaslaw , three , of Hanover , New Hampshire , and Agnes Knol , five , and Toon van den Hurk , eight , both of the Netherlands , have gone off to another room with their brothers and sisters to color and watch Asterix DVDs .
" The kids are astounded to see all the little people , " reports Agnes ' mother , Beatrix , during a coffee break .
" When our kids saw Lindsay , they went ahhhh , because Agnes is so normal for them . "
Alex Turtletaub 's mother , Diane , flew from New Mexico to talk about her experiences raising an afflicted child .
" I feel like Alex is here with me today , " she begins during a panel discussion .
" Alex played soccer before his arthritis got too bad .
He was running around the field with boys twice his size .
I was terrified he would get hurt .
I think we do have a tendency to baby our Bloom 's kids because they 're small .
" My daughter accused me of babying Alex when he was 30 .
Mothers want to make sure everything is perfect for their children .
We wanted to let him know he was loved and respected for who he was , as much as any other child . "
" It 's hard , " says Dana Hesch , Jason 's 21 - year - old sister .
" Last year I helped him move into his apartment .
I was in charge of buying furniture and building it , since it was harder for him .
He had the box from IKEA with his dresser in a cart and was trying to push it , and the whole thing tipped over .
I got so frustrated .
I wanted to say , ' If you were n't like this , we would n't be doing this . '
I wanted to help .
But it was hard .
It sucks .
But I have to stop wanting what I can't have .
I have to continue to give him a hard time as his sister . "
Hesch , overhearing that last sentence , playfully flips her the bird .
" There 's one advantage of having Bloom 's syndrome , " says Hesch , who hopes for a career in politics .
" No one ever forgets me . "
" Hey Jason , " Dana asks , " if you had a choice between being you or being me , who would you want to be ? "
Hesch does n't hesitate : " I 'd be me . "
Sheryl Grossman leans her head against the back seat of the taxi and closes her eyes .
Its been a long two days .
" Miss , " the driver says , " you need to tell me where you 're going . "
Grossman opens her eyes and looks dazed .
Less than an hour before , she addressed a group of scientists at the medical conference about what Bloom 's Connect is trying to accomplish .
The medical community understands Bloom 's syndrome on a molecular level , but Grossman worries that they can't truly comprehend what it 's like to live with the disease .
" The scientists have the money , the power , the clout , that we do n't have , " she says .
" It 's important for the scientists to learn from us what we need in our lives .
We can give them faces and names and real - life experiences . "
The influence of Bloom 's syndrome extends beyond its tiny population of sufferers .
Says Richard Gladstein , a Hollywood producer and founder of the Bloom 's Syndrome Foundation : " It 's characteristic of people with Bloom 's syndrome that they get what everyone else gets , but they get it sooner . "
Dr. James German , a professor of pediatrics at Cornell University , has been studying Bloom 's for nearly 50 years .
He was the first to realize that Bloom 's is a genetic — rather than dermatological — disease .
During cell division , the Bloom 's gene , located on the fifteenth chromosome , causes a patient 's DNA to reproduce genetic gibberish instead of an exact copy .
The chromosome becomes unstable , and pieces of it break off .
This tendency toward mutation , German discovered , makes Bloom 's patients particularly susceptible to cancer .
What remains a puzzle is why Bloomies are so small .
Their cells are normal - sized , but they have fewer of them .
In 1960 Dr. German established the Bloom 's Syndrome Registry which has tracked 264 patients throughout their lifetimes .
Recently renamed the Bloom 's Syndrome Study Population , it remains the most complete source of information about the effects of the disease .
But because of confidentiality concerns , German will not release the names of patients in the registry , even the ones who ask for their names to be made public .
German , meanwhile , is dismissive of Grossman and Bloom 's Connect .
" She 's passing herself off as some sort of expert , " he said by telephone from his New York office a week before the conferences .
Though German has become close to some Bloom 's patients , including Stacey Dentz , he knows that others believe he is more interested in them as research subjects than as human beings .
" Some people complain that all the registry is doing is wanting blood , " he says .
" Well , that 's true .
We want to know about the condition . "
Grossman had hoped the other doctors at the medical conference would be more receptive .
" Our mission is to fill the gaps in your research , " she told them .
She relayed the Bloom 's Connect group 's request for more information to share with their doctors at home and asked for more financial support .
Afterward , several researchers , including the conference chair Dr. Vilhelm Bohr , gave her business cards and invited her to call them to discuss further collaboration between the scientists and Bloom 's Connect .
Despite her exhaustion , Grossman is elated .
" I think this is the beginning of a fruitful discussion , " she says .
" Dr. Bohr said he would be in touch .
I want this to work .
If he does n't follow up , I will . "
On her way back to University of Illinois at Chicago to say goodbye to attendees at the Bloom 's Connect conference , Grossman reflects on the progress they have made .
The families have already exchanged addresses and promised to keep in touch .
Jerry Hesch , Jason 's father and a Miami lawyer , has volunteered to help her incorporate Bloom 's Connect as a nonprofit charity .
For Grossman , the biggest surprise of the conference was the reaction of her own mother .
Karen Grossman had never before been very involved in Bloom 's Connect , but during this conference , she became Grossman 's main source of support .
" I want to thank Sheryl for putting this together , " she tells the Bloom 's Connect group .
" This has been amazing for her and amazing for me watching her . "
For the first time , Sheryl grows teary .
" I 've never heard her sound so proud of me before , " Grossman later reflects .
" I 'm really surprised she talked so much here .
It 's like it had all been bottled up for years . "
Back in St. Louis , Grossman sips a hot chocolate at the Starbucks in the Delmar Loop and tries to sum up what the Chicago conference meant to her .
" It 's hard to put into words , " she says .
" Ever since I was fourteen , I thought I 'd never meet someone like me .
And now I just met thirteen families at the same time .
I 'm in my thirties .
I 'm getting up there .
I want to leave something positive .
I did n't have much support when I was growing up .
Now things have changed forever for people with Bloom 's and their families because of this . "

Building Blot
This build process creates the following executables :
bin/app/blot-glut/blot-glut - image evolver & function grapher
bin / app / math / math - command line function eval
CMake is used to aid a platform independent configuration .
http://www.cmake.org/
Note - the build examples below try to keep build files completely separated from code .
However , be aware that the parser files generated by fnscanner .l and fnparser.y ( named fnscanner.cpp , fnparser.cpp & fnparser.output ) land in the code tree rather than the build tree .

Quickstart Guide
If you 've already downloaded and compiled Blot , then here 's the minimal set of things you need to know to start making pictures .
Blot 's interface is entirely keyboard driven , I 've not gone out of the way to provide any convenient menus or dialogs of any kind .
For this , I am truly sorry .
But , if it 's any consolation , it was really easy to write .
blot - glut Typing ' blot - glut ' in a shell runs Blot . h Hitting the 'h ' key in the blot window shows the list of interface commands .
mm Typing ' mm ' in the blot window mutates the current genotype , and displays a grid of mutation thumbnails .
double - click Double - clicking one of the thumbnails selects that one as the survivor and displays it .
single - click Single - clicking two different thumbnails selects both images for survival , and then mates them to produce 25 offspring .
Repeat mutation & mating as long as you wish .
s Hitting the lowercase 's ' key in the blot window at any time will save the current genotype or thumbnail view in the current directory .
I usually hit 's ' a lot .
S Hitting shift -'S ' in the blot window at any time will render the current genotype to an image file .
NB : Blot asks you for an image resolution in the shell window , not the Blot window .
u/d
Most history is saved in memory as you play , hitting ' u ' and ' d ' will go up and down the stack of images you create .
Q Shift -' q ' closes the Blot window and quits the program .
Examples
Evolving an image - a typical blot session Since much of the design of Blot ( or it 's lack thereof ) is a direct result of how I 'm using the program daily , here 's a description my own typical workflow .
Take as much or as little of this as needed , YMMV .
Starting Blot I make a new directory for every Blot " session " , because I save a lot of files while I 'm evolving , and because it 's easier for me to keep things organized by date with a directory for each day .
To make starting Blot easier , I added an alias ' sb ' to my zsh startup files ( ' sb ' stands for Start Blot ) .
I also added ~/ bin to my PATH environment variable , and put a sym - link named ' blot ' in ~ / bin which points to my release build of blot - glut .
With this setup , I start blot on a dual - core mac by opening a new terminal / shell window , and typing : > sb ; ./ blot - threads 2
Changing colors
My color scheme is intentionally very simple , there are two colors , one for positive numbers and one for negative .
The colors are multiplied by the magnitude of the expression , so very small numbers create dark colors , and very large numbers make bright colors .
I usually leave the colors desaturated so that very bright colors turn white , it both looks nice and gives the impression of using more than two colors .
By default , negative is blue and positive is red .
The RGB channels of positive colors are assigned to keys 5 , 6 and 7 , and negative colors are assigned to 8 , 9 and 0 .
Pressing a number will increase the value in its assigned color channel .
Holding the shift key while pressing the number will decrease the respective color channel .
So , for example , pressing 6 will make the positive color more green .
Pressing shift - 8 ( or '*' ) will make the negative color less red .
The brightness of all the color channels can be increased or decreased at the same time by using the up and down arrow keys .
Gamma can be increased or decreased by using the right and left arrow keys .
To reset color channels to their default value , press shift -' C ' .
To reset gamma use shift -' G ' , and to reset brightness shift - 'E ' .
( The ' E ' stands for exposure )
Setting the mutation rate
The global mutation rate can be changed by hitting the two - key combo 'm < n > ' where n is 1 - 9 , 0 , or ' - ' .
Typing m1 to m5 sets absolute mutation rates from 1 to 32 in powers of two , and typing m6 to m- set relative mutation rates similarly from 1/32 to 1/1 .
The default mutation rate is relative - 1/4 , meaning that when you perform any mutation operation , only 25 % of the nodes in the genotype will be affected .
Mutation & mating
To mutate a genotype , hit the two - key combo ' mm ' .
This will use a random combination of all the mutation types .
To only mutate using a specific mutation type , first hit 'm ' and then hit the letter corresponding to the mutation you want .
[ cvfwnaCh ]
c mutate constants only v mutate variables only f mutate function nodes only ( e.g. change operator types , etc. ) w warp mutations n node2arg - ( destructive ) collapse subtrees to a single node a arg2node - ( constructive ) expand a single node into a random subtree C Copy - replace an existing subtree with a copy of some other subtree in the genotype h harmonic mutation - add a copy of a subtree onto itself at higher frequencies Mating two genotypes can be performed by clicking on two different thumbnails from the selection screen , i.e. after mutating .
The two genotypes will be mated randomly , producing another selection screen .
Changing resolution
Blot starts in a low - resolution mode to make rendering very fast and interactive .
As soon as your image has higher frequencies in it , the default resolution becomes too low to evaluate your images .
To change the display resolution at any time , use the keys shift - 1 , shift - 2 and shift - 3 .
These correspond to pixel blocks that are 1x1 ( high res ) , 2x2 ( medium res ) , and 4x4 ( low res ) respectively .
high : shift - 1 ( 1x1 ) medium : shift - 2 ( 2x2 ) low : shift - 3 ( 4x4 )
Saving Hit 's ' to save at any time .
This will save two files into the directory that blot was started from :
A .bfn file that contains the current genotype 's expression , as well as color and view settings , and a .jpg thumbnail render of the genotype .
The save files are numbered automatically in the form ## #.bfn and ###.jpg .
The numbering starts at 001 and increases by 1 for every genotype that is saved .
Rendering
To interactively render a larger image of a genotype , hit shift - 'S ' .
Blot will prompt for an image size , in the shell window .
After entering the image size , e.g. 1000 , Blot will prompt for the jitter setting .
Enter 0 for no jittering , or 1 for jittering .
no jitter jitter jitter + resampling Jittering is used to trade aliasing in high - frequency regions ( such as jagged edges or moire patterns ) for random noise .
When such artifacts are present , I usually render an image with jitter on , at three or sometimes five times the final size I want , and then resize the image to its final size using a high - quality filter ( e.g. Photoshop 's " Bicubic " ) .
For example , the first two images above were rendered at 128x128 .
The third image was rendered at 640x640 and then resized to 128x128 with a Mitchell filter .
Graphing an expression Blot started its life as a function plotter .
To plot a one - dimensional function , include an expression which is a function of x on the Blot command line .
If the expression is a function of y , then Blot is started in two - dimensional mode .
Blot can switch back and forth interactively by pressing the ' 1 ' and ' 2 ' keys .
The list of built - in function types can be seen by running Blot with the ' - h ' flag .
> blot " ( sin (x ) + sin( 4*x ) ) * exp ( -x* x / 16 ) *
3 "
Defining new functions
The syntax for defining new functions looks like this : name ( param { , param ...} : body ) . > blot " gauss ( x : exp ( - x * x ) ) ; gauss ( x - 3 ) +gauss (x ) +gauss ( x+3 ) "
Seeding evolution with a specific expression
It is sometimes helpful , if you have a specific goal in mind , to build a basic structure for an image manually .
To do this , start blot with an expression on the command line as described above , then evolve from there .
You can also use this to initialize Blot with interesting basis functions , to make evolution faster or guide it in certain directions .
In this example , I start with three spots placed vaguely like eyes and a mouth to produce an alien face .
> blot " spot( x , y , cx , cy: sqrt( length ( x - cx , y - cy ) ) ) ; spot( x , y , - 1,1 ) * spot( x , y , 1,1 ) * spot( x , y, 0 , - 1 ) "
Animating ( blending ) between two images Animated blends between two images can be created either interactively or from the command line .
There are three blending types , the most common of which is the " tree alignment " blend .
To blend the top two functions on the stack interactively , go to the top image on the stack ( using 'u ' ) and then press ' T ' for a tree - alignment blend .
( Alternatively ' B ' for a " random " blend , or ' F ' for a " first - difference " blend . )
The resulting blend is a new function of variable t , where t ranges from zero to one .
The blend is displayed at t=0.5 , which gives some indication whether the blend animation will be interesting .
Hit 's ' to save the blend for later rendering .
To render an animated sequence of thumbnails from a blend , press ' A ' .
You will be prompted for the number of frames to render , in the shell window ( not the blot window ) .
After entering a number ( e.g. 20 ) , blot will render a sequence of thumbnails .
The animation can be quickly previewed this way by opening the sequence using the finder ( macos ) or explorer ( windows ) , and flipping through the thumbnails with your arrow keys .
To blend two functions on the command line , load both files with the ' - f ' flag , and blend with the ' - blend ' flag .
This will start blot with the blended genotype as the top function on the stack .
To render the animation without opening the Blot window , use the ' - anim < frames > ' flag .
For example , I rendered the sequence pictured above using the following command .
The files listed here are provided in the doc / images / prep directory .
[ doc/images ] > blot -f prep/example_blend_first.bfn -f prep/example_blend_second.bfn \ - blend - anim 10 - res 192 192 - threads 2
I also resized the sequence of images like so .
( zsh syntax w/ ImageMagick 's " convert " utility . ) > for f in 00 ?. jpg ; convert - resize 33.33 % - quality 95 $ f $ f:r_small.$f:e
Rendering a high - res image , from the command line
To render an image from the command line , pass the ' - o ' flag with the name of the output file .
The file type is saved as the type suggested by the filename 's extension .
Blot supports .jpg .tif .ppm .hdr /.rgbe .tga .png . > blot -f 001.bfn -o high_res.tif -res 2400 2400 - threads 2
The - threads flag should be used on a multi- processor and / or multi-core machine , but using more than one thread on a single - processor computer will slow Blot down instead of speeding it up .
The default number of threads is one .
Using ' math '
The ' math ' command line executable included with Blot was written mainly to test the parser and expression language that Blot is based on , but I also use it frequently when scripting as I do n't know of any other good , simple , infix command line expression calculators that are included in most * nix distributions .
( neither ' bc ' nor ' dc ' really cut it .
The shell ( e.g. zsh ) is n't that bad for arithmetic , but lacks functions ( e.g. sin ( ) ) )
Anyway ... > math " 1.1 + 2 " 3.1 > math " x=5 ; x * sin( 2+3 ) " - 4.79462 > for f in { 1,2,3} ; math " 3 - $ f " 2 1 0 > blot -f 001.bfn -o high_res.jpg - res `math " 320*7 " ` `math " 320*7 " ` > convert - resize `math " 100 * 1/7 " ` % high_res.jpg low_res.jpg
Visualizing genotypes A genotype 's structure can be rendered directly by displaying the tree - structured graph of nodes .
Blot will output GraphViz compatible " dot " files , by passing the " - dot " flag to Blot .
After GraphViz has been installed , " dot " files can be rendered using the GraphViz command " dot " . [ doc/images ] > blot -f prep/example_blend_first.bfn - dot test.dot > dot test.dot - Tjpg - otest.dot.jpg \ - Nstyle=filled - Nfontsize=24 - Nfontname=Times \ - Estyle=bold - Earrowsize=2 - Gnodesep=0.15

The semantic web has been one of the hot buzz phrases of the last few years .
The idea is that search engines are rubbish because they do n't really understand the meaning of what users are searching for .
But what if computers actually understood the context of the text that they were crawling ?
Semantic web advocates argue that such understanding would make searches much more efficient and allow for much more specific queries .
Some of the latest computer learning research , published in Science , shows that we use brain imaging technology to take some baby steps in the right direction .
The basic problem that faces the semantic web is that while a culture generally has an agreed - upon meaning for a word , it is hard to break that meaning up into symbols that a computer can understand .
One way to go about tackling this problem determine what symbols our brain uses to convey that meaning .
While we 're still a ways off from decoding the internal symbolic " language " of the mind , functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) indicates that meaning seems to be associative .
For instance , when a person is shown a picture of celery , fMRI pictures of their brain will usually show the part of the brain associated with taste activating .
The general conclusion is that objects are associated with sensory and motor control regions .
Unfortunately , it is not quite that simple , because other parts of the brain , primarily the frontal cortex , also light up , indicating that there is more going on .
Nevertheless , the associative patterns are strong enough that a trained observer can accurately guess the object being shown to a subject by watching the fMRI pattern .
In a twist on that observation , scientists have trained a computer using word associations and fMRI patterns to see if it could predict the fMRI pattern of nouns that it had never encountered before .
This was achieved by creating a neural network with an enormous text from which to gather word associations .
The network was then fed 60 nouns and a set of verb classes — from there it searched this text to correlate the nouns with the verb classes , creating a 25 - dimensional model for each noun .
Finally the network was trained on fMRI patterns for some of the nouns .
To test how well the model performed , the researchers made the network predict the brain activity patterns for nouns for which it had no fMRI data .
This worked significantly better than the rate expected by chance .
Furthermore , the model was able to construct fairly accurate fMRI images of some of the associated verbs , as well .
To test the model further , the researchers gave the network words that were not associated with any of the verb sets .
The neural network then successfully predicted the fMRI patterns for these new words , though not quite as accurately as for words within the training categories .
If you thought that was impressive , the researchers then tested it on similar nouns ( e.g. , corn and celery ) .
In this case , the model 's performance fell substantially , but was still better than chance .
This was expected , since the similarities mean that additional meaning has to be derived from other nouns — like color and shape , for instance — a process the neural network was not capable of handling .
Finally , the carefully chosen category set was replaced with a random one .
This set included verbs , nouns , and words that have little independent semantic value ( like " the " ) .
Using this category set , the neural network performed very poorly , though still slightly better than chance , probably due to the fact that there were still verb categories .
So what does this mean ?
For one , it adds a lot of evidence to the idea that humans develop their meaning for nouns associatively .
It also tells us that the primary associations that our brain makes for words are with sensory perception — a smell , for instance — or actions .
These have dedicated brain regions that are associated with them .
A noun then is instantiated in the brain as the set of actions and experiences associated with it , rather than some concrete independent object .
So what does this mean for the chances of the semantic web ?
These findings tell us that researchers looking for statistical associations between nouns and verbs are probably on the right path to generating contextual meaning for those nouns — even when they are used out of context .
However , there is a long way to go yet , and the chances of it improving search engine accuracy are limited .
This is because current algorithms are already semantic , albeit indirectly .
As an example , the much vaunted Google algorithm uses link maps to rank hits .
However , it tacitly assumes that humans do the linking , and that humans know what they are doing .
This builds the semantic aspect in , but the indirectness also leaves open a frustrating ambiguity that users must learn to overcome
Science , 2008 , DOI : 10.1126/science.1152876
In Germany , where newspapers and broadcasters have been fascinated by the American election campaign , several politicians and commentators have referred to Mr. Obama as the new John F. Kennedy , expressing fervent hope that he will reach the White House , not only because of his youth and background but also because he promises a radical departure from the Bush administration .
Reinhardt Bütikofer , leader of Germany ’s Green Party , said the election was of crucial importance for democracy .
“ I think this is a major historical moment , ” he said .
“ And it came about against all the odds .
What is most exciting is how Obama has been able to mobilize younger voters .
This is one of the most important aspects .
He can always be proud of that . ”
The enthusiasm was also clear among conservative politicians , such as Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg , the foreign policy spokesman for the Christian Social Union , the sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s conservative Christian Democrats .
If Mr. Obama becomes president , “ we will reach a new peak of trans - Atlantic romanticism , ” he said .
The enthusiasm spread to Brussels , where Jan Marinus Wiersma , vice president of the Socialist Group , which has 216 of the 785 seats in the European Parliament , said : “ Mr. Obama represents an agenda for change for which we in Europe are longing .
We hope and expect Mr. Obama to win . ”
In Switzerland , Miriam Behrens , the spokesperson for Switzerland ’s Green Party , said , “ Among the general public there is a tendency to support Obama .
He ’s perceived as a person who ’s very charismatic , and he ’s more open to a European approach to things .
That ’s very much appreciated here . ”
Some Europeans expressed caution about pre-judging Mr. Obama ’s prospects of bringing about the change he advocates in America .
“ It ’s clear that to affirm this change , there would have to be a victory in November , which is n’t at all certain , ” said Mario Del Pero , who teaches American history at the University of Bologna in Italy .
Nikos Karahalios , a top strategist of the ruling New Democracy Party in Greece , said the government in Athens “ is n’t playing the Republican or Democratic card game . ”
He continued , “ Greece , a small country struggling to make its mark in international affairs , has always had a history of siding by the underdog .
That ’s what Obama is .
That ’s why he ’s appealing to the Greeks .
“ How well Mr. Obama rebrands America is crucial for Greece .
It will determine how Greeks position themselves vis-à - vis the United States . ”
I have been following the Obama candidacy with great interest and hope .
No one in America can deny it 's historic importance regardless of their political bent .
But it is n't all rosy .
In fact , it 's very troubling .
Troubling on several fronts :
1. Anyone questioning Obama 's backgound and experience is immediately and hatefully marginalized as a racist .
2 . Many people , some normally in opposition to Obama 's positions , are supporting or considering supporting him solely because of the color of his skin ( Armstrong Williams , Juan Williams , JC Watts and many others ) .
3. Obama is proactively using the race card , to help accomplish # 1 above .
Of course this chills any honest political analysis and debate .
There was a time when I too , out of a wild and inappropriately empathetic " white guilt " would have supported Obama without question .
I would have denied it , but would have done the same thing I 'd always done - supported Black people in politics , sports , and other high profile pursuits not necessarily because they earned it or deserved it as individuals , but only because they were Black .
In fact , questioning whether they deserved or earned that support was in itself proof of meanness and racism , according to my guilt - ridden , misguided mind .
It was really the most inconsiderate and disrespectful kind of treatment .
It was a sort of pity that I ’m sure they all would have resented .
I 've since learned the incredible power of the TRUTH of Dr. Martin Luther King 's " I have a Dream " speech .
A truth untainted by politics and the pursuit of power .
Untainted by those who would use it for public manipulation for nefarious goals .
A truth untainted by well intentioned , but misguided guilt .
A truth and purity Dr King knew must be maintained .
He knew that all the progress he ultimately gave his life for could easily be undone .
Here 's an oft forgotten and rarely quoted passage from that speech with a chilling admonition for us all :
" ... But there is something that I must say to my people , who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice :
In the process of gaining our rightful place , we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds .
Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred .
We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline . "
While he does n't specifically address racism , the implication is clear .
We must not use the injustice of the past , and power of our unity in our righteous cause in such a way as to taint and thereby weaken the pursuit of our great objective .
We have ignored Dr. King 's warning for decades .
Most of us have probably never heard that portion of his speech .
Fortunately Mr. Obama 's candidacy has thrust Dr King 's concerns before us once again .
With Reverend Wright , Father Pfleger , William Ayers , and others being exposed some for the first time , others for the first time in decades , it 's difficult to deny just how far afield we have gone .
Whether these people have any bearing on the election or relation to Obama is relatively unimportant .
We simply must not loose this opportunity to recognize our misdirection , right our course and recommit to Dr Kings original ideals that were so long ago lost in the pursuit of political gain , personal power , profit and revolutionary schemes .
Then too , we must strenuously reject those regardless of race , creed or religion who seek to profit by those " wrongful deeds " and are " drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred " .
We are inextricably linked by the history of this great nation , Black and White .
People of ALL colors who call themselves American .
As Victor Frankl said , " there are only 2 races of humans , the indecent , and the decent . "
We must not allow ourselves to be pitted against each other by those who would seek to profit by our own indecent fear , hatred and envy .
We must discard the tired old clichés of victimization and powerlessness that encourages us to hate others and believe we can't succeed with out the hate mongers .
Here ’s how Dr King said it , " The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people , for many of our white brothers , as evidenced by their presence here today , have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny .
And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom .
We can not walk alone .
And as we walk , we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead .
We cannot turn back . "
We can not turn back .
The injustices of the past can not be undone .
We must move forward with a better understanding and purer vision .
Only then will we enjoy the finer justice Dr King sought .
I know many people , Black , White , Conservative , Liberal , who are going to vote for Obama because he is Black and they want to be a part of history .
I can only ask :
How does it feel to be a racist , and exactly how much racism does it take to eliminate racism ?
I would ask that all who plan to vote for Obama to carefully and honestly consider your motivation .
If it is because you have similar values and agree with most of his policies , then do so proudly and with a clear conscience .
If you are doing so because he is Black , then I would respectfully ask that you reconsider .
The rationalization behind racism , no matter how lofty , does n't purify it .
It is still ugly , ignorant racism .
We will enjoy for yet another season , the crops of racism that we have sown .
Many of us are finding the current political , cultural and racial situation surprising and challenging .
The truth is often difficult to grapple with .
But we are forced to search our souls and that ’s always good , even if a little uncomfortable .
Here 's a more popular and oft quoted part of Dr Kings historic speech that we all remember , and is particularly pertinent to this issue , " I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character . "
Well , I have a dream , too - that a President will be voted in to office because of the content of his or her character , policy positions and experience .
Not by the color of his or her skin .
The high plane of dignity and discipline demands it .

Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have spent $ 121 million combined vying for the Democratic presidential nomination , swamping the $ 57 million spent by all Republican presidential candidates through the primary season .
Obama spent nearly $ 75 million on television ads , while Clinton bought $ 46 million worth of spots to date , according to the Joyce Foundation ’s Wisconsin Advertising Project .
Republican John McCain , who essentially secured his party ’s nomination in March , has spent a paltry $ 11 million on 16,413 airings of his ads .
More than half of the GOP ’s ad dollars were spent by Mitt Romney , who dropped out of the race in February .
The Wisconsin Advertising Project calculated Romney spent $ 31 million boosting his failed candidacy .
All in all , the 2008 presidential candidates have spent nearly $ 195 million promoting their campaigns .
Democratic advertising made up the bulk of the spending at $ 135 million , while GOP candidates spent some $ 57 million combined .
Clinton , forced to lend her campaign personal money at two different points during the primary season , was able to put up 80,505 airings of her television ads .
Obama ’s $ 75 million bought 139,000 airings .
In the run-up to February 5 , “ Super Tuesday , ” Clinton and Obama spent roughly the same amount of money on ads .
Then , Obama upped his advertising budget .
From Super Tuesday through February 19 Obama ’s ad spending outpaced Clinton ’s by a 3 - 1 ratio .
During that streak Obama won nine straight primaries and gained 281 delegates to Clinton ’s 163 .
The Wisconsin Project ’s study said “ the advertising advantage alone , of course , does not explain Obama ’s victories in these contests , ” but notes “ in the nine states that Obama won in a two week period following the February 5 Super Tuesday primaries , Obama , not only had an advantage in the number of ads that he aired , but in most of the nine contests , he was also first on the air and had the paid media airways all to himself for a significant part of the short campaigns .
For example , in Nebraska , during the short nine - day advertising war , Obama was up alone , with his messages not countered for six days . ”
Obama was “ up alone ” in Wisconsin for six days , and in Maryland and Virginia he ruled the airwaves for 7 out of the 12 days of intense campaigning against Clinton .
Special interest groups supplemented Obama ’s spending .
The Service Employees International Union has purchased more than $ 2 million worth of ads to benefit Obama ’s candidacy .
This number includes an $ 800,000 negative ad campaign against McCain .
Likewise , the liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org and the environmental lobbying group Friends of the Earth has spent $ 373,000 and $ 138,000 attacking McCain , respectively .
University of Wisconsin ’s Ken Goldstein , who headed up the story , thinks McCain got off easy .
“ A big story in this campaign is the hundreds of millions that were not spent attacking John McCain in February , March , April and now May of 2008 , ” he said in a statement to publicize his findings .
He said the Democrats may regret their failure to spend significant amounts of money opposing McCain and building up their party in November .
“ By any reasonable measure , the Democrats should win the presidency and strengthen their control of Congress , ” Goldstein said .
“ If they do not , the money that was not spent early to define John McCain among voters in swing stats and to strengthen Democratic congressional candidates this spring may be one of the reasons . ”
For all the money that has been spent by Clinton and Obama neither of them has been named the Democratic nominee .
The Democratic primary will finally come to a close on when Montana and South Dakota hold their contests Tuesday .
Obama is expected to secure the nomination outright , by way of delegates won from those states and party “ superdelegates ” who will endorse him after the primaries conclude .
Clinton , however , is threatening to challenge party rules and possibly extend the nomination fight , and the Democratic battle for airwaves , until August .
Managing online traffic can be risky stuff .
Just ask Comcast .
The cable TV giant came under fire recently when it slowed a " peer - to - peer " transmission of the King James Bible sent as a test by an Associated Press reporter .
At two special hearings held by the Federal Communications Commission — one at Harvard and another last week at Stanford — the company was excoriated for delaying peer - to - peer traffic .
Peer - to - peer transmissions , which account for more than half of all Web traffic , enable computers to snatch music , data and video files from other computers .
To assemble one file , a peer - to - peer service can tap into dozens , or even hundreds , of computers around the world .
Comcast ( CMCSA ) , which has 13 million online customers , has been taking a low profile .
Executives Tony Werner , Comcast 's chief technology officer , and Mitch Bowling , senior vice president of online service , agreed to discuss the incident with USA TODAY .
According to Werner , the transmission slowdown occurred automatically when network congestion started to build in the Boston area , affecting other customers .
The King James transmission , which was small , did n't cause the slowdown , he says .
Once traffic loads got too high , he says , Comcast 's network automatically took steps to avoid further degradation .
The result : Some peer - to - peer traffic , including the AP transmission , got delayed .
But it was never blocked , he says .
The transmission " showed up .
It just took a little longer to get there . "
" The only reason you do something like that is to maintain consistent network performance , " Werner says .
At the FCC hearings , Comcast was criticized for throttling back peer - to - peer traffic as a network management technique .
" The technique is not unique to Comcast , " says Comcast 's Bowling .
FCC Chairman Kevin Martin says Comcast should be specific about its bandwidth limitations .
" Consumers have to be informed about what they are buying , " he says .
Comcast service contracts say " excessive usage " is banned , but no cutoff point is specified .
Bowling says there 's a good reason for that : " There is n't a specific limit . "
Bowling says Comcast considers incidents case - by - case .
Only a handful of people fall into the " excessive user " category , he says .
Pressed to say how much bandwidth consumption is too much , Bowling offers this : People who use " the equivalent of two T - 1 lines " — big data lines used by large corporations .
" I do n't think anybody could look at that as typical residential usage , " he says .

You All Meet in a Tavern ...
by David Morgan - Mar .
How many campaigns have begun with these immortal words ?
Probably too many .
This conceit has been used so often to introduce PCs to one another and begin a campaign that it has become a cliche .
Characters meeting for the first time at the beginning of a story is a classic device in literature , cinema , and television .
These sources give inspiration for vastly more possibilities than meeting in a tavern , however .
Another approach is to assume that the characters are known to each other before the campaign begins , either by reputation only , acquaintance , long friendship , family ties , or even rivalries .
Either way , a campaign has to begin somehow , usually by gathering the PCs together and giving them a common goal .
Here then are some different ways of assembling characters , either strangers , friends , allies , or enemies , into a group with a common motivation which can be the foundation of a campaign .
These are deliberately vague , and can be developed in many different directions by considering them in the context of a desired genre .
The Max Hunter Collection is an archive of almost 1600 Ozark Mountain folk songs , recorded between 1956 and 1976 .
A traveling salesman from Springfield , Missouri , Hunter took his reel - to - reel tape recorder into the hills and backwoods of the Ozarks , preserving the heritage of the region by recording the songs and stories of many generations of Ozark history .
As important as the songs themselves are the voices of the Missouri and Arkansas folks who shared their talents and recollections with Hunter .
Designed to give increased public access to this unique and invaluable resource , this site is a joint project of the Missouri State University Department of Music and the Springfield - Greene County Library in Springfield , Missouri , where the permanent collection is housed .
The materials on this website were digitized and transcribed from Max Hunter 's original reel - to - reel tapes and typewritten lyrics between 1998 and 2001 .
The project was led by Dr. Michael F. Murray , with assistance from Kathy Murray ( tune transcriptions ) and Mark Bilyeu ( lyric transcriptions ) from the Missouri State University Department of Music .
Marc van Roosmalen is one of the most famous biologists in the Amazon . *
Photo : Stanley Greene * Motoring up Brazil 's Arauazinho River during the rainy season is like navigating a lake full of trees .
The rust - colored water escapes its banks and spreads out across the rain forest , leaving the channel indistinguishable from the jungle around it .
Marc van Roosmalen , however , seems to sense the river 's course .
Perched on the bow of our small aluminum boat , the primatologist confidently directs our pilot up the main artery , and we head deeper into the Amazonian wilderness with every turn .
Thin and leathery , with a deep tan and a goatee , Van Roosmalen looks younger than his 60 years .
A Dutch - born naturalized Brazilian , he first came to this remote and untouched area of the Amazon more than a decade ago to study a biological El Dorado , a treasure of rare and undescribed biodiversity .
For many researchers , discovering a single new species is a career maker .
Van Roosmalen has discovered at least 10 — fantastical - sounding creatures like the dwarf marmoset and the giant peccary .
His work along the Arauazinho and the Aripuana has earned him a reputation as one of the world 's greatest living naturalists .
The boat edges around another curve , and Van Roosmalen 's longtime field aid , Francis Correêa , shouts and points at an enormous anaconda , thick as a palm tree , curled on the bank .
" Francis has such a keen eye , " Van Roosmalen says as the snake eases into the water and underneath the boat .
A few minutes later , our engine quits .
" I think I 'll have a swim , " Van Roosmalen announces , grabbing a snorkel out of his bag .
" This water is really nice .
The only problem is the electric eels .
And the anacondas .
And the sting rays , but that 's only in the dry season . "
He doffs his blue button - down and yellow T - shirt and jumps into the water .
I 'm dubious , but he persuades me to join him , narrating the river 's features as we paddle among the submerged tree trunks .
Eventually the pilot gets the motor going , but only barely .
We beach the boat and strike out overland .
The hike is slow going because Van Roosmalen pauses to note every fruit and tree , every monkey scratch in the bark .
He picks up a large , hollowed - out nut .
" This is a new species in the Brazil nut family that I 'd like to describe , " he says wistfully .
" In the old days , I would collect this and then later return for the flowers . "
He walks a few steps and then stops abruptly .
" Automatically I put it in my pocket , " he says , pulling out the nut and dropping it to the ground .
" If I forget and go back to Manaus " — the capital of the state of Amazonas — " they can throw me in jail . "
He may sound paranoid , but he 's actually facing a bleak reality .
In the summer of 2007 , Brazilian authorities put him into one of the country 's most dangerous prisons for two months , the beginning of what was supposed to be a 14 - year sentence .
They called him a traitor and a biopirate and convicted him of stealing the country 's natural resources .
As a result , Van Roosmalen was fired from his job at the government scientific institute where he 'd spent two decades .
He became estranged from his family , mired in debt , and afraid for his life .
Even as we trudge through the Arauazinho , he awaits the verdict on his final appeal .
If he loses , he goes back to prison to serve out his term .
No one disputes that Van Roosmalen is a talented researcher , or suggests that he is any sort of common criminal .
When he ran afoul of Brazil 's own paranoia over the theft of natural resources , important science lost out to bureaucracy , xenophobia , and cynicism .
But Marc van Roosmalen is a polarizing figure here .
Some see him as an environmental hero ; others believe he is the nations 's biggest biopirate .
The same monomania and hubris that made him a great researcher also helped bring about his own demise .
He could have become one of the most innovative conservationists of his generation .
Now he may end up nothing more than a cautionary tale — or , if his worst fears come to pass , a martyr .
Three - fifths of the Amazonian rain forest and 13 percent of all animal and plant species are in Brazil .
Photo : Stanley GreeneBiopiracy is what watchdog groups and government officials call the plundering of biological organisms for profit .
Over the past decade , developing nations have increasingly protested such incursions into their sovereignty .
They come primarily in the form of " bioprospecting " researchers and pharmaceutical companies that scour areas of natural diversity and indigenous knowledge seeking the next cancer treatment or face moisturizer .
Those fears , at some level , are warranted .
In the 1950s , the rosy periwinkle , a plant native to Madagascar , became the source of a lucrative leukemia drug for Eli Lilly ; the island nation received nothing .
In the mid-1990s , a US company filed for a patent involving the neem tree , long known in India as a source of antifungal medicines .
The neem patent was later overturned , and in 2005 the Indian government started building a database of traditional knowledge to compare to international patents — with an eye toward fighting any overlaps .
But no country has taken biopiracy as more of an affront than Brazil .
Here , anger over biopirataria started with Henry Wickham , an Englishman who smuggled thousands of rubber tree seeds out of Manaus at the height of Brazil 's rubber boom in the late 19th century .
Transported to Southeast Asia , the saplings allowed British colonies to flood the rubber market , crushing Brazil 's economic fortunes .
( Wickham likely purchased the seeds legally and then exaggerated his own daring , but the story stuck . )
The most infamous modern biopiracy incident involved Brazil and Squibb Pharmaceuticals .
The US - based company turned the venom from a Brazilian viper into a blood - pressure treatment that was worth $ 1.1 billion in sales in 1996 alone — none of which ended up in Brazilian hands .
Lately , international firms have been accused of trademarking the ae7ai , a native Brazilian fruit , and patenting other Amazonian fruits and oils for cosmetics .
Yet the true extent of biopiracy in Brazil is unclear .
According to Mário Lúcio Reis , acting superintendent for Brazil 's environmental division ( known as Ibama , the initials of its Portuguese name ) , only six biopiracy cases were pursued last year in the Amazon .
Most involved simple animal trafficking — cases more about pets than patents .
Nonetheless , the Brazilian government has portrayed biopiracy as a national crisis , setting off a kind of biological McCarthyism .
Dozens of researchers — many of them foreign — have been slapped with the biopirataria label by authorities and even their own colleagues .
Usually the cases amount to nothing , although occasionally the accused are paraded in front of federal committees or fined .
Into this tempest blundered Van Roosmalen .
Van Roosmalen grew up in the Netherlands in the 1960s , a radical leftist hippie who fell in love with biology .
" While other people were walking their dogs , he and my mother would walk their monkeys , " says his eldest son , Vasco .
For his PhD , Van Roosmalen studied the feeding strategies of spider monkeys in Suriname , just to the north of Brazil .
He had a natural gift for fieldwork , and his Field Guide to the Fruits of the Guianan Flora has been used by botanists for 20 years .
The book caught the eye of Brazil 's Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amaz4nia ( INPA ) , which hired Van Roosmalen to conduct a similar survey for the Brazilian Amazon .
" The guy is a brilliant researcher , " says Russ Mittermeier , who worked alongside Van Roosmalen when they were PhD candidates in Suriname and is now president of the US - based environmental group Conservation International .
" He knows more about the relationships between primates and other forest mammals , fruits , and trees than probably anyone else alive .
He 's really a great explorer . "
Van Roosmalen relished the free - spirited adventure of jungle research , often traveling by dugout canoe or walking barefoot through the forest for weeks or months , foraging for food and stringing up a hammock in local villages .
On one trip , he picked up leishmaniasis , a parasite - borne fever , and he 's had several bouts of malaria .
He loved it all , even when two near - fatal spider bites persuaded him to give up the barefoot trekking .
In Brazil , Van Roosmalen continued a habit he had begun in Suriname .
He set up animal rehabilitation centers — first outside Manaus and then in his family 's backyard , in the heart of the city — for monkeys , tapirs , peccaries , margays , and whatever other creatures came his way , orphaned by hunting or deforestation .
" Most came from the authorities , confiscated from the illegal markets , " he says .
" Many animals went through my hands , but you never knew where they came from . "
In 1996 , a local showed up at his door with a tiny live monkey in a powdered - milk can .
" When I opened it , " Van Roosmalen says , " I immediately saw that it was something totally new . "
He spent months traveling up and down the rivers around Manaus , stopping at villages to show pictures and ask whether anyone had seen the foot - long barefaced critter .
Finally , in a small village not far from the mouth of the Arauazinho River , he found the land of the " dwarf marmoset , " as he eventually named the monkey in a paper coauthored with Mittermeier .
As it turned out , this was not just a new species but the first new primate genus discovered in nearly a century .
Van Roosmalen surveyed the area and began to find other undiscovered mammals .
He made headlines globally and was even profiled in Sports Illustrated .
The biologist had found a new calling : species hunter of the Amazon .
Van Roosmalen opposed shooting animals to collect as specimens , preferring instead to question locals about what they had encountered .
He acquired specimens by trading for orphaned monkeys or by asking for the remains of hunted animals .
The methods worked :
He published his discovery of a remarkable five new monkey species in peer - reviewed journals , along with a previously unknown peccary , porcupine , tapir , and deer .
He was also transforming from scientist to conservationist .
In 1999 , he founded the Amazon Association for the Preservation of High Biodiversity Areas , or AAPA .
Its goal was not just to raise money for his research but to buy and protect habitats .
The innovative idea , linking scientific discovery to environmental protection , quickly attracted money and recognition .
Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands , who in 1997 had awarded Van Roosmalen the country 's highest scientific accolade , contributed the equivalent of $ 100,000 to purchase land .
The organization bought an 18,500 - acre parcel near the Arauazinho and 49,000 acres farther north .
In 2000 , Time magazine named Van Roosmalen one of its " heroes for the planet . "
Van Roosmalen 's rise coincided with what Brazilians perceived as a growing threat to their biological heritage .
In the mid-1990s , the pace of genetic and pharmacological discoveries in areas of high bio-diversity — like rain forests — was accelerating .
At the same time , international environmental groups were raising millions of dollars to enter Brazil and protect the Amazon , with or without Brazilian help .
The government tightened biological - collecting laws , creating a byzantine permit bureaucracy .
Today , researchers have to declare the type and number of specimens and document where they 're going to end up — it 's not exactly conducive to exploration or discovery .
Brazil holds three - fifths of the Amazonian rain forest and one - fifth of the world 's flowering plants .
An estimated 13 percent of the animal and plant species on Earth live there ; it is the planet 's most important living laboratory .
Yet , as a percentage of GDP , the government spends just over a third of what the US does on research .
" The politicians are very good at selling dreams — that in the Amazon we will find all the cures to our diseases , " says Efrem Ferreira , a Brazilian ichthyologist at the INPA .
" There are billions of dollars of promise , but it is just that : promise .
You have to spend the money and the time . "
Meanwhile , red tape has effectively smothered science .
Foreign biologists tend to shun the country in favor of relatively easygoing locales like Peru and Costa Rica , and indigenous scientists are unable to make up the difference .
One botanist estimates that there are only five plant taxonomists covering Brazil 's 1.9 million square miles of jungle .
" If working biologists were held rigorously to the law at the moment , we would all be arrested , " says George Shepherd , a plant taxonomist at the Universidade Estadual de Campinas .
" The law was framed with good ends in mind , but they did n't actually think about the disastrous effect it would have on the scientific community . "
Van Roosmalen himself has little stomach for the paperwork required for scientific collecting .
" I tried several times to advise him about the need to obey the INPA 's rules , " says Rogerio Gribel , former head of botany for the institute .
As Van Roosmalen garnered international awards and media attention for his work , he became increasingly scarce at the INPA .
He founded a series of nonprofit organizations to raise his own research money .
And he drifted away from institute activities , says Gribel , who believes his " egocentric , nondiplomatic behavior " may have rubbed others the wrong way .
In fact , Van Roosmalen 's ventures often seem to end in some sort of crisis .
His animal - rescue centers were shuttled from one property to the next as disagreements with some funder or partner surfaced .
But the real trouble started with one particular blowup .
In 1996 , he became a consultant for a British production company called Survival Anglia .
Founded by nature documentarist Nicholas Gordon , the outfit wanted to shoot three films about Amazonian animals and gave Van Roosmalen money to buy land for an animal - rehab center .
Three years later , as the filming wound down , Van Roosmalen became embroiled in an argument about finances with Gordon and his fiancée .
They complained to Ibama , the environmental enforcement agency , which opened an official inquiry .
In July 2002 , Van Roosmalen was returning from a research trip north of Manaus when he stopped to refuel .
Ibama agents boarded his boat , where they found some common orchids and four monkeys on deck — orphans he claimed to have rescued from a village in exchange for frozen chickens .
He lacked permits for any of them .
After a night of interrogation at the police station , he was fined $ 3,000 and released — minus the monkeys .
Two days later , the arrest hit local papers , and over the ensuing weeks the national press jumped on the story .
" Law of the Jungle : Scientest Accused of Biopiracy , " blasted the national newsweekly , Veja .
" I was already crucified , " Van Roosmalen says .
Soon after , a member of the Brazilian parliament named Vanessa Grazziotin took an interest .
It was an election year , and Grazziotin was heading up an inquest into biopiracy .
She subpoenaed Van Roosmalen 's computers and phone records and called him to testify in front of Parliament .
When he failed to appear — Van Roosmalen says that lawyers told him his testimony was optional — she sent the federal police to bring him back to the capital .
Van Roosmalen 's public grilling lasted four hours .
It turned out that the INPA had opened an inquiry into his methods soon after the raid on his boat , and Grazziotin used the results — which even Van Roosmalen had n't seen — to pick at obscure details from his research history .
What was his relationship with Ford , sponsor of Time 's Hero for the Planet award ?
How had Van Roosmalen 's son Tomas , a graduate student in genetics at Columbia , obtained monkey feces for DNA analysis ?
Van Roosmalen sounded flustered and evasive .
The final parliamentary report , issued in early 2003 , concluded — without offering direct evidence — that he had sent genetic material out of the country .
Grazziotin passed the results on to federal prosecutors to build a criminal case .
The state government of Amazonas filed environmental - crime charges of its own .
In February 2003 , Ibama raided Van Roosmalen 's home and confiscated 23 monkeys he had living there , citing a lack of permits .
In April , INPA fired him for ignoring administrative rules , like traveling abroad to accept awards without institute permission .
Six months later , Van Roosmalen 's wife discovered he was having an affair and left him .
His son Vasco ousted him from the presidency of the AAPA , and the organization sold off its research boat and 4x4s .
The status of the land it had bought was thrown into legal limbo .
Everything had crumbled .
In 2006 , Van Roosmalen was exonerated of the state charges against him , but eventually a federal court tried him for largely the same thing .
The judge convicted him in absentia — his lawyer was AWOL .
On June 15 , 2007 , police officers arrived at his home in Manaus and arrested him .
Weirdly , the federal conviction had little if any connection to biopiracy .
In fact , the most serious offense , carrying the bulk of his sentence , had nothing to do with biology ; it was for embezzlement .
Back in 1996 , Survival Anglia — the documentary - filmmaking outfit with which Van Roosmalen 's troubles had begun — had shipped 5 tons of scaffolding tower from the UK to help shoot footage in the jungle canopy .
Van Roosmalen 's INPA credentials had exempted the company from paying a customs duty .
In return , the company pledged to donate the equipment to the INPA when filming was complete .
But the scaffolding disappeared , and the feds said Van Roosmalen took it .
To where , nobody knew .
The press claimed he had used it for his monkey cages , but that was probably false :
He 'd had the cages for years before the scaffolding disappeared .
No one seems willing to sort out what actually happened .
Filmmaker Nicholas Gordon died of a heart attack in Venezuela in 2004 , and Gordon 's wife , Antonieta , now living in England , says that no one asked her to testify at the trial .
The government also convicted Van Roosmalen of lacking the proper permits for his backyard rescue operation .
But he showed me documents indicating that on three separate occasions he had applied for permits to keep rescued monkeys — and the rules allowed him to proceed if he did n't receive a response after 45 days .
And , finally , Van Roosmalen was found guilty of illegally auctioning off , via his Web site , the naming rights to species he had discovered .
Prosecutor Edmilson da Costa Barreiros acknowledges that scientific tradition gives the discoverer of a new species the right to name it .
But he maintains that Van Roosmalen " cannot claim that those species belong to him . "
Offering to name a monkey for donations amounts to stealing , in Barreiros ' words , " the national patrimony . "
Van Roosmalen had indeed made the offer on his Web site but never completed an auction .
Even if he had , it 's hard to see how the law could equate selling naming rights with owning the animals themselves .
The judge — in defiance of the special arrangements usually accorded convicts with higher degrees — deemed the crimes so severe that Van Roosmalen had to serve his sentence at Raimundo Vidal Pessoa Penitentiary in downtown Manaus , a dumping ground for the Amazon 's most dangerous and destitute .
In January , I visited the moldy concrete cell block where he had ended up .
He spent two months there in constant fear of a riot in which he might be seen as a valuable hostage .
He says he saw two fellow prisoners murdered ( which prison administrators deny ) .
The prison eventually transferred him to a cell with five other inmates , two of them violent crack addicts .
Van Roosmalen says he smuggled in cash to pay his companions ' drug debts .
Ricardo Hin , a friend who visited Van Roosmalen , remembers finding him wild - eyed and desperate .
" It was shocking , " Hin says .
" He told me , If I stay here much longer , I will be killed . ' "
Outside , Van Roosmalen 's second wife , Vivian , used family money to hire new lawyers .
Supporters started a Web site in the Netherlands to raise legal funds .
His ex-wife , son , and brother offered money , but they demanded he change lawyers .
By then he had begun to see enemies everywhere — among other conservationists , even among his own family .
He sent them away , later accusing them of blackmail .
Last August , attorneys finally obtained his temporary release while the case is on appeal .
Van Roosmalen and I spend the afternoon exploring the Arauazinho River forest , and then we hike down to the newly repaired boat and head for home .
He points out places where the riverbanks are marred by freshly cut roads .
The recent discovery of gold has driven a flurry of road building here , with the accompanying deforestation and malaria .
" This sustainable development is a bunch of crap , " he says .
" It just gives carte blanche to the loggers . "
Despite Van Roosmalen 's outrage , the entire region is a nature reserve now ( albeit one that 's often encroached upon ) .
That change in status is largely a result of Van Roosmalen 's own research into the area 's unique ecology .
In fact , it is illegal for us to be here without government permission .
In a perverse way , his case has helped open up a discussion in Brazil about true biopiracy .
Some collecting rules have recently been loosened , and there is debate on proposed legislation that many researchers say could make Brazil one of the more progressive places for scientists to work and collaborate .
" Everybody saw in his case exactly what we did n't want to see , which was the prosecution of researchers and not of criminals , " says Rita Mesquita , a former student of Van Roosmalen 's who helped establish the reserve .
" So he — of course at a very high cost in his life — ended up being a perfect example of the misuse of a regulation . "
When the police came to arrest him the last time , they found a plastic bag filled with skins and skulls he had gathered without permits .
Once , I asked him why he continued to collect , even when he knew he was being watched .
" Fuck them , " Van Roosmalen said .
" I wanted to go on publishing new things and just laughing at them .
It was stupid , OK .
I just consider this whole thing a circus . "
He paused .
" I was always a rebel and I always will be .
There was nothing wrong in my whole attitude during the 20 years that I worked for the government .
They should have been proud of me .
The real crooks are on the street in this country , the people who really are responsible for large - scale destruction of the rain forest .
And I 'm not one of them . "
On the river , the motor conks out again ; this time we 've blown a spark plug .
Running on half an engine , we'd have to spend the night out on the river , exposed .
Our pilot decides to flag down a passing gravel barge for help .
" There used to be just two gravel barges on the river .
Now there are 10 ships a day , " Van Roosmalen grouses .
" It 's all illegal .
They bribe the authorities for the permits . "
The prison cell in downtown Manuas where Van Roosmalen served part of his sentence .
Photo : Stanley Greene Luckily , our captain knows the barge pilot and arranges to borrow a spark plug .
It 's the kind of personal grease upon which South America , and indeed the world , operates .
It 's also the kind of trade - off that Van Roosmalen always believed was beneath him .
" Compromising myself with the devil , " he once said , " is the last thing I would do . "
As we fire up the outboard and race toward home , the cloudy skies open up and release a driving rain .
Van Roosmalen tucks himself under a plastic tarp .
Suddenly , he looks older .
I ask him jokingly if the weather makes him miss these expeditions .
" It was always like this , " he says , hunching his knees under his chin .
" Sometimes in the Amazon , you can really get a chill from the cold . "
Van Roosmalen 's house in Manaus is a red two - room building with a corrugated aluminum roof .
The stove and oven sit out on the porch while the kitchen remains a half - built cinder - block shell , its completion long ago sacrificed to lawyers fees .
The wide lawn is dotted with fruit trees and fronted by a 13 - foot - high concrete wall with metal gates .
Two closed - circuit cameras scan the perimeter .
If an unknown visitor rings the bell , Van Roosmalen sits quietly watching the monitors , girding himself for a dash into the jungle behind the house .
When I first contacted Van Roosmalen in November 2007 , three months after his release from prison , he had only recently stopped living on the run .
Just after his release from Raimundo Vidal , he said , gunmen masquerading as federal police came to the house to finish him off .
He and Vivian fled to friends ' houses , relocating every two days .
They scrounged up enough money to double the height of their wall and top it with surveillance cameras .
Then they felt safe enough to go home .
These days , Van Roosmalen says , he and Vivian live off fees for consulting on the occasional nature documentary and a small advance from a Dutch publisher for his memoirs .
Help Marc van Roosmalen , the organization dedicated to paying his legal costs , shut down months ago .
Tens of thousands in legal bills remain unpaid .
Vivian is training to become an armed guard to supplement their income .
On my final visit , I find Van Roosmalen more jittery than usual .
He hands me a grainy printout from his security cameras .
That morning , he says , two men arrived in a white Nissan pickup and banged on the door , lingering when no one answered .
" You do n't want to interpret , " he says , " but they were very persistent . "
A few weeks later , he emails me from a new address .

Contributing editor Evan Ratliff ( www.atavist.net) wrote about cellulosic ethanol in issue 15.10 .
It is widely known that the Nazis , in Operation Himmler , faked attacks on their own people and resources which they blamed on the Poles , to justify the invasion of Poland .
And it has now been persuasively argued -- as shown , for example , in this History Channel video -- that Nazis set fire to their own government building and blamed that fire on others ( if you have trouble playing the clip , it is because the website hosting the clip requires you to download the clip before playing it ) .
The fire was the event which justified Hitler 's seizure of power and suspension of liberties .
And in the early 1950s , agents of an Israeli terrorist cell operating in Egypt planted bombs in several buildings , including U.S. diplomatic facilities , then left behind " evidence " implicating the Arabs as the culprits ( one of the bombs detonated prematurely , allowing the Egyptians to identify the bombers ) .
Israel 's Defense Minister was brought down by the scandal , along with the entire Israeli government .
See also this confirmation .
And the Russian KGB apparently conducted a wave of bombings in Russia in order to justify war against Chechnya and put Vladimir Putin into power .
The Turkish government has carried out bombings and blamed it on the PKK in order to justify a crackdown on that group
This is called " false flag terrorism " , where a government attacks its own people then blames others in order to justify its goals
But NOT the U.S .
It is logical to assume that , even if other countries have carried out false flag operations ( especially horrible regimes such as , say , the Nazis ) , the U.S. has never done so .
Well , as shown by this BBC special ( which contains interviews with some of the key players ) , it is probable that America knew of the Japanese plan to attack Pearl Harbor -- down to the exact date of the attack -- and allowed it to happen to justify America 's entry into World War II .
See also this short essay by a highly - praised historian summarizing some of the key points ( the historian , a World War II veteran , actually agreed with this strategy for getting America into the war , and so does not have any axe to grind ) .
The Pearl Harbor conspiracy involved hundreds of military personnel .
Moreover , the White House apparently had , a year earlier , launched an 8 - point plan to provoke Japan into war against the U.S. ( including , for example , an oil embargo ) .
And -- most stunning -- the FDR administration took numerous affirmative steps to ensure that the Japanese attack would be successful .
And , as confirmed by a former Italian Prime Minister , an Italian judge , and the former head of Italian counterintelligence , NATO , with the help of U.S. and foreign special forces , carried out terror bombings in Italy and blamed the communists , in order to rally people ’s support for their governments in Europe in their fight against communism .
As one participant in this formerly - secret program stated : " You had to attack civilians , people , women , children , innocent people , unknown people far removed from any political game .
The reason was quite simple .
They were supposed to force these people , the Italian public , to turn to the state to ask for greater security . "
Moreover , recently declassified documents show that in the 1960's , the American Joint Chiefs of Staff signed off on a plan to blow up AMERICAN airplanes ( using an elaborate plan involving the switching of airplanes ) , and also to commit terrorist acts on American soil , and then to blame it on the Cubans in order to justify an invasion of Cuba .
If you view no other links in this article , please read the following ABC news report ; the official documents ; and watch this interview with the former Washington Investigative Producer for ABC 's World News Tonight with Peter Jennings .
Therefore , before you dismiss as a tinfoil hat conspiracy claims about 9/11 , please take a look at the historical record .
Postscript : the examples discussed above are only a small handful of the many potential examples of false flag operations .
Just two more examples :
Australia 's largest newspaper quoted the well - respected former Indonesian president as saying that the government had a role in the Bali bombings ( apparently , Muslim governments play this game as well )
And according to the London Times , " The man accused of supplying the dynamite used in the al - Qaeda train bombings in Madrid was in possession of the private telephone number of the head of Spain 's Civil Guard bomb squad . . . .
The revelation has raised fresh concerns in Madrid about links between those held responsible for the March bombings , which killed 190 people , and Spain ’s security services " .

Anyone who grew up in the fifties and sixties has to marvel at the organized life of today 's kids .
In the fifties , we came home from school and played pick - up football or baseball depending on the season .
One or two of us maybe had a glove , which was shared .
More often than not the bat really was a stick in our version of stick ball .
Bases were strategically placed rocks .
We played until we got bored or someone 's Mom yelled out that it was time for supper .
Today kids register for the privilege to play games .
I pulled this from a Soccer Club 's website :
" The season begins the day after Labor Day with practices during the week and games or practice scrimmages that first Saturday after Labor Day .
The season concludes the weekend before Thanksgiving .
Teams from kindergarten through sixth grade will practice once per week and play one game per week on Saturday .
The practice night depends on what evening your coach selects .
The practice will last about one hour and will begin between 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm depending on your coach .
Games last between 45 minutes and 1 hour depending on the grade your child is in .
For grades 7 - 12 there are no practices , only games .
The games take place on Saturdays and sometimes on a Sunday .
Fields and season are the same as above . "
Am I alone in finding it strange that " Kindergarten " teams practice , and no practice is required for kids grades 7 - 12 .
I guess the rational is that many years of practice is required before you can just play a " game " for fun .
The following appeared in my local newspaper .
I 've deleted the names .
I 'm not sure who I am protecting , maybe the humiliated parent who 's U9 son or daughter does n't " shine on defense " .
Or , more likely , the " all arms and legs " U9 child facing countless years of therapy and medication because they know , if they had been mentioned in the newspaper , the caption would have been " and " M just plain sucked ! " .
U9 boys : " R " and " O " played well offensively in the opener against " H " . " K " shined on defense and " L " used his speed to help the team .
" N " played in goal .
The previous snippet from the Internet stated that practice for kindergarten through sixth grade , began between 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm , depending on your coach .
Now when I was a kid , that was the time that Mom usually had supper ready .
Of course , my childhood was deficient by today 's standards .
We had no coaches .
I found this prominently displayed on a Community Club 's site :
" J " has been working for over 15 years with his World Cup Soccer Camps .
" J " , about six years ago , started our U - 8 development training .
" J " now hires , trains and oversees most of our U - 9 and U - 10 girls and boys coaches .
Well , I guess in today 's world U - 8 , U - 9 and U - 10 girls and boys are " developed " by highly trained coaches .
These U - 8 kids train between 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm .
When do they eat supper ?
I can't help but wonder if any of the kids today get to have the fun that we did .
Do they still get the opportunity to just play ?
Have their parents , the highly trained coaches , forgot that soccer is a game ?

Splunk Your Distributed Logs in EC2
Managing log files is like herding cats , except its worse : a typical LAMP / Rails stack will easily generate a dozen logs in different locations .
The fun part is , of course , the debugging and server administration tasks which involve the forensic task of tracking down each of these files and then cross- referencing timestamps to figure out what really happened .
We ’ve all dealt with this problem at one point or another .
Hence , when I recently stumbled on Splunk , I knew I had to try it - it , looked , awesome .
The setup was a breeze and I was up and running in no time - no more fgrep / egrep for me !
If you want to give it a try , take a look at Michael Wilde ’s video ( Splunkin ’ with Amazon EC2 ) , which he posted just a few days ago .
Michael provides a great walkthrough , but I think he overlooked an awesome feature of Splunk , which is especially useful for the EC2 environment , and one we ’re planning to make heavy use of at AideRSS : distributed logging over TCP !
Managing Distributed Logs from the Cloud
Managing logs is hard as it is , and now imagine you have several ( dozen ) servers in EC2 , the process becomes a chore , the debugging is hard , and frustration abounds .
To address this problem , I ’ve setup Splunk to listen on a TCP port for any network traffic - if all others servers log to this host , then you will have a centralized , indexed log repository for all of your services .
A simple Ruby - based NetworkLogger class later , and we ’re in business :
# igvita.com ( Ilya Grigorik ) require ' rubygems ' require ' socket ' class NetworkLogger def initialize ( host = ' localhost ' , port = ' 8888 ' ) @socket = TCPSocket .
new ( host , port ) end def log ( level , msg ) @socket .
write " #{ Time .
new .
strftime ( " % H: %M: %S " ) } ( #{ level } ) : #{ msg }
" end def method_missing ( method , * args ) if method .
to_s =~ /( info|debug|warn|error ) / i return self .
log ( method .
to_s , args [ 0 ] ) end end end logger = NetworkLogger . new ( ' localhost ' , 9998 ) #
Send log messages to remote Splunk server logger .
info " This is in INFO message " logger .
debug " This is a DEBUG message " logger .
warn " This is a WARNING message " logger .
error " Uh oh !
This is an ERROR message "
It ’s a simple example , but it highlights the possibilities - you can stream any set of logs to a centralized server for easy debugging , live monitoring , and alerts and notifications .
Best of all , it ’s a free solution as long as you stay below 500 mb of indexed log data , per day .
In Mike Nichols ’ 1967 film The Graduate , Mr. Maguire ( Walter Brooke ) takes young Benjamin ( Dustin Hoffman ) aside to tell him , “ there ’s a great future in plastics . ”
One can almost imagine Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster saying the same thing today about 3rd party applications on the iPhone and iPod Touch .
The market for these apps could be over $ 1 billion by next year , Munuster wrote in his research notes this morning .
Of course , this $ 1.2 billion market size falls under Munster ’s “ Agrressive Case ” scenario in which there are 85 million iPhone and iPod Touch users through the end of next year , 95 percent of whom would need to actively use the store .
Still , given that Apple has the device available in six countries right now but will have it in some 70 countries by next year , it ’s perhaps not entirely unreasonable to go along with these projections .
More interesting is Apple ’s position on the store .
Jobs said earlier this year that the company never intended to make money off of the App Store , as Digital Daily reminds us .
Yet , even under Munster ’s “ Conservative Case ” scenario ( see the chart below ) , Apple would be pulling in $ 125 million , and walking away with nearly $ 100 million in profit .
Jobs claimed money the store brought it would be used to maintain it , but even these low ball figures seem like a bit much for only that .
Of course , a survey taken at WWDC suggested that 70 percent of all planned iPhone apps may be free .
“ Free ” tends to not help revenues too much .
But in Munster ’s “ Neutral Case ” scenario , consumers would download two apps a year – one free and one paid .
So he at least somewhat takes into account free applications .
With everyone all in a tizzy over the new iPhone 3G could we be looking past the even more significant launch , the App Store ?
As an aside , do n’t believe the rumors that the App Store will launch on June 27 , it ’s still coming July 11 .

While speaking before the National Association of Latino Elected Officials ( NALEO ) , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama called out John McCain for walking away from his commitment to comprehensive immigration reform .
“ Now , one place where Senator McCain used to offer change was on immigration .
He was a champion of comprehensive reform , and I admired him for it , ” Obama said .
“ But when he was running for his party ’s nomination , he walked away from that commitment and he ’s said he would n’t even support his own legislation if it came up for a vote .
If we are going to solve the challenges we face , you need a President who will pursue genuine solutions day in and day out .
And that is my commitment to you . ”
The McCain campaign ’s response was to dodge the issue of the flip - flop and blame Obama for working against the Bush immigration reform bill , “ It ’s quite audacious for Barack Obama to question John McCain ’s commitment to immigration reform when it was Obama himself who worked to kill the Senate ’s bipartisan immigration reform compromise last year .
Barack Obama voted for five ‘ poison pill ’ amendments designed by special interests to kill the immigration reform deal . ”

However in his speech Obama called for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants , “ We need immigration reform that will secure our borders , and punish employers who exploit immigrant labor ; reform that finally brings the 12 million people who are here illegally out of the shadows by requiring them to take steps to become legal citizens .
We must assert our values and reconcile our principles as a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws .
That is a priority I will pursue from my very first day . ”
No matter who wins the election in November , immigration reform is going to continue to be a hot button issue .
I think that a pathway to citizenship is the sensible thing to do , but I also thought that the Bush immigration reform bill was a hodgepodge of ideas with no clear purpose behind them .
McCain can try to shift the focus and blame to Obama , but he ca n’t hide from the fact that he caved in to the right wing of his party on immigration .

More Bangladeshis than Indians are expected to use the service
The passenger train service between Calcutta in India and the capital of Bangladesh , Dhaka , has resumed after an interval of more than 40 years .
Trains travelled in both directions on Monday - the first service since the 1965 war between India and Pakistan .
Bangladesh - previously East Pakistan - gained independence from Pakistan in 1971 but Delhi and Dhaka only agreed to resume the train link in 2001 .
The train has been dubbed the Maitreyi , or Friendship , Express .
One service left Dhaka on Bengali New Year 's Day on Monday for the inaugural 500 km ( 310 mile ) run to Calcutta , with another train running from Calcutta to Dhaka .
The BBC's Bangladesh correspondent - travelling to Calcutta - says some in India have expressed concern that the train could lead to an increase in smuggling and illegal immigration .
Our correspondent says that even though security checks at the border will take four hours , the new train is another sign that normal relations are being established .
Protests Meanwhile the 360 - seater Calcutta - Dhaka Friendship Express on its inaugural run was carrying barely 65 passengers , including journalists and politicians , says BBC's Subir Bhaumik who is travelling to Dhaka on the train .
" The inaugural service has been started in a hurry and people are still not aware of where to get tickets .
But once they know , the trains will go full and I have no doubt about that , " said Indian railway spokesman Samir Goswami .
I am going back to my village in Bangladesh after 60 years
Janatosh Pal , passenger
In pictures : New rail link Bangladesh and India 's West Bengal state used to form united Bengal and many people on both sides of the border share a common language and have relatives on the other side .
With one - way tickets starting from $ 8 ( £ 4 ) , it is expected to be popular with Bangladeshis visiting family , looking for work , shopping or seeking medical treatment in their wealthier neighbour .
One man on the train said he was returning to his village in Bangladesh after 60 years .
" I came to India as a refugee when I was six year old but for me Kalindi in Bangladesh , the village I was born , remains my motherland , " said Janatosh Pal , his voice choked with emotion .
DHAKA - CALCUTTA RAIL ROUTE
The route was suspended in 1965 after war broke out between India and Pakistan .
Bangladesh was then part of Pakistan .
The first train carrying government officials ran on 8 July 2007 .
A one - way ticket costs about £ 4 Public enthusiasm was palpable and thousands lined up on both sides of the railway track all the way from Calcutta to Gede on the border , waving at the train .
A group representing Hindu refugees from Bangladesh , Nikhil Banga Nagarik Sangha ( All Bengal Citizens Committee ) , briefly obstruct the train because they are opposed to it .
" There is no reason why India should develop close links with Bangladesh when Hindus are persecuted in that country , " said the group 's chief Subhas Chakrabarti .
Police blamed the group for planting three bombs on the route on Sunday .
The bombs were defused and scores of the group 's supporters were arrested while demonstrating near the tracks .
Bilateral relations were dogged by suspicion and rivalry for many years even though India helped Bangladesh win its independence from Pakistan , says our correspondent .
Disagreements over security arrangements delayed the implementation of the rail link after the two countries signed an agreement in 2001 .
A passenger coach and freight trains already run between the two countries .

Finally , Engadget editor Paul Miller 's prayers have been answered -- in the form of a homebrew SNES emulator for the Wii .
It 's no secret that Paul is eerily obsessed with the SNES , and now he can get access to all his favorites ( import or otherwise ) with another Wii tweak .
The well known emulator SNES9X has been ported to Nintendo 's money maker , and it even includes support for the Wiimote ( there are plans for future implementation of the Classic controller and two - player game modes ) .
We 're assuming this is all part of the much - loved Twilight Princess exploit , though they 're a bit short on detail .

I 've been posting like crazy about the latest media / military propaganda scam that the NY Times broke a few weeks ago .
You know , the one about the paid military generals - turned - analysts that the networks used to deceive the American public with so the Iraq war was such an easy sell .
Since then we 've found out that Fox News , CNN , MSNBC , CBS , ABC and NBC failed to respond to a PBS request for comment which has resulted in virtually a complete media blackout , but which caused the the Defense Department to temporarily stop feeding information to retired military officers pending a review of the issue .
Col .
Allard admitted to CNN that there definitely was a conflict of interest --- while Sen .
Feingold questions the legality of it in a letter he wrote .
Now it looks like we 'll have some action because it seems that Harry Reid ( h/t Glenn Greenwald ) has been paying attention to the blogosphere 's call for action :
Harry Reid was at the FDL Book Salon today and an FDL reader asked : " are you planning to hold hearings on the illegality of the Pentagon 's propaganda training program of retired military officers ? "
Reid responded : " The answer is yes .
I have personally spoken to Chairman Levin and he is tremendously concerned as I .
And we are proceeding accordingly . "
Glenn Greenwald sheds more light on how the Pentagon was so very thrilled by these faux military experts .
The key issue here is that more and more , media analysts are having a greater impact on the television media network coverage of military issues .
They have now become the go to guys not only for breaking stories , but they influence the views on issues .
They also have a huge amount of influence on what stories the network decides to cover proactively with regard to the military .
. . . 1 . ) I recommend we develop a core group from within our media analyst list of those that we can count on to carry our water .
They become part of a " hot list " of those that we immediately make calls to or put on an email distro list before we contact or respond to media on hot issues ... read on
Sickening , just sickening .
Psy - ops , baby !
And I think we caught Lawrence Di Rita ( the former Pentagon spokesman under Secretary Don Rumsfeld ) lying on CNN with these new documents .
Di Rita denies ginning up the militaryTV analyists to Kurtz :
KURTZ : Larry Di Rita , were you , the Pentagon , Don Rumsfeld , trying to get a positive message out through these TV analysts , these retired military men , who appeared to the viewer at home to be Independent ?
LAWRENCE DI RITA , FMR .
PENTAGON SPOKESMAN : Positive , no .
I think our objective was a balance , a richer set of understandings .
There was a general sense , and I think the public often -- it showed up in polls -- that they were n't getting the breadth of the story .
( click image to make larger )
Yet in this note that Glenn Greenwald found --- he cheers on the talking points .
This is a thoughtful note .
. .
I think it makes a lot of sense to do as you suggest and I guess I thought we were already doing a lot of this in terms of quick contact , etc. . .
We ought to be doing this , though , and we should not make the list too small .
I wonder how Kurtz would feel knowing he was lied to on air by Di Rita ?
I 'll investigate further as the day goes on ...

One of the keys to restarting the American economy is staring us in the face .
While our future hinges on the rapid adoption of fuel - efficient vehicles , our government stands in the way of a rapid free market solution .
35 MPG can be an immediate reality , with one domestic manufacturer , if the United States government would only allow it to happen .
Our elected representatives need to be aware of the facts and make the appropriate decisions .
Chrysler is uniquely positioned among the Big Three US automakers .
Unlike Ford and General Motors , Chrysler is already building a slew of high - MPG diesel - powered vehicles right here in the United States .
Amazing as it may seem in these difficult times , Chrysler is not allowed to sell those cars domestically , due to recently tightened emissions regulations .
With the exception of the domestically - available Jeep Grand Cherokee diesel , all of Chrysler ’s North American manufactured high - MPG diesel - equipped vehicles are being shipped abroad .
Each and every one of Chrysler ’s European models is available with a diesel engine , with the exception of the Dodge Viper .
In fact , a diesel engine can be found under the hood of more than 50 % of the vehicles that Chrysler sells in Europe .
All - in - all , a dozen Chrysler , Dodge , and Jeep diesel - engined models are currently available outside of the United States , but are not sold domestically .
Here ’s the eye - opener … half of those models currently achieve 35 miles per gallon combined .
That ’s 35 MPG … right now .
And what ’s even more crazy ?
All of these 35 MPG cars and SUVs are built in North American plants by North American workers … American citizens cannot buy and drive the fuel - efficient cars they build .
The thriftiest of the bunch delivers nearly 50 MPG on the highway … and it ’s no dog off the line , turning in 0 - 62 mile per hour ( MPH ) times under nine seconds .
The fastest in the pack delivers 7.6 second 0 - 62 times and 35.6 MPG on the highway .
Needless to say , these are wonderful world - class cars , a world apart from your Uncle ’s noisy , slow , smelly 80 ’s - era diesel .
The Mercedes - Benz V6 diesel - equipped Jeep Grand Cherokee is the first US - built passenger vehicle to meet the tougher Federal emissions requirements .
With the emissions work done on the Mercedes ’ 3.0 liter engine , we expect the Chrysler 300 to be the next diesel - powered domestic , as it shares the same powerplant .
( At present , diesel 300s are being built in Graz , Austria . )
Chrysler is using four different diesel engines , in all :
2.0 liter Volkswagen turbo - diesel inline four ( Avenger , Caliber , Compass , Journey , Sebring , Patriot )
2.2 liter Mercedes - Benz inline four ( PT Cruiser )
2.8 liter VM Motari inline four ( Cherokee , Grand Voyager , Nitro , Wrangler )
3.0 liter Mercedes - Benz V6 ( 300 , Commander , Grand Cherokee )
What if the federal government temporarily rolled back the emissions requirements for one or two years , to allow the sale of these fuel - sipping vehicles while Chrysler and its partners complete the engineering necessary to meet the current regulations ?
Crazier schemes have been implemented to stimulate the economy , no doubt about that .
But this one just might work … by spurring investment and putting people back to work .
As you ponder that thought , take a gander at a group of specifications that compare the European diesels with the most fuel - efficient engines in each of the US domestics …

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Oil prices have some drivers looking for new rides , but some truck and sport-utility vehicle owners are remaining true to their gas guzzlers .
They say , $ 4 - a - gallon gas be damned ; they need the space .
Gas prices have drivers reconsidering what they drive , but some SUV owners say they have no real alternative .

" You 've got to have that room when you 're moving around , " said Steve Sharp , who has three active children and whose wife owns a dance studio .
" It would be impractical for us to own a Prius with everything we 've got going on . "
Toyota 's hybrid sedan just would n't work , said Sharp , 36 .
In addition to hauling their 11 - year - old boy to soccer games and their 10 - and 7 - year - old daughters to dance recitals , Sharp 's wife , Caren , also totes large props and background displays for her studio .
In March , as consumer cynicism toward SUVs soared alongside gas prices , the Sharpsburg , Georgia , family purchased a new Chevy Avalanche truck , which gets between 17 and 20 miles per gallon on the highway .
When GM chief Rick Wagoner announced Tuesday his company would close four North American plants by 2010 , he cited skyrocketing gas prices as a factor in the automobile giant 's decision .
Watch how gas prices drove the move »
" These higher gasoline prices are changing consumer behavior , and rapidly , " Wagoner said .
" We do n't think this is a temporary spike or shift .
We think it is permanent . "
Peter Brown , the executive director of the trade publication Automotive News , said in an interview last month that SUV sales were down almost 33 percent this year , and sales of pickups were down almost 20 percent .
He likened the behemoths to dinosaurs on the fast path to extinction .
iReport.com : Still driving that gas guzzler , and loving it ?
" If gas prices stay where they are at or continue to rise , the body - on - frame SUV is an endangered species and the pickup truck as a personal car is an endangered species , " he said .
But some consumers say they 'll strive to keep the beasts alive , even if it costs $ 100 or more to fill the tanks .

Stephanie Torgerson , 32 , of Pataskala , Ohio , said she simply can't put her three boys in her husband 's Mazda 626 .
The 1 - year - old needs a car seat , the 5 - year - old needs a booster chair and she does n't feel comfortable wedging her 8 - year - old between the two .
Sure , she could probably get better mileage in a minivan , but she does n't like the stigma .
" I do n't want to be labeled as a soccer mom , " she said .
Torgerson said her 2006 Chevy Trailblazer , which gets about 20 mpg , affords her and her kids protection -- not to mention four - wheel drive traction in the snowy winter months .
But security comes with a price .
Torgerson 's daily commute to Hilliard -- another Columbus suburb -- is 72 miles roundtrip .
She spends about $ 82 a week on gas , she said .

Asked if she had considered a hybrid SUV with four - wheel drive , she promptly said no .
" They 're all brand - new vehicles , and I can't afford a $ 500 - a - month car payment , " she said .
Orlando Tapia , of Cabot , Arkansas , said he considered trading in his 2001 Chevy Suburban to buy his wife a new car .
The 45 - year - old U.S. Air Force education manager said he reconsidered after learning he'd get about one - seventh of the vehicle 's market value .
See how SUV sales are on the decline »
" They want to give you nothing for it , " he said , lamenting the low demand and high supply of such vehicles .
Tapia , who also owns a 1988 Chevy Silverado pickup ( his wife drives a Toyota Camry ) , said his family uses the Suburban only about 10 times a year , for vacations , hauling his flatbed trailer and when piling friends and relatives into the Suburban saves driving two cars .
Tapia decided to keep his cars simply because they 're paid for .
" Do I pay $ 5,000 a year in car payments , or do I put $ 5,000 of gas in the Suburban ? " he asked .
" Right now it 's cheaper for me to just put gas in the Suburban . "
Tapia has felt the pinch of high gas prices , he said , but he has ways to alleviate the burden on his wallet without hocking his truck or SUV .
" If I 'm running to the store and the Camry 's out there and the Suburban and pickup are out there , I definitely jump in the Camry , " he said .
Sharp said his family looks for similar ways to save money on gas .
For instance , his wife will time trips to the bank or grocery store so she can pick up the children from school while she 's out running errands .
Extra trips mean extra gas , Sharp said .

But simple solutions do n't work for everyone .
" I 've got several of these things that I 've been pouring liquid gold in the tank of , " said Mark Antley , 47 , of Sharpsburg , Georgia .
The computer and technology contractor used to drive his 1999 Suburban from Sharpsburg through Atlanta to the northern suburb of Alpharetta .
The 145 - mile roundtrip to work put a dent in his 45 - gallon gas tank .
Making matters more costly were his wife 's car -- another ' 99 Suburban -- and his diesel 2002 Ford F250 pickup .
So last month , Antley got on eBay , where he found a 1996 Pontiac Sunfire for $ 1,000 .
The car is a " piece of junk , " he said , but it gets about 37 mpg , almost tripling his Suburban 's mileage .
He has already put 5,000 miles on it , which has saved him about the cost of the car in gas , he said .
" Last month , before I bought this car , it was running in the neighborhood of $ 1,400 to $ 1,800 a month , " Antley said of his family 's gasoline budget .
Though Antley has left his F250 parked since Christmas , his wife still needs her Suburban for carpooling to school and school events .
The Antleys ' daughter just turned 16 , and is driving her own Toyota Corolla , but the couple 's boys need rides to soccer practice and their sister 's gymnastics meets .
Antley said he does n't think the SUV is on the verge of extinction .
He laughs at folks willing to pay $ 1.25 for a pint of bottled water -- $ 10 a gallon -- but who gripe about $ 4 - a - gallon gas .
All products go up in price , he said .
Gas prices eventually will level off and families will adjust their budgets accordingly .
SUVs will either become luxuries for those who can afford the gas or necessities for those who need what SUVs have to offer , he predicts .
" There will still be a niche market for them , " he said .
" I do n't know what other vehicle affords you the luxury of carrying as much as they do . "
CNN 's Wayne Drash and Chris Isidore contributed to this report .

Reckon students are all bone - idle skiving filth who have n’t even got the wit to tie their shoelaces properly ?
Well then you ’d be in disagreement with Judge Parsons ( of Brighton magistrates ) .
He ’s just refused legal aid to seven students up in front of his bench for ‘ aggravated tresspass ’ ( punishable by up to three months inside ) on the grounds that “ they are intelligent enough to represent themselves ” .
The seven are accused of D- locking and supergluing to EDO MBM ’s infamous factory of death in Brighton on the fifth anniversary of the Iraq War .
Despite the fact that the student protesters are all in their first year and none are studying law , the judge is perhaps paying the defendants a compliment in considering them equal in legal know - how to a barrister ( who study for around six years before they are considered ready to defend their clients ) .
They are under stringent bail conditions to stay away from EDO MBMs factories .
Of course legal aid is gradually being whittled away for all of us ( See SchNEWS 618 ) .
But the decision to cut off the supply this time is interesting in the light of how many cases against EDO protestors have ended in failure for the authorities ( See SchNEWS 535 ) .
Campaign spokesman Andy Beckett told SchNEWS
“ By robbing these defendants of their rights to adequate legal representation , the authorities are launching an attack on our campaign as a whole .
They ’ve been forced to drop cases when it looked as if evidence of police collusion with the factory owners was about to emerge .
But that evidence only emerged after careful examination by trained solicitors .
The whole thing smacks of a desperate attempt to secure convictions against supporters of our successful campaign ” .
The National Union of Students is up in arms at this abuse of the student ’s status to trick them out of their right to legal representation .
In the words of the USSU education officer ; “ That students are being denied legal assistance simply because they are students is disgraceful .
A fair and public trial is a human right .
When students take on international arms dealers without legal representation it is laughable to claim that the proceedings could be fair or equal .
At a time when civil liberties are under attack nationally , this court is specifically targeting students as an isolated and disempowered group . ”
To support the defendants , fight for civil liberties and take action against the arms trade join Smash EDO at the Carnival Against The Arms Trade …

Badge of honour : Jimmy Savile receives recognition
Instead of uniforms they were given a pair of boots and a hard hat and instead of the front line they were sent underground .
And when the Second World War was over , still the Bevin Boys toiled .
They were the forgotten conscripts of the conflict , bringing Britain back from the edge of an energy crisis by shovelling coal at the order of Minister of Labour and National Service Ernest Bevin .
Now , 60 years on , the Bevin Boys have been granted the official recognition they have long deserved .
A group of 27 of the original " boys " - now aged in their eighties - received commemorative badges from Prime Minister Gordon Brown today .
Some 48,000 Bevin Boys aged 18 to 25 were recruited during the war to work down the mines as Britain was hit by severe coal shortages .
Many existing miners had been called up into the armed forces , leaving a shortfall of able - bodied men available to go underground .
Scroll down for more ...
A number of boys volunteered for the coal mines following a Government appeal , and started their training at Markham Main Colliery , near Doncaster
Among their number , selected as a representative sample by the Bevin Boys Association , was former DJ and TV presenter Sir Jimmy Savile .
He said : " The fact that 60 years later somebody says ' Here 's a medal for what you did ' comes as a tremendous surprise and honour . "
Bevin organised a ballot to select a proportion of conscripted men for the mines instead of the armed services .
It was a shattering blow for those young men who had been filled with a sense of excitement at serving their country on the battlefield , at sea or in the air .
Instead they were to be sent many hundreds of feet underground into a blackness " like no other " while they watched friends , brothers and neighbours go off into regular service .

Each month for 20 months
Bevin 's secretary drew two digits from a hat and all men whose National Service registration number ended with one of them were directed into coal mining .
For many , fresh from school , apprenticeships or from military cadet forces , the first they knew of it was when they received letters out of the blue .
Any refusal to comply would result in a heavy fine or possible imprisonment under the wartime Emergency Powers Act .
Not all Bevin Boys were ballotees , as men were also given the opportunity of choosing the mines in lieu of armed service .
The underground army included names that were later to become household ones , such as Jimmy Savile , who received a badge yesterday , Brian Rix and Eric Morecambe .

The fabulous Bevin Boys outisde 10 Downing Street today
Anyone who was conscripted directly into the mines , who joined the mines instead of the armed forces or who originally served in the armed forces and later volunteered to become a miner , is eligible to apply for a badge .
The ceremony coincides with the 60th anniversary of the demobilisation of the last Bevin Boys in 1948 .
As he prepared to meet the men the Prime Minister said : " The service that the Bevin Boys gave to this country was incredibly important and not only helped us to win the war but also to rebuild our country after the war .
" It is a great privilege to meet these men today to honour the work they did and on behalf of the whole country to show our appreciation for the service they gave . "
Warwick Taylor , 81 , was one of the Bevin Boys and is now vice - president of the Bevin Boys Association .
Like many of his fellow conscripts Mr Taylor had been looking forward to a quite different form of service back in 1943 .
After three - and - a - half years in the Air Training Corps his hopes were pinned on joining the RAF .
He was " devastated " when his calling up papers arrived and he found himself packed off from Harrow to South Wales .

" At the time I did feel like my opportunity to help my country had been snatched away , " he said .
" It was a job that had to be done , but it was only as time went on that I realised what an important job it was . "
But without a uniform Mr Taylor said it was often hard to meet the accusatory glances of others , who assumed the miner 's were draft dodgers or conscientious objectors .
He even got stopped by police .
The pensioner , who achieved his dream to work with planes after he was demobbed , said : " It 's absolutely vital to receive this recognition .
What we did was absolutely essential . "
Geoffrey Baker , 83 , of Deal , in Kent , thought he would enter the Royal Marines when he received his papers aged 18 .
" I did what I did without complaining but it was a nightmare when I got that letter , " he said .
Morris Pearce , 82 , of Basingstoke , Hampshire , was another who had dreamed of joining the Royal Marines .
" I was excited , young lads are a bit macho and the Royal Marines were top notch , I still get a tingle when I see them march . "
He was first asked to volunteer for mine work , then was ordered to the pit .
" I was absolutely disgusted , " he said .
" I was brought up in the country and I had no idea what to expect . "

Former Bevin Boy Brian Rix meets the Prime Minister
He was sent to a mine north of Doncaster where he worked until 1947 , watching as other men returned from war to " a gratuity and a new suit " while " we were stuck in a dark place " .
There was one bright spot when he met wife Sylvia .
" I 'm glad now I had that experience , " he said .
" There is no finer kind of man than the miners , they are marvellous people .
when you think of what they have to go through . "
Widower Raymon Benedyk , 81 , dreamed of joining the RAF as a pilot when he left bomb - blasted South London for the mines .
" I can't remember exactly what I did , but I think there may have been a few rude words when I got the letter .
" We got no uniform , we did n't even get work clothes , all we got were out boots and our helmet . "
He was invalided out in 1945 after suffering a back injury .
In the 1970s he enquired about a disability pension , only to be told he was not entitled to the pension as the injury was not sustained in combating the enemy .
Fellow widower Dan Duhig , 82 , had two brothers in the Army and was already a volunteer sick attendant for the Navy , which he expected to join , when he got his call up .
" I was claustrophobic and absolutely frightened to death when I started , " he said .
" You can't imagine what it 's like if you have never been down a coal mine .
You have never known a world of darkness like it and the conditions were disgusting . "
Even now Mr Duhig feels a slight sense of disappointment that he did n't achieve his dream , but he said his family were proud of him .
" We 've received recognition and that 's the main thing , " he said .

As odd as it sounds , Shailendra Roy of eastern India is n’t kidding around .
Earlier this week Roy impressed crowds by pulling a train engine and three coaches .
The Darjeeling toy train , which weighs about 35 tons , was attached to Roy ’s ponytail by a metal chain .
After pulling the train 10 meters , Roy proudly announced , “ I am planning to dangle myself from a helicopter . ”
How do you maintain such a ponytail ?
By rubbing it with mustard oil and doing lots of training , like pulling heavy logs and other objects .
And apparently the flying thing is n’t totally new ; last year Roy tied his ponytail from a rope and flew through the air from one building to another in front of television cameras .
Although we here at Gadling do not recommend you try Roy ’s new way of travel at home , the concept is intriguing .
And by intriguing I obviously mean slightly crazy .
Look at what the brilliant minds at Disney / Pixar have been working on : A real , working version of WALL -E , the hero of the upcoming Disney movie going by the same name .
I wonder how long it will take for this thing to end up on eBay ?

The trip will probably dwell on historic ties rather than differences
With the US presidential election now moving into high gear , the visit by President George W Bush to the major capitals of western Europe this week , expected to be his valedictory trip , has become something of a sideshow .
The eyes of many peoples and governments in Europe will be on Senators Obama and McCain , as Europe hopes for better things from the next US president .
A poll by the UK's Daily Telegraph website in late May showed that in Britain , France , Germany and Russia , more people regarded the United States as a force for evil than for good .
Only in Italy did the US fare better .
And Senator Barack Obama was the clear preference ( 52 % ) across the five countries to be the next US president .
This indicates that the mood in Europe is one for change , though it remains true that countries of the former Soviet bloc have much more positive views of the Bush administration than those in Western Europe .
Lame - duck phase
This trip is largely about the Western capitals , though Mr Bush will start off at the annual EU / US summit , being held this year in Slovenia .
Iraq was a stake driven into the heart of both transatlantic ties and relations between European governments
He will then visit Berlin , Rome ( including the Holy See to meet the Pope again ) , Paris and London , with a stop in Belfast on his way home .
Presidents in their lame - duck phase tend to travel around to say goodbye and polite hosts tend not to dwell on differences but on historic ties .
There will much of that in this visit , with a look - back at the warm feelings engendered by the Berlin airlift in 1948 and the Marshall Plan that put Western Europe back on its feet after the war .
Looking back is easy .
The problems come with looking forward .
Many western Europeans would like Guantanamo Bay closed Iraq was a stake driven into the heart of both transatlantic ties and relations between European governments .
It remains , if no longer a stake , then a thorn .
President Bush 's own standing has been further damaged by the memoirs of his former press secretary Scott McClellan , who said that the Bush administration had misled the world over Iraq with a " political propaganda campaign " .
Iraq is regarded in many , but not all , European capitals as a historic mistake , though there is a willingness now to accept that something might be salvaged from it .
As Iraq has improved , so has the transatlantic mood .
European leaders would like to hear that the US prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , is to be closed and that the US will not engage in anything that could be called torture , but this will have to wait for the next president .
There will be some important issues to be discussed , though , as always on a presidential visit .
These include a US push for more sanctions against Iran over the nuclear issue and a call by Mr Bush for Europe to match US spending on world health problems .
Old certainties gone Another disappointment is that a state of Palestine , which Mr Bush became the first American president to support , has not yet come about .
Easing Russian defiance will be a key challenge for the next US leader Mr Bush said in January : " I am confident that with proper help , the state of Palestine will emerge " , and further : " I believe it 's possible - not only possible , I believe it 's going to happen , that there will be a signed peace treaty by the time I leave office . "
He leaves office on 20 January 2009 .
But beyond Iraq and the Middle East , where Mr Bush 's central policy hope of greater democracy seems to have stalled , there remains the wider issue of where the US and Europe are heading .
The answer seems to be into still deep , if rather calmer , waters .
The old certainties of the Cold War have gone .
And new ones have arisen , especially the antagonism of Russia , a subject Mr Bush will raise .
Dimitri K Simes , president of the Nixon Center in Washington , wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine last December : " Misguided and arrogant US policies since the end of the Cold War have fuelled resentment in Russia , and Vladimir Putin 's increasing defiance is inflaming the West ...
Both sides must act soon to avert renewed confrontation . "
This will be a major task for the new US president and for Europe .
The deterioration of relations with Russia must go down as a blot on the pages of both US and European policy makers , though of course Russia has played its own full part .
Future of EU and Nato The European Union itself , like a lumbering behemoth , does not seem to know where it is going .
The fact is that EU governments retain the right to formulate their own foreign policies .
The corollary of that is that , diplomatically , Europe as a whole punches below its economic weight .
This gives the US a much freer hand as Europe is often divided .
At the end of the day , the US and Europe are still tied together by global interests , among them economics and international terrorism .
Nato seems to be enduring , perhaps under the new uncertainties about Russia , though in an ideal Europe , there would be no need for it .
In the long run , a greater emphasis on a European defence policy is likely to emerge ( the French will push this process during their EU presidency from July ) .
All this , too , will be on the new president 's agenda .
