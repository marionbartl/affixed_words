Science fiction and fantasy have ruled television for over 50 years , but some shows have brightened our screens and supercharged our brains more than others .
Here 's our list of the 100 greatest science fiction / fantasy shows of all time .

How did we determine these rankings ?
Using science .
That means that if you disagree with the shows we included , or the order we ranked them in , you are anti-science , and must go back to living in caves and eating animals you killed yourself , with your bare hands .
Just kidding — actually , we know that these rankings are highly subjective , and we argued over them for hours .
And we do n't expect you to agree with every single choice we made .

We did try to look at a show 's popularity at the time it was on the air , how much of a cult following it 's garnered since it ended ( if it 's already ended ) , and how much influence it had on other TV shows and pop culture as a whole .
Feel free to argue with us , and each other , in the comments — just please , be friendly and civil about it .
Thanks !

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The markets are on a roll , but it 's still a tad early for Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner to be counting his bailout winnings .
Geithner said this past weekend that taxpayers have made a small profit on their investments in banks via the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
" We 've already earned about $ 6 billion for the taxpayer on those investments , " Geithner said Sunday on ABC's " This Week . "
The claim seems to reflect regular payments banks have made since Treasury rolled out the TARP last fall .
Treasury did n't return a request for comment , but the agency had received $ 6.85 billion in bank dividend and interest payments through June , according to data published last month by Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general for TARP .
But as welcome as the dividend payments are at a time of surging federal spending , it would be premature to conclude they represent profits for taxpayers .
" Dividends are definitely income , but they 're not necessarily profit , " said Alex Pollock , a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington .
Pollock said it 's impossible to assess the profitability of TARP without a robust and systematic accounting of the program 's costs , including interest expense and overhead .
Others have reached similar conclusions .
Gary Engel , director of financial management and assurance at the Government Accountability Office , was asked at a hearing last month whether he views the stream of dividends into Treasury as a profit for taxpayers .
" Not at this point , " he said .
Pollock said the answer is for Treasury to administer the program as if it were an independent company , with its own independently audited financial statements and balance sheet .
Doing so would make clear exactly how much it costs Treasury to borrow the money it uses for TARP .
The shortage of data on that question came to light at a congressional hearing last month .
Rep. Randy Neugebauer , R - Texas , speculated at a July 9 House Financial Services hearing that the Treasury could end up spending $ 28 billion annually to finance TARP .
The committee 's chairman , Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass . , said he thought the costs are " far less " and said he 'd ask GAO to provide an estimate .
Frank 's office said Monday it would check on the answer .
Congress initially empowered Treasury to make $ 700 billion in TARP investments .
The government has some $ 371 billion in TARP investments outstanding , according to Barofsky 's report last month .
There 's also the question of subsidies -- the amount by which Treasury overpaid for the preferred stock it received from banks that got TARP funds , as measured by market values .
The Congressional Budget Office estimated in June that institutions received $ 159 billion more in aid than Treasury received in securities .
None of this is to say the program has been an unmitigated disaster .
Officials proposed TARP not to make money but to cushion the collapse of economic activity last fall following the collapse of giant finance firms such as Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual .
" This program is delivering very important improvements in availability of credit , which is the ultimate test , " Geithner said Sunday .
And the bet taxpayers made on the financial sector is looking a lot better now than it was when Geithner took office : on Monday , the S&P 500 closed above 1,000 for the first time since President Obama 's election last November .
But Marcus Peacock , project director at Subsidyscope , a Web site run by the Pew Charitable Trusts that tracks federal spending , said the government is n't doing enough to document what 's happening with the money .
He said government data collection projects are often " pockmarked " with omissions and outright errors , a pattern that has n't been broken with the financial bailouts .
Despite the administration 's public embrace of transparency , it has failed to provide full and understandable disclosure of its actions in TARP , Peacock said .
Pollock , likening taxpayers to the ant who saved all winter and the TARP - taking banks to the profligate grasshopper , said only a full airing of TARP accounts can satisfy responsible Americans .
" I 'd like to do something for the ant , " he said .

On a recent overcast Saturday , just before noon , the ministers from some of this city 's largest black churches arrived in their dapper and dark suits , looking somewhat out of place on a dusty construction site .
They had come to break ground on 21 affordable apartments – a joint project between a church - affiliated development group and Kaiser Permanente , the healthcare provider .
There were photo ops , the ceremonial shovels of dirt , and , given the number of reverends on hand , plenty of prayers .
This neighborhood , known as the Western Addition , was once the heartbeat of San Francisco 's African - American community .
Fillmore Street , known for its vibrant postwar jazz scene , is a few blocks away .
KPOO , the first black - owned noncommercial radio station west of the Mississippi , is up the street .
And the ministers say they hope that these new apartments – albeit not solely for black residents – begin to stem the rapid decline of the city 's African - American population .
Blacks have been leaving San Francisco in record numbers .
Blacks accounted for 6.5 percent of the population in 2005 , down from a high of 13.4 percent in 1970 – the steepest decline of any major US city , according to the US Census Bureau .
While San Francisco 's image has been defined by a history of tolerance and openness , some say today 's reality is much different .
They paint a picture of a racially and economically divided city where blacks are vanishing from the social and cultural fabric , priced out and marginalized by the urban redevelopment policies of the past half century .
The decline in the black population has been so rapid that Mayor Gavin Newsom launched the African American Out-Migration Task Force and Advisory Committee in 2007 to reverse the trend .
One key recommendation of the committee is for more affordable housing – much like the new development in the Western Addition .
It 's projects like this , says the Rev. J. Edgar Boyd of Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church , that could help retain middle - class African - Americans who may otherwise flee to northern California cities such as Stockton or Antioch .
That flight has left a wide gulf within the black community here .
On one end of the spectrum , seniors stay because they own homes .
On the other , poorer and younger black families populate public housing .
What 's missing , he says , is a middle ground .
That means fewer churchgoers in the pews on Sundays and not as many parishioners taking part in community efforts .
" It just kills the life and spirit of the community , " he says .
Findings of the mayor 's task force confirm that black families with moderate and above - moderate incomes have been leaving since 1990 .
As a result , very - low - income households made up more than two - thirds of the black population in 2005 – up from roughly one - half in 1990 .
The task force also said that the per capita income for African - Americans here is 56 percent less than that of whites .
Blacks " lag behind the rest of the city in almost every key economic indicator and face significant barriers to addressing the disparities , " it said .
The absence of middle - class blacks in San Francisco leaves the impression that " we are not stakeholders in the community , " says Pastor Boyd .
" A lot of African - American people feel that way , " says Fred Blackwell , executive director of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency , echoing the task force 's conclusion that many black San Franciscans feel increasingly disconnected with the city .
That was true for Rachel Satterfield , the child of an African - American father and Puerto Rican mother , who came to San Francisco three years ago searching for the diversity her hometown in Alaska never had .
Now , the 20 - something hipster with a burst of dark curly hair has found people like her – but only after leaving San Francisco .
She has moved across the San Francisco Bay to Oakland .
" That 's what I was expecting to find when I moved to San Francisco , " she says .
The decline of the black community began decades ago , many say , long before the dotcom boom and the housing bubble pushed housing to a peak median price of $ 665,000 in 2007 .
During a massive redevelopment of Western Addition between 1958 and 1971 , hundreds of homes owned by black residents were torn down and businesses razed .
Public housing tracts replaced blocks of the large Victorians – houses that may have been dilapidated at the time but would be valuable now .
What 's more , the transformation of San Francisco 's economy has been a key factor .
Closure of the city 's shipyard in the early 1970s caused many blacks to leave for jobs elsewhere in the Bay Area and to move out of the Bay View - Hunters Point neighborhood .
As San Francisco 's economy moved away from manufacturing , activists say , blacks were left out of the new service economy .
But the out - migration of blacks from San Francisco has positive aspects , too .
An " increase in economic status has enabled many African - American homeowners to sell their houses and take the profits to the suburbs , " states a study by San Francisco State University 's College of Ethnic Studies and its Public Research Institution .
For John William Templeton , author and black historian , there 's no choice :
He 's smitten with San Francisco even though he says blacks are being " excluded from the heritage and the economy . "
" Everybody in the world is trying to get to San Francisco , but black folks are leaving .
What 's up with that ?
It 's because they do n't see a future , " he says . •
Chemicals in cannabis have been found to stop prostate cancer cells from growing in the laboratory , suggesting marijuana - based medicines could one day help fight the disease , scientists said .
After working initially with human cancer cell lines , Ines Diaz - Laviada and colleagues from the University of Alcala in Madrid also tested one compound on mice and discovered it produced a significant reduction in tumour growth .
Their research , published in the British Journal of Cancer , underlines the growing interest in the medical use of active chemicals called cannabinoids , which are found in marijuana .
Experts , however , stressed that the research was still exploratory and many more years of testing would be needed to work out how to apply the findings to the treatment of cancer in humans .
" This is interesting research which opens a new avenue to explore potential drug targets but it is at a very early stage , " said Lesley Walker , director of cancer information at Cancer Research UK , which owns the journal .
" It absolutely is n't the case that men might be able to fight prostate cancer by smoking cannabis , " she added .
The cannabinoids tested by the Spanish team are thought to work against prostate cancer because they block a receptor , or molecular doorway , on the surface of tumour cells .
This stops them from dividing .
In effect , the cancer cell receptors can recognise and talk to chemicals found in cannabis , Ms Diaz - Laviada said .
" These chemicals can stop the division and growth of prostate cancer cells and could become a target for new research into potential drugs to treat prostate cancer , " she said .
Her team 's work with two cannabinoids - methanandamide and JWH - 015 - is the first demonstration that such cannabis chemicals prevent cancer cells from multiplying .
Some drug companies are already exploring the possibilities of cannabinoids in cancer , including British - based cannabis medicine specialist GW Pharmaceuticals .
It is collaborating with Japan 's Otsuka on early - stage research into using cannabis extracts to tackle prostate cancer - the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men - as well as breast and brain cancer .
Other attempts to exploit the cannabinoid system have met with mixed success .
Sanofi-Aventis was forced to withdraw its weight - loss drug Acomplia from the market last year because of links to mental disorders .

It is not clear what has caused the new disruption .
Large parts of West Africa are struggling to get back online following damage to an undersea cable .
The fault has caused severe problems in Benin , Togo , Niger and Nigeria .
The blackout is thought to have been caused by damage to the SAT - 3 cable which runs from Portugal and Spain to South Africa , via West Africa .
Around 70 % of Nigeria 's bandwidth was cut , causing severe problems for its banking sector , government and mobile phone networks .
" SAT - 3 is currently the only fibre optic cable serving West Africa , " explained Ladi Okuneye , chief marketing officer of Suburban Telecom , which provides the majority of Nigeria 's bandwidth .
" So all West African countries have to use it . "
Companies were being forced to use alternatives - such as using satellite links - to maintain connections to the rest of the world , he said .
Telkom South Africa , one of the shareholders of SAT - 3 , has not said what caused the problems but said it was aware of " a cable fault on the Benin branch that is being investigated " .
The 15,000 km ( 9,300 mile ) SAT - 3 cable lands in eight West African countries as it winds its way between Europe and South Africa .
" The rest of the system is unaffected by this fault , " a Telkom South Africa representative said .
Nigeria has been badly hit because around 70 % of its bandwidth is routed through neighbouring Benin .
The network , run by Suburban Telecom , was set up to bypass Nigeria 's principal telecoms operator Nitel which runs the SAT - 3 branch cable which lands in Nigeria .
The SAT - 3 consortium is in the process of sending a ship from Cape Town in South Africa to the area to investigate the fault .
Mr Okuneye said that by the time the relevant paperwork was done , it was likely to be " two weeks " before the ship arrived off the coast .
Meanwhile , Benin has been able to reroute its net traffic through neighbouring countries to get back online .
Mr Okuneye said his company was hoping to do the same but said the process would be slower because its bandwidth requirements were so much larger than those of the small republic .
Togo and Niger , which are not part of the SAT - 3 consortium , remain offline .

The world is in the market for some clean - energy breakthroughs .
But can the market deliver ?
It is less likely to happen than you think without government support , suggests Daron Acemoglu , the Charles P. Kindleberger Professor of Applied Economics at MIT .
In contrast to received wisdom , his mathematical modeling on the subject suggests private - sector innovation is inefficient :
Many firms chase the same short - term payoffs , inhibiting long - term technological and economic progress .
The economy would grow better , and become greener , if technology firms pursued a greater diversity of innovations .
" Why is it that we have not developed new technologies until now ? " asks Acemoglu during an interview in his office .
" It 's not a surprise that we 're going to run out of oil , and 20 years ago we knew the environmental implications of fossil fuels .
But we did n't do anything because the market does n't provide enough incentives for diversity of research . "
As Acemoglu states in a research note he published online this summer , the constant financial pressure on corporations means that " too much research will be devoted to currently successful product and technology lines , " rather than potentially transformative , if risky , projects .
Moreover , Acemoglu observes in the work , " A Note on Diversity and Technological Progress , " our patent system rewards incremental improvements on existing devices .
Should someone patent a far - reaching advance , " somebody else will have invented even a better version of this technology by the time it can be marketed . "
Automakers , he notes , long favored small steps , not leaps .
Acemoglu 's model looks at the financial incentives facing private - sector researchers who could work on either technologies that are already in use or on future innovations .
To maximize profits , scientists will tend to work on existing devices , creating a large quality gap between those technologies and their languishing potential replacements .
This analysis illuminates a paradox :
What seems logical for technology companies , one by one , may not be best for the entire economy .
Conversely , Acemoglu writes , policy - makers trying to help the environment by fostering a variety of clean innovations could also produce better economic results .
The issue matters because the government 's increasing drive to create clean energy , Acemoglu thinks , should fit the contours of innovation .
He believes a carbon tax , for instance , could help the environment but fail to spur significant innovation , since the market might respond with modest carbon - reducing technologies , not transformative changes .
In another 2009 paper , " The Environment and Directed Technical Change , " Acemoglu and three Harvard co-authors ( including economist Philippe Aghion ) assert that subsidies for research on clean technologies as well as temporary taxes on profits related to fossil fuels such as coal ( which accounts for nearly half the electricity generated in the United States ) would better prod corporations to research clean technologies .
Other economists find this analysis fruitful .
" One might think innovation is a random arrival process of ideas , " says Benjamin Jones PhD ’03 , an associate professor at Northwestern 's Kellogg School of Management who studies the structure of scientific research .
" While that may be important , Daron has shown how innovation is also disciplined by economic conditions . "
Some colleagues , while agreeing that corporate research usually involves small - scale advances , are less likely than Acemoglu to regard such incrementalism as a problem .
" If you look at transformative technologies , those are the product of many incremental steps , which end in something larger , " says David Levine PhD ' 81 , an economics professor at Washington University in St. Louis who has written about innovation .
For this reason , thinks Levine , the government does not need an assertive innovation policy .
Diversity at the university
Acemoglu , by contrast , thinks the government should not only more actively encourage technological change , but can expect to find a broad range of research ideas specifically in universities , which have markedly different incentive structures than the market .
In academia , Acemoglu suggests in his note , the " diversity of researchers " and " their non -profit seeking or ' nerdy ' behavior , may be socially beneficial . "
Granted , university researchers may also look to capitalize financially on their innovations , and , Acemoglu acknowledges , academics can exhibit their own " herding " habits .
Still , he says , " There is also an automatic control against that , which is that there is a reward for originality . "
Acemoglu regards projects such as the National Institutes of Health 's EUREKA program ( which funds innovative research ) as promising ways of enhancing this diversity ; as he notes , breakthroughs such as the Internet have their origins in government - sponsored academic research which later become commercialized .
Indeed , Acemoglu even suggests research diversity can stem from the sociological diversity of researchers .
" I think it 's very much related , " he says .
" If you have a different perspective , you might have a different solution to a problem . "
That may not apply to closely circumscribed fields like particle physics , Acemoglu adds , " but if you 're looking at a social problem , it 's a major thing . "
Our multi- faceted climate problem , he thinks , fits this category .
Studying innovation has diversified Acemoglu's own research portfolio ; in 2005 he won the John Bates Clark Medal , the American Economic Association 's award for the best American economist under the age of 40 , largely for work relating forms of government to economic growth .
But innovation has become an important area of research for him : " My ideal would be to team up with climate scientists and bring these ideas about the diversity of technology into their climate models . "
Those models contain assumptions about economic growth .
But will that growth be clean ?
Understanding the dynamics of innovation could let climate analysts forecast the environmental consequences of government policies .
This is work in progress , notes Acemoglu , but surely there will be a growing market for it .
Has President Obama outsmarted us all ?
This was conservatives ’ seething summer of discontent and unhinged hysteria : town halls , tea parties and tirades .
They captured headlines and gained momentum .
Misinformation ran amuck .
President Obama ’s approval ratings tumbled .
Through it all , Obama maintained a Pollyannaish , laissez - faire disposition .
Some found this worrisome .
Others , like me , even thought it weak .
But maybe not so fast .
According to Gallup poll results released on Wednesday , the president ’s approval rating has stopped falling and has leveled out in the low - 50 percents , about the same as Ronald Reagan ’s and Bill Clinton ’s at this point in their presidencies ( both two - termers , lest we forget ) .
The United Nations General Assembly and the G - 20 summit have catapulted Obama back onto the world stage where leaders treat him like the best jock in the high school cafeteria .
Even his adversaries praise him .
His leadership in these forums to tighten the screws on Iran for its nuclear programs project a presidential certitude and sense of steel and authority that was sorely needed and sorely missed .
Furthermore , after Dick Cheney ’s thrashing and whining about the Obama administration making us less safe , a rash of recent terror arrests has sent the signal that the aggressive pursuit of terror suspects remains a top priority .

Williams has confirmed that it will part company with Toyota at the end of the 2009 season .
The move ends an engine supply deal that began at the start of 2007 , and had been anticipated for several weeks , with senior Williams figures openly admitting that the team was reviewing its engine options for 2010 .
Team boss Frank Williams thanked Toyota for its support over the last three seasons .
" At a time of great difficulty for us as a team , Toyota stepped forward and agreed to supply us with engines for 2007 through to the end of 2009 , " he said .
" Toyota has been a very decent partner who have always respected our independence and provided us with a first - rate technical product .
We are proud that we have been able to work with such a great company and we are grateful to the team in Cologne for their support .
" I would like to single out for our thanks the Toyota engineers and technicians who have worked within our race team tirelessly for the past three years . "
Toyota motorsport boss Tadashi Yamashina added : " We have enjoyed a productive working relationship with Williams and I believe both companies have benefited from that partnership .
We respect the wishes of Williams to look for other opportunities and wish them well for the future . "
Williams 's statement said that its new engine supplier would be announced " in due course . "
The team has been linked with both Renault and Cosworth for next season .

Boys who carry a particular variation of the geneA ( ) , sometimes called the " warrior gene , " are more likely not only to join gangs but also to be among the most violent members and to use weapons , according to a new study from The Florida State University that is the first to confirm anlink specifically to gangs and guns .
Findings apply only to males .
Girls with the same variant of the MAOA gene seem resistant to its potentially violent effects on gang membership and weapon use .
Led by noted biosocial criminologist Kevin M. Beaver at FSU 's College of Criminology and Criminal Justice , the study sheds new light on the interplay of genetics and environment that produces some of society 's most serious violent offenders .
" While gangs typically have been regarded as a sociological phenomenon , our investigation shows that variants of a specific MAOA gene , known as a ' low - activity 3 - repeat allele , ' play a significant role , " said Beaver , an award - winning researcher who has co-authored more than 50 published papers on the biosocial underpinnings of criminal behaviour .
" Previous research has linked low - activity MAOA variants to a wide range of antisocial , even violent , behaviour , but our study confirms that these variants can predict gang membership , " he said .
" Moreover , we found that variants of this gene could distinguish gang members who were markedly more likely to behave violently and use weapons from members who were less likely to do either . "
The MAOA gene affects levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin that are related to mood and behavior , and those variants that are related to violence are hereditary .
Some previous studies have found the " warrior gene " to be more prevalent in cultures that are typified by warfare and aggression .
" What 's interesting about the MAOA gene is its location on the X - chromosome , " Beaver said .
" As a result , males , who have one X - chromosome and one Y - chromosome , possess only one copy of this gene , while females , who have two X - chromosomes , carry two .
Thus , if a male has an allele ( variant ) for the MAOA gene that is linked to violence , there is n't another copy to counteract it .
Females , in contrast , have two copies , so even if they have one risk allele , they have another that could compensate for it .
That 's why most MAOA research has focused on males , and probably why the MAOA effect has , for the most part , only been detected in males . "
The new study examined DNA data and lifestyle information drawn from more than 2,500 respondents to the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health .
Beaver and colleagues from Florida State , Iowa State and Saint Louis universities detailed their findings in a paper to be published in a forthcoming edition of the journal Comprehensive Psychiatry .
Currently , the paper ( " Monoamine oxidase A genotype is associated with gang membership and weapon use " ) is accessible online at www.comppsychjournal.com via the " Articles in Press " link .
In addition to the MAOA study , Beaver 's body of biosocial criminology research includes published research that links genetics to adolescent victimization and formation of delinquent peer groups and the use of steroids to " roid rage " -- all among the first such works in the field .
He won the American Society of Criminology 's 2009 Ruth Shonle Cavan Young Scholar Award in recognition of his outstanding scholarly contributions during the short time since he earned a Ph.D. in criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati in 2006 .
Beaver is the coauthor / editor of " Biosocial Criminology : A Primer " ( Kendall / Hunt , 2009 ) and six other books .
WASHINGTON - The Justice Department has launched an investigation into whether former Interior secretary Gale A. Norton illegally used her position to steer lucrative oil leases to Royal Dutch Shell PLC , the company she works for now , officials with both departments confirmed .
The criminal investigation is focused on a 2006 decision by the Interior Department to award three oil shale leases on federal land in Colorado to a Shell subsidiary .
Oil from the leases could eventually earn the company hundreds of billions of dollars .
Investigators are looking into whether Norton , named by President George W. Bush to run the agency in 2001 , violated a law that bars federal employees from discussing employment with a company if they are involved in a decision that could benefit that company .
Months after granting
Shell the leases , Norton left the agency .
Shell later that year hired her as an in - house counsel for its unconventional fuels division , which includes oil shale .
Justice Department and Interior investigators also are trying to determine whether Norton violated a broader federal “ denial of honest services ’’ law .
Under the statute , government officials can be prosecuted for violating the public trust for directing government business to favored firms .
Officials spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case .
Norton could not be reached immediately for comment .
“ We are aware of an investigation ; however , we are not in a position to comment , ’’ said Kelly op de Weegh , a Shell spokeswoman .
The Interior Department ’s Office of Inspector General began the investigation toward the end of Bush ’s last term , after receiving complaints about the lease process .
The IG ’s office made a formal referral to the Justice Department earlier this year after concluding there was probable cause of a criminal violation .
The investigation was first reported by The Los Angeles Times .
Before becoming Bush ’s first Interior secretary , Norton was Colorado ’s attorney general and had worked as a private lawyer for timber , oil , and mining companies .
At Interior , she supported expanded oil and gas drilling on government - owned land .
The development of oil shale largely in the West was one of the technologies that the Bush administration wanted to explore aggressively .
In response to a recommendation by then - Vice President Dick Cheney ’s energy task force , the Interior ’s Bureau of Land Management issued six demonstration leases in Colorado and Utah .
Shell was the only company to receive more than one lease .
Its US operations are based in Houston .

Stephen A. Smith On Rush Limbaugh And The Rams
Stephen A. Smith on black athletes playing for Rush Limbaugh if he bought the NFL's St. Louis Rams .
Armando Iannucci's part - improvised political comedy about the inner workings of new ( ish ) Labour , The Thick of It , returns to TV next week – this time with a proper run of eight episodes and a prime - time Saturday night slot on BBC2 .
The new series begins on the day of a cabinet reshuffle and a new minister for the Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship in the form of Nicola Murray ( played by queen of twisted middle - class women Rebecca Front ) a back - bencher so low down the pecking order her appointment is likened to a dinner lady presenting the 10th series of The Big Breakfast .
The best reason to tune in though is to witness the further adventures of Malcolm Tucker , Peter Capaldi 's lethal Scottish enforcer of number 10's wishes , or as Murray describes him " the PM 's all - swearing eye " .
With Tucker , The Thick of It has taken profanity , the liberal use of the word cock and the fine art of the soul - puncturing put - down to a new high .
So here are our 10 favourite Tucker quotes from the first series and the two spin - off specials ( both of which are being repeated next week ) .
Did we miss any pearls of Tucker wisdom ?
Feel free to share them below .
WARNING : Obvious really , but just in case … ridiculously sweary language follows below :
Our ten favourite Tucker quotes
• Responding to knock at his door : " Come the fuck in or fuck the fuck off . "
• Tucker 's Law ( out - take from the Spinners & Losers special ) : " If some cunt can fuck something up , that cunt will pick the worst possible time to fucking fuck it up cause that cunt 's a cunt . "
• Moaning about minister on the phone : " He 's about as much use as a marzipan dildo . "
• To a pair of rival advisors : " Laurel and fucking Hardy !
Glad you could join us .
Did you manage to get that piano up the stairs OK ? "
• Dressing down MP , Geoff Holhurst : " You 're so back - bench , you 've actually fucking fallen off .
You 're out by the fucking bins where I put you . "
• Commenting on Ben Swain 's disastrous Newsnight appearance : " All these hands all over the place !
You were like a sweaty octopus trying to unhook a bra . "
• Bollocking a communications department employee : " How much fucking shit is there on the menu and what fucking flavour is it ? "
• Advising minister Hugh Abbot to keep up with the zeitgeist : " You 've got 24 hours to sort out your policy on EastEnders , right ?
Or you 're for the halal butchers . "
• Note passed to assistant Jamie during meeting with blue - sky thinker Julius Nicholson : " Please could you take this note , ram it up his hairy inbox and pin it to his fucking prostate . "
• Admonishing junior adviser Ollie Reeder to respect government property : " Feet off the furniture you Oxbridge twat , you 're not on a punt now . "

There was another workplace rampage killing last week , just outside of Fresno , California , leaving two company employees dead and the other employees grateful to be alive .
Fresno , like so much of unofficial America , is still in a state of shock these days , after suffering from a non -stop barrage of tragic events and trends , of subprime devastation and a three - year drought , and political corruption and machinations that seem to be accelerating with every month .
So unlike workplace shootings in the past , this one was quickly pushed off the front pages and almost forgotten , just a couple of days after it happened .
But like so many workplace shootings , scratch the surface of Fresno today , to get a sense of context , and you ’ll be shocked by how corrupt , desperate and bizarre the situation has become : pull the camera back from the scene of the crime , and suddenly you get Sean Hannity making regular appearances on behalf of agribusiness oligarchs , and beleaguered Mexican farmworkers gang - pressed into marching 50 miles in the Central Valley heat calling for the repeal of the Endangered Species Act … but more on that a bit later .
Here ’s what happened last Tuesday : Jim Badasci , who ’d worked at Fresno Equipment for 10 years , showed up Tuesday morning with a shotgun at 8:57 a.m. , and the first thing he did was kill a fellow co-worker , Ralph Wallis .
About two dozen fellow co-workers scattered at that point , some taking refuge at a nearby car wash , others reportedly hiding inside of a locked vault , as Badasci , wearing a hunting vest filled with ammo , proceeded to “ shoot the equipment ” — in this case , John Deere agricultural machinery .
Shooting utility tractors may seem strange or psychotic to anyone who has n’t studied these workplace shootings , but if you believe Badasci was trying to kill the Company which he believed was killing him , then shooting anything on company grounds makes perfect sense .
The really surprising part of the story is how four of the employees managed to stop Badasci from killing anyone else .
Though few details have come out about how they managed to convince an armed killer to stop shooting , a close friend of Badasci ’s believes this proves that he was not a wild madman randomly killing , but rather a normal man who ’d become desperate .
Rather than kill more fellow - workers , Badasci took his own life .
It was all over in a few minutes ; as always , the police and SWAT teams arrived just beyond the nick of time .
So why did Badasci shoot ?
What drove him to it , and who was he after ?
Officially , we do n’t know .
But one local report on KSEE24 TV , which no one else picked up on , offered a rather clear explanation :
We spoke with Michael von Flue , a former coworker of Jim Badasci , who says that this was out of character for him .
That Jim would go out of his way to help others and that he had a good home life .
Von Flue did not want to go on camera , but tells KCEE 24 News , ” This is what happens when a company mismanages their employees and fails to treat them with respect . ”
In an email exchange with Von Flue , he told me that Jim Badasci had been driven to desperation by a particular supervisor and the company ’s toleration of the supervisor ’s mistreatment .
Von Flue apologized for all the grammatical errors in his email , noting how difficult the last week has been , and how little he has slept .
He dismissed the idea that drugs played a part , but then went on to speculate that maybe he suffered from some kind of mental illness that was triggered by the harassment and mistreatment Jim suffered .
This is particularly interesting because I ’ve written about this in the past : the definition of mental illness today in today ’s workplace is when you ’re too sensitive to mistreatment , bullying , stress , wage cuts , firing , etc. and you want to fight back ; a healthy mind should be able to take it all in stride , accept it with a harmless grumble , and “ move on . ”
Continuing , Von Flue said that Jim “ loved his job , talking with people , ” and was very sociable , but that the supervisor had made his life hell , and unfortunately the company owners decided not to do anything about it , even though others had also complained .
“ It is sad that they did n’t follow through … things might have been different I ’m sure . ”
Von Flue ’s letter echoes a reader comment I spotted in a Fresno Bee story about the shooting :
sweetthgvfwrote on September , 23 11:09 AM
: To anyone and everyone out there who knows Jimmy and knows what it was like to work at Fresno Equipment Company , Jimmy may have been the one who did this horrible deed , but Fresno Equipment is ultimately responsible because of the way they treat their employees .
If you do n’t want to believe it do n’t , but you can talk to anyone who ’s quit over the last 5 years because of management my husband included , and they will tell you the real story behind all of this .
My husband warned the company owners 3 years ago when he quit that if they do n’t take care of the problem somebody will go postal .
Too bad they did n’t listen back then …. if you ask me both Jimmy and Ralph are victims .
Again , our sympathies to both families …. but let ’s face reality here .
This situation has been in the making for a long time .
It ’s called hostile work environment .
Maybe now management will listen to their employees when there ’s a problem instead of sweeping it under the rug .
Just a year ago , this kind of talk would have been dismissed out of hand , because the Reaganomics model in place for 30 years was the still best in the world , and if you were n’t on board , it was your own problem .
Now that it ’s all collapsed and we ’re starting to understand how badly we ’ve been burned all these years , revelations about how miserably workers may have been treated at the company Badasci attacked elicit a different kind of shrug — like , “ Yeah , so what , everyone gets screwed over by their companies , what ’s new ? ”
Getting screwed over the way we have been these past 30 years is something new — as are the workplace massacres , pitting employee against Company , which only started after the Reagan Revolution handed all power to the shareholders , and convinced the losers in that deal — the 90 percent of Americans whose lives got worse in every measurable way since then — that in fact it was in our own best interests to turn corporations into little Profit Gulags , where the inmates could be downsized at will , and mass - layoffs in the tens and hundreds of thousands became so common in good times and in bad that it proved Stalin ’s dictum about “ one victim is a tragedy , a million victims is a statistic . ”
What is surprising is the portrait painted of Badasci — nothing at all like the cliched “ loner who kept to himself . ”
Here is how some people described Badasci in the aftermath — and remember , it ’s not easy to publicly talk well of a murderer :
One friend said he was unable to explain why Badasci would commit such a crime .
Mario Juarez of Kingsburg said he worked with Badasci at Fresno Equipment for two years and they remained friends after Juarez quit .
“ We ’ve gone dove hunting and to concerts .
We talked from time to time , ” Juarez said .
But Juarez is at a loss to understand the shooting .
“ I talked to him last week and he gave no clues that anything was wrong , ” Juarez said .
“ I ’ve never in my life seen him mad .
I would have bet my life savings he would never do a thing like this . ” … Marie Taylor , who lives down the block , had heard news reports about the shooting , but did not know Badasci was the suspect .
She said Badasci was a mechanic and seemed to like his job .
“ He waved at me twice yesterday when I went by , ” she said Taylor occasionally talked to Badasci and his mother , but never saw a hint of trouble in his life .
“ He kept up the yard , ” she said .
“ He was good to his mother . ”
That last part , about how he lived with his mother at age 46 , might offer one clue as to what might have been bothering Badasci ; that , and the fact that everyone I read or saw interviewed seemed so casual about that , as if living with his mother and treating her well did n’t pain him , as if they were unaware that American culture marks such people as losers and laughingstocks , disqualified from the Darwinian Tournament .
If you ask me , that sounds about as miserable as a life can be : living at home with your mother outside of Fresno , in the unbearable heat and dust , at age 46 , working every day in a John Deere dealership in a barren strip off highway 99 , where business is bad and tempers are hot because of a three - year drought and a recession , and to top it all off , management treats him like shit .
Who would n’t want to end that violently ?
Few would actually do it — only the mentally sick , of course — but many , even healthy types , would dream of it …
So even though every person interviewed who knew Badasci had such nice things to say about him , and even though Von Flue and apparently others seem eager to get the truth out about what went on at the company , officially no one knows why he shot anyone , and officially , no one seems to care .
It is as if we ’ve come to accept these rampage murders as inevitable , as if there were always worker - on - worker killings in the American workplace , as if the workplace was always a dangerous place , and a stressful place , and a humiliating , degrading , insecure place where no one could be trusted , from the executives stuffing their pockets to the co-worker you wrongly suspect of being “ the type who ’d go postal . ”
All that is brand new by any historical measure :
The first of these modern workplace massacres , pitting abused employee against his own company , took place just twenty years ago this month , at the Standard Gravure plant in Louisville , Kentucky , when an aggrieved employee arrived at work with a gym bag full of weapons , and killed 8 coworkers and wounded 12 , before blowing his brains out .
Compared to that body count , Tuesday ’s workplace shooting at the Fresno Equipment Company was a mere skirmish : two dead , no injuries .
And we are n’t learning much in part because Fresno Equipment ’s owners barred employees from talking to the media , according to a local ABC affiliate — and they ’ll be inclined to listen , given Fresno ’s 15 % unemployment rate .
Moreover , Fresno has a particularly nasty socio- economic culture : at the top , a vicious ruling class of agribusiness plutocrats and their corrupt political tools , who together lord over hordes of pissed - off crackers and endlessly - exploited Mexican laborers .
In a lot of ways the region has more in common with a kleptocratic post - Soviet country , or an old Upton Sinclair novel , than what we think of as “ modern America . ”
Below the agribusiness oligarchs in Fresno County is a huge class of people struggling to keep its head above water , and losing .
An estimated 41 % of the people in Fresno County are either uninsured or underinsured , among the worst in the country .
Housing prices collapsed out here , and coupled with the three - year drought , unemployment in some Central Valley farming towns reaches as high as 40 - 50 % .
The struggle with poverty can mean dozens of circles of Hell , levels that you would n’t imagine possible , like this one described in a recent Fresno Bee feature :
Ask Stanley about the cost of being poor and she whips out a plastic bag with dozens of dead cockroaches inside .
They were gathered from one apartment along Lowe Avenue .
“ Every night when you turn on the light , roaches scatter , ” Stanley said .
The roaches , attracted to mold and moisture behind the walls , wiggle their way into the ears of young children , prompting costly midnight visits to the emergency room , she said .
Families sleep with the lights on , not because they fear the bogeyman , but because they fear pests .
The bag of roaches came from an apartment where FIRM was conducting an assessment as part of a program to identify substandard housing and organize help .
The task is difficult , because families often wo n’t ask for help , or shun it .
Many are afraid of being evicted , having rents raised or being ratted out to immigration authorities , advocates say .
And this being Fresno County , you ca n’t forget that familiar demographic which gravitates to hot dry places like this : the Fox / Hannity crowd , seething with petty white - male malice , always mobilized to fuck up anything good , and side with whomever ’s going to cause the most damage — out of sheer spite .
* * *
Although the connection is tenuous between the site of the workplace shooting — a dealer in agricultural machines — and the larger issues in Fresno — agribusiness and water — nevertheless , as in so many other shootings , by digging into the Fresno Equipment murder , I started to get a taste of just how rotten and corrupt Fresno is these days , and the larger context in which the shooting took place .
Fresno is a bad place to be , and it ’s getting worse : imagine , just a week before the shooting , Sean Hannity flew into the area to — get this — demand federal government handouts .
Since this sort of clashes with his proclaimed hatred of socialism and Big Government , Hannity , whom Glenn Beck has relegated to role of “ Peter Brady of Fox News ’ celebrity - goons , ” switched enemies : now it ’s environmentalists who are the “ terrorists ” and “ extremists , ” headed , of course , by the eco-terrorist Number One , our socialist / Marxist / Islamofascist President Barack Obama .
Hannity was joined in his soak - the - taxpayer crusade by a washed - up Latino comedian named Paul Rodriguez , whose failure in showbiz ( the best gig Rodriguez landed this decade was a bit part in Beverly Hills Chihuahua — as the voice of a CG - generated iguana named “ Chico ” ) drove him to where it drove another failed comedian , Dennis Miller : into the fat arms of the angry Fox News white right - wing crowd : the last refuge of washed - up - comedian scoundrels .
But whereas Miller found himself a comfortable spot as Bill O’Reilly ’s monkey boy , Rodriguez is taking on a much more sinister role as the Latino face of agribusiness oligarch interests , fronting for rich landowners and farming conglomerates .
They set Rodriguez up as the head of a shady new advocacy group , “ The Latino Water Coalition , ” a front group set up by his rich agribusiness sponsors to make it seem that pobrefruit - pickers ’ interests are indistinguishable from those of their rich exploiters .
The agribusiness plutocrats who rule Fresno County are as horrible , greedy and shameless as the villains in an old Upton Sinclair novel , something even they seem to grasp .
So they hired the notorious PR firm Burson - Marsteller to mask their role .
Burson - Marsteller is the perfect firm for the job : they ’ve spent decades whitewashing evil Third World dictators , genocidal maniacs , and kleptocrats , helping them get away with murder and mass - theft all across the globe .
So for them , this was a piece of cake .
What B-M and the agribusiness tycoons decided to do is re-define the debate over taxpayer - funded water : shift attention away from all the state welfare money that the tycoons have been feeding off of and want more of , and superimpose a new false debate over water : as a choice between an endangered guppy versus vulnerable , impoverished Mexicans , the apple of every liberal ’s bleeding heart .
Paul “ Chico ” Rodriguez ( right ) , the CG - generated iguana
Taking Astroturfing to a new and darker level , this past April , agribusiness interests gang - pressed a couple thousand migrant Latino farmworkers into “ marching ” 50 miles over four days in the scorching hot Central Valley sun , calling for the repeal of the Endangered Species Act and for taking out the taxpayer credit card to finance and subsidize more cheap water .
The New York Times reported that marchers were paid by their employers , something I have n’t seen since Putin ’s PR goons would bus in thousands of workers and students for rallies that they either were bribed into attending , or told they better attend : “ In reality , this is not a farm worker march , ” said Arturo Rodriguez , president of the United Farm Workers of America , the 27,000 - member union founded by Cesar Chavez , which did not participate in the march .
“ This is a farmer march orchestrated and financed by growers . ”
And again in July , a couple thousand Latino farm hands were pressed into marching on Fresno City Hall to demand the repeal of the Endangered Species Act , opening up more cheap water , and ultimately , building the loathed Peripheral Canal , which would cost taxpayers billions of dollars and deliver enormous amounts of cheap water from Northern California to the Central Valley , converting their farm land into much more valuable suburban - tract - home development land .
At that July 1 rally , once again , some protesters admitted to reporters that they were either paid to protest , transported in by their bosses , or told that if they wanted to keep their jobs , they better show , according to the AP :
On Wednesday , nearly 4,000 people carrying professionally printed signs proclaiming , “ No water , no jobs , no hope , no future , ” marched through downtown .
One man who declined to give us name said his Kettleman City ( Kings County ) employer had driven him and other workers there and were paying them for their time .
Another woman said she came with 50 other employees of a Tulare agriculture contractor for free , to protect their jobs .
So basically the super - rich landowners and farming oligarchs are using the poorest and most vulnerable demographic — Mexican migrant workers — as human shields , in order to steal money from taxpayers while daring them to fire back : “ What , liberal eco-terrorists , you have more compassion for a guppy than for this poor Mexican , who sleeps with his lights on out of fear of cockroaches ?
What sort of heartless eco-terrorist are you ?
Sign the $ 12 billion Peripheral Canal deal now , or you ’ll have the blood of millions of Mexicans on your hands ! ”
Compare the happy healthy jocks ( left ) to the grim expressions on the gang - pressed migrant workers
It really is that sinister .
Paul Rodriguez even bragged about it to a convention of nearly - all - white rightwing Republicans this past May .
Rodriguez assured them they had nothing to be worried about his group being “ Latino , ” because he , Rodriguez , was using his less - fortunate fellow Mexicans as human shields to front for their wealthy agribusiness profits .
According to a topnotch local investigative reporter , Lloyd Carter ( who ’s written some amazing stories on the water / race / Astroturfing issues in the region ) , Rodriguez was invited to Bakersfield to speak to the rightwing Republican Assembly , where the former comedian went out of his way to assure his new white masters that there was nothing to be afraid of in the “ Latino ” name of his “ Latino Water Coalition ” group — it ’s all a Trojan Horse to advance their rich white Republican interests !
Here ’s what Rodriguez said :
“ When I say Latino Water Coalition a lot of you automatically say , ‘ Why Latino ?
Does n’t everyone need water , Paul ?
Why just you Latinos , and as a Caucasian person I take offense to that , why does everything have to be segregated ? ’
I do n’t know .
I do n’t know but we ’re using this .
We ’re using this race card in a positive manner , a cloak .
You know everybody ’s welcome to this .
The reason why we call it the Latino Water Coalition [ is ] because it gives them a pause .
‘ Better not attack these Latinos , we do n’t know . ’
If we call it the Caucasian Coalition , you bet they would already be attacking us .
Because Caucasians , sadly to say , who is defending you ?
I am .
You know , just to put that to rest , there ’s no division . ”
Rodriguez really could n’t go any lower than this : from Beverly Hills Chihuahua to Westlands Mexican Hairless ; from “ Chico ” the talking CG - generated iguana , to Paul Rodriguez the Republican - generated talking monkey , a mean soulless prick willing to sell out his own to get a pat on the head and a chew - stick from his white masters .
To get an idea of just how vicious the ex-comic has become , watch him attack this guy in this video .
And this is where Sean Hannity comes in .
A week before the shooting , Hannity flew in to the nearby town of Huron , and hosted a show - cum- rally called “ The Valley That Hope Forgot . ”
One guest , former Republican mayor and TV actor Alan Autry , denounced Obama as fulfilling an Al Qaeda terrorist goal because a federal judge ordered the state to temporarily reduce the taxpayer - subsidized water flows to 86 % of normal due in part to damage to fish stock in the north of the state .
Hannity : I never saw an issue where it was so simple : Just turn the water on .
Autry : Yeah , Sean .
But that message has , there ’s a very powerful forces at work here .
And there ’s an old saying , it ’s not paranoia if they ’re really after you .
I made a statement not too long ago , and I stand by it , and I ’m going to stand by it today , and you saw Evangelina and Joe , turning this water off is not just bad politics , it ’s an act of domestic terror .
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
Now , Sean , the last thing I want to do is come here and go over the top .
Let me tell you why it is .
As mayor for eight years , I worked with Homeland Security after 9/11 .
One of the things we were charged with by the federal government was to work together locally to protect the water supply to farming communities so they could continue to provide food for the nation .
Now , if you would have told me that those — that water would have stopped , I would have believed maybe al - Qaeda struck , not the federal government .
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
In an article on the right - wing site newsbusters.com about Hannity ’s rally , commenters ( perhaps B - M AstroTurfers ) reached for even more hysterical analogies :

Granny , the proper term is Holodomor ….’ hunger plague ’ or in other words ‘ death by starvation ’ .
I think it is ironic that all Obama would have to do is stroll around DC and see the memorial made to the Holodomor .
But since one of his heroes implemented it , he wo n’t pay attention to it .

September 18 , 2009 – 16:32 ET bycandance
It all ties in to the effort to devalue human life .
Who cares if 70 million people starved to death under Mao ?
Humans are an inconvenience to mother earth anyway .
Once you accept this premise , no argument against government can be framed around damage to citizens .
What I do n’t get about these rightwing bleeding - hearts is that if they ’re so familiar with the tragedies they cite , and if they feel the pain of those tragedies so deeply , then how is it that they can , with a clear conscience , degrade those tragedies by comparing a situation where 6 million starved to death or 70 million starved to death on the one hand , and a situation where no one starved to death on the other hand .
I know what their response is : retreat into an imaginary future - tense , where nothing can be disproven , and therefore their warnings that 70 million Americans WILL die because the government wo n’t fund the Peripheral Canal is as valid as if I say they wo n’t die , which is as valid as if someone else says that the Four Horsemen will align with the Age of Aquarius .
Whatever , it ’s like trying to reason with the street people in Berkeley …
And then there ’s Paul Rodriguez , the failed comedian who ’s being paid by agribusiness oligarchs to betray his own people and in particular the United Farm Workers union , the real target of the Latino Water Coalition front group he heads up .
Rodriguez , himself an immigrant from Mexico , now gets paid to put a suffering Latino face on the same rallies where migrant workers are pressed into marching for their masters — the failed comedian is reduced to performing in front of an audience that ’s literally paid to see him , or threatened with their jobs if they do n’t .
And he ’s performing his role as the Tio Tomás of Fresno County better than his masters could hope for .
Rodriguez is so overzealous in his new collaborationist role that he ’s cooking up his own plans to out - anti-Obama his pals in the angry - white Tea Party movement .
One plan he ’s working on is to use these same gang - pressed migrant workers , hundreds or even thousands , to form a giant “ HELP ” sign visible from the air , aimed at President Obama ; another plan is a petition drive he wants to hold to rename Fresno County as “ Nobama County . ”
Here ’s an excerpt from Rodriguez ’s appearance on Hannity ’s show a couple of weeks ago in nearby Huron :
Rodriguez :
You know , we ’re not going to be farmers any longer .
We ’re going to be selling firewood because our trees wo n’t last another six months without water .
It ’s really a sad situation that those of us who choose to farm , my mother and my family in the central San Joaquin , perhaps the most fertile soil in the world , are now just sitting there ready to go on welfare or some other kind of support because we can’t farm .
Hannity : Paul , this is so serious , and it ’s almost mind - numbing that this could happen .
All right .
So we showed the little Delta smelt , this little minnow fish that is now on the endangered species list .
Now , they literally have shut down - you are getting and farmers are getting zero percent water .
Their trees and their farms are dying .
Is that right ?
Rodriguez : Yes …
Incidentally , just over a week after Hannity ’s “ The Valley Of No Hope ” rally in Huron , the mayor of that town was arrested on charges of grand theft , real estate fraud , possession of stolen property , and “ a wide array of criminal activity . ”
Hannity really knows how to pick ’em .
A couple of days after the Fresno Equipment Co. workplace shooting , the big story making local headlines was about how scores of Fresno State Bulldogs fans were thrown out of the football stadium during their game against Boise State , accused of “ politicizing ” the game , which was broadcast live on ESPN .
Certain students , supposedly forming a group called “ The Cause , ” wore pro-water T - shirts and waved pro-water signs for the cameras — a classic PR stunt that smells of something subcontracted out from Burson Marsteller .
The reason the students were thrown out was n’t just because they ’d brought politics into a college football game , but because some of the signs and shirts used profane language against President Obama .
Meanwhile , as Fresno continues to slash its police force and city employees , the county approved another $ 5 million tax subsidy for agribusiness landowners , even though the state budget can’t pitch in anymore .
For the super - rich in Fresno , there ’s no such thing as furloughs and shortfalls .
Which brings me back to Fresno Equipment Co. shooting .
When you pull the camera back a bit like this , and put the shooting into a larger context , it starts to make more sense .
But remember , even though it ’s easier to understand these shootings since last year ’s collapse , they ’re a product of the brutal Reaganomics we ’ve been living under for thirty years .
Workplace shootings , in which an employee stages an armed suicide attack on his company , or supervisors , or co-workers , only began a couple of decades ago , after Reagan ’s Revolution successfully stripped whatever power and leverage employees once had , and handed it all to the shareholders and executives .
Since then , it ’s been
Hell for an increasing number of Americans , and it ’s no coincidence that a brand new crime of desperation appeared with the Reagan Revolution : the worker who “ goes postal . ”
The first massacres began in the mid-late 1980s , and the shootings have repeated with such regularity that it seems we ’ve got to the point where we almost accept them as part of the landscape , as if they ’re inevitable and they ’ve always been with us , and always will .
Maybe that ’s why no one seems to have noticed or cared much that the man who shot his fellow worker , his company equipment , and then himself , may very well have been mistreated and driven to the brink .
Given just a small sample of what ’s going on in Fresno County , it ’s a wonder we ’re not all taking up arms and heading to the source of the pain .
Because Fresno County is most of America today , the rule , and not the exception .

The bear puppet host , Nassur , of a Hamas children 's TV program used different words for “ slaughter ” to describe how to rid Israel of Jews .
First the bear explains that all Jews must be “ erased from our land . ”
Later in the conversation he adds , " We want to slaughter them , Saraa , so they will be expelled from our land . ”
He repeats , “ … We ’ll have to [ do it ] by slaughter . "
He first uses the Arabic expression for “ slaughter , ” “ Nidbah - hom , ” and later on uses the word “ Shaht . ”
The following is the transcript from the children ’s program " Tomorrow's Pioneers " :
Nassur : “ There wo n't be any Jews or Zionists , if Allah wills .
They 'll be erased . ”
Saraa : “ Chased away . ”
Nassur : “ And just like we will visit the Qaaba [ in Mecca ] ... everyone will visit Jerusalem . ”
[ Sevenyear - old Palestinian child on phone tells how his father , a member of the Hamas Al - Qassam Brigades , “ died as a Shahid ( Martyr ) . ” ]
Nassur to child on phone : “ What do you want to do to the Jews who shot your father ? ”
Child on phone : “ I want to kill them . ”
Saraa :
“ We do n't want to do anything to them , just expel them from our land . ”
Nassur : “ We want to slaughter ( Nidbah - hom ) them , so they will be expelled from our land , right ? ”
Saraa : “ Yes .
That 's right .
We will expel them from our land using all means . ”
Nassur : “ And if they do n't want [ to go ] peacefully , by words or talking , we ’ll have to [ do it ] by slaughter . ”

Warum ich niemals die Piratenpartei wählen werde ... aber am liebsten doch wählen würde .
Die Piratenpartei hat einen Wahlspot .
Hurra .
Der wurde gevotet , nicht etwa von den Parteischergen ausgewählt , und der wurde auch nicht gemacht , sondern ganz crowdsourcingmässig geschenkt .
Und der geht so :
So ein wenig bieder , aber geht schon .
Wir werden schlimmeres sehen .
Und toll , der Film ist auch noch Creative Commons ( Ja , ich weiss auch , der Link geht auf eine 404 Seite , absichtlich oder nicht , wir können das nur ahnen ) !
Und die Musik von Pogotracks ist herzallerliebster Kinderelektropop .
Ich persönlich bin mir gerade nicht so sicher ob die Samplegesetze in Australien so lasch sind , dass man wirklich Disneys Mary Poppins durchsamplen darf .
So als Kunst .
Wegen mir ist das alle mal OK , und das Orginalvideo ist zumindest noch nicht von YouTube geschmissen worden .
Ok .
Jetzt sagt die “ gemeinte ” CC - Lizenz aber , dass man mit dem Film , und das meint auch die Musik im Film , machen kann worauf man Bock hat , sofern man die Urheber nennt .
Über die Urheber wissen wir erst mal nicht viel mehr als den Myspace User .
Der aber hat ja Disney gesampled .
Zuhauf .
Wer weiß was sonst noch .
Darf er das ?
Hat der von Disney die Lizenz einen Teil von Mary Poppins zum CC - Allgemeingut zu erklären ?
Wir haben keine Ahnung , wir vermuten die Piratenpartei ebensowenig .
Und so sehr ich diesen
Move mag , dieses : “ wir senden mal eben einen Piratenspot dessen Rechte nicht geklärt sind , dessen Attitude aber vorgibt Creative Commons zu sein ” , und so sehr man auf der eigenen Webseite vielleicht noch mit einem amerikanischen ( in Deutschland halbwegs bodenlosen )
Fair Use argumentieren könnte , wenn das im Fernsehen läuft , wird doch wem auffallen , dass das Mary Poppins ist .
Oder etwa nicht ?
Und was dann ?
Hoffen die Kids von der Piratenpartei ernsthaft , dass wo CC draufsteht auch CC drin ist ?
Selbst wenn es so offensichtlicher Unfug ist ?
Oder hoffen die ernsthaft , dass sich da niemand von Disney oder sonst einer Verwertungsgesellschaft melden wird ?
In den öffentlich - rechtlichen Fernsehanstalten ?
Da solle es doch laufen , oder verstehe ich hier etwas an “ Wahlwerbespot ” falsch ?.
Oder ist das einkalkulierter Optimismus zum Scheitern der eigenen Sache , weil , wir haben das doch alle nicht so ernst gemeint ?
Wir wollen doch nur mal ein bischen Aufruhr machen ?
Style - Entscheidung für den Soundtrack gäbe bei mir Pluspunkte , völliges Wirrwarr selbst beim eigenen Werbespot über die tatsächlichen Inhalte der eigenen Partei gibt massiv Minuspunkte .
Unter realmarxistischen Verhältnissen wäre man für so einen Wahlspot gekreuzigt worden .
Manchmal wünscht man sich etwas die Schärfe früher “ linker ” Diskussionen zurück .
Oder gibt es ein merkwürdiges Wahlgesetz das behauptet , freie Wahlen stehen über dem Urheberrecht von dem ich nichts weiss ?
Ok , zugegeben , die anderen Parteien lügen sich sicher auch eins in die Tasche , dass sich die Balken biegen , aber will man genau das von einer neuen jungen Partei ?
Macht es dann nicht schon wieder genau so viel Sinn FDP oder CDU zu wählen , weil man zumindest halbwegs zu Recht annehmen kann , dass die zu den im Wahlspot angesprochenen Themen Gesetze verabschieden werden , die vorm Verfassungsgericht dann letztendlich keinen Bestand haben , weil die überraschenderweise immer noch mehr als gar nichts checken ?

The care home where Lakshmi was allegedly raped
The story of a pregnant teenager has been making the headlines in India .
Lakshmi ( not her real name ) is 19 years old , but her mental age is said to be only around eight .
She became pregnant after allegedly being raped in a government - run care home , and the state authorities petitioned the local courts to allow them to carry out an abortion .
Their contention was that she would n't survive the trauma of childbirth , and that she would n't be able to take care of a baby .
That court ruled that an abortion should go ahead .
But then came the twist - her lawyers and several disability rights groups appealed to the Supreme Court .
It overruled the original judgement - allowing her to have the baby she said she wanted to keep .
' Clothes for the baby ' Today , Lakshmi lives in a different government - run home in Chandigarh .
At first glance , she seems like a shy girl with a lovely smile whose answers are monosyllabic and barely audible .
Lakshmi had told the high court in Chandigarh that she wanted to keep the baby .
When I asked her if this was so , her answer was the same : " Yes . "
So I asked her if she had ever looked after a baby before .
Lakshmi's lawyer , Tanu Bedi , says no one else can decide on her behalf " Yes , " she replied again .
One of the women in the Nari Niketan , the care home where she was allegedly raped , had a baby and Lakshmi said she fed him milk with a spoon and cleaned him up when needed .
Lakshmi was found two years ago wandering the streets of Chandigarh and placed in Nari Niketan .
She was allegedly raped earlier this year and a guard of the care home has been arrested and is awaiting trial .
I asked her nurse if Lakshmi ever talked about what had happened to her .
" At first she was ashamed .
When no one knew about it , she did n't talk about it .
But now everyone knows and she talks non -stop about her baby .
" And when anyone comes to visit her , she asks them to bring new clothes for the baby .
She wants a swing as well . "
However , medical professionals who examined Lakshmi said she could not look after a baby .
Psychologists say she suffers from " mild mental retardation " and has a low IQ .
Moral questions
" After consultations we thought that since she 's mentally challenged , an orphan and has been raped in a government institution ... it would be in her interest to have the termination , " says Prof Raj Bahadur , director of the Government Medical College in Chandigarh and the man in charge of the shelter where Lakshmi lives .
But Lakshmi's lawyer , Tanu Bedi , disagrees .
" Can we say just because she has a low IQ , anybody can decide for her and against her specific wish to have an abortion , which has the medical complications and problems for all times to come for her health ?
In my view it would have been a judicial rape . "
Mr Gupta questions whether the case should be before the courts The Supreme Court agreed with Ms Bedi .
In its ruling , the court said : " Nature will take care of the orphan mother and child . "
There was plenty of outrage at the Supreme Court 's decision .
Many questioned whether the law courts were the place to decide such moral and ethical cases .
Lawyer Anupam Gupta fought the case on behalf of the state government .
He says even the local judge raised the issue when the case came before him .
" On the very first day when the matter came up before the chief justice , he appeared reluctant to interfere .
This is your baby - he was n't referring to the foetus of course - but in a more metaphorical sense .
He said this problem is of your making , do n't come to the high court . "
But , Mr Gupta says , " because Lakshmi had been allegedly raped while in the state 's custody , the authorities had no choice .
They had failed to protect her and so approached the court to make a decision on what to do . "
' Arbitrary ' The National Trust for the Welfare of persons with Autism , Cerebral Palsy , Mental Retardation and Mental Disabilities - a government organisation - has offered to take care of Lakshmi and her baby .
It has offered to put her in an independent home , either in the southern city of Bangalore or closer to Chandigarh .
" There she will be able to blossom and develop her life skills , " says Poonam Natarajan , who heads the trust .
" The IQ score is very arbitrary in our country .
The whole world is only talking about her as eight years old .
But she 's 19 years old , so her life experience is very different .
" Everyone has the capacity of evolve , the capacity to grow if in the right environment .
But somehow in the minds of people when it comes to mental retardation , it 's static .
" That is a medical concept that we have to challenge . "
A decision on when and where Lakshmi will be sent is to be taken soon .
At the shelter , Lakshmi is looking forward to being a mother - her baby is due in December .
" I want a baby girl , " she tells me shyly .
And as I prepare to leave , she says : " Please visit me again . "

the Cyberpunk Apocalypse is a writers ' cooperative work & event space , residency program , and publication based out of Upper Lawrenceville , Pittsburgh PA
For years , the aim of pretty much every technology company has been to make a product that people can't give up using , and in case something better comes along from a rival , make sure that they can't get their stuff – whether it be data , software or hardware – to work easily with the newcomer 's platform .
On this rested the success of the compact cassette v the 8 - track , VHS v Betamax , Iomega 's Zip v other backup systems , and most recently Blu-ray v HD DVD .
Amidst which , Brian Fitzpatrick 's role at Google sounds , at the very least , contrary .
He runs its self - styled ( and half - jokingly named ) " Data Liberation Front " in the Chicago offices , and his aim is to make it easier – one button is the ideal – to export your data from Google 's servers onto a storage format of your choice – whether that 's your own web server , your computer , or the comfort of your backup drive that you keep locked away in a fireproof cupboard after using it every night .
The Data Liberation Front – the name 's a jokey reference to the Judean People 's Front , the would - be terrorist group in Monty Python 's Life of Brian that never quite gets its act together and spends most of its time bickering – is actually a good thing for Google 's customers , Fitzpatrick argues , because it means that lock - in element can't be applied to your data .
" Think of it like you were renting a house , " says Fitzpatrick .
" If you decided to move out and the landlord came and told you that you could n't take your furniture or your clothes or your family photos , you would n't be pleased , would you ? "
His point being that Google wants to give you that comfortable feeling that if you need to export your data then you can .
In the click of time
It 's already been achieved for Blogger , the free blogging platform the company bought .
There is a one - click export ( to the Atom format ) which preserves not only posts but also comments .
( An export to RSS , which is also available , only preserves the blog posts . )
Google Notebook , which has been " end of lifed " ( read : killed off ) , has had export functionality added to it .
Fitzpatrick notes all sorts of Google products that have got export functionality : Google Docs , iGoogle , and various other Google products .
( And , inevitably , you can follow it on Twitter at twitter .com / dataliberation — which might make you ponder how easy it is , by contrast , to get your tweets out of Twitter . )
And next , he says – though dates are n'tgi – there 'll be an " export " button for Google Sites ( in HTML ) , as well as a " mass export " from Google Docs , for those who want to export a lot of data at once .
You can see the clever sales logic .
Many people fret that with cloud computing you can't walk up to any location – still less a specific machine – and say : " My data is in here . "
Such distributed services mean your data might be on five continents at the same time .
Thus people , and companies , get uncomfortable about trusting a cloud service , because they do n't know where it is , and so can't be sure it 's really safe .
For Google to say " we can easily import your data " is n't more of a claim than others are already making .
But if it then says " exporting your data is one - button easy " , it actually has a selling point .
True , it looks perverse to those accustomed to the lock - in mentality of previous commercial battles .
But it may be the right approach for the web .
It 's classically , Google - typically , counter - intuitive .
Fitzpatrick studied Latin and Greek ( " and ceramics " ) at university , then went to work for OnShore , a small networking company based in Chicago .
There he got interested in fixing a problem with an open source database driver , and was then encouraged to submit the change to its authors .
Which led to working on Subversion , a version control system widely used by teams of programmers who need to co-ordinate different versions of programs .
He then went to Apple , where he worked on the consulting team that would go with every sale of its fabulously expensive WebObjects package , and then back to Subversion .
( He wrote the book on it . )
When Google bought the company he was working at , he was reluctant to join : he 'd set down roots in Chicago .
But the company was happy to let him set up an engineering department in the city ( it already had a sales centre ) .
He 's also in charge of Google Affiliate Networks , an acquisition from the takeover of DoubleClick .
He adds : " We believe in an open web for everyone … The web is fundamentally about openness . "
Open and shut case
But there 's also two other ways in which it works to Google 's advantage .
First , it encourages its developers not to fall behind rivals .
If the price of being overtaken is that people will pick up their data and leave your application behind ( which might then mean your job as the application 's developer vanishes ) , you 'll have a stronger incentive to keep going .
But equally , for managers who do n't want to have to support a million wilting blooms , being able to export data means that unsuccessful projects can be shut down without regrets that users will curse the company for locking away their data on its servers forever .
Compare that with the outcry that Yahoo faced when it announced it would close Geocities : efforts to save it sprouted up , and Yahoo was n't popular .
Google is n't popular for closing services – but at least Google Notebook users can get their data out .
So , export for blogs and Google docs is straightforward enough , as everyone is familiar with their formats .
But how will exporting work for a completely novel idea , such as Wave , whose functionality nobody outside Google ( " or inside , " adds Google 's PR woman , who is listening ) has yet managed to describe in fewer than a thousand hand - waving words ( it 's something like " email and instant messaging and collaboration but with changes shown over time " ) ?
How do you export something which has a unique format ?
For a moment , Fitzpatrick looks faintly alarmed .
But that 's not because he has n't considered it – although Wave was developed in Sydney , his Chicago team has already been looking at what it needs to do .
" We have talked about it .
It 's not that difficult to represent [ its data ] .
The question is how to represent time .
Wave has the extra dimension of revisions .
There are ways to represent that but nothing else really has anything that it 's like .
It 's unique . "
What about Wikipedia's " diff " , which shows the differences between revised versions of the same page ?
" That 's perhaps the closest , " Fitzpatrick acknowledges .
The problem then is that a diff is a database representation and there is n't an agreed way to export a database .
( SQL ends up being database - specific , Fitzpatrick says . )
The irony is that if Fitzpatrick succeeds , then Eric Schmidt , Google 's chief executive , will probably be happy .
" He keeps telling us , the way to not be evil is to not lock users in , " Fitzpatrick says .
" He tells us , just get the users and we 'll figure out how to make money . "

Phoenix is showing off a few interesting things at IDF , but the real standout is their new Instant Boot BIOS , a highly optimized UEFI implementation that can start loading an OS in just under a second .
Combined with Windows 7 's optimized startup procedure , that means you 're looking at incredibly short boot times -- we saw a retrofitted Dell Adamo hit the Windows desktop in 20 seconds , while a Lenovo T400s with a fast SSD got there in under 10 .
It 's pretty slick stuff , and it should be out soon -- check a video after the break .
Gyromancer appears to be the work of a nefarious intellect , when the truth is substantially more beautiful : Gyromancer stands as proof of an interested , active , and present divinity , like spontaneous fermentation .

Because those three days were so dense , memories from PAX are still decompressing and being presented to me with the urgency of the present moment .
So vast ( bordering on ridiculous ) was this year ’s Exhibition Room that I was not able to see the entirety of it , particularly events which appeared and were gone , like the Brink demo .
In what must seem a bizarre inversion , I felt confident skipping the Blizzard booth almost entirely , though it included such unerring projectiles as Starcraft 2 , Diablo 3 , and World of Warcraft : Cataclysm .
They ’re the kind of games that require no explicatory link .
For me , enthusiasm is in fixed supply , and represents an investment of self .
That is why I utilized the “ Bet ” nomenclature when collating my list .
I ’ll buy the aforementioned games , and most likely enjoy them , but there ’s really nothing for me to fantasize about .
By comparison , Heavy Rain is the kind of game I would place a few chips on .
It had but a single screen at the event , which strikes me as an injustice , but it ’s not an especially mainstream play .
Things that occur in games tend to be things which veer from the routine , just by definition .
There are games which take mundane lives as their subject , The Sims stands out , but those lives are abstracted to a tremendous extent .
Heavy Rain certainly has high drama , but not since Shenmue have I seen a game so obsessed with manifesting the actual world .
Heavy Rain relies on “ scenes ” as a metaphor for progression instead of an explorable nineteen eighties Japan , sure .
But in their almost romantic devotion to the ordinary , the commonplace , and the real , they are cousins .
The following is a public service announcement .
Releasing your Goddamned reviews for Uncharted 2 more than two weeks before the game ’s retail release goes past mean , vaults over cruel , and keeps running past the sign which indicates you ’ve entered the realm of bastards .

Der Karmapa Lama Trinley
Dorje ist ein hochrangiger Buddhist , der auch von den Regierungen in Tibet , China und Indien anerkannt ist .
Er ist 24 Jahre alt , hört Hip - Hop und spielt auch solche Videospiele , die hierzulande als » Killerspiele « als Sündenbock und Aktionismus - Vehikel mancher Politiker dienen .
Aber Dorje sieht das vollkommen anders .
Diese Spiele seien kein Gegensatz zu seinem Glauben , sondern eher eine Art Therapie , wie Times India meldet .
Jeder habe Emotionen , Buddhist oder nicht , und Videospiele helfen dem Karmapa Lama , seine negativen Gefühle und Gedanken » in der Illusion des Spiels « freizulassen .
Das sei für ihn eine sehr geschickte Methode , nicht doch irgendjemanden auf den Kopf zu schlagen zu müssen .
Mit dieser Aussage stellt der Mönch die » Argumente « deutscher Politiker auf den Kopf , die in Videospielen die Ursache von Gewalt und kein Ventil für Aggressionen sehen , das bedauerlicherweise bei wenigen Betroffenen nicht mehr ausgereicht zu haben scheint .

A conversation with John Bellamy Foster , editor of the US - based socialist magazine Monthly Review , professor of sociology at the University of Oregon and co-author ( with Fred Magdoff ) of The Great Financial Crisis : Causes and Consequences ( Monthly Review Press , 2009 ) .
He was interviewed by Farooque Chowdhury for the Bangladesh daily newspaper New Age .
It was published on September 8 , 2009 .

Farooque Chowdhury :
What is the likely impact of the present financial crisis on geopolitics , especially if the crisis is considered in the context of the energy crisis , including the peak oil issue , the food crisis , the environmental crisis and the declining US dollar ?
Will the world experience war(s ) as an effort to survive ?
Will monopoly - finance capital attempt to create another bubble , as capital is gripped with contradictions within and without ?
John Bellamy Foster : The ``Great Financial Crisis '' and the ``Great Recession '' that followed close upon it has uncovered the depth of the contradictions facing capitalism in this phase , labelled ``monopoly - finance capital ' ' .
Specifically , the overall crisis has revealed that capitalism , at its vital core , is caught in a stagnation - financialisation trap with no visible way out .
The geopolitical implications of course are vast .
Not only is capitalism weakening in many ways at the centre but US hegemony is also compromised .
The US dollar at first strengthened in this crisis , but the long - term implications for the dollar are negative .
On top of the worst world economic downturn since the Great Depression , we are also facing , as you indicate , the worst environmental threat in history ( indeed what might be viewed as the ultimate environmental threat , with the destabilising of the climate ) , the rapid growth of world hunger and the prospect of peak oil .
Inequality in the world ( both between rich and poor countries and within states ) is increasing .
The occupation in Iraq continues , while the United States under the new Barack Obama administration has expanded the war in Afghanistan , further destabilising Pakistan .
Militarisation is growing across the planet .
Washington is acquiring seven additional military bases in Colombia alone — aimed at the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America ( ALBA ) countries .
Behind all of this is an accumulation system that is increasingly geared to finance rather than production .
There is no doubt that the policy priority at the centre at present is to restore the financial status quo ante — that is , to promote financialisation or a new series of financial bubbles .
This , however , is a reflection of the corruption of the entire accumulation process of capital .
We can speak today not only of the financialisation of capitalism , but also the financialisation of imperialism , in the sense that financial control of the periphery is the central economic issue , and the main lever of the centre , backed up in the end by military power .
Samir Amin , in particular , saw this coming , emphasising how the centre continues to control the periphery financially , technologically and militarily , even in the face of some industrial advance in the South .
What apprehensions are there for the periphery of the world system due to the impact of the present crisis of monopoly - finance capital — other than ``receiving '' the brunt of war(s ) , if any ?
Being the brunt of militarism , war and naked imperialism is of course bad enough .
But there is no doubt that the current period of economic meltdown has brought other dangers .
Today ’s deep global crisis represents one of those historical events that serves to clarify developments that have been happening over a much longer period , so that it becomes possible to understand better where we are heading .
Building on analysis constructed by Harry Magdoff and Paul Sweezy in Monthly Review , I observed a dozen years ago :
In general , monopolisation , imperialism , globalisation , and the shift from production to finance are ways in which capital seeks to break out of the circle of stagnation , though this simply ``shifts the contradictions to a broader sphere , and gives them a wider orbit '' ( Marx , Capital , vol . 2 ) ) .
Today the pace of this entire process is being set largely by the global expansion of financial capital .
On a typical day world capital markets move $ 1.3 trillion or more , while the exports of the entire world add up to only $ 3 trillion per year .
This means that in just over two days world capital markets move as much money as international trade accounts in an entire year .
The increasing integration of global financial markets means that if and when the financial bubble bursts it could well encompass the entire world capitalist system — creating new and unprecedented dangers .
Given the ``absurd overvaluations '' that characterise the modern financial system ( in Japan prior to the 1990 stock market crash price - earnings ratios had risen to 100 - 1 ) , MIT economist Lester Thurow argues , ``it is only a question of when the market falls and whether the fall is slow or rapid ' ' .
Moreover , in contrast to national economies , where the state is able to act as the lender of last resort and thus to stave off cascading defaults , the world system as a whole lacks any single entity capable of intervening on the necessary scale in the face of a sudden financial collapse … .
The point here is not to predict such a financial collapse .
Indeed , predictions should be avoided because it is the task of anti-systemic movements to alter the status quo in order to escape from this irrational world order .
The point rather is that the system is inherently irrational and on an expanding scale .
Globalisation in the face of stagnation only gives the crisis ``a wider orbit ' ' . — ( `` The Age of Planetary Crisis ' ' , Review of Radical Political Economics , Fall 1997 ) .
There is no doubt that this general way of looking at things , rooted in a Marxist tradition long associated with Monthly Review , has proven to be correct in its broad outlines .
Despite the strengthening of capitalist relations in a few ``emerging '’ economies , the system as a whole is in finding itself in a deeper and deeper crisis .
I am convinced that we are somewhere in the middle — no longer at the beginning but also far from the end — of a long - term structural crisis of capitalism ; one that threatens the continued existence of the accumulation system itself .
At the same time , of course , we are facing grave threats to the planet as we know it and to human civilisation , the very survival of which is in question if present trends continue .
In this sense the current economic crisis may prove fortuitous in helping humanity to understand the need to abandon the destructive logic of capital .
History teaches us that the main resistance can be expected to come from the bottom rather from the top of the world system .
The negative forces of stagnation and financialisation , emanating from monopoly - finance capital at the centre of the world economy , has a mixed message for the periphery .
In the past the periphery has been made to bear the greater part of the adjustment in a crisis , but today that may not be possible .
Successful resistance is now conceivable in the global South ( as we are seeing today in areas as widely separated as Venezuela and Nepal ) .
Europe , broadly , watched transfixed while Wall Street was melting down .
They talked twice .
Then there was trans -Atlantic meeting of finance ministers in Washington DC producing a very brief and vague statement on ways to face the crisis together .
Was the whole episode of trans -Atlantic discussions and consultations a show of unity meant to disguise an undercurrent of disunity within monopoly - finance capital ?
You are right about the façade of unity .
The European ruling elites did not act in unison — indeed they seemed incapable of doing so — nor did the United States and Europe work together .
Yet , neoliberal globalisation had linked these economies over the years , in a process that hit at the remnants of the Keynesian social - democratic ``compromise '' within the core capitalist countries .
And there was a broad understanding of how to combat the deflationary tendencies that suddenly appeared .
It is hardly surprising , therefore , that they all operated in a kind of indirect collusion ( resembling oligopolistic corporations ) , with the United States as the financial - price leader , so to speak .
The universal response was to bail out the financial system , with the object , it soon became apparent , of getting the financialisation process going again — since there was little hope for capital otherwise .
In this sense , there were common dimensions to this crisis of monopoly - finance capital that took precedence , over and beyond the inter - imperialist rivalries that had been developing — without generating real cooperation among the leading states .
Nevertheless conflicts have emerged within Europe between countries with current account deficits , notably Britain , and countries with current account surpluses , notably Germany .
The former have been accused of being profligate consumers , while the latter have been accused of neo-mercanitilism .
( See the interesting analysis by Joseph Halevi , ``G20 and Inter - capitalist Conflicts ' ' , MRzine , April 7 , 2009 . )
The conflicts dividing capitalist states may become still more apparent in the recovery phase of the cycle , as countries feel greater latitude to chart their different courses , and as the strengthening of the dollar in early the crisis , increasingly gives way to its opposite .
What impact will the financial crisis have on the US body - politic ?
That of course is the big question in the United States .
There is no doubt that the economic crisis is so serious as potentially to threaten the stability of the ruling capitalist regime .
So far there is no evidence of a serious rift at the top .
Capital as a whole seems to be united in this crisis in bailing out the financial system and restoring what Henry Kaufman , one of the leading financial analysts in the United States , has called ``the financial - industrial complex ' ' .
Talk of regulating finance was always rather empty and is receding now that the outward symptoms of the crisis fade .
The US government , which in the present crisis has seen both Republican and Democratic administrations in power , has consistently emphasised salvaging the most powerful banks over all else , with more than $ 12 trillion in cash infusions , loans , guarantees , subsidies , etc. , poured mainly into the financial sector by early 2009 — and more since then .
In this respect , there was absolutely no difference in the response of the Bush and Obama administrations .
Things are more complex when the issue of the underlying population is raised .
There is no doubt that the economic crisis , the rise in unemployment , the lost wages , the cutbacks in state support , have left much of the population in a state of hopelessness and growing rage .
Based on the experiences of the 1930s one might think naturally enough that this would generate a working - class revolt on the left , including growing trade union organisations , strike waves , marches of the unemployed , street demonstrations , etc .
The election of what is seen as a ``centre - left ' ' president might serve to feed such struggles .
There has been a lot of talk on the left of a new ``New Deal ' ' .
But the left is weak organisationally due to a long history of repression that goes back to the McCarthy era , and it is effectively invisible in society , due to the media propaganda system ’s normal sorting process , which hides any genuine dissent .
Hence , the right , with its money , power and media dominance , has been much more effective at visibly channelling the widespread alienation of workers than has the left .
This has been apparent in the right ’s attacks on the healthcare changes promoted by the Obama administration , which is seen as strengthening the hand of an oppressive government .
Liberals are dismayed by this but most socialists are not surprised in the least .
The fact that the government has been bailing out the banks to the tune of trillions and letting them run off with bags of money and exorbitant bonuses while the population has been suffering only served to promote distrust of the state .
Dispatched to the town halls to calm the masses down , Larry Summers , Obama ’s chief economic adviser , defended the corporate bonuses , disdainfully saying ( to a population that was seeing its retirement pensions disappear , along with jobs , healthcare , etc. ) , ``We are a country of law .
There are contracts '' ( quoted by Robert Kuttner , ``Rage the Left Should Use ' ' , Washington Post , August 19 , 2009 ) .
Ironically , given the stranglehold of the two business parties ( in reality two factions of a single party ) on US politics , many in the working class are drawn to the Republican Party and its anti-government stance , since they see the state , not entirely without reason of course , as an oppressor — and it at least gives them something to attack .
Whether this will continue , we do n’t know .
The left as I said is in a weak position , but this is not inevitable or permanent .
If a sense of crisis continues , explosive developments could occur weakening the system of political control .
Socialists need to speak the truth as they see it , rather than forever trying to be social democrats or ``left liberals ' ' , thereby obscuring and undermining their own message .
You and Fred Magdoff discussed in The Great Financial Crisis the US House of Representaives ’ rejection of the bailout plan , when it was originally tabled in October 2008 .
Was the only reason behind that rejection , the one that you observed in your book ( p 112 ) : `` The outburst of grassroots anger and dissent ' ' , i.e. a reflection of pressure from the bottom in the society ?
Or along with that outburst and dissent was there also an inability , in that moment of cascading financial meltdown , of all the fractions of the system to reach a consensus ?
And , is that failure to reach a consensus — if that was the case — a result of the blame game immediately after the voting ( when the bailout plan was initially tabled ) — directed at blaming Nancy Pelosi , the house speaker ?
Was that in itself a manifestation of an erosion in the dominating political culture ; a failure of the system to hold together during the crisis of the dominating capital ?
The ``failure to reach consensus '' should not entirely surprise us of course .
Marx argued that the antagonism of the principal classes in English society constituted ``the framework of English society '' ( New York Tribune , June 7 , 1856 ) .
The same principle applies today , particularly in periods of deep crisis , during which the normal antagonism , often just beneath the surface , comes to the fore .
When we talk of consensus in this context we are speaking of a hegemonic - consensual order designed to integrate the population as a whole into the ruling project , against their own interests .
There is no doubt that in the unexpected and severe financial meltdown that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 , the US ruling class had no thought at first of the exercise of hegemonic power .
Faced with a full - fledged financial panic , there was simply one immediate objective : bailing out financial institutions , and corporate capitalism as a whole .
When the secretary of US Treasury , Henry Paulson , proposed his bailout plan he was doing exactly what was required of him ( and what Obama ’s appointee to the same post , Timothy Geithner , continued with no essential change ) .
But the working population in the United States was outraged by this plan to bail out the banks — at a time when people everywhere were suffering the loss of their jobs and houses .
The Republican congressional representatives ( House Republicans ) saw this as a grand opportunity in the context of an election that was bringing the Democrats to power , and in which they were afraid of losing their seats .
They immediately catered to this grassroots sentiment , attacking the government — always the target of their criticisms — over the bailout plan .
John McCain , who was running for president on the Republican ticket , was partly swept along by this , while Barack Obama , who , unlike McCain , had the support of all the big financial interests , backed the bailout wholeheartedly — if somewhat quietly given the public sentiment — thereby presenting himself as the responsible party .
Within days , naturally , the House Republicans had been brought back into line , and the normal hegemony of capital reasserted .
But in the meantime , these actions had served to highlight to everyone throughout society the widespread outrage amongst the population .
A few left democrats also opposed the bailout , but they were far outnumbered by the Republicans who opposed it .
In retrospect , there is no doubt that the House Republicans , although cynically directing their criticisms at the state , were much more effective in exploiting working - class anger than were the Democrats , who had no such goal and were concerned simply with propping up the system .
The fact that Nancy Pelosi , the Democrat leader of the House , was turned into a major target — at a time when a Republican administration was still in power and the overall political current was favouring the Democrats — was an indication of the general effectiveness of these tactics .
Although the great majority of the population in the United States has been and remains opposed to the massive bailout , the system has moved to take care of its own : that is , the financial interests .
The ruling class as a whole has been able effectively to ignore the masses , who have no economic and no real political power , lacking any organised basis .
Now with the crisis ebbing , the media propaganda system is working overtime to convince the public at large that Paulson , Bernanke , Geithner and company saved the financial system and the economy .
There are news reports of sporadic protests and demonstrations by different sections of the people in the United States .
News agencies reported protests against the bailout plan , against the auction of homes , against layoffs and demanding compensation , against taxes , and in many other areas .
Months ago a group of workers in Chicago occupied a factory , probably unprecedented in recent US history .
President Obama offered token support to these factory - occupying workers , one news report said .
A number of political commentators have expressed opinions that more protests could arise in the United States .
There were protesters in Sacramento holding placards with hard sounding words .
A commentator has declared that the elites are aware of the possibility of civil unrest .
Is there any real likelihood of major resistance while labour is unorganised , while consumers are hard pressed ?
There are certainly a lot of spontaneous protests and demonstrations of all kinds going on in the United States in response to the crisis and the war .
I do n’t think anyone really knows how much protest is occurring because the media makes a point of not covering left protests , as much as possible .
Strikes have taken place , including , as you note , the dramatic occupation of a factory by members of a United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers local union early in the crisis .
But organised labour can hardly be said to be engaging in struggle .
The AFL - CIO seems almost dormant in this crisis .
One is inclined to think that organised labour in the United States today is organised for something else other than struggle .
In the 1930s , the Communist Party backed by other smaller left parties played a big role in getting mass protests going .
There is nothing equivalent in the United States today .
Still , there are plenty of reasons to believe that resistance could grow dramatically in present circumstances .
It is well to remember that although the Great Depression began in October 1929 it was n’t until 1934 that one saw the truly massive strike waves that constituted what has been called `` The Great Revolt from Below '’ , associated with the rise of industrial unionism and the CIO .
( The best short account of these developments is to be found in David Milton ’s book , The Politics of US Labor . )
This happened after unemployment had bottomed out in 1933 and what was to turn out to be a slow economic recovery was beginning .
Today , there has been no bottoming out yet of job losses .
Unemployment is still rising and the economic conditions promise to be extremely difficult for workers in the years ahead .
It may take some time , possibly years , before we see the development of organised revolt from workers .
The New Deal in its more radical phase , it should not be forgotten , was an effect rather than a cause of the revolt from below from 1934 on .
It is the responsibility of the left in this crisis to help open the way to such possibilities , by drawing on the lessons of the past .
Monthly Review Press has just reissued Nancy Rose ’s book , Put to Work , on the federal job programs of the 1930s — the WPA and others — so that those engaged in struggles can learn from the past .
One aspect of the US situation that is not well understood is the level of internal repression marked by a vast growth in the numbers of police and prisons .
This is of course a system of racial and class control , with blacks and Hispanics representing the biggest share of inmates .
This penal state has been growing rapidly during the last 20 years — the whole period of neoliberal policy associated with the growth of monopoly - finance capital .
While India , I believe , has an incarceration rate of around 50 per 100,000 , the United States , with the highest incarceration rate in the world , has one of around 750 per 100,000 .
This a system of social repression that may even expand in the crisis .
( See `` The Penal State in an Age of Crisis ' ' written by Robert W. McChesney , Hannah Holleman , R. Jamil Jonna and myself for the June 2009 Monthly Review ) .
Is going to war one of the tendencies of military Keynesianism ?
Military Keynesianism is the doctrine that military spending can help lift a capitalist economy that is faced with demand shortfalls .
This should not be identified directly with Keynes ’s views themselves , though he did co-author a famous pamphlet called How to Pay for the War .
Rather , the first military Keynesian , even before the publication of Keynes ’ book ( as Michal Kalecki and Joan Robinson both pointed out ) , was Hitler , who managed to restore the German economy to a large extent by rearming it , with of course barbaric consequences .
In the post - World War II US system , expenditures on militarism and imperialism were directed mainly at maintaining and enhancing the US empire .
But this was also seen as having the secondary benefit of promoting economic demand and profits .
In the past half - century or more the United States has devoted vast resources to the military and carried out numerous interventions and regional wars , mostly in Asia .
There is no doubt that this has been an important boost to the economy .
Acknowledged US military spending in 2007 was $ 553 billion .
But Hannah Holleman , Robert W. McChesney and I recently did an empirical study ( `` The US Imperial Triangle and Military Spending ’ ' , Monthly Review , October 2008 ) that determined that the actual amount spent was $ 1 trillion .
This is nearly three times the federal budget stimulus for a single year provided by the Obama administration in order to counteract the current crisis , so the numbers are very significant .
At present the administration is accelerating the war in Afghanistan as part of its larger imperial strategy for controlling the Persian Gulf and Central Asia .
But military Keynesian considerations ( i.e. economic ends ) also enter in at some level to reinforce these imperial objectives .
There is what Kalecki in The Last Phase in the Transformation of Capitalism called the ``imperial triangle '' of ( 1 ) state - financed military production , ( 2 ) a media - propaganda system that supports imperial adventures and ( 3 ) the real / imagined employment - income effects .
This form of ``Pentagon capitalism '' , as it has been called , also feeds into US arms sales , which fuel wars throughout the world .
In 2008 sales of US armaments constituted more than two - thirds of total international arms sales , with the US share amounting to $ 37 billion in all .
This is crucial to the US current account balance .
Is there any geopolitical division within monopoly - finance capital ?
How does such a division , if it exists , manifest itself globally in ``camps '' , alliances , ``surrogate ' ' countries , etc . ?
How does it affect countries in the periphery ?
Are there weak links in the chain of monopoly - finance capital that fastens the globe ?
I think of monopoly - finance capital as a new phase , essentially , of the monopoly stage of capitalism ( which Lenin said was ``the briefest possible definition '' of imperialism ) .
The combined centrifugal and centripetal tendencies of imperialism that come more and more to the fore under monopoly capital are still there , in magnified , increasingly complex , and largely unpredictable forms .
Simply , because there is and can be no overall state of the capitalist system , developments at the global level are always more contingent and problematic .
Wars and inter-imperialist rivalries are part of the system , along with the domination of the periphery by the centre .
In terms of the global political economy , we have witnessed , since the resurfacing of stagnation tendencies in the mid-1970s , the rise of the whole era of neoliberal globalisation , which has been a mechanism for re-establishing the control of the global North over the South , and for shifting the main costs of stagnation from centre to periphery .
But this period has also seen the growth of some ``emerging '' capitalist countries , which have been able to benefit from the global sourcing of resources and commodities — thereby also increasing the profit margins of global corporations .
The shifts in economic power in the period have thrown up the whole question of international hegemony , today exerted by the United States ( which in the 1990s following the fall of the Soviet Union became the sole superpower ) – but increasingly under circumstances that look anything but stable , with the rise of various major , regional powers .
To be sure , no state can yet challenge the United States economically or militarily on a global basis .
Nevertheless , in the United States , this perceived impending threat to its global rule has resulted recently in calls to create the basis for a ``new American century '' , and has led to the growth of naked imperialism , i.e. the increased use of US military power to change the rules of the game in its favour : geopolitically and economically .
There is no doubt that , to use terms introduced by Richard Haass , formerly in the Bush administration and now head of the Council on Foreign Relations , that the United States is the sheriff and that Western Europe and Japan are its posse , or junior partners .
There are outlaw states , from the standpoint of the sheriff , such as Iran , North Korea and Venezuela .
The sheriff is not above carrying out lynchings without the approval of the system of justice ( in this case the United Nations ) , and with or without the direct help of the posse .
Geopolitically , there are of course camps , alliances , and sub-imperial powers .
The United States under Obama , as already mentioned , has recently helped expedite a coup in Honduras that is aimed at the ALBA countries , of which Honduras was a member .
It is leasing / building seven new bases in Colombia , which is its main military platform in South America .
At the same time this is a recognition that certain weak links have appeared — that a socialism of the 21st century is arising challenging both capitalism and US hegemony .
As explained in The Great Financial Crisis , Marx used the shorthand M [ Money ] - M ' for the circuit of money capital , in which money begets money all by itself , as opposed to what he called the ``general formula of capital '' in which a produced commodity intervenes between M - M ' ( p 133 ) .
Is this the dominant form of monopoly - finance capital , whereby ``productive ' ' M is increasingly subordinated to ``exotic '' financial instruments ?
Can it be said that this process signifies : ( 1 ) that this is the way capital , as a whole , degenerates , ( 2 ) that this degeneration is part of the decline and decay of the whole system , and ( 3 ) that we can now hear the sounds of its last nail ?
I would not say that we can hear the sounds of capitalism ’s last nail .
But certainly we are seeing all sorts of signs of global social and economic decay .
Capitalism ’s famous ``creative destruction '' , so celebrated by Schumpeter ( in which he was referring not to our present age but to the entrepreneurial age he saw as disappearing ) has now given way to an enormously distorted and uncontrollable destructive creation : financialisation , environmental destruction , war , etc .
As Keynes once suggested , things are likely to be done badly when production becomes a bubble on a whirlpool of speculation .
The last shreds of rationality of the system are quickly disappearing .
On the one hand , economic stagnation finds its counter in a growing casino economy and military expansion ; on the other hand , this expansion is threatening the environment of the planet .
We are living in a time of financial bubble ( M - M ' ) , but also an environmental bubble , in which the economy is overshooting sustainability by rapidly using up the last remaining ancient sunshine ( fossil fuels ) .
Now the climate is threatened , and world hunger is accelerating with the growth of ``agrofuels '' since the ``free market '' requires that those with money , who desire fuel , will always prevail over those without money who need food .
The sheer scale of irrationality of this system of accumulation has become unspeakable , unfathomable .
Cash was infused in the asset bubble to keep it expanding as that was the only way to keep the bubble ``alive ' ' .
But is there not a limit to such expansion , as we find in the law of elasticity ?
Or to put it more dialectically , can expansion reach its limits so that it bursts out ?
Should the mainstream economics expect expansion forever with cash infusion … expansion without limit ?
It is true that asset bubbles by definition expand until they burst .
There are obviously limits to the growth of debt and speculation , particularly when the real economy is stagnant .
But no one can say for sure what those limits are at any given time , and the situation keeps on changing .
Under monopoly - finance capital the whole system is propped up by the central banks , which are charged with keeping the game going as long as they can , and with protecting the big financial speculators when the bubble bursts .
This is even clearer today with the present financial crisis , where a ``too big too fail '' policy has explicitly been adopted .
Today this has resulted in such large amounts of ``lender of last resort '' debt coming into being in the United States , Japan and the UK that — given simultaneous vast budget deficits — any rise in interest rates for the foreseeable future is out of the question .
Nothing like this has ever happened before , and no exit path from this extraordinary situation is visible .
But a collapse has been avoided , and future problems are for the future to solve .
In the irrational class society in which we live it is ``rational '' for the individual units of capital to proceed as before , in their own interests , with an ``after me the deluge ' ' philosophy .
And the state has no choice but to back this .
Is this rational from the standpoint of society as a whole ?
Of course not .
But forging a socially rational society is not the goal of private capital : rather the object is one of self - aggrandisement .
And as a whole this is still working for the ruling elites .
In this sense , Naomi Klein is right ; a kind of ``disaster capitalism '' is now in place , in which the promotion of growing economic , social and environmental disasters has become the basis of the accumulation of riches for a privileged few .
Class in monopoly - finance capital is discussed in The Great Financial Crisis ( p 85 ) .
Is there any contradiction , especially because of the autonomy of finance , and due to the progressive shift in gravity from production to finance , between financial capital and manufacturing capital — in class or class - fraction terms ?
Similarly , is there any tension / contradiction between the class having financial control and capital directly engaged in exploiting cheap labour by outsourcing , engaged in export processing zones / special economic zones , etc. in the periphery ?
These are good questions and I have to say that I do n’t have entirely satisfactory answers , since a great deal of research needs to be done in this area .
The term monopoly - finance capital is meant to refer to a hybrid system of monopoly capital ( that is the economy of the giant corporations ) and an increasing reliance on financial expansion with the attendant increase in financial control .
So far it has not appeared to be a case of a conflict between financial and industrial capital ( or between ruling class fractions in that sense ) .
Rather the dominant tendency , judging by the United States , seems to be the growth of the financial - industrial complex .
Even what we consider industrial corporations now have their own financial subsidiaries and are increasingly directed at growth through asset speculation rather than production .
I would n’t say that financial and industrial capital has melded together entirely , but there also does not appear to be a sharp contradiction between the two sectors in this period .
This is because the expansion of speculation ( the casino economy ) has become the major stimulus , such as it is , to the real economy , which otherwise would sink deeper into stagnation ; so objectively all of capital has an interest in keeping the financialisation process going .
At the same time there is a stagnation - financialisation trap that embraces the whole system .
A number of things can be said with a fair degree of certainty about the power dimensions of all of this .
First , a growing portion of those at the very top of the society in the United States in the last couple of decades have owed their wealth primarily to finance , real estate and insurance ( FIRE ) and relatively fewer to other areas such as manufacturing , technology , natural resources , transportation , etc .
Second , financial concentration is occurring very rapidly , and in ways that may alter the entire structure of the political economy .
Thus , while the top five financial institutions in the United States owned 10 per cent of all financial assets in 1990 , today they own 50 per cent of all financial assets .
In two decades or so the United States has seen its financial sector radically transformed , so that the major banks are far more powerful vis-à - vis other economic interests than was true 20 years ago .
The long - term impact of this is yet to be seen .
The same kind of development has been occurring on global level .
And much of this is not even taking into account the ``shadow banking '' , i.e. financial interests that transcend the traditional banking structure .
Neoliberalism reflects this shift toward finance and the need for constant cash infusions to keep a given bubble going , so the result is a system that is more rapacious than ever before — or , as Marx frequently said , more Vampire - like in the sense that it sucks the lifeblood from its victims day by day .
At the global level Samir Amin wrote in his Capitalism in the Age of Globalisation of the ``five monopolies '' that are now key to the dominance of centre over periphery , despite industrialisation of important parts of the latter : ( 1 ) technology , ( 2 ) financial control of worldwide financial markets , ( 3 ) monopolistic access to the planet ’s natural resources , ( 4 ) media and communications monopolies and ( 5 ) monopolies over weapons of mass destruction .
I think that this is a good way of understanding the imperial power of monopoly - finance capital .
The most important and volatile of these today are ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) , i.e. world financial markets and nuclear weapons , both of which point to possible catastrophic meltdowns / firestorms .
The issue of global outsourcing that you raise is enormously important .
The logic behind this development is of course clear .
Due to unequal exchange globally — which Amin somewhere defines as a situation where the difference between wages is greater than the difference between productivities — global corporations are able to super - exploit low - wage workers in poor countries , selling the goods at prices that are meanwhile determined in the centre of the world economy , thereby generating enormous profit margins .
( This has also propelled the growth of big box stores like Wal - Mart , which through more effective global sourcing is able to sell goods at relatively lower prices , driving smaller competitors out of business , while still enjoying widening profit margins . )
The effects of global sourcing on the restructuring of imperialism — disarticulating economies in both the global South and the global North — are enormous , and are beyond what can be addressed here .
Still , to answer your question , I do n’t think the internal conflict over outsourcing between sectors of capital is very significant in the United States , because the dominant monopoly ( or monopoly - finance ) capital is for all practical purposes identical with multinational capital , which is simply monopoly capital abroad .
Can it be assumed that monopoly - finance capital will find itself in a difficult situation as the capacity and authority of the state as the lender of last resort gradually gets eroded , and due to contradictions that arise in the body politic ?
It is possible .
But we have to understand that this is not a stable system in the first place , so it is already in a difficult situation , and is taking the whole world down a difficult path .
When the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy occurred and there were fears that the whole system would meltdown , one fairly rational first response , even for some on the left , seemed to be to bail out the banks and salvage the financial system no matter what it cost .
No one really wanted a depression .
And that of course is what the system did with the support of almost the entire bourgeoisie , apart from a few gold bugs .
In this respect , the response of the majority of the population , which was against bailing out the banks , was looked at as representing total anarchy and disaster , possibly leading to another second Great Depression .
But the truth is that the solution adopted puts off the problem at best , reinforcing long - term stagnation tendencies , and leading to the certainty of far worse crises in the future .
The lender of last resort function of the government has become both the saviour of the system in the short run and , quite possibly , its nemesis in the long run .
The problem of servicing ( or retiring ) the immense debt created in the last year would seem sooner or later to require sharp commodity inflation and / or a sharp rise in the rate of exploitation through cutbacks in social services , hikes in consumption taxes , etc. Such ``solutions '' are destabilising .
Already workers are suffering : jobs are vanishing , pension agreements are being abandoned by corporations , workers are losing their houses , wages are declining , hunger is expanding , education is being privatised and downsized , etc .
The United States has ended up with both the bailout of the banks and a devastating crisis the effects of which will linger .
What is really important , from a social standpoint is the welfare of the population as a whole .
While the financial institutions have been bailed out , the people are suffering worse than ever , with very little done to ease their pain .
In fact , the whole direction of social policy is to increase exploitation .
It is well to remember that the vast majority of working people are the body politic .
The rest are usurpers , from a social and democratic standpoint .
What is the significance of the theory / formulation of monopoly - finance capital : its genesis , its character and its crisis , in the centre and periphery ?
This is what we have been talking about more or less all along , so I can be brief .
The genesis and character of monopoly finance capital are treated in a forthcoming article entitled ``Monopoly - Finance Capital and the Paradox of Accumulation ' ' , which I have written with Robert W. McChesney for the October 2009 Monthly Review .
What we have not addressed sufficiently at this point is the relation of all of this to the global system as a whole .
I think what we need today is not so much a theory of the ``new imperialism '' as some have called it , but a theory of the changed economic context of imperialism , rooted in the stagnation - financialisation trap endemic to monopoly - finance capital .
We also need a better understanding of how this relates to the struggle over hegemony in the world economy and to geopolitics ( the most dangerous realm of state action since it relates to the strategic control of territory and resources through war or the threat of war ) .
Under monopoly - finance capital the growing industrialisation of parts of the periphery has done less to change the relations of power within the world system as a whole than is sometimes supposed .
This is because the rules of the game have been changing , with global corporations and financial institutions of growing importance .
At the same time we are seeing a new age of revolution , in Latin America in particular .
Nevertheless , it is important to note that the most significant historical change of the last quarter - century has had relatively little to do with changing relations of power within the system , but has arisen from the changing ``external '' relations to the Earth .
The age - old choice of ``socialism or barbarism ? '' — raised by Rosa Luxemburg — is giving way today to an even more momentous choice of ``socialism or exterminism ? '’ as the prospect annihilation of the Earth , as we know it , lies before us under business as usual .
In this sense , the call for a new socialism for the 21st century , now emanating from the Third World and aimed at overcoming the depredations of capitalism , represents humanity ’s best and perhaps only chance .
SILVIO FIORITO is the proud owner of a Subaru WRX and , like any engineer , he is happy when his hard work speeds up his car from 45 seconds to 5 seconds .
A good engineer can always improve on what comes from the manufacturer .
He ’s not talking about the car itself , but the PC he installed to link the navigation , music system and video playback systems .
You can go get a cup of coffee while your desktop starts , but a car is different .
“ If my girlfriend gets into my car , she should n’t notice , ” said Mr. Fiorito , 29 .
“ If they do n’t even realize that I have a car computer in my car , it means it ’s working properly . ”
So he tore apart his version of Windows , tweaked the start - up routine and ripped out every unnecessary part .
“ You do n’t need a printer in your car computer , ” he explained and paused a second , perhaps imagining what he might do with a printer in the back seat , and then added a qualification to the next sentence :
“ If you do n’t have a network , you do n’t need the Windows fire wall . ”
Engineers like Mr. Fiorito , of Reston , Va. , are just some of the car lovers who want an able computer in their vehicle to complement the turbocharged engine and the fat brake pads .
They ’re also wiring these computers into the stereo , the cellphone , the backup cameras , the Onboard Diagnostics Port ( OBD - II ) , the navigation system and almost any electrical part .
Then they tinker with the PC to make it easy to control everything with a few taps on a button or a touch screen .
Captain Lou Albano , who became one of the most recognized professional wrestlers of the 1980s after appearing in Cyndi Lauper ’s “ Girls Just Want to Have Fun ” music video , died Wednesday .
He was 76 .
Albano , whose real name was Louis Vincent Albano , died of natural causes in Westchester County in suburban New York , said Dawn Marie , founder of Wrestlers Rescue , an organization that helps raise money for the healthcare of retired wrestlers .
World Wrestling Entertainment called him one of the company ’s “ most popular and charismatic legends . ”
With his trademark Hawaiian shirts , wiry goatee and rubber bands hung like piercings from his cheek , Albano was an outsize personality who , in a career spanning nearly five decades , was known as much for his showmanship as for his ring talent .
His fame skyrocketed when he appeared in Lauper ’s 1983 music video , playing a scruffy , overbearing father in a white tank top who gets shoved against a wall by the singer .
Partly because of the success of Albano ’s partnership with Lauper , the entity then known as the World Wrestling Federation forged ties with the music industry .
That helped bring it to a wider national audience in the mid-1980s , known as the “ Rock ‘ n ’ Wrestling ” era .
It was a time when wrestlers such as Albano , Hulk Hogan , “ Rowdy ” Roddy Piper and Andre the Giant were so popular that they could headline TV cartoon series and appear in movies .
Albano later had a role in the music video for Lauper ’s 1984 song “ Time After Time , ” and he appeared in episodes of the TV series “ Miami Vice ” and in the 1986 movie “ Body Slam . ”
He played Mario in “ The Super Mario Bros. Super Show , ” a live - action animated show , from 1989 to 1991 .
Albano was born July 29 , 1933 , in Rome .
After moving to the United States , his family settled in Mount Vernon , N.Y .
His career in the ring began in 1953 in Canada .
He retired from the WWE in 1996 .
Survivors include his wife , Geri ; four children ; and 14 grandchildren .

The government 's top financial regulator last night backed radical plans for a multibillion - pound tax on banks as a way to tackle the City 's persistent bonus culture .
Lord Turner , chairman of the Financial Services Authority , warned bankers that he would support a new wave of taxes on the City to prevent excessive profiteering if they continue to take excessive risks .
In a searing critique of the industry , Lord Turner described much of the City 's activities as " socially useless " and questioned whether it has grown too large .
His comments , in an interview published by current affairs magazine Prospect , mark a shift in the debate on bonuses , which Turner characterised as a symptom rather than a cause of the financial crisis .
The FSA chairman , who has faced criticism for " going soft " on bankers ' pay and would see his empire abolished by an incoming Tory government , said a tax on the millions of transactions in the Square Mile would cut banks ' profits and reduce the pool of money available for bonuses .
The idea was recently put forward by anti-poverty campaigners who have argued that a small levy applied to each transaction would mean billions of pounds could be redirected to support developing nations .
Turner said he sympathised with applying a tax that would be " a nice sensible revenue source for funding global public goods " .
In a discussion of the issues facing the embattled FSA , Lord Turner said that after a decade of excess " beyond a socially reasonable size " the City had become " swollen " .
In a statement that reversed a decade of policy at the regulator , he also said it was no longer one of his primary aims to promote the status of London as a global financial centre .
" The really fundamental question is whether the overall level of financial services pay is a consequence of the swollen financial sector which has resulted from oversimplistic financial deregulation .
This is not a question that any of the politicians have focused on but I think it's an important and legitimate issue of public concern , " he said .
The FSA has already put forward plans forcing banks to set aside more cash as an insurance policy to cover their risky activities .
However , the regulator 's critics argue that it has watered down proposals to tackle excessive pay .
Turner , who believes the immediate issues over pay should be tackled by the government , said he was concerned about curbing excessive pay over the longer term and was aware his current plans may be too weak .
He rejected plans by the Conservatives for an anti-competitive investigation of the banks , which he said would miss the target of tackling global financial transactions .
He has also rejected splitting the retail banks from their riskier investment activities , which is favoured by the Liberal Democrats .
He told Prospect : " If you want to stop excessive pay in a swollen financial sector you have to reduce the size of that sector or apply special taxes to its pre-remuneration profit .
Higher capital requirements against trading activities will be our most powerful tool to eliminate excessive activity and profits .
" And if increased capital requirements are insufficient I am happy to consider taxes on financial transactions – Tobin taxes . "
A tax on financial transactions was first suggested by the American economist James Tobin in the early 1970s , but the lack of interest in Washington and London meant it never gained traction .
Turner won the support of some Labour backbenchers , who said his willingness to consider taxes was a step in the right direction .
The former welfare minister Frank Field said the lack of action by the authorities was " in stark contrast to the damage done by the people paid massive bonuses " .
He said : " It looks like Adair Turner has fired the starting gun on thinking more seriously about the City and what it is for and what kind of pay people should expect .
" When the City has largely made money by moving money around and not by making anything , it is clear the pay is out of kilter . "
Turner said that direct action on bankers ' pay in the short term was the job of the government and could be tackled by ministers who had either taken controlling stakes in banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group , or guarantees and insurance policies that cover Barclays and several other firms .
The Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott said he agreed with Turner 's analysis that the City had grown too big , but his remedies were flawed .
" A Tobin tax is interesting but is unworkable without international agreement , which could take years and probably will never happen , " said Oakeshott .
Finance industry figures agreed that a Tobin tax would be complicated to implement and unlikely to be agreed by countries keen to protect rival financial centres .
The Association of British Insurers said current plans to impose higher capital requirements on banks and insurers were sufficient to persuade them to avoid risky behaviour .
EDMOND — A person has been arrested in connection with the death of Dwight Morgan , a homeless man known by the community of as Bicycle Bob .
Travis Monroe Jim , 20 , also homeless , is in the Oklahoma County jail on a murder complaint .
Jim was arrested Sunday night after police found Morgan 's body about 3:05 p.m. , said Glynda Chu , Edmond Police Department spokeswoman .
A cause of death and a motive were not available this morning .
Jim and Morgan , 54 , knew each other , Chu said .
People in Edmond did not know Morgan 's real name .
Most called him Bicycle Bob because he was seen riding his bicycle throughout the city .
“ Everyone loved him and would help him out , ” Chu said .
“ We lost part of Edmond 's history . ”

Kalter Krieg Atom - Minen sollten Deutschland verwüsten
Im Kalten Krieg wollten die Briten offenbar um jeden Preis eine Besetzung Deutschlands durch die Sowjets verhindern .
Nukleare Landminen , berichtet ein Historiker auf Basis von jetzt freigegebenen Geheimdokumenten , sollten im Kriegsfall ganze Landstriche verseuchen .
Among the problems with our country ’s system of meat production is the routine use of antibiotics in livestock .
Dosing the animals regularly helps them grow faster and survive cramped factory - farm conditions , which means cheap , abundant meat for consumers .
The problem is that overusing antibiotics contributes to antibiotic resistance .
Cheap meat does n’t seem like such a bargain when more and more people are dying from antibiotic - resistant infections .
Representative Louise Slaughter ( D - NY ) has introduced the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2009 ( HR 1549 ) , which would ban animal uses of seven classes of antibiotics important to human health , and restrict the uses of other antibiotics in animals .
The New York Times ’ Gardiner Harris reports that opposition from the farm lobby makes this bill unlikely to pass on its own , but that the measure could be included in health reform legislation .
In a hearing about the bill , Dr. Joshua Sharfstein , Principal Deputy Commissioner at FDA voiced the Obama administration ’s support for curbs on the use of antibiotics in livestock :
FDA supports the idea of H.R. 1549 to phase out growth promotion / feed efficiency uses of antimicrobials in animals .
The current statutory process of withdrawing a new animal drug approval is very burdensome on the agency .
FDA recommends that any proposed legislation facilitate the timely removal of nonjudicious uses of antimicrobial drugs in food - producing animals .
At the same time , FDA believes that legislation should permit the judicious use of antimicrobials in animals for prevention and control …
Antimicrobial resistance is an important public health issue that can only be addressed by collaborative efforts of the relevant Federal agencies , state health departments , and the private sector .
FDA looks forward to working with Congress on this important public health issue .
Maryn McKenna at Suberbug has more on the hearing , including an observation that the Pew Commission on Human Health and Industrial Farming does n’t think Scharfstein ’s position goes far enough .
Still , it ’s great to have a member of the administration acknowledging this important public health issue and expressing a willingness to take steps toward a solution .
Getting people out of cars and onto bicycles , a much more sustainable form of transportation , has long vexed environmentally conscious city planners .
Although bike lanes painted on streets and automobile - free “ greenways ” have increased ridership over the past few years , the share of people relying on bikes for transportation is still less than 2 percent , based on various studies .
An emerging body of research suggests that a superior strategy to increase pedal pushing could be had by asking the perennial question :
What do women want ?
In the U.S. , men ’s cycling trips surpass women ’s by at least 2:1 .
This ratio stands in marked contrast to cycling in European countries , where urban biking is a way of life and draws about as many women as men — sometimes more .
In the Netherlands , where 27 percent of all trips are made by bike , 55 percent of all riders are women .
In Germany 12 percent of all trips are on bikes , 49 percent of which are made by women .
“ If you want to know if an urban environment supports cycling , you can forget about all the detailed ‘ bikeability indexes ’ — just measure the proportion of cyclists who are female , ” says Jan Garrard , a senior lecturer at Deakin University in Melbourne , Australia , and author of several studies on biking and gender differences .
Women are considered an “ indicator species ” for bike - friendly cities for several reasons .
First , studies across disciplines as disparate as criminology and child ­rearing have shown that women are more averse to risk than men .
In the cycling arena , that risk aversion translates into increased demand for safe bike infrastructure as a prerequisite for riding .
Women also do most of the child care and household shopping , which means these bike routes need to be organized around practical urban destinations to make a difference .
“ Despite our hope that gender roles do n’t exist , they still do , ” says Jennifer Dill , a transportation and planning researcher at Portland State University .
Addressing women ’s concerns about safety and utility “ will go a long way ” toward increasing the number of people on two wheels , Dill explains .
So far few cities have taken on the challenge .
In the U.S. , most cycling facilities consist of on - street bike lanes , which require riding in vehicle - clogged traffic , notes John Pucher , a professor of urban planning at Rutgers University and longtime bike scholar .
And when cities do install traffic - protected off - street bike paths , they are almost always along rivers and parks rather than along routes leading “ to the supermarket , the school , the day care center , ” Pucher says .
Although researchers have long examined the bike infrastructure in Europe , they have only just started to do so for the U.S.
In a study conducted last year , Dill examined the effect of different types of bike facilities on cycling .
The project , which used GPS positioning to record individual cycling trips in Portland , compared the shortest route with the path cyclists actually took to their destination .
Women were less likely than men to try on - street bike lanes and more likely to go out of their way to use “ bike boulevards , ” quiet residential streets with special traffic - calming features for bicycles .
“ Women diverted from the shortest routes more often , ” Dill says .
Other data support those findings .
In New York City , men are three times as likely to be cyclists as women .
Yet a bicycle count found that an off - street bike path in Central Park had 44 percent female riders .
“ Within the same city you find huge deviations in terms of gender , ” Pucher remarks .
Good infrastructure alone wo n’t improve women ’s cycling rates , researchers caution .
In an automobile - dominated culture , “ attitudinal variables ” also play a role , says Susan Handy , a professor of environmental science at the University of California , Davis .
In a survey to be published in Transportation Research Record , Handy found that “ comfort ” and “ needing a car ” were important factors influencing women ’s cycling rates — but not men’s .
Needing a car is likely tied to the household errands women often perform , Handy says , and could be addressed in part by outreach programs showing that women can “ jump on a bike the way they jump in a car . ”
A few municipalities are beginning to implement a “ second wave ” of strategies aimed at broadening the cycling demographic .
In Portland , a city already renowned for its urban cycling , a Women on Bikes program targets such concerns as fixing a flat tire .
The city is also building its first cycle track — a European - style bike lane that is separated from cars and pedestrians .
Across the country state and federally funded Safe Routes to Schools programs are creating practical bike routes for kids so they do n’t have to be driven by their parents .
Ahead of the curve may be New York City , where about five miles of traffic - protected bike lanes have recently been installed .
Credit goes to the new Department of Transportation commissioner Janette Sadik - Khan , who is upending the department ’s long - standing focus on trucks and automobiles .
Remarks Pucher : “ A woman cyclist became head of the DOT , and wonderful things started happening . ”

This article was originally printed with the title , " Shifting Gears . "
As the story was told to me , the realization that my eyes were “ different ” was n’t discovered until I ’d been home from the hospital for a couple weeks .
You know how it is - newborns sleep a lot , and eye contact is a bit limited when you ’ve got a little one that is only awake a small portion of the day .
Then of course the majority of those waking hours are usually spent with the eyes scrunched up in a squawk .
But after settling down a bit , the day came when my mother and I finally got a good look at one another .
And as I understand it , the first time I looked my mom straight in the eye - she had a bit of a panic attack .
Because when she looked down at her youngest baby daughter , I looked back with eyes that did n’t look like hers - but looked more like our pet cat ’s .
The pupils of my eyes are not round , they ’re more of a keyhole shape , or an upside - down teardrop .
The condition is called coloboma , and is a congenital defect of the eye .
Essentially , coloboma is a gap in part of the structure of the eye .
The gap can be large or small , but normally appears in the bottom part of the eye .
It is caused when a fetus ’s eyes do not develop properly during pregnancy .
Coloboma forms while the baby grows in the womb .
The eyes normally develop between the fourth and twelfth week of pregnancy , and start off as little buds .
Usually the eye folds in on itself as it develops , which leaves a small gap called the foetal cleft .
The foetal cleft helps maintain the blood supply to the developing parts of the eye .
In the final stage of eye development during pregnancy , the cleft seals up from the back of the eye forwards and all the structures of the eye are formed .
In an eye with coloboma , this gap does not fully close and remains in some of the structures of the eye .
The condition occurs in about 1 in 10,000 births .
Coloboma can affect one eye ( unilateral ) or both eyes ( bilateral ) , and can affect a number of different parts of the eye .
It can affect the iris which is the colored part at the front of the eye .
It can affect the lens , the part of the eye which helps focus light onto the retina .
Coloboma can also affect the choroid which is a thin network of blood vessels which help to keep the retina healthy .
Finally , it can affect the retina at the back of the eye .
Very rarely coloboma can also affect the optic disc or the eyelid .
Coloboma with a more defined " keyhole " shapeIn my particular case I have bilateral coloboma , but only the irises are affected .
Since the eyes form from the back to the front - that means that the rest of my eyes formed normally and my condition is more cosmetic than anything .
My sight is fine , but I do suffer from increased light sensitivity because my pupils are larger than average .
The iris , which usually limits the amount of light entering the eye by controlling the size of the pupil , does not work properly as a result of having coloboma and does not dilate normally in bright light .
Sunglasses are my friend , and are so essential to my comfort on sunny days that they are almost like a security feature for me – similar to Linus and his blanket .
I am fortunate that the impact to my vision is mild .
There are some individuals that have coloboma that are not as fortunate .
The effect coloboma has on vision depends a lot on which part of the eye is affected and how big the gap is .
Normally the gap is at the bottom of the eye ( where a 6 is on the face of a clock ) and runs from the front to the back of the eye .
Coloboma affects only the front of the eye if most of the cleft has sealed up .
It can affect the eye from the front to the center and back if more of the cleft has failed to close .
The further back the coloboma goes into the eye , the more visual problems it can cause - especially if the retina is involved .
If this has happened then central vision may be affected , and the individual may be legally blind due to the inability of the eye to focus properly .
In some cases , coloboma affects not only the eye , but the structure of the eyelid as well .
The existence of coloboma may also be an indicator of other hidden issues – other organs or structures that did not form properly before birth .
A child born with coloboma is checked for symptoms of certain syndromes known to include coloboma , such as CHARGE , a rare condition that stands for : C – colobomaH – heart defectsA – atresia of the choanae ( problems with the nose passages ) R – retarded growth and developmentsG – genital hypoplasia ( undescended testicles ) E – ear abnormalities What causes coloboma ?
Most cases appear without any previous family history .
In some families coloboma can be inherited .
If a child is diagnosed with coloboma it is advisable for the child 's parents to have an eye examination .
This is because coloboma can be present without causing any visual problems ; therefore a parent might have the condition but not know it .
In my case , there was a distant genetic link .
I had a great ( great - great ? ) uncle that had coloboma in one eye .
However , I have an older brother and sister , and neither of them have it .
I also have three children , and none of them were born with it either ( although when they were born I made sure that as soon as the fingers and toes were counted , that their eyes were the very next thing the doctors checked ) .
They all theoretically have the gene though , so it may pop up again in some future generation .
In some cases , coloboma can also be caused by accident , injury , or surgery .
The resulting gap in the eye from one of these external causes would have similar impacts to a person ’s eyesight , dependent upon the severity and depth of the gap .
There is no “ cure ” for coloboma .
There is no surgical way to close the gap in order to complete the formation of the eye after the fact .
For individuals like me that have coloboma of the iris , we compensate with sunglasses and shade hats .
For those that have more severe cases involving deeper layers of the eye , unfortunately not much can be done with corrective lenses or surgery to mitigate the impact .
I recognize my fortune in having a very mild case of this condition .
The impact to my eyesight and daily life is minimal , and it ’s served as a conversation starter at stores and BBQ ’s more than anything else .
I am not self - conscious of my eyes , and honestly usually forget that they look different until someone else notices them and makes a comment .
I am instantly aware of the people that tend to make eye contact when they speak however - because those are the ones that will suddenly stop mid-sentence , crane their necks a little closer , and say , “ Hey , your eyes look like cat - eyes ! ”
Or , “ Uh , are you wearing contacts ? ” I have never had anyone be rude though , mostly just curious .
And just about everyone is interested in learning more about my eyes , and why they look the way they do .
Yep - that 's meAs a kid I never quite understood all the fuss .
The subject would sometimes come up during get - togethers at our house , and suddenly I would get trotted out so that those that had heard about my eyes but never seen them could get a look .
I was my sister ’s show - and - tell item more than once .
And there were occasional days in grade school where I heard a “ cat-eyes ” reference whispered as I went by – but even at that age most kids were curious instead of mean about it .
The very worst part of having coloboma was while growing up in Colorado , walking to school on sunny mornings after a fresh snow .
The sunlight reflecting off the snow on the ground was more than I could handle .
My eyes would squeeze shut until they were mere slits , yet they would continue to water so much under the strain that tears would roll down my face without end .
At this age , my mom would buy me sunglasses – but they would always be lost within an hour .
So most times I had no protection , and the only way I could make my way to school was by walking behind my sister and focusing on her shadow on the ground ; her shadow was the only respite in an otherwise unending field of bright white light .
I would trudge behind her , head down , following that shadow until we would reach the protection and relative darkness of our school building .
I would experience such tension during the walk to school on such days , that more often than not I suffered from a headache the rest of the morning .
Even today , my “ dream city ” is Seattle .
My favorite days are overcast and cool , since I am neither a fan of sunshine nor heat .
My sun-loving husband however disagrees , and instead keeps me comfortably outfitted with sunglasses instead of going house - hunting in Washington state .
He and I did visit Seattle once though , and while we were there we had lunch on top of the Space Needle .
Our friendly waitress came over to take our order , and when I looked up at her you ’ll never guess what I saw – a pair of eyes just like mine looking back at me !
We stopped , looked at each other , and both broke out in a huge smile .
For both of us this was the first time we stumbled across someone that shared our rare trait .
It was refreshing for once to be the person surprised by an unexpected pair of “ cat-eyes . ”
And the fact that my eye - twin chose to live in Seattle – a coincidence ?
I think not .
Both the most recent draft of the agreement and the climate bill passed by the House in late June in the United States include plans for rich countries and companies to pay the poor to preserve their forests .
The payment strategies may include direct payments to landowners to keep forests standing , as well as indirect subsidies , like higher prices for beef and soy that are produced without resorting to clear - cutting .
Deforestation creates carbon emissions through fires and machinery that are used to fell trees , and it also destroys the plant life that helps absorb carbon dioxide emissions from cars and factories around the globe .
But getting the cash incentives right is a complex and uncharted business .
In much of the developing world , including here , deforestation has been tied to economic progress .
Pedro Alves Guimarães , 73 , a weathered man sitting at the edge of the region ’s River of the Dead , came to Mato Grosso in 1964 in search of free land , pushing into the jungle until he found a site and built a hut as a base for raising cattle .
While he regrets the loss of the forest , he has welcomed amenities like the school built a few years ago that his grandchildren attend , or the electricity put in last year that allowed him to buy his first freezer .
Also , environmental groups caution that , designed poorly , programs to pay for forest preservation could merely serve as a cash cow for the very people who are destroying them .
For example , one proposed version of the new United Nations plan would allow plantations of trees , like palms grown for palm oil , to count as forest , even though tree plantations do not have nearly the carbon absorption potential of genuine forest and are far less diverse in plant and animal life .
“ There is the capacity to get a very perverse outcome , ” said Sean Cadman , a spokesman for the Wilderness Society of Australia .
Global as well as local economic forces are driving deforestation  Brazil and Indonesia lead the world in the extent of their rain forests lost each year .
The forests are felled to help feed the world ’s growing population and meet its growing appetite for meat .
Much of Brazil ’s soy is bought by American - based companies like Cargill or Archer Daniels Midland and used to feed cows as far away as Europe and China .
In Indonesia , rain forests are felled to plant palms for the palm oil , which is a component of biofuels .
" It could have potentially been that as well as splashing them , they ran them over , and then we would have had six or seven people dead at the roadside " , he added .
“ We have welcomed the management moves to improve shareholder returns , and think these initiatives have much further to run , ” said Mark Burgess of L&G .
“ We also note the valuations of other recent food transactions .
As such , we therefore believe this approach materially undervalues Cadbury and support the management in rejecting it . ”
L&G has a 5.4 pc stake in Cadbury .
In a recent column for the Charleston City Paper , I explained how my moniker , the “  Southern Avenger , ”  came from my advocating for states ”  rights and even secession in my early 20s , a brand of politics I still subscribe to today .
Long comfortable with such concepts , it ’s easy to forget that plenty of folks are not , and was reminded promptly by a number of readers that very notion of Americans no longer living under the same government is still considered “ crazy ”  by many .
Here are a few of those comments :
“ Just great !
What we need is to divide our country into a Balkanized mish - mash of impotent little “ countries . ” 
This is crazy talk , meant only to incite as far as I can see . ” 
Another wrote : “ So , are we asking for the idea of 50 individual countries ?
Talk about a screwed up idea . ” 
A kind critic wrote : “  Jack — I ’m a big fan … but the secession idea these days is on par with colonizing the moon .
It just does n’t make sense . ” 
And a less kind critic wrote : “  You need to broaden your exposure to world ideas .
This column shows how narrow your focus is .
You have n’t grown much from your early years .
You thought you knew it all then and still do . ” 
While I ” m always more fascinated by the amount of stuff I don” t know , than I am the narrow worldview that exists between my two ears , I am quite certain of two things : big government doesn ” t work ” and yet it is always considered sound , sane and respectable to advocate for it .
And the opposite is also true — to advocate for smaller government is acceptable so long as you ” re talking about voting Republican or lowering taxes , but the moment you try to actually seek limiting Washington , DC ’s jurisdiction ; it ’s time for a straightjacket .

Can we take a look at Schakowsky 's day planner from 2000 - 2002 ?
Did she go to any funerals ?
If so , whose ?
Just curious , might be a place to look for some kind of corroboration .
Whether the townhouse was hers or someone else 's really is n't important - in fact , would n't it have been easier to bug a townhouse that did n't belong to Schakowsky , one that belonged to ... oh , I do n't know ... the Turkish Lobby ??
You know , I have had a lot of respect for Schakowsky as a liberal force in the House .
I 'd continue to have respect if she just came out and told the truth ( that is , if the truth is other than Kincaid is claiming ) .
Politics is a shit game , and unfortunately a relatively good one got covered in some .
BTW , where is the planet Xenon ?

Sibel had alluded to , well before this article was out .
She claimed that she'd heard this rumor through other sources previously .

Well , Schakowsky 's reponse is certainly predictable .
But is n't it nice to at least get ANY kind of public acknowledgment from ANYone involved ?
Would like to see same from Hastert , Grossman , et al .
Let the smearing begin !
Also , check out the WaPo story this morning on Obama 's loosening of the state secrets privilege : http://www.washingtonpos...204295.html?hpid=topnews
Predictably , again , not a single mention of Sibel , and not even in the reader 's comments ( that is , until I posted one ... but who the heck is gonna see that ? ) .

At TWN , a long time poster I have always suspected of being a hasbarist is trying to shove this story into the realm of the " birthers " and " truthers " , much like Kincaid is attempting .
I sincerely hope that care is taken , while trying to get this story into the public eye , to avoid attaching it to other issues that may aid those such as Kincaid in shoving it into the fringe world of the tinfoil hat crowd .

>> the realm of the " birthers " and " truthers " do n't get me started .
truthers and birthers are diametric opposites .
ok too late , you got me started .
" truthers " are concerned with factual scientific evidence on top of a mountain of circumstantial evidence in a matter where 3000 innocents died and an economically crippling GWOT was launched .
" birthers " are concerned with the relatively trivial matter as to where the President was born .
nobody died , no economies were ruined and in fact if Ahnold were in the running , the birthers would be the first pushing an amendment to allow non-native citizens to become President .
Conflating the two groups sure has worked well , huh ?

" I cannot address the reliability of the information being provided by the congresswoman and would not even want to attempt to do so . "
How does that work ?
Certainly they will use this to deny all of the allegations .
And it will work too - inside the MSM .
Which is where it matters , unfortunately .
So I think you should seriously reconsider investigating - very thoroughly - the congresswoman 's claims for accuracy and whether they have any bearing on Edmond 's findings .

Great work , Brad .
The Schakowski piece is only a small part of this , but since she has responded , we should let it be known to her : Edmonds was very careful in what she said about you , even if she got some of the satellite facts wrong .
Edmonds made it clear she did not know if you had ever done anything illegal or even been approached as a subject of blackmail .
You have now repaid that care with vitriol , name calling and a blanket denial .
Your choice , so now you deserve whatever political consequences come if you are blowing smoke .
Rep. Schakowski , we wish you understood that every decent person will defend you and your right to fuck whoever you want , man , woman or other adult human , even if you 're married , provided [ i ] you yourself [ / i ] do n't treat it as a point of vulnerability .
If you feel the need to cover it up for political reasons , we 're even ok with THAT under certain circumstances .
But when you , by your own carelessness , expose yourself to blackmail and choose to try to defend your secrecy at the expense of constituent service , this is when we leave your side .
Under these circumstances , your progressive standing rapidly diminishes in importance .
You becomes just another politician who puts her personal gain ahead of public service , which is a shame .
As it stands , you are way off base in your characterization of Edmonds , and apparently you do n't care if you do damage to Edmonds ' credibility on other matters .
Parts of this story have been out for YEARS , and not a single part of it has ever been shown to be false .
It was apparently good enough for publication in places like Vanity Fair and the mainstream UK press .
Your response looks bad , characterized by direct avoidance of the most salient aspects of the story .
Not what one would expect from a truly innocent person .

Here 's the giveaway for me that Schakowski is full of shit : Edmonds is merely repeating WHAT SHE SAYS SHE WAS EXPOSED TO in the course of her employment at FBI .
Why is n't Schakowski expressing curiosity about the source material ?
How on earth could Schakowski ( legally ! ) be in a position to know this is all made up , and that Edmonds is making it up ?

... Ernest A. Canning said on 9/23/2009 @ 8:20 am PT ...
It is interesting that the only public response comes from a member of Congress whom Edmonds has not accused of espionage or other illegal forms of corruption .
Throughout her deposition , Edmonds declined to name Schakowsky because Edmonds said she did not know whether the Turkish lobby scheme to blackmail Schakowsky for the lesbian tryst succeeded .
Edmonds told Giraldi that Schakowsky was " added to the list " in 2000 .
Her response to Schakowsky 's denial reflects that Edmonds relied entirely on an FBI intercepts that covered the period 1996 to 2002 .
The intercept said the Turkish female operative was to accompany Schakowsky to the funeral of " the mother . "
Schakowsky says " her mother " died in 1987 .
There is no reason to question the accuracy of Schakowsky 's statement as to when her mother died .
But this also does not necessarily call into question Sibel 's candor .
What it does call into question is the accuracy of Sibel 's interpretation of the words , " the mother , " in the FBI intercept or perhaps the accuracy of the intercept itself .
Do FBI intercepts contain the verbatim words of the intercepted conversations or a summation by an FBI employee of the gist of conversations ?
If the later , then there 's always the risk of error by the FBI employee preparing the summation , especially if that summary pertains to a conversation in a foreign language .
( There are many instances in which a word in another language does not literally translate into English ) .
Finally , while the lesbian tryst makes for the most salacious allegation , we should not lose sight of the far more serious questions involving not just corruption at the highest levels of government but espionage and treason .
Those questions are the real " story " which the entire media should be covering and which the Department of Justice should be investigating .

I would n't agree .
It 's very difficult for public figures to sue for libel , because they are then opened up to ALL sorts of stuff via discovery .
It 's also a very high bar to prove that a ) the defendant was lying and b ) defendant knew he / she was lying , but printed it anyway ( malice ) .

If the later , then there 's always the risk of error by the FBI employee preparing the summation , especially if that summary pertains to a conversation in a foreign language .
( There are many instances in which a word in another language does not literally translate into English ) .
Interesting that you should mention that point .
Edmonds ' original allegations against her co-worker ( Melek Can Dickerson ) in the Turkish translation division --- who was apparently a member of one of the orgs being targeted by the FBI --- included the charge that she had been mistranslating and / or mis-summarizing documents to that end .
From my understanding of the translation / language specialist divisions , the work of the translator on foreign - language wiretaps is * incredibly * important , as the field agents , who often do n't speak the language , rely on the translators to tell them what is important and what is n't , amongst a mountain of wiretap tapes .
In the case of Edmonds ' tapes , stretching from 1996 to 2002 in all , she had been tasked , as I recall , to go back through those years of tapes which had already been reviewed , in some measure , to make sure they had been properly reviewed .
Apparently there were fears that they had n't , or that important information had been missed .
She has told me ( going from memory here , without checking old old notes ) that Dickerson had been changing / re-writing summaries .
Noting that some tapes were not important , after they had previously been found to be important , etc .
So , yes , the translators and their summaries and translations are a VERY important key in the counterintelligence division 's investigations .

What possible reason would Edmonds have to fabricate stories about powerful people , thereby making herself a target of ridicule - and worse ?
If she were manufacturing , why not come out with subsequent accusations , about othere figures , in the public realm .
Has she continued to make statements about others beyond the time frame indicated in her depostion ?
I do n't think so .
Hey , why not have Sibel sue Schakowsky for being called a liar ?

Schakowsky smeared Sibel with false allegations that she believes ' 9/11 conspiracy theories ' ; this is not true ; Sibel has testified to incidents she witnessed pointing to foreknowledge , obstruction and cover up by certain people , but has not promoted any ' theories ' .
Schakowsky did not specifically deny the allegation of an affair , instead claiming the info about the townhouse and ' mother ' is incorrect , which are trivial matters .
I could n't care less if she cheated or is bisexual ; i want to know if she was blackmailed , and what she did if she complied with demands .
Schakowsky * may * not have done anything - what 's going on with the members of Congress and DOS / DOD officials named in Sibel 's under oath deposition - Sibel has alleged acts amounting to treason in some cases ; involvement in espionage , blackmail , bribery , money laundering and trafficking in drugs , arms and nuclear secrets .
These allegations have been public since since Aug 25 - and now in a cover story for Am Con .
These people need to be pressed for answers .

If the Congresswoman and / or Ms. Edmonds decide to take a polygraph test , it should only be what polygraph examiners refer to as a " single - issue exam " , the most accurate of which is the Utah Zone of Comparison Test .
Any other kind of polygraph test will lack sufficient accuracy .

Kudos to bradblog ( 1st I 'd ever heard of it ) in helping to publicize Sibel 's very important revelations .
I tried to get CommonDreams.org to pick - up the amcons cover story and have used its comment spaces to spread the word .
I also posted a link to it at Juan Cole 's Informed Comment , which he allowed into his comments section , as well as at theoildrum.com , where a few posted replys to it , but not in the volume it ought to generate IF people were to click the link and read .
Saying that Edmonds's is a part of the " right wing smear machine " fails entirely as most of those named by her are Republicans , which is why BushCo gagged her in the first place .
The problem is basic as most folks in our culture would respond to such allegations with knee jerk lie(s ) of some sort .
For me , those named Republicans are the primary criminals named by Edmonds , but there 's nothing said by Schakowsky 's mouthpiece about them or the high crimes that are alleged .
It seems to me that Kincaid 's attempt to paint Edmonds as non-credible is an effort to " front - run " for the accused Republicans .
IOW , since there is NO mention of Schakowsky being connected in any way with 9/11 by Edmonds , then WHY is she accused of being a " truther " and " consipacy - theory " member ?
This informs me that Schakowsky DOES have something to hide , but not related to what Edmonds 's revealed .

Ms. Schakowsky is a victim of the Turkish government , not a crook .
She should be treated by us all in that vein .
She will never answer the questions about the Turkish agent , except under compulsion and oath .
She will merely parrot the Turkish lobby attack that Sibel is nuts , or make some other non-specific remark .
I am guessing that her husband is the key to all of this .

It seems to me that the fact that the bush administration had Edmonds gagged under the State Secrets Privilege indicates that there is validity to her claims .
Also , I recall reading a UK article ( year or more ago ) about FBI agents corroborating Sibel 's allegations .
And Schakowsky 's response to Edmonds is reminiscent of the bush admins methods of marginalizing anyone that questioned or disagreed with them in any way -- they 're crazy conspiracy theorists , birthers , unAmerican , etc .
Schakowsky 's very defensive response makes it seem as though she 's hiding something , particularly since Sibel has n't accused her of doing anything illegal .

The minions of the Congresswoman are warm - air - blowing artists .
Lets review :
The bottom line is that Ms Edmonds has no credibility because she is apparently willing to make things up and pretend that they are true .
* " Has no credibility " because of the say - so of some minion ?
How does he support that claim ?
* Edmonds " is willing to make things up and pretend they are true " ?
Is that not rather a reversal of the facts , namely that the congresswoman and her minions are denying facts and pretending they are not true ?
We have presented the facts and she changed her story as a result .
Having followed the story , it appears to me that things are the other way around , namely that Edmonds presented facts and they dissembled and presented a lot of hot air and angry shrieking .
" As with all fairytales , Ms. Edmonds ' fantasy about Congresswoman Schakowsky was easily dismantled by introducing irrefutable facts .
Which " irrefutable facts " were introduced ?
The say - so of the minion ?
Since when are taped intercepts " fairy tales " ?
It is clear from reading her response that Ms. Edmonds has decided to change her story rather than admitting her charade had been revealed .
When did she " change her story " ?
Which " charade " is he talking about ?
The claims about Congresswoman Schakowsky do not have a leg to stand on and have been shown to be the stuff of science - fiction and absurd conspiracy theory ; absent of any factual basis .
Period . "
So the FBI deals with " science fiction " and " absurd conspiracy theories " ?
Why would they put the FBI out of business in that way ?
And , BTW , Xenon is a chemical element , not a planet , afaik .
The net ( material ) result of this whole affair will probably be some lezzy - pr0n filmed in low quality , featuring a granny doing lesbo things with a turkish hottie .

Reddit The Extension and Removal of Ogden Avenue by Serhii Chrucky Ogden Avenue is an arterial highway in Chicago , running southwest from the near west side .
The street was closed to traffic between North Avenue to Armitage Avenue in 1967 .
Another block was closed in 1983 , south from North Avenue to Blackhawk Street .
Finally by 1993 , the viaduct carrying it over Goose Island was demolished , effectively cutting the route back to Chicago Avenue .
The street did not need to be closed , but was done so as a result of poor planning and deferred maintenance .
The map at left from 1938 shows the Ogden extension north of Chicago Avenue at its greatest length .
The 2008 map at right indicates the location of the former right of way , and also shows the large number of streets that were removed in the vicinity of Ogden and Clybourn .
“ No pocket street is a great street ” Ogden Avenue was originally called Southwest Plank Road .
Built in 1848 , it was ten miles long and ended in Riverside .
The name was changed in 1877 - 78 following the death of Chicago ’s first mayor , William B. Ogden .
Plans to extend Ogden beyond Union Park , and improve the rest of the thoroughfare , were floated around at least forty years before it finally happened in 1922 .
As early as 1880 , the issue of extension from Union Park to Lincoln Park was a platform for aldermanic campaigns .
However , improvements were not seriously considered until 1900 .
It was not until the Plan of Chicago , authored in 1909 , which advocated such improvements , did the project gain momentum .
It was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission in 1916 , and the City Council in 1919 .
The initial route planned for the extension was slightly different than the one eventually adopted .
Originally , it ran just south of the later route , terminating instead at the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and Wells Street .
The city council voted against the improvement in 1902 because they found it to be too costly .
At some point , a cost - saving zigzagging route was proposed , which would have involved condemning less property , but was eventually dropped in favor of the original plan .
The final terminus was the intersection of Armitage and Clark , about three blocks north of Lincoln and Wells .

Right : Birds eye view looking south from North Branch Street .
Birds eye view looking south from North Branch Street .
There were many reasons in favor of extending the road , and few against it , beside the early cost concerns .
The cost of the initial improvement was approximately $ 5 million .
The viaduct over Goose Island , which was begun in 1932 , cost another $ 8 million .
There was good reason for the city to invest this much money to improve Ogden .
The land along the proposed route , especially Goose Island , was euphemized by Charles Wacker as “ stagnant , ” but conditions were likely appalling .
Goose Island had always been an underdeveloped area criss - crossed by grade level rail lines .
Consisting primarily of industrial land , there were workers ’ cottages on it as well , but economic conditions in the area were poor .
Goose Island also had a reputation for its foul smell and repulsiveness .
One writer referred to it as “ the home of all abominations . ”
In the early period of the Ogden extension plan , there was talk of converting Goose Island into a park .
This never came to fruition as city planners had a better idea for the island .
It was thought that extending Ogden through Goose Island would stimulate industrial development in the area , which it eventually did .
Also , it should be noted that the only access point from Goose Island to Ogden was a ramp at Hickory street .

Such a large civic improvement was almost sure to increase property values in the area , and in turn provide the city with increased tax revenue and more power to attain larger bonds in the future .
It is uncertain that the city ever saw such a great financial return from extending Ogden , as some important planning issues were overlooked and the street never developed to its full potential .
A rendering of the viaduct section from 1933 .
The facilitation of retail development along the street should have been a top priority for the city after the street had been extended .
An important reason for extension and improvement was that a new , large commercial artery was going to be created .
Commercial development did occur to some extent , especially south of Chicago Avenue .
Most of the businesses that developed on Ogden were auto - related services .
Similar development occurred on other major diagonal streets , such as the motels on north Lincoln and south Archer , as well as establishments like hot dog stands , service stations , drive - thru ’s , etc .
What differentiated Ogden from streets like Lincoln was the absence of other types of commercial development .
For example , a supermarket was never built on the Ogden extension .
Restaurants and shops were few and far between .
An issue that could have been easily avoided with more careful planning , is that the extension disrupted the grid pattern .
Other diagonals , including the original section of Ogden , were Indian trails before they were streets .
The street grid grew naturally around them , where the Ogden extension slashed through it .
This created a number of problems .
In terms of retail development , the slashing through the grid caused oddly shaped plots and residences backing on to Ogden at angles .
An modern day example is the Matchbox Bar , located at Chicago and Ogden .
The building is a tiny sliver , barely enough to hold one of the smallest bars in the city .
The available property was stunted , suited only to small , inconsequential development in addition to being aesthetically unattractive .

There were more reasons to extend Ogden .
It was hoped that by giving west side residents better access to Lake Michigan , it would improve their quality of life .
Others included easing traffic in the central city , much like Interstate 294 does for the metro area today , improving connectivity , and providing a direct route from the lake to points west .
It was not only the extension that was improved .
In fact , the entire street was improved and transformed into a modern highway connecting the city to suburbs such as Riverside , Naperville , Plainfield , and Joliet .
A few years after Ogden ’s initial improvement , it was incorporated into the nascent U.S. highway system .
Ogden , from Harlem Avenue , to the intersection of Jackson and Paulina streets , carried U.S. route 66 , one of the most famous pre-interstate highways , through Chicago .
U.S. route 34 , which paralleled 66 to some degree , was also assigned to Ogden .
Both of these have since been decommissioned through Chicago , and few U.S. highway routes traverse the City today .
This is due to the rise of the interstate freeways , which would prove to be a factor in Ogden ’s demise .
“ … a community liability … ” Following the great depression , the housing stock in Lincoln Park , like many neighborhoods , began to slip into decline .
Some reasons for this decline included the conversion of larger buildings to rooming houses , which in turn caused overcrowding .
Deferred maintenance , and the use of inferior building materials were some other problems .
The first community organization , of seven that would eventually form in the area , was the Old Town Triangle Association ( OTTA ) , organized in 1948 .
Its formation marks the official beginning of urban renewal in Lincoln Park .

Ogden is the larger street to the left in the image .
This photo was found in a city - published pamphlet , and probably was taken in the late 50’s or early 60’s .
The purpose of these organizations was to combat something called “ blight ” , a catch - all for everything residents found undesirable .
It is a vague term for general deterioration , thrown around in the urban renewal literature of the day .
“ Urban renewal ” itself is a phrase that is ambiguous , and has gained a negative , almost ironic connotation over time .
Its meaning differs from city to city and neighborhood to neighborhood .
Urban renewal in Lincoln Park consisted of selecting outmoded or code- violating buildings for demolition , eliminating mixed uses , creating more open space , and closing off and / or eliminating streets .
The Lincoln Park Conservation Association ( LPCA ) was formed in 1954 in order to oversee organizations like OTTA and others that followed .
Their main goal was to improve the quality of residential structures and livability in Lincoln Park .
In the Lincoln Park General Neighborhood Renewal Plan ( GNRP ) , the LPCA goes into detail regarding elements that needed to be added or eliminated .
The first part of the plan , Project One , calls for the removal of Ogden Avenue north of North Avenue .
It was a flawed plan .
The ultimate goal in improving and emphasizing residential structures was the retention of residents .
In many other areas of the city residents were moving out to suburbs , in turn causing further physical and psychological deterioration of neighborhoods .
All measures taken by the LPCA were done in order to avoid the same thing happening in Lincoln Park .
Key policies of the GNRP included the separation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic , and separation of residential , commercial , and industrial zones .
One correspondence advocated the elimination of “ harmful mixed uses . ”
Other policies included the removal of outmoded structures , building more open space and parks , and widening preferred ( major ) streets .

In the 1975 film Cooley High , Preach takes Brenda on a stroll along the Ogden Avenue viaduct .
If you ’ve seen the film , you ’ll know that the viaduct seems to have an affect on Brenda ’s sex drive .
Or perhaps it was something else ?
Here the young lovers are shown on one of the bridges near a parapet .
The prominent use of the Municipal Device ( Y ) was a notable feature of the viaduct ’s decorative aesthetic , it is visible here on the bas -relief sculpture as well as the railing .
At right is a detail of the railing photographed by Ron Schramm in 1992 .
William Friedlander , then executive director of the LPCA , was quoted as stating : “ Ogden Avenue is a wide street carrying very light traffic .
It cuts up the area and is a waste of land ” .
There is no simpler way to explain the party line and popular sentiment at the time regarding Ogden Avenue .
With a 108 foot wide right of way , Ogden was by far the widest street in the area , the one most suited to carrying heavy traffic .
It had very little traffic , for which the GNRP offers five reasons .
In Project One , it is argued that traffic volume on Ogden was far below designed capacity , and that only a small percentage of traffic in Lincoln Park was oriented towards distant points west .
Because of this , the street could be vacated and traffic could easily be diverted on to other large streets , especially those to be widened .
Let us address the five numbered arguments individually .
1 ) Lincoln Park has too many retail areas for a community so close to the Loop .
How many retail areas are too many ?
Virtually every neighborhood in Chicago has a retail strip , some large , some small .
The idea of actually turning away potential business development occurred in no other area aside from Lincoln Park .
It makes sense only if the residents are trying to create something akin to a suburban subdivision , which it seems was the goal .
2 ) Michigan Avenue brought loop retail shopping and business offices even closer to the Lincoln Park area .
The Michigan Avenue shopping district is , at very least , a mile south of Lincoln Park .
Like the State Street shopping district , Michigan Avenue differed in character from Lincoln Park , as did the nature of businesses in these areas .
3 ) The electrification of the surface lines made access to the Loop easier .
Street railways had been operating in Chicago since the 1860s .
They made access everywhere easier , and their electrification is irrelevant .
Also , nothing is closer or more convenient than walking to work or to shop .
If the desire of the LPCA was to generate more pedestrian traffic , local businesses would have to be accessible to local residents by foot .
4 ) The use along the streets ( sic ) frontage were not carefully planned .
This argument is best of the lot .
As was stated earlier , when Ogden was extended , it was cut through the grid with little thought , and no planning .
Very few buildings fronted onto Ogden ; mostly it was a mess of pavement , shorn buildings , and garages .
The street was never developed to its full potential .
However , this argument is a reason to invest in and improve the street , rather than remove it .
5 ) The expected traffic never materialized ; possibly because the area already possessed too many main traffic arteries .
The expected traffic never materialized for more reasons than one , especially this one .
It has less to do with the existence of an abundance of other streets as it does to the way Ogden linked to other high - capacity roads .
The terminus of the street at Armitage and Clark is a perfect example .
When Lake Shore Drive was extended in 1933 , north from Fullerton Avenue as a limited - access highway , Ogden was not linked to it .
Lake Shore Drive has exits at North Avenue and Fullerton Avenue , one mile apart .
Armitage / Clark / Ogden is half way between the two aforementioned exits .
Fullerton , though it is a “ mile street ” , was a two lane residential road .
In fact it was kept this way between Clark and Lincoln as part of the GNRP , as it remains to this day .
Between Lake Shore Drive and Clark Street , Fullerton is slightly less narrow , and is often congested .
If an exit from Lake Shore Drive had been built at Ogden instead of one or both of the North and Fullerton exits , traffic could have been funneled to the higher - capacity Ogden .
A similar preference by the city for narrow , traffic - clogged mile streets over the wider Ogden will resurface in a 1990 study .
The southwest corner of Ogden and Evergreen street , the north entrance to the viaduct , is shown in a scene from the 1964 film , Goldstein .
Another reason for Ogden ’s under-use was the increased use of limited access expressways and freeways , but only because Ogden was poorly connected to these routes .
Of the three major expressways / freeways that Ogden intersected or came near , Lake Shore Drive , the Eisenhower Expressway , and the Kennedy Expressway , only one northbound ramp onto the Kennedy connected Ogden with the system .
With only one connection , it is easy to see why the street was under used .
For example , Goose Island is very close to the Kennedy Expressway .
Division Street is the shortest link between Goose Island and the Kennedy , and Division has on - ramps and off - ramps going in both directions .
It is the obvious choice for northbound and southbound truck traffic to and from Goose Island .
If Ogden had full on and off - ramps from the Kennedy , it would make sense that most southbound trucks from the Island would have used Ogden rather than Division .
That is just one example , not to mention the complete lack of on and off - ramps to the Eisenhower .
The Ogden improvement predated modern Lake Shore Drive by one year , and the Eisenhower by twenty - six .
Why the connections were never made is an interesting question .
The use of Ogden as a carrier of long range traffic southwest of the city diminished with the opening of two expressways , the Stevenson and the East - West toll - way , pushing Ogden further towards obsolescence .
In Lincoln Park , there were claims that the street was something of an eyesore , as it was a massive swath of concrete with no trees or greenery . .
It was also felt that it separated the community , however , not everyone in the community was in favor of closing the street .
The most active opposition came from the Lincoln Park Chamber of Commerce .
The LPCA ’s plan made little provision for displaced merchants , planning only for a small shopping area at the corner of Larrabee and North Avenue .
The closing of Ogden also necessitated the widening of North Avenue to accommodate increased traffic .
North Avenue was a dense commercial district , and its widening would displace even more business owners in addition to those on Ogden .
It was also proposed to close a portion of Lincoln Avenue and give it the same treatment as Ogden .
The LPCC took action and commissioned the architectural firm of Holabird and Root to provide an alternate design plan that would retain Ogden and Lincoln while improving them .
An alternate plan
The two different design plans for Ogden offer two very opposite courses of action .
LPCA ’s plan , designed by the firm of Sasaki , Dawson , DeMay , and associates , called for the street to be closed in favor of a landscaped pedestrian right of way .
New parks and open spaces as well as commercial space were provided .
The Chamber of Commerce ’s plan , designed by the firm of Holabird and Root , makes provision for the street to be retained and beautified while allowing for new residential and commercial zoning .
The design objective of the Sasaki plan was to create meeting places for people which physically reunite the community .
The report claims that Ogden was a divisive liability to the neighborhood .
By removing it and placing a pedestrian mall with parks and open space , it was hoped that this would have a similar effect for the community as stitches would for a bad cut .
A number of recreational facilities and other amenities were to be provided , such as ; “ conversation plazas ” , parking areas , play lots , passive space , bicycle and bridle paths , tennis courts , space for an outdoor art fair or museum , and shopper - oriented recreational areas .
It was also hoped that small businesses like coffee shops , small theatres , and distinctive shops would open .
The latter refers to an area near the Clark / Armitage intersection that would come to be known as the Ogden Mall .
City of Chicago Ogden Mall in the mid-seventies .
The Ogden Mall was one of two areas provided for in the LPCA plan to be used for retail space .
Shops in this area were to be two floors .
The small business owner would live on the second floor and operate the business at ground level .
There was another retail area planned at Larrabee and North , but like many aspects of this plan , never materialized after the street was removed .
As ambitious as the plan was in terms of providing community services , it mostly provided opportunity for developers to build town homes .
The Ogden Mall is the only true open space and commercial area constructed on the former right of way .
The rest of the right of way currently consists of ( mostly ) town homes , two churches , an oddly shaped concrete park , another concrete path with benches fronting town homes , and a parking lot .
A fenced in space of open grass was left in front of St. Michael ’s church .
Click to view before and after maps from the Holabird plan .
The Holabird plan recognizes all of Ogden ’s flaws more accurately than the Sasaki plan , as well as recognizing that it had assets .
The objective of the plan was to retain the street and improve it .
This would have involved creating a traffic circle at the Armitage / Clark intersection while extending Ogden to Stockton drive .
Stockton parallels Lake Shore Drive and leads traffic to entrances .
This would have greatly improved the usefulness of Ogden .
The plan also calls for all of the intersections with Ogden by Lincoln Park ’s residential streets to be reconfigured .
Smaller streets would have been cut off , as in the Sasaki plan , while traffic would be allocated to Ogden via collector streets such as Sedgwick and Orleans .
Ogden would have been landscaped on the side walks and with a planted median , addressing the widespread criticism that it was a concrete eyesore .
Also , the Holabird plan recognized that “ … access … will become more important with the trend of shoppers to use automobiles ” .
This statement would become prophetic when Lincoln Park would later see a surge in population density and commercial activity .
The Sasaki plan addresses traffic in a more unrealistic fashion .
It was stated that “ increased pedestrian flow is expected on North avenue ” .
In order to remove Ogden , North avenue would have to be widened to handle extra traffic .
In addition , North avenue as well as LaSalle street were identified by the GNRP as two of the major preferential traffic arteries ( principal arterials ) through Lincoln Park and Old Town .
To widen North avenue to fit this purpose , the commercial facilities on its north side were removed .
They were not replaced .
If one of the goals for removing Ogden is to separate pedestrian traffic from vehicular traffic , why does the Sasaki plan state that more pedestrian traffic is expected on another main vehicular artery ?
Sasaki plan .
Artist ’s rendering of the planned commercial area at Larrabee and North .
It was never built .
Perhaps this pedestrian traffic was to come from the former Ogden right of way , and filter out through the gateway of the planned commercial area at Larrabee and North .
But again , that commercial area was never built .
Even so , it is incongruous with the rest of the plan and makes little sense .
The Ogden Courts town homes instead were built where the commercial area was planned .
These homes are designed in a manner not to front on the North / Larrabee intersection , rather they appear as if they are turning their backs to it .
It must also be noted that the former Ogden right - of - way is not contiguous or walkable .
It leads one to believe the Sasaki plan was intended for public relations purposes , if anything .
After all , it was only executed superficially and left Lincoln Park and Old Town disconnected from the west side .
“ It now takes twice as long to get to the southwest side … ” Ogden was removed north of North avenue in 1967 .
Severing the connection between Lake Shore Drive and the interstate system , the massive viaduct was left to carry sparse traffic through an area few wanted to traverse .
In 1958 , fifteen public housing buildings of seven , ten , and nineteen stories were constructed at Division and Sedgwick streets .
Another eight buildings were added to the complex , fifteen and sixteen stories tall , in 1962 .
The 1962 addition was situated east of Ogden on the north side of Division , extending east toward previous public housing efforts .
These high rises , known as Cabrini - Green , were comprised largely of poor African - Americans and early on were plagued by crime , drug , and high - vacancy problems .
The hopelessness and poverty that came to be associated with this area were a far cry from the ideal that Lincoln Park community leaders were trying to achieve .
As writer Greg Beaubien puts it , the removal of Ogden “ created a barrier at North Avenue between elite wealth in the Triangle District and crushing poverty around Cabrini - Green . ” Lincoln Park and Old Town had been successfully isolated by the removal of Ogden Avenue .
The Near West side would follow .

The proximity of the Green extension high - rises can be seen clearly .
In 1983 , Ogden avenue was closed between Clybourn and and North avenues .
A baseball field , for the Metro - North Career High School was built over the street .
In 1989 the city began a study to evaluate a number of things about the viaduct section of Ogden and surrounding streets .
The main goal of the survey , which was completed in 1992 , was to determine whether or not to remove the viaduct or rehabilitate and restore it .
Five different considerations were made in the survey .
1 ) Data was collected regarding the trip purpose and destination of vehicles using the viaduct .
This was done by collecting license plate numbers and mailing surveys to those drivers .
The drivers were also asked what alternate route they would take if the viaduct were to be removed .
In addition to the driver survey , traffic counts were done during peak travel hours .
2 ) Using the driver survey data , the authors of the study determined what impact the re-distribution of traffic would have on the remaining streets if the viaduct were to be removed .
The direction and density of traffic were both considered .

Cost estimates of both alternatives were compared .
The streets that were included in the study are ; Halsted , Division , Milwaukee , Clybourn , Elston , Larrabee , Chicago , and North .
Each street is classified according to its traffic count and status within the Strategic Regional Arterial System .
Streets are grouped into one of four different classifications .
A principal arterial street is federally funded and carries a minimum of 15,000 vehicles daily .
These streets are intended to supplement freeway systems and carry regional traffic for trips 10 miles or longer .
North and Halsted are the principal arterials in this study .
Minor arterials are also federally funded , and carry around 15,000 vehicles daily , more or less .
Rather than serve long term trips , minor arterials are designed to augment the principal arterial streets .
Chicago and Ashland are minor arterials .
The remainder of the streets listed earlier are classified as collector streets .
Their function is to provide land access and distribute traffic from arterials to the lowest classification , local streets .
Collector streets may be federally funded .
Ogden Avenue , because of its low traffic count , around 8,000 daily at the time of this study , was classified as a collector street .
In comparison , the busiest street in the study , North Avenue , carried 32,000 vehicles daily .
Ron Schramm
Two very different varieties of public art .
Actually , the bridge houses and bas - relief sculptures are covered not with graffiti , but tags .
Few would argue the artistic merit of this form of tagging .
Surveys were conducted during peak A.M. and P.M. hours in October 1989 , and again in 1990 .
The two hours when the study was conducted were 7 - 8 A.M .
and 4 - 5 P.M.
The viaduct carried 890 vehicles in the A.M. hour and 870 in the P.M. Hour .
Ninety percent of the vehicles using the viaduct were automobiles , only 5 % were trucks .
Eighty five to ninety percent of drivers surveyed lived in Chicago and were traveling to a destination within Chicago .
The purpose of trips over the viaduct during rush hours was mostly ( 85 % ) for work - related activities .
One third of the work related travel was bound for the Medical Center area .
The study falls very short in considering existing and future land use .
It focuses solely on Goose Island as a planned industrial district , 30 % of which was vacant at the time .
The study assumes that this land will be occupied with similar density industrial use in the future , and generate another 2,000 trips daily .
Of the three major streets traversing Goose Island , the study predicted Halsted and Division would pick up another 2,000 trips each by 2010 , while Ogden , with the viaduct , would only pick up 1,000 .
This seems difficult to believe , as Ogden was twice as wide as both of those streets , far better suited to carry industrial traffic .
This is only a minor issue , as those predictions were not made solely about Goose Island .
The problem is that Goose Island is the only region to have its land use considered in the study .
Lincoln Park by 1990 had undergone a process of gentrification in the twenty previous years .
This process did not stop in 1990 , but it seems to have been omitted in the study .
The amount of traffic in Lincoln Park in 2007 is greater than this study estimated .
Ron Schramm
The roadbed of the viaduct over Goose Island , facing east with the Cabrini - Green high rises prominently visible .
The Hickory Street ramp is behind the building in the left image .
The level of disrepair is evident .
Another aspect of this study that makes little sense is the preference given to Halsted Street as a principal arterial .
Streets of this classification are intended to serve long term trips .
Halsted , from its beginning at Grace Street south to the Eisenhower Expressway ( and beyond ) , is quite narrow .
Additionally , it traverses a very dense area and features at least three troublesome bottlenecks .
The Ogden viaduct was constructed for through traffic to avoid streets like Halsted .
The idea that Halsted be preferred is absurd .
All said , the truly telling portion of the study are the cost estimates .
The estimate for demolition was $ 14 million while the estimate for rehabilitation was $ 39 million .
Rehabilitation would have entailed replacement of the bridge deck ( $ 13.5 million ) , replacement of the electrical system for the bridges ( $ 2.5 ) million , and repairs to both bascule bridges ( $ 14 million ) .
The rehabilitation cost estimates seem inflated .
The idea that the replacement of the bridge deck would be equivalent to the cost to demolish the entire structure seems incorrect .
Worse , the study assumes that both bascule bridges need to be fully operational .
The Chicago river forks around Goose Island , but only one section at best needs to be passable for larger vessels .
One of the bridges could have been turned into a fixed bridge , greatly reducing costs .
The study does not even address the necessity for clearance under the bridges .
The Chicago River had seen a major decline in heavy traffic as far north as Goose Island by 1990 .
Perhaps both bridges could have been fixed , perhaps not , the point is that no such alternatives were considered .
The conclusion of the study was to remove the viaduct .
Ron Schramm Left :
The south entrance to the viaduct just after it was closed .
Right : Roughly the same scene in 2007 .
On Tuesday , March 24 , 1992 , the Bridge Maintenance division of the Department of Transportation received an emergency call .
Pieces of concrete were reportedly falling from the viaduct near the intersection of Halsted and Division .
The viaduct was immediately closed and tradesmen began scaling remaining pieces of loose concrete .
During this process , workers were fired upon from the nearby Cabrini - Green high rises .
This was not the first time City workers had been shot at from these projects .
A proposal was set forth to remove the northern viaduct entrance from Evergreen Street and a portion of the viaduct extending south to the river .
At the time of closure , the structure was reported to be in very poor condition .
The roadbed suffered from deep cracks and holes , in addition to the falling concrete .
The closure was discussed with property owners in the area and the local alderman , who agreed the viaduct should be removed immediately .
Inter - office correspondence between City officials and engineers reflects the same attitude , that the viaduct was useless and should be removed .
Then Acting Commissioner of the Department of Planning , Valerie Jarrett , states the apparent uselessness of the viaduct quite well .
“ The role of Ogden Avenue as a primary transportation route between the North and West sides of the City diminished significantly following the construction of the City ’s extensive expressway system . ”
She goes on to state the usefulness of the route was even further diminished when Ogden was removed north of Clybourn avenue , when
Metro-North Career Academy ’s baseball diamond was constructed over the right of way .
The Hickory Street ramp , Ogden ’s only connection to Goose Island was closed in 1988 , she also notes .
The viaduct , she states , “ is perceived by area companies as a safety hazard and visual detriment to the industrial marketability of Goose Island . ”
Demolition began in March 1992 , and the entire viaduct had been removed by 1993 .
Ron Schramm Demolition of the viaduct in progress .
As of this writing , Ogden avenue dead - ends before the Chicago river .
South of the river to its old terminus at Randolph street , evidence of arguments made against it in Lincoln Park can still be seen .
There are a large number of bad intersections with little concrete triangles , and very few good - looking buildings front on to the street .
The extension , though a good idea , was not planned well .
If intersections had been reconfigured at the beginning , and enough space had been made for retail establishments to front on the street , it may have survived .
However , so many mistakes were made in planning and execution , that no other outcome seems possible .

The stage is set for an epic confrontation this weekend , as Christian evangelists and members of the Australian Sex Party go head to head on Mount Ainslie near Canberra .
The story began back in August , when radical Minister Danny Nalliah blogged about disturbing goings - on atop Mount Ainslie , at a site overlooking the Federal Parliament Building .
Nalliah , who had previously claimed that a spate of bush fires were God ’s vengeance for abortion laws , told how a friend had made a disturbing discovery on a school visit to this site .
He wrote : " One of the students , who was not a Christian , came up to my Pastor friend and said , ' there is blood all over the concrete slab under the tower ' .
This got the attention of many students and when they looked further , it was indeed fresh blood splattered all over the slab .
The students were absolutely shocked as was my friend , who explained that it was some sort of sacrifice . "
After consulting with a born - again tour guide , Nalliah ’s friend determined that this was the result of witches ’ covens carrying out sacrifices on the mountain top in an attempt to influence the policies of government .
Alarmed beyond belief , Nalliah declared war on the witches , satanists and assorted evil spirits involved .
On 27 September , he called on all Christians to commence a 21 - day period of fasting and abstinence .
This would culminate on Saturday 17 October 2009 with " an offensive spiritual warfare attack on the demonic strongholds over the nation " .
He wrote : " Christians from all over the nation will gather on top of Mount Ainsley in Canberra from 2 pm to 5 pm .
We are calling a special afternoon of United Spiritual Warfare Prayer , Repentance , and Prophetic Worship . "
It did look like one in the eye for the Satanists , until the Australian Sex Party - who are not at all impressed by Christian fundamentalist views on issues such as contraception , sex education and gay rights - decided to stick an oar in on behalf of constitutional rights .
They too will be up on Mount Ainslie this Saturday , to protest the influence that they consider radical religious groups are having on federal politics .
According to Party Convenor Fiona Patten , the federal Parliamentary Privileges Committee should also attend the rally to ensure that MPs were not in any way threatened in the line of duty by the nature of what she described as an " exorcism " .
She said : " The Privileges Committee has the power to sit while Parliament is in recess and we would strongly suggest that the Chair , George Brandis , should come up and mingle with the crowds .
" If a God- fearing member of Parliament is threatened with ' eternal damnation ' for voting in favour of gay marriage , this is clearly as much of a contempt as any other threat to an MP . "
In a tactic that may further inflame passions , the Sex Party has announced that its answer to the alleged blood sacrifices carried by witches ’ covens is its very own " blood sacrifice in the form of a halel [ sic ] sausage and kofta ball sizzle " .
They also intend to unveil a specially commissioned painting that deals with the issue of blood sacrifices , religious influence and the federal parliament .
Luckily for all concerned , Samhain ( October 31 ) is still two weeks away .
Otherwise , the resulting conflagration – involving fundamental Christians , Sex Party workers , and Satanists – could well be beyond the bounds even of our own Playmobil expert to illustrate . ®

A picture of the site of the alleged sacrifice was taken by Danny Nalliah , a slightly larger version of which is available on a special witchcraft edition of the Australian Sex Party newsletter .
The object in question appears to be a large block of stone that has been heavily stained by some unspecified substance .

Darren sez , " The City of Toronto apparently did n't think their ethnically - ambiguous stock photography was diverse enough .
They did a poor job of adding a happy African - Canadian to the mix . "
" The policy does n't say PhotoShop , the policy says ' show diversity ' and that 's of course what we try and do because we want all of our publications to reflect the community that we serve , " explained Mr. Sack , who oversees city communications .
" That 's only fair .
People should see themselves reflected in city services because it 's everyone who uses them . "
" When you 're publishing something with the deadlines and you do n't have the right photo , the objective is to communicate the service , " Mr. Sack said .
" We 're in one of the most diverse cities in the world .
I hope that does n't pose a problem for anybody .
Capturing that diversity is not difficult .
That 's been our general experience . "
I 'm divided on this .
I think the real problem is that they could n't find a piece of diverse stock art , and opted for a ham - fisted photoshop job rather than a more detailed search of their stock catalogs .
I do n't see anything wrong ( and I do see plenty right ! ) with trying to find photos for government publications that reflect the ethnic makeup of the citizens the government serves .
Toronto is a fantastically , famously diverse place , and it's good to see the city trying to reflect that .
But they should do better than this !

Ever since Sonia Sotomayor was nominated for the Supreme Court , MSNBC ’s Pat Buchanan has been bashing her as an unqualified Affirmative Action baby .
His comments reached their zenith on The Rachel Maddow Show where he claimed that the US was built by white people and have continued today .
Here are some videos of Buchanan ’s recent race based attacks on Sotomayor .
Here is Pat Buchanan on Hardball claiming that Hispanics do n’t deserve Affirmative Action because they were never enslaved :

Here is Buchanan stating that Sotomayor is a militant liberal Latina :
Here is Buchanan declaring that Sotomayor ’s nomination is Affirmative Action :
Here is the showdown on Thursday night between Pat Buchanan and Rachel Maddow :
Pat Buchanan has a long history of racist comments .
For decades , he has complained that minorities get all of the breaks .
In 1990 he wrote , “ The Negroes of the ’50s became the blacks of the ’60’s ; now , the “ African - Americans ” of the 90’s demand racial quotas and set- asides , as the Democrats eagerly assent and a pandering GOP prepares to go along .
Who speaks for the Euro - Americans , who founded the U.S.A.? …
Is it not time to take America back ? ”
In 1991 Buchanan accused former grand wizard of the KKK David Duke of stealing his ideas , “ David Duke is busy stealing from me .
I have a mind to go down there and sue that dude for intellectual property theft . ”
In the past Buchanan also defended the ban on interracial dating at Bob Jones University , and golf clubs that ban minorities from joining .
I think that if people choose not to support Sotomayor because of her judicial philosophy , that ’s fine , but if you watch the video ’s above , does n’t Buchanan ’s problem with her appear to be that she is not white ?
Buchanan seems less concerned about her judicial philosophy , than he is worried about her skin color .
His racist attacks are good for stirring the pot at MSNBC , but they are bad for the GOP .
However judging from the comments made by some of the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Sotomayor hearing , it would seem that many Republicans share his views .
Buchanan may be a racist straight out of the bad old days in American history , but the problem is many Republicans are happy to share his views .
This is a default response for many people–irked customers , angry bosses , disappointed colleagues .
It 's easy to go into high dudgeon ( in fact , low dudgeon is n't even in the dictionary , it 's always ' high ' ) .
The thing is : it does n't work .
It rarely succeeds in accomplishing much , and it makes you unhappy at the same time .
What if you took it out of your toolbox of responses ?
What if , just like becoming a cannibal or painting your face green , you eliminated righteous indignation as an option in your list of responses to various situations , no matter how unfair ?
What if the people you work with were n't permitted to indulge ?
Just think of how much more you 'd get done and how much calmer everything would be .

Car wrecks may be the most significant and well - documented adverse health effect of smoking marijuana , as clear evidence that it causes schizophrenia or other health problems is largely missing , a literature review showed .
Overall , " the public health burden of cannabis use is probably modest compared with that of alcohol , tobacco , and other illicit drugs , " Australian researchers reported in the Oct. 17 issue of The Lancet .
Wayne Hall , PhD , of the University of Queensland in Herston , Australia , and Louisa Degenhardt , PhD , of the University of New South Wales in Sydney , reviewed nearly 100 studies covering acute as well as chronic effects of marijuana , including reports of the prevalence of marijuana use around the world .
Globally , they wrote , about 3.9 % of the world 's population used marijuana in 2006 , according to United Nations statistics .
These data also indicated wide variation from place to place -- North America , Australia , New Zealand , and many nations in western Europe and southern and western Africa have usage rates above 8 % , with much lower prevalence in east Asia and certain Muslim countries .
But the data also suggest that marijuana use is stable or falling in nations with high prevalence in the past , while in China , eastern Europe , sub -Saharan Africa , and South America cannabis consumption is increasing .
Hall and Degenhardt said the most common acute effects of cannabis intake are anxiety , panic reactions , and psychotic symptoms , primarily in individuals using the substance for the first time .
But the authors moved on to other topics after this assertion and cited no primary sources for it .
They spent more time detailing the psychomotor impairments associated with the marijuana high .
" Some experimental studies have shown diminished driving performance in response to emergency situations , " Hall and Degenhardt said , findings also corroborated in epidemiological studies .
For example , one study of car crash victims found that they were more likely to have tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , the main psychoactive component of marijuana , in their blood compared with age - and sex - matched controls .
Another study determined that motorists killed in wrecks were 2.5 times as likely to have been responsible for the accident when they had THC in their blood .
On the other hand , it appears that the impairments are less severe than those associated with alcohol , the review authors said , " because cannabis - affected people drive more slowly and take fewer risks . "
Few somatic effects of chronic use have been documented , Hall and Degenhardt found , except for several case - control studies suggesting promotion of lung cancer .
Also , THC increases heart rate in a dose - dependent way , perhaps increasing risks for people with preexisting cardiovascular disease .
Two studies have indicated that individuals with a history of myocardial infarction were at increased risk for second events or death when they used marijuana , the authors said .
Cognitive effects while high are , of course , well recognized , but their persistence is less clear , Hall and Degenhardt said .
Some studies say cognitive impairment remains in chronic heavy users even after they quit , but others indicate that recovery of function is the rule .
Cannabis use has been linked by numerous studies with adverse psychosocial effects including poor school performance and increased likelihood of unemployment , the authors said .
But causality has never been proven , they pointed out .
" Whether cannabis use is a contributory cause of poor school performance , is a consequence of poor educational attainment , or poor educational attainment is the result of common factors is unclear , " they wrote .
Similar uncertainty clouds the research on whether marijuana fosters use of other , arguably more dangerous , drugs such as cocaine and heroin , the researchers said .
People who use marijuana are more likely to use other illicit drugs as well , but causality has been difficult to prove .
Marijuana use has also been linked to increased risk of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and , less consistently , depression .
Hall and Degenhardt appeared to be persuaded that the association with schizophrenia is real , citing a series of longitudinal studies that found frequency of marijuana use was correlated with later diagnosis of schizophrenia .
" A meta -analysis [ published in The Lancet in 2007 ] of these longitudinal studies reported a pooled odds ratio of 1.4 ( 95 % CI 1.20 to 1.65 ) of psychotic symptoms or psychotic disorders in those who had ever used cannabis , " Hall and Degenhardt wrote .
" Risk of psychotic symptoms or disorders was higher in regular users than in nonusers ( OR 2.09 , 95 % CI 1.54 to 2.84 ) . "
On the other hand , they conceded that a causal relationship remained uncertain .
" Evidence is conflicting on whether incidence of schizophrenia increases as cannabis use increases in young adults , as would be expected if the association was causal , " they said .
Donald Abrams , MD , chief of hematology - oncology at San Francisco General Hospital , told MedPage Today that the causal direction could actually point the other way .
" One hypothesis suggests that adolescents with schizophrenic tendencies find that cannabis improves their thought disorder and hence tend to be more likely to use cannabis to self - medicate , " Abrams , a well - known HIV researcher who has also studied medical uses of marijuana , said in an e-mail .
" Hence , use does not lead to schizophrenia but is associated with amelioration of symptoms , " Abrams said .
He also scoffed at the evidence -- which Hall and Degenhardt admitted was weak -- linking marijuana use with depression .
Abrams pointed out that a cannabinoid receptor antagonist , rimonabant ( Acomplia , Zimulti ) , was withdrawn from the market because it was associated with increases in depression and suicide .
" It would seem unlikely that the [ receptor ] agonist would do the same , " he said .
Hall and Degenhardt said a few studies had suggested modest and usually temporary developmental deficits in infants born to mothers who used marijuana , but the evidence was weakened by a lack of controls for other drug use , genetic factors , or simply poor parenting .
Overall , they concluded that marijuana is clearly associated with negative health and psychosocial consequences , but these are not as major as for some other drugs , and the causal relations remain unproven .
" The focus of epidemiological and clinical research should be on clarifying the causative role of cannabis for these adverse health effects , " the authors said .
They also cited a recent study estimating that marijuana accounted for about 0.2 % of the total disease burden in Australia , a nation with one of the world 's highest rates of cannabis use .
Its health impact was one - tenth that of alcohol and one - fortieth that of tobacco , the study found .
Abrams called their review balanced on the whole .
Hall and Degenhardt , he said , " provide tempering comments in their interpretation of the data that allows for uncertainties that still exist . "
But he cautioned against relying exclusively on published studies .
" There is a publication bias , in my opinion , towards easier publication of reports of the harmful effects of cannabis " compared with studies finding no adverse consequences , he suggested .
Saying he has heard his critics , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , Max Baucus , said Monday in an interview that he would modify his health care bill to provide more generous assistance to moderate - income Americans , to help them buy insurance .
He also said he would make changes to reduce the impact of a proposed tax on high - end health insurance policies .
Mr. Baucus , a Montana Democrat , disclosed his plans in an interview a day before the committee is to begin meeting to debate and vote on sweeping legislation to remake the health care system and guarantee insurance for millions of Americans .

In the second half of the 90s , a company called Be boldly entered the personal computing market with an operating system that was unlike any other .
BeOS was highly modular and responsive , booted in mere seconds , made extensive use of threading , gave developers rich C++ APIs , and had a database - like 64 - bit filesystem with support for journaling , indexing , and metadata .
BeOS offered all of this while Microsoft was selling Windows 95 and Apple was still struggling to deliver features like preemptive multitasking .
Although BeOS was arguably one of the most advanced platforms of its time , it never gained sufficient traction to stay afloat in a market that was almost entirely locked up by its rivals .
After the final BeOS release in 2000 , a community of enthusiasts began an effort to bring the platform back to life by building a clean - room open source implementation from scratch .
This effort , which became known as the Haiku project , has just announced the availability of its first alpha release after eight years of development .
I tested Haiku alpha 1 in VirtualBox to see how it compares with modern operating systems and the original BeOS user experience .
It 's significantly more robust and mature than the prerelease build that I explored last year , but a lot of work still remains to be done before it will be ready for broader adoption .
The Haiku alpha is available for download in several formats .
There is a VMware image , a raw disk image , and an installable Live CD ISO .
I tested the latter by installing it in VirtualBox .
The installation experience is not quite as polished as modern Linux Live CD installers , but I was able to get through it without much difficulty .
Partitioning was a bit unintuitive and had to be done manually with an included disk management tool .
In the spirit of BeOS , Haiku 's boot performance is very good .
In my tests , I got from the startup splash screen to a fully usable desktop in roughly four seconds .
This is one of Haiku 's strengths relative to modern operating systems and it is the envy of prominent Linux distributions that are ambitiously aiming for similarly fast startup .
The Haiku user interface is modeled entirely after BeOS , inheriting its signature variable - width titlebars and legendary spatial file management .
When I was testing Haiku , I was surprised by how modern the user interface feels despite the age of the underlying paradigms .
It has really aged well .
The deskbar , with its application expanders , is still one of the most elegant and space - efficient approaches to desktop task management that I 've encountered .
Several noticeable aesthetic flourishes visually differentiate Haiku from BeOS R5 , including the extensive use of light gradients on user interface elements and the adoption of vector drawing for icons .
In general , the look and feel is smoother and more refined .
One of the principal goals of the Haiku developer community is to deliver binary compatibility with BeOS R5 , the last official version of the operating system .
Binary compatibility is important , because it will make it possible for users to run the corpus of existing legacy BeOS applications on Haiku systems .
One of the most notable impediments to achieving this goal is the fact that the GCC compiler itself discarded backwards binary compatibility with the release of the GCC 4.x series .
To address this challenge , Haiku offers a " GCC Hybrid " model .
I did n't have much luck getting old software from BeBits to run on Haiku , but there are several complex third - party applications that have successfully been ported and are included by default in the alpha release .
These include the Vision IRC client , the WonderBrush graphic editing tool , and BeZillaBrowser , a rebranded port of Firefox 2 .
Haiku comes with its own versions of the basic suite of standard BeOS desktop applications .
This includes a media player , archive expander , lightweight Web server , command terminal , the workspace switcher , and a number of other tools .
The obligatory spinning teapot demo is also present .
The Haiku alpha is primarily intended to facilitate application and platform development , so it is unsurprising that it ships with a relatively diverse assortment of standard development tools , including GCC , git , and Vim .
It also comes with Python 2.6 and Perl 5 to enable scripting .
Haiku has come a long way , but there are still a lot of caveats and limitations .
Haiku provides source - level compatibility with BSD network drivers , which brings support for a lot of modern network hardware , but it still lacks WiFi compatibility .
At the HaikuWare website , a $ 2,000 bounty has been offered to encourage the development of a WiFi stack .
There is already a preliminary implementation under development that has been shown to work .
Although some of the unique advantages of BeOS have faded with time as other platforms evolved , there is still intrinsic value in the Haiku project and it could have a lot to offer as it matures .
As I said in my previous review of Haiku , I think that it has the most potential to shine on netbooks and other hardware devices where boot performance and low overhead are important .
I look forward to the day when I can rock Haiku on my portable computer .
THE odd whitish spheres resting in a tray of ice outside a bodega on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn were strange enough to make passers - by do a double take .
Strolling down the Williamsburg street , Martin Mancusi , 30 , a tourist from Barcelona , Spain , and his friend Alejandro Kaed , 33 , stopped to examine the items : young peeled coconuts , waiting to be pierced by a straw and sipped tiki - style by someone young and fashionable , as they have been all summer .
Like banh mi sandwiches and sriracha chili sauce , the young coconut and its juice is the latest formerly humble food to be discovered by New York City ’s style set , and elevated  if not quite to the level of a status symbol  at least to that of a prized accessory .
In the last few months , retailers in hipster hot spots like Williamsburg and the Lower East Side say they have sold unprecedented amounts of the fruit for streetside consumption .
Car of the Future Will Run on Its Own Waste Energy
September 1st , 2009 by Tina Casey
Electricity is the ultimate portable fuel , so running a car on electricity opens a world of possibilities in terms of harvesting and using sustainable energy while on the go .
Thermoelectric innovator Amerigon Incorporated has one especially interesting approach : capture the waste energy from the car ’s engine exhaust and recycle it into electric power .
Through its BSST subsidiary and with $ 1.1 million in backing from the U.S Department of Energy , Amerigon is entering the fifth phase of the project .
Completion is targeted for March 31 , 2010 , and then look out , world .
[ social_buttons ]
Amerigon , BSST and Thermoelectric Energy
Amerigon ’s BSST subsidiary has already applied thermoelectric recovery principles to heating and cooling systems .
It ’s a logical choice for the project , having developed the highest - efficiency thermoelectric technology achieved so far .
The program kicked off in 2005 with a team including Visteon Corporation , BMW , UC Santa Cruz , the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , and the California Institute of Technology ’s Jet propulsion Laboratory .
Ford joined the project after analysis and concept phases established a fuel savings of up to 12 % in simulations , and the thermoelectric system was bench - tested in the lab using hot gas instead of actual exhaust .
Phase 4 , which is drawing to a close , involves testing the system on a BMW six - cylinder engine .
Cars as Energy Harvesters , and Energy Generators
The new technology promises a sea change in the way we conceive of cars as energy users – and producers .
For example , an electric car that harvests solar energy could also incorporate BSST ’s thermoelectric system , while generating kinetic energy as it passes over a roadway – and using available wind as an additional power source .
In the not too distant future , cars that run only on fossil fuels will be just that – fossils .

Cesar Lopez , a 29 - year - old Lebanon , Pa. , man , was busted Saturday when he walked up to a police officer with a small bag of marijuana stuck to his forehead , according to Lebanon police .
Police said the officer went into a Turkey Hill convenience store on Lehman Street at 3:25 a.m. Saturday and saw Lopez holding a baseball cap and peering inside it .
When Lopez approached the officer , he looked up , and the officer said he saw a small plastic bag stuck to Lopez 's forehead .
The bag appeared to contain marijuana , police said .
The officer retrieved the bag from Lopez ’s forehead and said , “ Is this what you are looking for ? , ” according to the police report .
Lopez was charged with possession of a small amount of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia .
It is not uncommon for people to hide drugs in the inside lip of a cap , police said .

Fun with comments
In the Atlanta Journal - Constitution , Cynthia Tucker cautiously moves a step forward with Why not de-criminalize marijuana use ?.
It ’s a short post that riffs off The Washington Post article I mentioned , as well as Andrew Sullivan ’s Cannabis Closet posts .
What ’s interesting in this particular case , though , is some of the colorful characters that you discover further down on the page …
Say What ??
says :
Why not de-criminalize marijuana use ?
Hmm , why not de-criminalize the following : gambling prostitution alcohol ( for those under 21 ) crack cocaine imbezzlement voter fraud ( you know , help out ACORN ) underage sex
Well , first of all , thanks for not using rape and murder .
People who ca n’t tell the difference between smoking pot and rape will quickly stop being invited to the good parties .
As far as the others , I ’m actually fine with one through five , but imbezzlement [ sic ] and voter fraud ?
Really ?
This guy could n’t even land a job as stock boy .
He ’d put the sweat socks and carburetors in the produce section .
El Jefe decides to take the sarcastic road :
Ms. Tucker – your right , we do not have enough lazy slackers in society , we need more .
El Jefe , if potheads are such lazy slackers , how do they manage to keep supplied with pot ?
And how is it that some of them actually know the difference between “ your ” and “ you ’re ” ?
Joe Matarotz made my head explode :
Being a college student in the early 70’s , I smoked a small forest worth of pot .
I can say that it is one of the few things I ’ve done that I am ashamed of today .
Keep it illegal .
Smoking pot is NOT something to be encouraged .
Let me get this straight …
Joe is ashamed of all the pot he smoked and wishes it had been illegal so he would n’t have smoked it … but … wait , it was illegal and he smoked it anyway .
If it stays illegal , will that mean that Joe will be less ashamed of having smoked pot when it was … illegal ?
I ’m so confused .
And what about the notion that making it legal would encourage it ?
Well , let ’s see… I believe that it ’s legal to eat camel dung .
Does that mean that it ’s encouraged ?
Wow , did you know that the U.S. government encourages the consumption of camel dung ?
Sunshine …
Yes , she calls herself Sunshine , and really betrays her name with another “ lazy ” post
Have you ever seen a pot head with a ‘ to do list ’ ?
The answer is no .
Pot heads are too lazy to do anything .
The pot heads who are all for legalizing it have probably already pickled their brains and ca n’t see the damage it does .
This country should NEVER , EVER legalize pot .
Sunshine , all your friends smoke pot and you do n’t even realize it .
To Do List Get stoned Demolish Sunshine in a battle of wits
CK Hall brings takes the intellectual approach :
For all you “ authorities ” on Pot–Keep it ILLEGAL !
Kind of hard to debunk that .
Sort of like saying “ Hey , all you “ earth is round ” people – keep it flat ! ”
Public Option Heading South says :
Anyone who has seen a relative or close friend hit rock bottom because of drug addictions knows why marijuana should be illegal .
Marijuana is the port of entry for stronger highly addictive drugs like crack cocccain [ sic ] , opiates , meth etc .
Alcohol , while a drug that can lead to self destructive consequences is n’t any where near as addictive for most people .
Well , that ’s certainly one approach to proving your point .
Simply make up shit .
Mutts R Stupid ( apparently some kind of self - referential name ) came up with this doozy :
Legalizing pot is ok by me , let stupid people kill themselves faster , it will improve the gene pool .
My mother was a night ER nurse in a small town , and I recall her telling me a tale of woe concerning young drug users .
This teenage boy came into the ER with black , cold arms .
It turns out he had been told that injecting peanut butter into his veins would make him high , so that is what he did .
He lost both arms .
Marijuana kills people fast , and somehow causes people to inject peanut butter in their arms .
I do n’t even know how to respond to that .
This apparently explains the millions of armless dead pot smokers , and why they put peanut butter behind the counter .
Mutts R Stupid came back with another one …
Have you ever seen what the lungs of a long term pot smoker look like ?
Worse that [ sic ] tobacco users lungs by far .
At least tobacco has some quality control , and is highly processed , and somewhat purified .
Somehow I doubt that Mutts R Stupid has personally compared the lungs of pot smokers and cigarette smokers ( and if it were true , why is n’t the ONDCP trotting those pictures out all over the media ? ) .
But it ’s odd that he ’d oppose legalization because pot lacks quality control — would n’t that be a reason to legalize ?
And I do n’t know that I ’d want to get that excited about the highly processed “ purification ” of tobacco .
Of course , these folks are the fringe elements who populate the comments sections of local newspapers .
And clearly nobody out there has an argument that could come close to denting the strength of ours .
Part of me is entertained by these specimens of humanity ’s periphery , while another part of me is deeply frightened .
In 2007 , a resident surgeon snapped a picture of a patient 's tattoo -- the words Hot Rod on his penis -- and shared it with colleagues , making international news when the story was leaked to the press .
At least the resident did n't post the picture on the Internet .
In the age of Facebook and YouTube , medical students might post content that violates patient privacy .
A new survey suggests that with the rise of blogging and sites like Facebook , Twitter , and YouTube , such a thing could happen .
In fact , 60 percent of medical schools have had students post inappropriate or unprofessional information on the Web , according to a study in the September 23/30 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Most of the time , the information was related to the student 's own behavior , including drunken , drug - related , or sexually suggestive images or comments , as well as the use of profanity or discriminatory language .
But six schools , or 13 percent , reported incidents in the past year that involved content that violated patient privacy .
For example , some students blogged about their experiences with enough detail to identify patients , and one student posted patient details on Facebook .
Most of the time other trainees told the dean about the indiscretions , but in two cases , patients or their families blew the whistle .
Health.com : Medical mistakes :
More common than you think
" We expected to find incidents of unprofessionalism , but the number was higher than expected , " says lead study author Dr. Katherine C. Chretien , of the Washington , D.C. , VA Medical Center .
Less than half of schools currently have policies in place to police or punish such behavior .
In the study , the researchers sent out anonymous surveys to medical school deans or their representatives at each institution in the Association of American Medical Colleges ( AAMC ) -- a total of 130 schools .
Of the 78 schools that responded , 47 reported ever having an incident .
In the previous year , 13 percent of those schools reported no incidents , 78 percent had fewer than 5 incidents , 7 percent reported 5 to 15 incidents , and 2 percent had some incidents but did not know exactly how many .
Do n't Miss White House offers medical malpractice initiative
Of those that reported an incident and responded to the question about disciplinary actions , 30 gave informal warnings and three students were expelled .
Overall , 38 percent of the schools had policies in place that cover unprofessional online behavior and 11 percent of the schools without such policies were working on developing one .

Deans who reported incidents were more likely to have such a policy in place , the survey found .
" This is a pretty new issue for medicine , " Chretien says .
" We need to have a discussion about what kind of information is appropriate to be out there and what defines medical professionalism in the online world . "
Other professions are also grappling with the same types of issues , she says .
" The difference with medicine is that we have patients ' privacy to maintain , and that is critical ; doctors have also been held to a higher moral standard , at least historically .
Health.com : Unhealthy outbursts :
What you ( and celebs ) should do instead
" There needs to be better education in medical schools about protecting patient privacy on the Internet because even if [ students ] do n't use direct patient identifiers , you can still identify someone with certain characteristics , " she says .
Arthur Caplan , the director of the University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics , says he was surprised that more institutions had not begun to adopt policies about the Internet .
" Today 's medical students think of the online world as freewheeling and open - ended with no rules , and we have to educate them that they can't take that attitude when discussing their patients or personal information , " he says .
Medical students may be accustomed to being free with their thoughts and photos on the Web , but the Internet is not a free - fly zone for future doctors .
The only way to reign in this behavior is to punish violators , Caplan says .
" First - time violators should get suspended , which is serious stuff , and second - time violators are out , " he explains .
" We also need to remind and teach students what medical privacy is in terms of the Internet . "

Dr. Jordan Cohen , a professor of medicine at George Washington University and a former president of the AAMC , says he finds the study results not all that surprising , given the popularity of social - networking sites .
" It 's clearly an area that should be addressed by schools , " he says .
" The Internet needs to be included in examples of potential areas where unprofessional behavior can occur . "

Britain is to commit itself to a massive increase in domestic food production to feed the population in the next 40 years , The Independent on Sunday has learnt .
The UK will announce tomorrow that it intends to " play a full part " in meeting a United Nations target of raising food production by 70 per cent by 2050 .
The surge in homegrown crops and meat – which has echoes of the Dig for Victory campaign of the Second World War – is needed to cope with rising global population levels and crop failures and water scarcity caused by climate change .
British officials are increasingly concerned that food supplies will come under strain as a result of rocketing demand from newly prosperous and powerful nations such as China and India .
Self - sufficiency has fallen in recent years , and only about 60 per cent of the food British people eat comes from the UK .

Tomorrow , the Secretary of State for the Environment , Hilary Benn , will set out the scale of the problem and challenge farmers to raise output rapidly while cutting greenhouse gases .
In the search for a new green revolution , he will say new research is needed to develop new crop breeds and techniques .
Manufacturers , retailers and households will be urged to cut current massive levels of waste .
Households can help by growing more food in back gardens and allotments .
Civil servants described the new food strategy as a " wake - up call " for farmers , retailers and the public .
Farmers who have long criticised the Government for taking a relaxed attitude towards food security will welcome the focus on domestic production .
Wildlife groups , however , fear that further agricultural intensification will hit wildlife .
Ripping out hedgerows , growing crops on meadows and dousing fields in pesticides and fertilisers have badly affected farmland birds and animals in the past 50 years .
Numbers of farmland birds such as skylarks , yellowhammers and corn buntings have almost halved and many wildflowers have been left on the brink of extinction .
Most of England 's hedgerows have been lost since 1947 .
The Government 's new approach is set out in a new document , the UK Food Security Assessment .
It says that Britain 's position is currently favourable because agricultural production has risen in recent years , with Britain a major exporter of wheat and barley .
But it warns that rising population pressures and a likely worsening environmental picture will pose serious challenges in coming decades .
In a list of challenges to UK food security are the changing climate , floods , drought , soil erosion , water scarcities and the breakdown of ecosystems .
Global temperatures may rise two to three degrees in the next 50 years , threatening large - scale crop failure in Africa .
" The Government is monitoring the climate risks to harvests and the potential for more volatility in supplies and prices .
We will also examine any implications for animal disease and food safety , " the document said .
" Other areas of climate - change impacts on our food will include further pressure on fish products from increasing ocean acidification ; supply strains on water - reliant crops such as fruit from the Mediterranean ; and the impacts of increasing episodes of coastal flooding and erosion . "
Droughts and rocketing demand last year sparked riots across developing countries such as Haiti after food prices rose by 40 per cent in 2007 .
In Britain , years of cheap food ended , with prices rising back to 1997 levels .
British households still spend on average less than 10 per cent of their income on food , compared with 70 per cent in many developing countries .
The new document says that while Britain is relatively well placed for food security , countries from which we import may be in a much worse position .
It adds that Britain should help to take pressure off global food supplies by raising production .
The UN Food and Agriculture Programme believes food production must rise by 70 per cent on 2005 - 7 levels to cope with a world population forecast to hit nine billion in 2050 .
On the risk of wildlife destruction , a government source said : " We are obviously hoping it 's not going to lead to that .
The central message is we have got to produce more using less and not trash our wildlife . "
Last year the Department for the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) said that the agrarian revolution must be done sustainably , or else future generations would inherit depleted natural resources and , ultimately , dwindling food .
Professor Tim Lang , a commissioner for land use on the Government 's Sustainable Development Commission , warned : " We are facing a mounting crisis in securing global food supplies , with climate change , rocketing oil prices and growing demand all placing a strain on traditional supply chains . "
Britain was wholly self - sufficient in food before the start of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century .
Self - sufficiency sank to a record low of 30 per cent before the Second World War , when the Government was forced to increase production rapidly by bringing more areas under the plough and exhorting people to grow their own fruit and vegetables .
After the Dig for Victory campaign , production drifted back downwards , before nudging up to the current level of 62 per cent .
Imports are mainly plants that have to be grown in hotter countries such as bananas , oranges , tomatoes , tea and coffee .
In a speech to the Fabian Society last year , Mr Benn – who will launch the new policy at the massive Thanet Earth greenhouse complex in Kent tomorrow morning – said : " UK farming is doing all right overall .
We are more self - sufficient now than we were before and after the Second World War , and we have shown during wartime what we can do to raise production when we need to .
" But to look at our food security in this way is only to think about art of the problem .
Rather , we should look to maintain the security of our sources of supply .
And if we want to avoid too much demand chasing not enough world supply , then we need to help to create a stable food market which can meet global demand for future generations . "
Groups such as the Council for the Protection of Rural England , the Soil Association and the RSPB are concerned that Britain will opt for massive single - crop farms , turning many areas of the country into monocultures dubbed " green concrete " for their impact on wildlife .
The RSPB said : " It is important that concerns about food security are not used as an argument to decrease the sustainability of production .
For long - term food security , we must consider our impacts on the environment and ensure we do not cause lasting damage to biodiversity and the ecosystem . "
If MPs had hoped that the summer recess would bring some relief from the nightmare that descended upon them they were sorely mistaken .
If Sir Thomas has uncovered widespread misuse of taxpayers ' money it also belies the efforts of Speaker Bercow and others to maintain that this was confined to a small number .
Yet talking to MPs at the party conferences it is clear that many are deeply aggrieved over what has happened to them .
While in public they are contrite , in private most are plain livid .
They believe they were entitled to claim the full whack under the rules and it was their business how they went about doing so .
One Tory MP said he felt that Parliament and the political system had been irreparably damaged by the leak of the computer disk containing the information that they wanted kept confidential – and he was among the so - called " good guys " who had hardly claimed anything .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Murder and persecution of women and children accused of being witches is spreading around the world and destroying the lives of millions of people , experts said Wednesday .
Dimbeswari Bhattarai ( front ) , a witch doctor , or ojha , speaks during an interview with Reuters in Uttarkuchi village in India 's northeastern state of Assam September 7 , 2006 .
Police say that around 300 people have been killed in the state in the five years from 2001 for allegedly practising witchcraft .
REUTERS / Utpal Baruah
The experts -- United Nations officials , civil society representatives from affected countries and non-governmental organization ( NGO ) specialists working on the issue -- urged governments to acknowledge the extent of the persecution .
“ This is becoming an international problem -- it is a form of persecution and violence that is spreading around the globe , ” Jeff Crisp of the U.N. ’s refugee agency UNHCR told a seminar organized by human rights officials of the world body .
Aides to U.N. special investigators on women ’s rights and on summary executions said killings and violence against alleged witch women -- often elderly people -- were becoming common events in countries ranging from South Africa to India .
And community workers from Nepal and Papua New Guinea told the seminar , on the fringes of a session of the U.N. ’s 47 - member Human Rights Council , that “ witch - hunting ” was now common , both in rural communities and larger population centres .
HOMELESS CHILDREN
Gary Foxcroft of British - based charity Stepping Stones - Nigeria said children living homeless on the streets in many countries had been driven out by families or communities because they were suspected of being witches .
But increasingly children suspected of witchcraft -- usually on the basis of vague accusations -- were being killed because their parents feared they would have to take them back if the authorities identified them .
Ulrich Garms from the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay told the seminar that there were no reliable statistics on how many women and child “ witches ” were killed annually around the globe .
Other U.N. officials tracking the problem said deaths ran into at least tens of thousands , and beatings , deprivation of property and banishment and isolation from community life meant victims of “ witch frenzy ” ran into millions .
Speakers at the seminar agreed that poverty , exacerbated by the current world economic crisis , often lay behind the phenomenon as people sought to find scapegoats for their misfortunes and the illnesses they suffered .
But some preachers of major religions and governments were also responsible , they said .

A record year for Wall Street pay
15 October 2009
According to the Wall Street Journal , the major US banks and financial firms are on track to hand out a record $ 140 billion in compensation this year .
This is a 20 percent increase from 2008 and $ 10 billion more than the previous record , set in 2007 .
The stock market celebrated the news , outlined in a front - page Journal article on Wednesday , along with the release of JPMorgan Chase ’s third - quarter earnings report , which showed a seven - fold increase in profits from last year to $ 3.6 billion .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 145 points , closing above the 10,000 mark for the first time in a year .
The record pay being handed out by the 23 largest publicly traded banks , hedge funds , asset management firms and stock and commodity exchanges ( the report did not include privately held companies ) underscores the class interests being served by the Obama administration and the subordination of the entire political system to a financial aristocracy which essentially dictates government policy .
The American financial elite , aided and abetted by the White House and Congress , is profiting from an economic disaster that is driving hundreds of millions of working people in the US and around the world into poverty — a disaster precipitated by its own methods of financial speculation and fraud and its manic pursuit of personal gain .
One year after the financial crash of 2008 , the richer - than - ever compensation packages for bankers give the lie to Obama ’s occasional protests against Wall Street “ excesses ” and talk of tough , new banking regulations .
It demonstrates that the administration ’s economic policies , including trillions in subsidies to the banks , have been devoted to paying off the bad debts of the bankers at public expense and protecting the wealth of a miniscule section of the population .
There is an element of provocation in the pay awards being doled out by the banks .
Far from curbing their avarice , they are flaunting their wealth and power in the midst of soaring unemployment and deepening social misery for millions of Americans .
The Journal based its estimate on an analysis of the financial firms ’ earnings reports for the first half of 2009 and projected earnings for the rest of the year .
It predicted the firms ’ total revenues would hit $ 437 billion this year , surpassing the $ 345 billion they recorded in 2007 , before the financial crisis erupted .
The projected $ 140 billion in compensation includes salary , bonuses , health benefits , retirement plans and stock awards .
Average compensation for employees at the 23 firms will top out at $ 143,000 , but this figure obscures the eight - digit sums that will go to the top executives and traders , who will receive a disproportionate share of the total outlay .
The Journal projects that Bank of America , which has not paid back the $ 45 billion in cash it received in Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) funds , will award more than $ 30 billion in compensation , a 64 percent increase over last year .
JPMorgan
Chase will pay out $ 29.5 billion , an increase of nearly 30 percent .
Goldman Sachs is on track to dispense $ 21.8 billion , nearly double its pay tab for 2008 .
The average Goldman employee will receive over $ 743,000 .
While bank pay is reaching new heights , workers ’ wages are being systematically slashed .
The New York Times reported Wednesday that pay cuts in the US “ are occurring more frequently than at any time since the Great Depression . ”
It cited Bureau of Labor statistics showing that weekly pay for production workers , representing 80 percent of the workforce , has fallen for nine consecutive months .
This is a record for the 44 years since the bureau began tracking weekly pay .
The previous record was a two - month period during the 1981 - 82 recession .
The assault on workers ’ pay reflects a deliberate policy of the Obama administration to use mass unemployment to drive down the wages and living standards of the working class and effect a further redistribution of wealth from the bottom to the top .
While Obama demands that the American people “ take responsibility ” for the crisis and “ live within their means , ” he implements policies designed to further enrich the financial elite .
Even as he continued and expanded the bank bailout begun under Bush , he intervened last March to scuttle bills in Congress , following the public furor over millions in bonuses awarded by the bailed - out insurance firm AIG , which would have imposed certain restraints on executive pay .
He followed this by rejecting the turnaround plans of General Motors and Chrysler and forcing the auto companies into bankruptcy , in order to impose sweeping layoffs and cuts in pay and benefits for auto workers .
This was a sign to big business to launch a wage - cutting drive against the working class as a whole .
The White House is pushing a health care overhaul that will dramatically cut coverage for workers , which is to be a down payment on austerity measures and cuts in basic entitlement programs , such as Medicare , on which tens of millions of people rely .
No government measures are being proposed to create jobs .
Nothing is being done to provide relief for millions who are facing foreclosure , the cutoff of utilities , the loss of life savings and the prospect of destitution .
The administration has flatly refused to provide additional money to states and localities that are being bankrupted by the fall in tax revenues .
As a result , savage cuts are being made in education , health care and other social services across the country , and tens of thousands of public workers are being laid off .
The $ 140 billion in compensation reported by the Wall Street Journal for a section of the financial industry equals the total amount allocated in the administration ’s stimulus plan for aid to the states .
To put this sum in perspective , it is more than twice the federal outlay in 2008 for education ( $ 67 billion ) , close to three times federal spending that year for highways and mass transit ( $ 53 billion ) , and far in excess of allocations for unemployment benefits ( $ 37 billion ) ; community and regional development ( $ 27 billion ) ; general science , space and technology ( $ 27 billion ) ; training , employment and social services ( $ 26 billion ) and housing and commerce ( $ 7.4 billion ) .
The total federal outlay for homeless assistance programs in 2008 was $ 2.4 billion .
This $ 140 billion is greater than the gross domestic product of Egypt , a country of 82 million people , slightly less than the GDP of the Philippines ( population — 96 million ) and nearly three times the GDP of Ecuador ( 14 million ) .
This colossal squandering of resources is rooted neither in psychology nor the “ culture ” of Wall Street , but rather in the capitalist system itself .
The profit system subordinates all social needs to the accumulation of personal wealth by the narrow stratum that owns and controls the means of production , dominated by finance capital — the most parasitic and predatory section of the ruling elite .
The social disaster threatening the working class can be reversed only on the basis of a struggle for socialism , in which the productive forces created by the working class are taken out of private hands and developed under democratic control for the benefit of society as a whole .
The working class must break the stranglehold of the financial aristocracy .
The ill - gotten gains of the CEOs and financiers must be expropriated , without compensation , and these funds , which add up to trillions of dollars , used to meet the needs of working people for jobs , housing , education and health care , and to rebuild the crumbling social infrastructure .
The books and business dealings of the big banks must be opened to public scrutiny , with criminal investigations undertaken into their illegal practices .
This requires the building of a mass socialist movement directed against the Obama administration , the two - party system and the capitalist system which they defend .

Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain .
Every PC needs protection .
Even though the Linux operating system has a reputation for being nearly crack - proof , it is irresponsible to assume this true .
Any operating system connected to a network is vulnerable in some way or other and having as much protection as you can is the only way to use a computer intelligently .
Now with the Linux operating system you have a lot of choices for protection .
But one of the easiest to use is Firestarter .
Firestarter is one of the easiest - to - use firewalls I have used .
And with this simplicity does not come a sacrifice to security .
Just because it 's easy does not mean it lacks protection .
Firestarter is powerful and has a ton of features .
In this article you will learn how to install Firestarter and set up a basic desktop firewall .
Feature highlights
Firestarter includes such features as :
Setup wizard .
Real time event viewer .
Easy port forwarding .
ICMP parameter tuning .
Advanced kernel tuning .
Suitable for desktops , servers , and gateways .
and much , much more .
Installation
The installation of Firestarter is simple .
Because it will most likely be found in your distributions ' repositories you will only need to follow these steps for installation :
Open up your Add / Remove Software tool .
Search for " firestarter " ( no quotes ) .
Select Firestarter for installation .
Click Apply .
Enter your user password .
Wait for the installation to complete .
Close your Add / Remove Software utility .
Running Firestarter
You will find the Firestarter executable located in the Administration sub-menu of the System menu ( in GNOME ) .
When you first run Firestarter the wizard will open up .
The first screen is the usual Welcome screen so you can just click the Forward button .
The first screen you will have to do any configuration with is the Network Device Setup ( see Figure 1 ) .
In this screen you need to set which interface Firestarter is to listen to .
I am using a laptop so I will select my wireless device .
The next screen ( see Figure 2 ) asks if you need to use internet connection sharing to set your machine up as a gateway .
If you do you will need to first click the check box to enable it and then select an interface for the other machines to connect to .
If you need to use your machine as a DHCP server you will have to have that installed outside of Firestarter .
Once you have taken care of connection sharing ( if it is needed ) click the Forward button and you 're done .
The last screen wants to know if you want to start the firewall immediately and has you save your configuration .
While Firestarter is running you will see a small icon in your notification area that looks like a blue circle with a right - pointing triangle .
If you click on that it will open up the Firestarter main window ( see Figure 3 ) .
From this window you can Stop the firewall , lock the firewall , view the events log , edit both your inbound and outbound policies , and monitor active connections .
In order to monitor active connections expand the Active Connections listing which will list every connection made to and from your machine .
In both the Active connections section and the Events tab you can right click an entry and take action .
For instance , in the Active Connections section you can right click an entry and look up the hostname of that entry .
In the Events tab you can do more .
If you right click an entry in the Events tab you can do the following :
Allow connections from source .
Allow inbound service for everyone .
Allow inbound service for source .
Disable events from source .
Disable events on port .
Lookup hostnames .
Finally , in the Policy tab , you can right click any blank area and add a rule that will apply to a connection from a host or to a port / service .
When you go to add a rule you will only need enter the IP address ( or domain ) and then add a comment .
Final thoughts
Firestarter makes the often daunting task of creating a firewall for a Linux machine simple .
If you have ever dealt with iptables you will understand when I say this is a huge relief for desktop users who do not want to take the time to learn to use the underlying technology .
Summary Article Name Firestarter : Simple to use , powerful desktop firewall Description Now with the Linux operating system you have a lot of choices for protection .
But one of the easiest to use is Firestarter .
Firestarter is one of the easiest - to - use firewalls I have used .

WASHINGTON — Under immense pressure from the liberal wing of his caucus , the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , has told colleagues that he may include a government - run health insurance plan in a health care bill he will soon take to the Senate floor , Democratic senators said Thursday .
Mr. Reid ’s latest thinking seemed to reflect a calculated gamble that the 60 members of his caucus could be persuaded to vote for the public plan , if it included some mechanism for states to opt out .
His decision was shaped , in part , by opinion polls showing public support for a government insurance plan , which would compete with private insurers .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said again Thursday that the House would definitely include a public option in its version of the legislation .
At a meeting at the White House on Thursday , Mr. Reid informed President Obama of his inclination to add the public option to the bill , but did not specifically ask the president to endorse that approach , a Democratic aide said .
Mr. Obama asked questions , but did not express a preference at the meeting , which was called on short notice by the White House .
Just six weeks ago the public option appeared to be dying , under fierce attack by the insurance industry .
A clear majority of Democratic senators favor a government - run plan .
But public statements by other senators indicate that the proposal does not have the 60 votes ordinarily needed to secure Senate approval for hotly contested legislation .
Democratic champions of the public plan , like Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York , have urged Mr. Reid to take an aggressive posture , by putting the public plan in the bill and forcing opponents to try to strip it out .
“ There is a growing sense that we need to lead on this issue and not wait for it to be offered on the Senate floor , ” a senior Democratic aide said .
“ The idea is that it ’s better to show some fight . ”

DEERFIELD BEACH , Fla . -
Five teenagers were charged with aggravated battery yesterday for dousing a 15 - year - old with rubbing alcohol and setting him on fire because he stopped someone from stealing his father ’s bicycle , authorities said .
Michael Brewer was hospitalized with burns on more than three - quarters of his body after the attack at a Deerfield Beach apartment complex Monday .
The Broward County sheriff ’s office said in a news release that 15 - year - olds Matthew Bent , Denver Jarvis , Steven Shelton , and Jesus Mendez , and 13 - year - old Jeremy Jarvis were charged with aggravated battery .
Mendez was also charged with attempted second - degree murder because authorities say he flicked the lighter .
The victim ’s brother - in - law , Danny Martinez , told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that Brewer is in serious condition but doing OK .
He was burned on his torso and arms , sheriff ’s spokesman Jim Leljedal said .
Family members said most of his hair , including his eyelashes , had also been burned off .
He refused to attend classes at Deerfield Beach Middle School on Monday because of the bicycle incident Sunday , authorities said .
Instead of going to school , Brewer went to the apartment complex to visit a friend .
He told deputies that while he was sitting by the swimming pool , he was splashed with a flammable liquid and set ablaze .
A neighbor heard his screams for help and put out the flames with a fire extinguisher , said Malissa Durkee , Brewer ’s sister .
The teen then ripped off his shirt and jumped into the pool .
Brewer is expected to remain hospitalized for five months , Martinez said .
Bent and the Jarvis brothers were in court yesterday and were ordered held in a juvenile detention center for 21 days .
The Sun Sentinel reported that attorney Stephen Melnick said Jeremy Jarvis was “ just there .
He was not accused of actually doing it . ’’

'' It is unlikely that the gas was present above trace levels in the atmosphere of the Earth during the first two billion years of the planet 's history , but when oxygenic photosynthesis first arose on the Earth is not known with certainty . ''
The Union Leader is reporting that in the name of the children , Keene police and prosecutors plan to make arrests in Keene ’s Central Square , a piece of “ public ” property .
Will tomorrow ’s Pumpkin Fest event be a tragedy of the commons ?
“ Public ” property is allegedly owned by everyone , which also means it ’s owned by no one .
While ideally all property should be owned , as long as the concept of “ public ” property exists , any peaceful individuals should be allowed there .
Because of the children though , Keene ’s armed gang has decided that smokers of cannabis will be kidnapped while smokers of tobacco will be left alone .
Sure , this is completely arbitrary , but that ’s how they roll .
What will happen tomorrow afternoon at 4:20 pm is anyone ’s guess .
Remember , no one is in charge .
Will the tokers stay away that one day ?
Will they show up and be arrested ?
( If they are arrested , will they take jail time and cost the gang , or will they pay the gang ? )
Are the cops bluffing ?
If both sides show up , how many will there be ?
“ What about the children ? ”
Why not tell your kids the truth about cannabis ?
You do know the truth , right ?
Child : “ What are those people doing over there ? ” ( Points to people standing in a circle , passing a joint . )
Parent : “ Well , those are cannabis users .
They are altering their state of conciousness .
It ’s a time - honored tradition and a very social occasion .
Many people look down on them for it , but that ’s because they ’ve been lied to about what cannabis is . ”
Child : “ What is it ? ”
Parent : “ It ’s a plant with special properties .
For some people it helps them cope with illness , for others it makes them feel different than they normally do . ”
Child : “ You said before that smoking is bad ”
Parent : “ It ’s true that smoking is a poor way to deliver a chemical , but there are better , healthier ways to consume cannabis . ”
Child : “ What are those policemen doing to them ? ” ( Points in alarm at police handcuffing the peaceful smokers . )
Parent : “ They are arresting them because they ’ve been lied to about cannabis .
They think it ’s okay to kidnap people who use or sell it . ”
Child : “ Is it OK ? ”
Parent : “ No way – it ’s never appropriate to kidnap someone who has n’t hurt anyone .
Many cannabis users are upstanding members of society , but they are frightened of being hurt and put in a cage .
So they hide their use of it .
Can you imagine what it would be like if your mom / dad and I were taken away and could n’t take care of you guys ? ”
Child : “ That would be awful ! ”
Parent : “ You ’re right .
They call it the “ Drug War ” , but it ’s really a war against our family and friends . ”
Here ’s the Union Leader article about the crackdown , thanks to Melanie Plenda :
Thousands of lighted , frightful - looking jack - o- lanterns will be crowding Central Square and Main Street tomorrow .
Police are worried about something else that may be lit up .
For more than a month , dozens of people have gathered daily at Central Square to light marijuana joints and pipes at 4:20 p.m. to protest drug laws .
They do so at the spot where organizers of the Keene Pumpkin Festival locate their signature tower of pumpkins , which casts a goblin - like glow over the entire festival .
Up until now , police have held off on making any drug arrests during the smoke - ins .
But an estimated 40,000 people , many of them children , are expected for tomorrow ’s event , which earns the quiet Monadnock Regional city its 15 minutes of nationwide fame .
So what will happen if the smell of a pot party wafts over tables of pumpkin treats and hot apple cider ?
Lt. Steve Russo said police have discussed how they will respond , but he would not divulge details .
“ We would n’t want ( plans ) in print , ” he said .
“ But we ’ve considered the issue ; it ’s been discussed with staff and prosecutors . ”
Russo said police talked with prosecutors in the event there are arrests .
“ If there are arrests , then you want to make sure that everyone is on the same page for the initial arrest , post arrest and for the investigation and eventual prosecution , ” he said .
County Attorney Peter
Heed said his office has been talking with police .
“ They obviously are aware of the potential of whatever could happen , ” Heed said .
“ Anytime you have a lot of people in one place and then the potential for pot protester or other protesters there are lots of things that could happen . . .
Anytime you have a big crowd you look at all the eventualities . ”
Heed said that in past years there have been problems with parties and drinking , which the police have been able to handle .
Suzanne Woodward , director of Center Stage , the nonprofit putting on the Pumpkin Festival , said she ’s not worried about protesters affecting the festival .
“ If they try to protest in the square they wo n’t be able to because it will be filled up with pumpkins , ” Woodward said .
“ I mean , they may try to integrate into the crowd , and there ’s nothing we can do about that .
But it will be completely filled . ”
Rich Paul , one of the regular 4:20 protesters who apparently started the rallies , did not immediately return a call for comment .
Russo said police are n’t sure if protesters will even show up .
“ I would just hope that they would realize that this is a family event , there will be people with their kids out there , ” Russo said .
“ I would just hope they would show some respect to that .
Whatever their beliefs are , they need to respect the fact that there are people out there who have other beliefs .
And like a lot of small towns , people are getting unhappy with what ( the protesters ) have been doing . ”
and no it's not the fanta fanta do n't you wanted to fanta fanta .
It go something 3 beat 5 beat 5 beat 5 beat ?
ANYONE KNOW !
One more muffin recipe in this unplanned muffin mini-marathon .
These are a bit sweeter than the other muffins I 've posted , so are more suitable as in - between - meal snacks perhaps , or even at home for teatime .
They are still not overly sweet though , and are featherly light and fragrant .
Flecked throughout with fine tea leaves , they sort of taste like an Earl Grey milk tea in muffin form .
You can see the tea when you split one open .
Since each mini -muffin is only 60 calories ( 120 for regular sized ones ) , consider carrying these along instead of succumbing to a donut or pastry .
Recipe : Earl Grey Tea Muffins

1 1/3 cups buttermilk ( or 1 1/3 regular low - fat milk + 1 Tbs. vinegar )
Plus :
1 tsp. or 1 teabag fine Earl Grey tea leaves .
If your tea leaves are on the coarse side , grind them up a bit in a mortar and pestle , or just crumble them up by rubbing the leaves between your fingers .
Again , the procedure is almost identical to the corn muffins !
Muffins are so easy .
Preheat the oven to 180 °C / 360 °F .
Grease or spray non -stick spray onto your muffin tins if needed .
Mix or sift together the dry ingredients .
Beat together the wet ingredients until blended .
Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients , using a spatula .
Do n’t overmix .
Add the tea leaves .
Spoon the batter into the muffin tins evenly .
Bake for about 20 minutes for mini-muffins , 25 - 30 for regular size muffins , until the tops are browned and a skewer stuck through a middle muffin comes out clean .
Note : these muffins will puff up quite a bit .
Take out of the muffin tins and cool on a rack - that is , if you can resist eating them hot , since these smell so good !
If freezing , put them in the freezer well wrapped as soon as they are at room temperature .
Notes
Sucanat is a fine grain raw cane sugar .
You can find it at health food stores .
It ’s expensive , but I find I need less of it than regular sugar since it has a lot of flavor .
If you ca n’t get it , use one of the suggested substitutions .
( Repeated from the corn muffins page ) .
Try using different kinds of tea leaves .
So far , I 've tried some Bitter Orange from Fortnum and Mason , and Apple from Fauchon , as well as Mariage Frères Darjeeling ( I'm a bit of a tea - nut ) .
I have to say that Earl Grey is still my favorite - the bergamot really comes through quite strongly .
I 've gotten the best results using a sort of generic brand tea bag I got in England the last time I was there with very fine leaves .
A pairing of tea brewed with the same tea leaves you used for the muffins is nice .
These match very nicely with jam .
We 've had a week of sex scandals in schools .
Now Terence Kealey , vice - chancellor of Buckingham University , seems intent on stirring things up on the academic front .
Female students , he declares , are a perk of the job for male university lecturers – though they should look , not touch .
In an article for the Times Higher Education magazine on lust , part of a feature on the seven deadly sins of universities , Kealey wrote : " Normal girls – more interested in abs than in labs , more interested in pecs than specs , more interested in triceps than tripos – will abjure their lecturers for the company of their peers , but nonetheless , most male lecturers know that , most years , there will be a girl in class who flashes her admiration and who asks for advice on her essays .
What to do ?
" Enjoy her !
She 's a perk . "
Flashing a few literary allusions , he continued : " She does n't yet know that you are only Casaubon to her Dorothea , Howard Kirk to her Felicity Phee , and she will flaunt you her curves .
Which you should admire daily to spice up your sex , nightly , with the wife . "
Displaying a more surprising familiarity with the etiquette at lapdancing clubs , Kealey added : " As in Stringfellows , you should look but not touch . "
The magazine 's academic readers were outraged , including otototototoi who wrote : " I 'm amazed that Terence K has a position in any university , and I 'll be damn sure never to apply for a job at Buckingham .
Why did the THE print this awful , ugly nonsense ? "
Kealey , who has been vice - chancellor at Buckingham , the country 's only independent university , for eight years , said it was a myth that an affair between student and lecturer was an abuse of power , saying accountability has meant that " the days are gone when a scholar could trade sex for upgrades " .
But he added that some female students still fantasised about their lecturers .
Kealey 's comments were attacked by Olivia Bailey , women 's officer at the National Union of Students .
She told the Telegraph : " I am appalled that a university vice - chancellor should display such an astounding lack of respect for women .
" Regardless of whether this was an attempt at humour , it is completely unacceptable for someone in Terence Kealey 's position to compare a lecture theatre to a lapdancing club , and I expect that many women studying at Buckingham University will be feeling extremely angry and insulted at these comments . "
Should Kealey be allowed to have his fun ?
Or has he badly misjudged how students and staff feel about this issue ?
You must n't mention God ... council bans church from putting up notices about its meetings
A Christian campaign group has been banned from pinning up notices about its meetings in libraries or community centres .
The activists were told their posters advertising talks about climate change could not be shown in public because they mentioned Christianity and God .
Officials declared that the flyers for a talk on ' climate change is a Christian issue ' and and another by a spokesman for the Christian Ecology Link were in conflict with town hall policy against the promotion of religious ideas .
Ban : Campaigners from the Roman Catholic Our Lady of Christians parish church in Camden were told their posters conflicted with council policy
The ban in Camden in North London bemused campaigners from the Roman Catholic Our Lady Help of Christians parish church - not least because they were told they could display posters advertising green rallies so long as they did not refer to God .
There was also confusion among the greens that while borough officials insist they cannot lend a hand to a Christian group , it provides for inquirers details of no fewer than 13 mosques , Muslim study groups , and Islamic social groups .
It is currently advertising for a £ 32,714 - a- year youth worker to engage with ' especially Muslim teenagers ' and the borough 's website publishes the news that ' Camden council raises awareness of Islam ' , complete with assurances from a former leader that 'we work hard to spread a true picture of Islam and the Muslim faith . '
The rejection of flyers by local Christian group at libraries and community centres in Camden follows a growing number of incidents of official disapproval of Christians and Christianity .
They range from the refusal by some local authorities to allow any recognition of Christmas through attempts by police forces to silence activists and authors who oppose the gay rights lobby , to disciplinary action by schools and hospitals against teachers who make their Christianity public or nurses who offer to pray with patients .
Jo Siedlecka is organising the climate change meetings for the Our Lady parish .
They are part of a national push by church leaders who want to publicise their fears over the greenhouse effect which involves Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams and Anglican Bishop of London Dr Richard Chartres as well as Roman Catholic clergy .
' I went to the local library with the posters , ' Miss Siedlecka said .
' This time last year we had a green fair and lots of the councillors came , along with our local MP Frank Dobson .
' We had a good deal of support from Camden council who had stalls promoting recycling and compost and so on .
I do n't understand why they they wo n't allow us to put up our posters this year . '
Miss Siedlecka said she asked her local library to use its distribution service to put up flyers throughout the borough giving notice of the talks .
' A lady in a yashmak , a Muslim lady , told me that they could not advocate religions and that they could not promote religious ideas .
' Then I spoke to officials at the town hall who told me again that they could not promote a religion .
They said they would be very happy if it was green , but it could not be Christian . '
She added : ' This is bizarre .
This is annoying .'
Christian pressure groups called for an immediate rethink from borough leaders .
Mike Judge of the Christian Institute said : ' This is another case of Christians being told to go to the back of the class .
' It is prejudice against Christianily .
Christians run huge numbers of community projects and they pay council taxes .
' They are not promoting their religion at the expense of anyone else and they are entitled to put their posters up .
It is time Camden got a grip . '
The London borough , where the Liberal Democrats are the biggest party and provide the council with its leader Ken Moffitt , told a Roman Catholic news agency : ' We are happy to put up posters supporting green issues but council policy does not allow the promotion of religion . '
Officials declined to comment to the Daily Mail .
I am a student of history .
Professionally , I have written 15 books on history that have been published in six languages , and I have studied history all my life .
I have come to think there is something monumentally large afoot , and I do not believe it is simply a banking crisis , or a mortgage crisis , or a credit crisis .
Yes these exist , but they are merely single facets on a very large gemstone that is only now coming into a sharper focus .
Something of historic proportions is happening .
I can sense it because I know how it feels , smells , what it looks like , and how people react to it .
Yes , a perfect storm may be brewing , but there is something happening within our country that has been evolving for about ten to fifteen years .
The pace has dramatically quickened in the past two .
We demand and then codify into law the requirement that our banks make massive loans to people we know they can never pay back ?
Why ?
We learned just days ago that the Federal Reserve , which has little or no real oversight by anyone , has " loaned " two trillion dollars ( that is $ 2,000,000,000,000 ) over the past few months , but will not tell us to whom or why or disclose the terms .
That is our money .
Yours and mine .
And that is three times the $ 700 billion we all argued about so strenuously just this past September .
Who has this money ?
Why do they have it ?
Why are the terms unavailable to us ?
Who asked for it ?
Who authorized it ?
I thought this was a government of " we the people , " who loaned our powers to our elected leaders .
Apparently not .
We have spent two or more decades intentionally de-industrializing our economy ..
Why ?
We have intentionally dumbed down our schools , ignored our history , and no longer teach our founding documents , why we are exceptional , and why we are worth preserving .
Students by and large cannot write , think critically , read , or articulate .
Parents are not revolting , teachers are not picketing , school boards continue to back mediocrity .
Why ?
We have now established the precedent of protesting every close election ( violently inCalifornia over a proposition that is so controversial that it simply wants marriage to remain defined as between one man and one woman .
Did you ever think such a thing possible just a decade ago ? )
We have corrupted our sacred political process by allowing unelected judges to write laws that radically change our way of life , and then mainstream Marxist groups like ACORN and others to turn our voting system into a banana republic .
To what purpose ?
Now our mortgage industry is collapsing , housing prices are in free fall , major industries are failing , our banking system is on the verge of collapse , social security is nearly bankrupt , as is Medicare and our entire government .
Our education system is worse than a joke ( I teach college and I know precisely what I am talking about ) - the list is staggering in its length , breadth , and depth ..
It is potentially 1929 x ten ... And we are at war with an enemy we cannot even name for fear of offending people of the same religion , who , in turn , cannot wait to slit the throats of your children if they have the opportunity to do so .
And finally , we have elected a man that no one really knows anything about , who has never run so much as a Dairy Queen , let alone a town as big as Wasilla , Alaska ..
All of his associations and alliances are with real radicals in their chosen fields of employment , and everything we learn about him , drip by drip , is unsettling if not downright scary ( Surely you have heard him speak about his idea to create and fund a mandatory civilian defense force stronger than our military for use inside our borders ?
No ?
Oh , of course .
The media would never play that for you over and over and then demand he answer it .
Sarah Palin 's pregnant daughter and $ 150,000 wardrobe are more important . )
Mr. Obama 's winning platform can be boiled down to one word : Change .
Why ?
I have never been so afraid for my country and for my children as I am now .
This man campaigned on bringing people together , something he has never , ever done in his professional life .
In my assessment , Obama will divide us along philosophical lines , push us apart , and then try to realign the pieces into a new and different power structure .
Change is indeed coming .
And when it comes , you will never see the same nation again .
And that is only the beginning ..
As a serious student of history , I thought I would never come to experience what the ordinary , moral German must have felt in the mid-1930s
In those times , the " savior " was a former smooth - talking rabble - rouser from the streets , about whom the average German knew next to nothing .
What they should have known was that he was associated with groups that shouted , shoved , and pushed around people with whom they disagreed ; he edged his way onto the political stage through great oratory .
Conservative " losers " read it right now .
And there were the promises .
Economic times were tough , people were losing jobs , and he was a great speaker .
And he smiled and frowned and waved a lot .
And people , even newspapers , were afraid to speak out for fear that his " brown shirts " would bully and beat them into submission .
Which they did - regularly .
And then , he was duly elected to office , while a full - throttled economic crisis bloomed at hand - the Great Depression .
Slowly , but surely he seized the controls of government power , person by person , department by department , bureaucracy by bureaucracy .
The children of German citizens were at first , encouraged to join a Youth Movement in his name where they were taught exactly what to think .
Later , they were required to do so .
No Jews of course , How did he get people on his side ?
He did it by promising jobs to the jobless , money to the money - less , and rewards for the military - industrial complex .
He did it by indoctrinating the children , advocating gun control , health care for all , better wages , better jobs , and promising to re-instill pride once again in the country , across Europe , and across the world .
He did it with a compliant media - did you know that ?
And he did this all in the name of justice and .... . .. change .
And the people surely got what they voted for .
If you think I am exaggerating , look it up .
It 's all there in the history books .
So read your history books .
Many people of conscience objected in 1933 and were shouted down , called names , laughed at , and ridiculed .
When Winston Churchill pointed out the obvious in the late 1930s while seated in the House of Lords in England ( he was not yet Prime Minister ) , he was booed into his seat and called a crazy troublemaker .
He was right , though .
And the world came to regret that he was not listened to .
Do not forget that Germany was the most educated , the most cultured country in Europe .
It was full of music , art , museums , hospitals , laboratories , and universities .
And yet , in less than six years ( a shorter time span than just two terms of the U. S. presidency ) it was rounding up its own citizens , killing others , abrogating its laws , turning children against parents , and neighbors against neighbors ..
All with the best of intentions , of course .
The road to Hell is paved with them .
As a practical thinker , one not overly prone to emotional decisions , I have a choice : I can either believe what the objective pieces of evidence tell me ( even if they make me cringe with disgust ) ; I can believe what history is shouting to me from across the chasm of seven decades ; or I can hope I am wrong by closing my eyes , having another latte , and ignoring what is transpiring around me ..
I choose to believe the evidence .
No doubt some people will scoff at me , others laugh , or think I am foolish , naive , or both .
To some degree , perhaps I am .
But I have never been afraid to look people in the eye and tell them exactly what I believe - and why I believe it .
I pray I am wrong .
I do not think I am .
Perhaps the only hope is our vote in the next elections .
Public demonstrations have become more common since June 's disputed election

BBC News , Washington
In an apparent shift from the Bush administration 's efforts to foster regime change in Iran by financing opposition groups , the Obama White House has all but dismantled the Iran Democracy Fund .
While the move has been criticised by neo-conservatives in the US , it has been welcomed by Iranian human rights and pro-democracy activists .
The controversial program was initiated by the Bush administration in an effort to topple the clerical regime in Tehran by financing Iranian NGOs .
While heralded by some in Washington , reactions in Iran to the program were overwhelmingly negative .
US funds are going to people who have very little to do with the real struggle for democracy in Iran and our civil society activists never received such funds
Abdolfattah Soltani
Iranian human rights activist Critics like Iranian dissident and journalist Akbar Ganji have maintained that the program made virtually all Iranian NGOs targets of the hardline government in Iran : " The US democracy fund was severely counterproductive .
None of the human right activists and members of opposition in Iran had any interest in using such funds , but we were all accused by Iran 's government of being American spies because a few groups in America used these funds . "
The secretiveness around the program - the recipients of the funds remain classified - has added to the dilemma , Iranian human rights groups maintain .
They say it has enabled the Iranian authorities to accuse any Iranian NGO of having received funds from the US government .
Human rights abuses Abdolfattah Soltani is a well - known Iranian human rights lawyer , and spokesman for the Defenders of Human Rights Center , which was founded by the Nobel Peace Prize - winner Shirin Ebadi .
It is disturbing that the State Department would cut off funding at precisely the moment when these brave investigations are needed most
U Senator Joe Lieberman
He welcomes the change in policy : " These US funds are going to people who have very little to do with the real struggle for democracy in Iran and our civil society activists never received such funds .
The end to this program will have no impact on our activities whatsoever . "
Critics of the Obama administration have accused him of cutting much needed funds for human rights activists at a time when the Iranian government 's human rights abuses have sharply increased .
The director of one benefactor of the Iran Democracy Fund , the US - based Iranian Human Rights Documentation Center , told the Boston Globe that they never expected their funding to be cut under these circumstances .
Senator Joe Lieberman said in a statement : " It is disturbing that the State Department would cut off funding at precisely the moment when these brave investigations are needed most . ''
' National security threat '
Human rights defenders in Iran , however , point to the Iranian Human Rights Documentation Center 's activities as an example of exactly why the fund should be cut .
In 2005 , the centre organised a seminar in Dubai .
Though it was advertised as a human rights seminar , participants tell the BBC that they soon realised that the aim was to train Iranian human rights defenders on how to overthrow the Iranian regime through non-violent means .
Several of the participants were subsequently arrested and jailed in Iran .
Today , they bitterly complain that the Human Rights Documentation Center knowingly put them under immense risk by luring them to Dubai - a hub for Iranian intelligence services - under false pretences .
The episode is believed to have focused the attention of the Iranian regime on NGOs and political activists .
The authorities began to regard them a as a potential national security threat , prompting a severe crackdown on Iranian civil society .

9/11 Family Members , and Survivor File for Re-validation of Citizens ’ Signatures with New York State Supreme Court , following rejection of NYC CAN petition by the City Clerk and Board of Elections
NYC CAN News Bulletin -- July 31 , 2009 -- PLEASE FORWARD WIDELY
New York City– On Wednesday , several 9/11 victim family members and a survivor took the first step in challenging the City Clerk ’s rejection of the NYC CAN petition for a new investigation in New York City .
The group filed a Verified Petition / Order to Show Cause with the Supreme Court of the State of New York requesting a review of Board of Election documentation and a ‘ special referee ’ appointed to re-validate the over 52,000 signatures filed by NYC CAN on June 24th .
The NYC CAN petition was rejected by the City Clerk on Friday , July 24th , a week ago , certifying less than the minimum of 30,000 qualified signatures of electors .
This benchmark , according to the Clerk ’s office was not met .
A ‘ qualified elector ’ is a registered New York City voter who was eligible to vote in the last election .
According to the letter sent by the Clerk to the City Council , the NY Board of Elections validated 26,003 signatures and invalidated 24,664 , leaving 1,333 that were not certified .
At a hearing scheduled for Monday , August 3rd , before a Supreme Court Justice , the plaintiffs , representing tens of thousands of concerned New Yorkers who support a new 9/11 investigation , will formally raise their request for an independent review of the Board of Elections findings .
If granted by the presiding Justice , a re-validation of the petition signatures by an independent special referee will follow .
In addition to the requirement to reach the threshold of 30,000 qualified electors , the petition itself must comply with New York Municipal Home Rule Law and relevant Election Laws .
The City Clerk maintains the Petition fell short in several areas but it should be emphasized that this is the legal opinion of the Corporation Counsel , the City of New York ’s top lawyer , and will be challenged in court by lawyers for the five plaintiffs .
Legal advisers to the plaintiffs believe that the legal objections raised by the Corporation Counsel are specious and should be set aside , however considering the political implications and official opposition to the proposed Commission , obtaining approval for placing the referendum question on the ballet itself will be fraught with difficulty and challenge each step of the way .
The fact is historically in New York City ballot initiatives have not been successful .
The last two were denied by the City Clerk .
In both cases the petitioners filed a suit and ultimately lost and thus NYC CAN anticipated the response of the Clerk .
And though the odds are stacked against us , we are committed to take the next steps available to us .
Regardless of the outcome , the court case will serve to amplify the demand for a new 9/11 investigation and with lessons learned , should serve to strengthen the ability of the people to petition their government for meaningful referendums in the future .

More than 59,000 people in the UK were victims of identify fraud in the past year , research has revealed .
This represents an increase of 36 % on the same period in 2008 , according to research by UK fraud prevention service CIFAS .
The report , released today to mark the start of National Identity Fraud Prevention Week , also shows account takeovers have increased 23 % in the past year .
More than 50 % of account takeovers have targeted victims ' credit and debit card accounts , the research showed .
This demonstrates that identity fraud is becoming more prevalent and that knowledge about it and how to prevent it is not as widespread as it should be , the report said .
Peter Hurst , chief executive of CIFAS , said fraud is an insidious crime that affects consumers and businesses financially as well as in terms of reputation and trust .
" In partnership with other industry participants , this report lays bare the facts .
It is only through such collaboration that the continued fight against fraud can be won , " he said .
Fraud prevention a shared responsibility and must also become a shared duty across both private and public sectors , said Hurst .
The research showed 64 % of people still throw sensitive documents away without shredding them and 12 % used the internet without having any security software .
Only 21 % of people regularly check their credit report and 55 % do not check on expected document to ensure they have not been intercepted by fraudsters .
National Identity Fraud Prevention
Week is supported by CIFAS , the Metropolitan Police , National Fraud Authority , the Home Office 's Identity and Passport Service , and a number of business groups and the credit reference agencies .

Ares 1 - X : Work on the " program of record " continues Experts asked to review the US human spaceflight programme have given strong support to the use of commercial services to launch astronauts .
The Augustine panel published its final report on Thursday and said America could find cheaper , faster successors to the shuttle in the private sector .
The US space agency is developing two new rockets and a crew capsule .
But the committee has told President Barack Obama that these systems no longer meet the US 's immediate needs .
Speaking at a press conference in Washington DC , lead members of the panel said that if crew transport services to the International Space Station were passed to the private sector , it would free Nasa to work on more difficult and more exciting objectives .
" We think this is a time to create a market for commercial firms to transport both cargo and humans between the Earth and low - Earth orbit , " said Norm Augustine , the panel chairman and a former CEO of Lockheed Martin .
" While that is certainly not simple , it is much easier than going to Mars .
We think Nasa would be better served to spend its money and its ability - which is immense - focusing on going beyond low - Earth orbit rather than running a trucking service to low - Earth orbit ( LEO ) . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Favoured solutions
The panel published its summary findings in September .
The full report adds considerable detail .
It will be used by President Obama , his chief scientist Dr John Holdren , and the new Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden , as they seek to put the agency on a sustainable future course .
Nasa - watchers have long complained that the organisation is being asked to do too much on insufficient funds ; and the Augustine panel has determined that only an additional $ 3bn annually will see America carry out meaningful space exploration beyond low - Earth orbit .
Nasa is currently working to produce two new rockets - known as Ares 1 and 5 - and a new crewship called Orion .
These are intended to replace the shuttle but have the capability also to take astronauts back to the Moon .
Nasa is developing the Orion ship to be immensely capable However , the Augustine panel said this " program of record " , although well managed and technically competent , no longer fitted to the timescales over which it was needed and to the budgets it had been given .
The committee cited what it saw as the paradox of Ares 1 and Orion entering into service in 2017 , which , on current plans , was a year after the termination of the space station .
And because no lunar - landing capability would be ready by then , the Orion spaceship would have nowhere to go .
But if the space station 's life was extended ( which the panel supported ) , the diverted funds would only further delay Ares 1 and Orion .
The panel said it had provided Mr Obama with " options or alternatives " not " recommendations " , but it was clear from the Washington press conference that the committee had favoured paths for the president to pursue .
These included asking Nasa to oversee the development of a less sophisticated capsule than Orion that could possibly be launched on an existing , but upgraded , rocket .
This course could see crew transport services enter into service in 2015 that cost the taxpayer some $ 5 bn to develop .
This sum would be about the same as , or slightly less than , developing Ares 1 but the ongoing costs to Nasa for missions to LEO would be much more favourable .
' New model ' Panel member and MIT engineering Professor Ed Crawley said : " You can interpret the report as saying that we 're suggesting in this option a new way of doing business , a new form of partnership where Nasa is the anchor customer for this service , [ where Nasa ] would have to significantly incentivise its development because of the return on investment expected by any commercial investor , and [ where Nasa ] would continue to play an important role as the quality assurance and mission assurance agency for it . "
Professor Crawley added that if the taxpayer carried some of the capital risk of development , commercial players could then make a profit by selling crew transport services to other nations and perhaps to space tourists .
A return to the lunar surface by astronauts may be many years away The approach , Professor Crawley and Mr Augustine explained , would enable the agency to concentrate on developing a heavy - lift rocket and a high - specification crew - capsule for use beyond low - Earth orbit , but on a timescale that matched the available budget .
The two men championed what they termed a " flexible path " which had the eventual goal of putting people on Mars .
Under this scenario , Nasa would use technologies and equipments when they became available to visit progressively more interesting and more challenging targets .
These might include missions to asteroids , a sweep around Mars or even a landing on one of the Red Planet 's little moons .
" What this flexible path does is allow us to take some of the components that you would build anyway - the heavy booster and the capsule - and start exploring while we 're building the lunar landing system and the lunar surface system , so that when they become available it's time to go to the Moon , " Professor Crawley said .
" In the report , it shows we can leave low - Earth orbit in those scenarios in the early to mid-2020s . "
Nasa moved a test version of its
Ares 1 rocket to the launch pad on Tuesday in preparation for a demonstration flight next week .
Mr Augustine and Professor Crawley said they still supported the launch .
The flight should provide data that is valuable to engineers no matter which rocket programme Nasa eventually follows .
President Obama is expected to give his response to the Augustine committee report in the coming weeks .

I 've blogged before about London 's Junky Styling , a clothing boutique that features original one - of - a - kind clothes made from hacking together thrift - store finds , salvaged textiles , and whatever happens to be lying around .
They made my favorite winter coat , my best suit jacket , and my wife 's wedding dress ( stitched together from Alice - blue men 's work - shirts ! ) .
I just received a review copy of Junky Styling : Wardrobe Surgery , a book written by Junky 's co-founders , Annika Sanders and Kerry Seager .
The first half of the book is given over to Junky 's improbable history , a business started by two young women who knew so little about tailoring that they could n't produce patterns for their clothes , which meant that each piece they finished was one - of - a- kind .
They 're naturals , though , and have thrived in the Truman Brewery off Brick Lane in East London .
This section is lavishly illustrated with photos of their clothes over the years .
The second section is a detailed HOWTO for recreating several of their basic garments : a suit - sleeve scarf , a " shirt wrap halter top , " a " fly top " and others , with copious notes about shopping for clothes to rescue and repurpose , instructions for unpicking seams , a glossary of textile types and strategies for working with each and so on .
Junky 's tailors are makers , who dive in headfirst , make lots of mistakes quickly , learn and iterate and improve and surprise , and the book and clothes are infused with that heartening spirit .
Makes me want to buy a sewing machine !

What is this anyway ?
Parodied airline safety cards !
During my college days back in '99 I was on a flight somewhere when I realized that the safety instructions in front of me had no captions .
I thought to myself , " why is that guy 's life jacket dispensing red licorice ? ! "
So I decided to add some captions to the emergency evacuation instruction placards that everyone who flies the friendly skies is familiar with .
I showed them to my pals , and they loved them !
I hope you do too !

As technology evolves to meet the demands of our dreams , more and more wondrous feats of engineering will transform our world ; and us with it .
These 7 amazing engineering wonders push the envelope of what can be accomplished on Earth – and someday , beyond .
Dubai ’s World Islands
( images via : Homes Dubai and Ursi Paltenstein )
Following on the successful completion of other offshore artificial island communities like the Palm Islands , Dubai ’s World Islands was intended to be even more ambitious , not to mention larger .
Imagine owning a private island in the shape of a country or continent , surrounded by the warm waters of the Persian Gulf – and your equally “ worldly ” neighbors ?
( images via : ESA and Amazing Dubai Islands )
While Dubai ’s vision of a 300 - island floating world may someday come to fruition , things are n’t so rosy at the moment thanks to the ongoing world economic crisis .
As of late summer 2009 only a single island has been developed and it belongs to Dubai ’s ruling Sheik ; “ the rest looks like a pile of muck ” according to a local realtor .
With property prices crashing by 50 to 75 percent , many of Dubai ’s spectacular construction projects have been put on indefinite hold if not canceled outright .
Bering Strait Bridge

A bridge across the Bering Strait connecting Russia and Alaska ?
No , this is not a repeat from 11,000BC .
OFF Architecture won the 2nd Prize in the Professional Category at the 2009 Bering Strait Project competition ( yes , there is such a thing ) with their grandiose and green bridge - tunnel combo .
The design would greatly reduce circulation between the Arctic and North Pacific Oceans , thus cooling the former and mitigating the effects of global warming .
Or so they say .

The 53 - mile wide Bering Strait is surprisingly shallow – it was a natural land bridge back in Ice Age times – so OFF Architecture ’s design would reach from just above the water ’s surface down to the ocean floor 100 to 150 feet below .
Such a design would necessitate circular “ pass throughs ” for migrating marine mammals and whales .
The thought of a whale having a panic attack inside one of the tunnels gives a whole new meaning to “ Thar she blows ! ! ”
Large Hadron Collider

The Large Hadron Collider , or LHC being built by CERN is without question the largest and most complex machine ever constructed by Man .
It has to be – the universe does n’t give up its deepest secrets very easily .
The LHC is the world ’s largest refrigerator , requiring 10,080 tons of liquid nitrogen and nearly 60 tons of liquid helium to bring the temperature of the collider ’s huge electromagnets down to - 271.3 °C ( 1.9 Kelvin ) .
Want more ?
The interior of the LHC ’s ring tunnel is the emptiest place in the entire solar system – the machine ’s particle beams will travel through an ultra - high vacuum with ten times less pressure than you ’ll find on the Moon .

Huge as it is , the LHC does n’t look too impressive from the air since the actual 17 - mile ( 27 km ) tunnel lies buried an average 330 feet ( 100 meters ) underground .
It IS big however – part of the ring is in France ; part is in Switzerland .
Since this short blurb gives only a hint of the LHC ’s workings , check out this Schoolhouse Rock style rap on the LHC from TeacherTube :
Gotthard Base Tunnel

The 95.3 - mile ( 153.5 km ) long Gotthard Base Tunnel network now being drilled out beneath the Alps , when finally completed in about ten years , will be the longest underground tunnel ever constructed .
High - speed trains traveling at 155 mph ( 250 kph ) will significantly reduce travel times between Zurich , Switzerland and Milan , Italy while at the same time relieving the bottleneck of commercial and passenger traffic now clogging existing mountain highways and train lines .
Hannibal would most definitely approve .

The most difficult portion of the tunnel is the 57 km ( 35.4 mi ) stretch that will run nearly 2,000 feet ( 600 meters ) under the Gotthard massif below the existing Gotthardbahn track .
It ’s estimated that 459 million cubic feet ( 13 million cubic meters ) of crumbly , porous rock will have to be removed during the course of tunnel construction – that ’s enough to fill the Great Pyramid of Giza five times over .
In the above image , one of the huge tunnel - boring machines is shown just as it breaks through to one of the completed sections of the tunnel .
Japan - Korea Undersea Tunnel

Though the shovels have yet to shift any dirt , the blueprints are ready for construction to begin on one of Asia ’s most momentous megaprojects : the Japan - Korea Friendship Tunnel .
Or the Korea - Japan Friendship Tunnel – the fine details are still being discussed .
Should the project get the nod from the politicos , work will begin on joining the southwestern Japanese city of Karatsu with the South Korean port of Busan with a 79 - mile ( 128 - km ) train tunnel .
The distance is more than three times that of the Anglo - French “ Chunnel ” but the technology is proven .
As for North Korea ’s take on the project , either Kim Jong
Il has n’t been told or everyone ’s scared to bring up the subject .

The challenges and difficulties involved in large - scale orbital construction projects are immense … yet someday they will be tackled as the demand for interplanetary spacecraft , space elevators and orbiting power stations becomes irresistible .
The latter – a solar power station in geostationary orbit – is now on the drawing board and has been given a sky - high price tag of 2 trillion yen ( $ 21 billion ) .
( image via : Bloomberg )
The project , conceived by the Japanese government and industry researchers , will see a space - based solar power station built in orbit 22,360 miles ( 36,000 km ) above the earth .
The station will generate 1 gigawatt of power from sunlight and beam the energy down to a receiving station where it can be used to power almost 300,000 homes .
Terraforming Mars

The most extreme engineering project in the history of the world will be performed OFF the world … on Mars .
A variety of schemes have been floated over the past few decades with the intent of making Earth ’s nearest neighbor more amenable to life of the earthly variety – in other words , Terraforming .
Naturally the scale is huge – comets may be redirected to impact the Red Planet to provide water for oceans , which would be seeded with algae in order to boost the oxygen content in the Martian atmosphere .
Other schemes entail the placement of giant orbiting mirrors to focus sunlight upon Mars ’ polar icecaps , thus releasing liquid water and gaseous carbon dioxide to kick - start a greenhouse effect .

Terraforming
Mars is no pie - in - the - sky scheme ; it could be the salvation of our species should our actions on Earth continue to reduce our home planet ’s livability .
It would be most fitting if someday , as predicted / depicted in The Million - Year Picnic , a short story from Ray Bradbury ’s book The Martian Chronicles , this scene should take place :
A father answers his children ’s desire to see Martians by suggesting they look into the canal their boat is floating on … in which they view their own reflections .

The team hope their work will pave the way to new treatments Scientists say they have decoded the entire genetic structure of HIV - 1 - the main cause of Aids in humans .
They hope this will pave the way to a greater understanding of how the virus operates , and potentially accelerate the development of drug treatments .
HIV carries its genetic information in more complicated structures than some other viruses .
The US research , published in Nature , may allow scientists the chance to look at the information buried inside .
HIV , like the viruses which cause influenza , hepatitis C and polio , carries its genetic information as single - stranded RNA rather than double - stranded DNA .
The information enclosed in DNA is encoded in a relatively simple way , but in RNA this is more complex .
We are also beginning to understand tricks the genome uses to help the virus escape detection by the human host
Ron Swanstrom
study author RNA is able to fold into intricate patterns and structures .
Therefore decoding a full genome opens up genetic information that was not previously accessible , and may hold answers to why the virus acts as it does .
The team from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said they planned to use the information to see if they could make tiny changes to the virus .
" If it does n't grow as well when you disrupt the virus with mutations , then you know you 've mutated or affected something that was important to the virus , " says Ron Swanstrom , professor of microbiology and immunology .
" We are also beginning to understand tricks the genome uses to help the virus escape detection by the human host . "
Deep inside Dr David Robertson from the University of Manchester welcomed this " definitive analysis " .
" What this may reveal is some of the functions operating at a level below protein structures , which may have all sorts of importance for the virus . "
" More generally , if we can understand these RNA structures then we can compare the systems of different viruses and gain new understanding of their role in virus biology . "
Keith Alcorn of the HIV information service NAM added : " Encouraging the virus to mutate is not a new idea , but it is one of a number of options on the table .
" How important this information will be for the development of new drugs remains to be seen , but it is a useful addition to what we know . "

Let 's get this straight : the people who will change Iran for the better are the Iranians .
The words of an American president at the UN general assembly in New York can't do that .
European talks and sanctions can't do that .
Israeli bombs on Iran 's nuclear installations certainly wo n't do that .
But the Iranian people : yes , they can .
This is what millions of Iranians set out to do , in mass demonstrations this summer ; and that is what some of them are still trying to do , despite beatings , killings , torture , rape , the continued arrest of thousands of activists , and a grotesque show trial of leading reformists .
There are acute limits to what democracies and democrats outside Iran can do to help Iran 's " green movement " directly , but the first imperative of our policy must be to do nothing that makes their struggle for peaceful change more difficult .
Be Hippocratic : first , do no harm .
President Barack Obama is right to instruct his officials to negotiate " without preconditions " on the nuclear issue .
The US should have done that long ago .
But European powers have been negotiating with Tehran for years , and it has not got us anywhere .
While stringing us along , with the negotiating tactics of the Tehran bazaar , the Islamic Republic has been spinning ever more centrifuges – bringing itself closer to the threshold where it can decide whether or not to go for a nuclear weapon .
Negotiations should continue , but for the sake of a few more slippery promises of nuclear restraint the US and Europe must not do anything that would give a jot more legitimacy to a fraudulently elected president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who celebrated last week 's " Jerusalem Day " by saying that " the pretext " for the creation of Israel – that is , the Holocaust – " is false ...
It is a lie based on an unprovable and mythical claim . "
A textbook example of what democracies should not do was provided last year by a joint venture between Siemens and Nokia , called Nokia Siemens Networks .
It sold the Iranian regime a sophisticated system with which they can monitor the internet , including emails , internet phone calls and social - networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter , much used by Iranian protesters .
In today 's politics of people power , that is the equivalent of selling a dictator tanks or poison gas .
So , to be clear : a German company , Siemens , which used slave labour during the Third Reich , sold a Holocaust - denying president the instruments with which he can persecute young Iranians risking their lives for freedom .
Think of that every time you buy something made by Siemens .
Analysts of Iran sometimes use the image of a race between two clocks : the nuclear clock and the democracy clock .
The Iranian regime has got the nuclear clock ticking faster than many in the west anticipated , despite all the negotiations and western sanctions ; but the Iranian people have now set the democracy clock going in a way most western diplomats never believed they would .
Many thousands of opposition supporters again turned out last Friday , together with the three most prominent reformist leaders still at liberty .
More protests are to be expected when the universities reopen later this week .
This is not just a bunch of angry young people with green headbands .
The Islamic regime is divided at the top , and the authority of the Supreme Leader is being questioned as never before .
Pillars of the Islamic establishment such as Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani are locked in conflict with Ahmadinejad and the revolutionary guards who have the Supreme Leader 's ear .
The phrase " democracy clock " is perhaps misleading .
Iran is not going to be a western - style liberal democracy any time soon .
( But then , nor is Afghanistan or Iraq . )
What is still possible , however , is a mix of reform and revolution – what I have called " refolution " – which strengthens the constitutional republican elements in the strange hybrid political system of the self - styled Islamic Republic , and weakens the Islamist revolutionary ones .
At the moment , the opposite is happening .
By throwing his theocratic authority behind Ahmadinejad and the revolutionary guards , Ayatollah Khamenei has tipped the scales to the Islamist revolutionary side .
The best likely outcome of a " negotiated revolution " in Iran would be a decisive tipping of the scales back in the other direction : more republican , less Islamist .
This would be a better Iran for the Iranians , but would it be a better Iran for the rest of the world ?
Sceptics say there is little evidence that Iranian reformists would be any less militantly nationalist on the nuclear issue .
A spokesman for the green movement , Mohsen Makhmalbaf , issued a statement on Tuesday saying " the Iranian green movement does not want a nuclear bomb " .
Opposition leaders could usefully be more specific : for example , accepting the idea of neutral international supervision of the fuel cycle in a civilian nuclear programme – on the clear understanding that this international regime would apply to all civil nuclear powers , including the US , and not just to Iran .
There are , I say again , severe limits to what democracies – and especially the US and Britain – can do directly to promote political change inside Iran .
All the more important to do the indirect things better .
One of these the British government has now done – funding the first - rate BBC Persian television and internet service , which in less than a year has become an indispensable , trusted source of news for Iranians .
But too direct support of the opposition from Washington or London will only give credibility to the claims which the Ahmadinejad camp and the revolutionary guards make anyway , that the reformists and green movement are tools of a plot by the Great Satan ( the US ) and the Little Satan ( Britain ) – claims that have some traction with public opinion , partly because there really was a British - American plot to topple the Iranian prime minister Mohammad Mossadeq half a century ago .
Obama may have been a shade too hands - off in his reaction to the summer protests , but it was a matter of a few degrees of calibration .
At the UN yesterday , he spoke of " the rights of people everywhere to determine their own destiny " .
Exactly so .
So we must not give any legitimacy to an illegitimate , Holocaust - denying president , for the sake of nuclear negotiations which have not yet gone anywhere .
We should not put all our money on the democracy card , but nor should we put it all on the nuclear negotiation card .
Every diplomatic move we make should be scrutinised for its possible impact on the fissile political process inside Iran .
If tighter nuclear - related sanctions can be targeted specifically to increase pressure on Ahmadinejad and the revolutionary guards , that 's a double - benefit ; if military action would strengthen hardliners , that 's another argument against military action .
It may be that in a year 's time we have to acknowledge that the refolution in Iran really has been repressed , at least for now .
In that case , we would have to deal as best we could – by negotiation , pressure and containment – with President Ahmadinejad and an Islamist revolutionary regime .
But that time is not yet .
The contest inside Iran is far from over .
Its outcome is not up to us , but at least we must do nothing that helps the wrong side win .
It was now nearly 11 p.m. , and the airport stood eerily hushed .
The wind was hurtling off the prairie , rattling the broad windows , while tendrils of snow snaked across the tarmac .
The usual gaggle of briefcase - toters and college kids filed from the gate and then , a head above the rest , came the three brothers -- Peter , Maduk and Riak -- each one long - limbed and lanky , with flashing eyes and dark African skin and wearing a quiet and unreadable expression .
( At the request of resettlement agencies , the refugees ' last names are not used here . )
They came , as most of the Lost Boys had , with hopes of furthering their education and with worries , too , having heard rumors that America was a land covered in ice and darkness and that black boys could not walk with white girls without getting shot .
Cultural orientation class had taught them a few things -- that houses would have many rooms , that women held the same jobs as men -- but like the cold , this was all still inconceivable .
The words describing America had piled up without real meaning : freedom , democracy , a safe place , a land with food enough for everyone .
Each brother wore a thin gray sweatsuit issued by the State Department , along with a pair of flimsy white canvas sneakers .
Each carried his precious immigration documents in a plastic bag .
Maduk , 17 , and Riak , 15 , appeared petrified and uncertain of what was to happen next , but Peter Dut , who is small - framed with a high forehead and a thoughtful demeanor that bespeaks the fact that he has been in charge of his family since turning 12 , stepped forward .
He pumped the hand of Michelle Irmen , a 25 - year - old caseworker from Lutheran Social Services of North Dakota , who stood smiling nervously .
As she started to usher the three boys toward a pile of winter coats and hats she had bought for them earlier that day , she realized that Peter was not following .
He was instead studying the black night and spiraling snow through the airport window , puzzled , remembering possibly what that businessman in Minneapolis said about surviving Fargo .
'' Excuse me , '' he said , worriedly eyeing the dark ice - covered plains of his new American home .
'' Can you tell me , please , is it now night or day ? ''
This is a stove burner .
this is a can opener .
This is a brush for your teeth .
The new things came in a tumble .
The brothers ' home was a sparsely furnished two - bedroom apartment in the basement of a sterile - looking complex on Fargo 's south side , for which they would pay $ 445 a month .
It had been stocked by a resettlement agency employee , primarily with donations from area churches and businesses , and the randomness reflected as much : there were two bundt pans , six tubes of toothpaste and no towels or cutting knives .
Nonetheless , it was a good start .
A loaf of white bread sat on the counter alongside a bunch of ripe bananas .
There were cans of beans , a jumbo box of Corn Flakes , tea bags , a modest collection of mismatched dishes and a gallon of whole milk in the refrigerator .
Another caseworker , an energetic and somewhat impatient Somalian man named Yusuf Ibrahim , worked the kitchen faucet for Maduk and Riak 's benefit , speaking in loud , deliberate English .
'' Hot. Cold .
On. Off .
Do you see ? ''
Maduk , whose wide - set eyes and broad cheekbones give him a sweetly soulful appearance , nodded carefully , as Riak , whose face still carries a childlike roundness , giggled behind him .
Each boy then took a turn at the sink , awkwardly shoving the faucet handle to and fro .
Back in the living room , the quick - moving Ibrahim emptied a garbage bag full of donated clothing on the couch : a couple of weathered three - piece suits and some polyester pants and short - sleeved pastel shirts .
Most of it looked to have come straight from the closet of an elderly man , one who wintered in Miami , no less .
Watching young Maduk check the size of a rumpled shirt against his spidery shoulders , I was struck by an uncomfortable feeling , one I would have more than once during my time in Fargo .
I fully understood that these boys were lucky , that there were thousands of Sudanese left behind in Kakuma -- and millions of refugees stuck in camps across the globe -- but still I could imagine , painfully , the small indignities and cultural stumbling blocks that lay ahead .
As petty as this seems , the feel - good power of American charity was lost on me the second I imagined Maduk showing up for his first day of high school dressed in government - issue white canvas boat shoes and a shirt better suited for a retiree on a cruise ship .
Someone more versed in refugee politics might point out that these kids have spent most of their lives as the beneficiaries of first - world donations , and they are obviously fortunate for it .
According to State Department estimates , the combination of war , famine and disease in southern Sudan has killed more than two million people and displaced another four million .
The Kakuma Refugee Camp has no less than eight international aid organizations operating within its fences , with the United Nations providing subsistence - level food rations for the 65,000 refugees from seven African nations currently living there .
What little clothing they have came mostly from American church drives , and as a result , the boys in Fargo had a surprisingly refined sense of what could pass for cool .
The following day , when another bag of clothes arrived at the apartment , Riak immediately pounced on a sleeveless Denver Nuggets jersey , while Maduk contented himself with a pair of ill - fitting jeans .
That the boys are accustomed to receiving aid concerns some of those who have helped provide it .
'' They 're going from an environment where you 've basically been given everything at the camp to an environment where you have to work , you have to produce , '' says Steve Redding , who directs the Kenya and southern Sudan programs of International Rescue Committee .
'' It 's a huge leap . ''
And if my first impulse was to want to shelter Peter , Maduk and Riak from the shock of this transition , Ibrahim , who arrived as a refugee from Somalia in 1996 , took an unsparing , sink - or - swim approach .
Clearly , he had had to wrestle with everything from can openers to food stamps himself at one point , and he had muddled through .
In addition to working as a Lutheran Social Services case manager , Ibrahim runs a small African import business in Fargo , and like any good American entrepreneur , he conducts much of his business on a cell phone while driving his S.U.V .
It was Mr Gaddafi too who , much to the anger of the US and some victims ' relatives , stood alongside Megrahi and ensured he was given a " hero's welcome " as his plane touched down in the Libyan capital of Tripoli late on Thursday night – just hours after he was released by the Scottish government from a life sentence handed down in 2001 for the terrorist attack that claimed 270 lives in December 1988 .
Grand Central Dispatch
Snow Leopard 's answer to the concurrency conundrum is called Grand Central Dispatch ( GCD ) .
As with QuickTime X , the name is extremely apt , though this is not entirely clear until you understand the technology .
The first thing to know about GCD is that it's not a new Cocoa framework or similar special - purpose frill off to the side .
It 's a plain C library baked into the lowest levels of Mac OS X .
( It 's in libSystem , which incorporates libc and the other code that sits at the very bottom of userspace . )
There 's no need to link in a new library to use GCD in your program .
Just #include < dispatch / dispatch.h > and you 're off to the races .
The fact that GCD is a C library means that it can be used from all of the C - derived languages supported on Mac OS X : Objective - C , C++ , and Objective - C++.
Queues and threads
GCD is built on a few simple entities .
Let 's start with queues .
A queue in GCD is just what it sounds like .
Tasks are enqueued , and then dequeued in FIFO order .
( That 's " First In , First Out , " just like the checkout line at the supermarket , for those who do n't know and do n't want to follow the link . )
Dequeuing the task means handing it off to a thread where it will execute and do its actual work .
Though GCD queues will hand tasks off to threads in FIFO order , several tasks from the same queue may be running in parallel at any given time .
This animation demonstrates .
A Grand Central Dispatch queue in action
You 'll notice that Task B completed before Task A . Though dequeuing is FIFO , task completion is not .
Also note that even though there were three tasks enqueued , only two threads were used .
This is an important feature of GCD which we 'll discuss shortly .
But first , let 's look at the other kind of queue .
A serial queue works just like a normal queue , except that it only executes one task at a time .
That means task completion in a serial queue is also FIFO .
Serial queues can be created explicitly , just like normal queues , but each application also has an implicit " main queue " which is a serial queue that runs on the main thread .
The animation above shows threads appearing as work needs to be done , and disappearing as they 're no longer needed .
Where do these threads come from and where do they go when they 're done ?
GCD maintains a global pool of threads which it hands out to queues as they 're needed .
When a queue has no more pending tasks to run on a thread , the thread goes back into the pool .
This is an extremely important aspect of GCD 's design .
Perhaps surprisingly , one of the most difficult parts of extracting maximum performance using traditional , manually managed threads is figuring out exactly how many threads to create .
Too few , and you risk leaving hardware idle .
Too many , and you start to spend a significant amount of time simply shuffling threads in and out of the available processor cores .
Let 's say a program has a problem that can be split into eight separate , independent units of work .
If this program then creates four threads on an eight - core machine , is this an example of creating too many or too few threads ?
Trick question !
The answer is that it depends on what else is happening on the system .
If six of the eight cores are totally saturated doing some other work , then creating four threads will just require the OS to waste time rotating those four threads through the two available cores .
But wait , what if the process that was saturating those six cores finishes ?
Now there are eight available cores but only four threads , leaving half the cores idle .
With the exception of programs that can reasonably expect to have the entire machine to themselves when they run , there 's no way for a programmer to know ahead of time exactly how many threads he should create .
Of the available cores on a particular machine , how many are in use ?
If more become available , how will my program know ?
The bottom line is that the optimal number of threads to put in flight at any given time is best determined by a single , globally aware entity .
In Snow Leopard , that entity is GCD .
It will keep zero threads in its pool if there are no queues that have tasks to run .
As tasks are dequeued , GCD will create and dole out threads in a way that optimizes the use of the available hardware .
GCD knows how many cores the system has , and it knows how many threads are currently executing tasks .
When a queue no longer needs a thread , it 's returned to the pool where GCD can hand it out to another queue that has a task ready to be dequeued .
There are further optimizations inherent in this scheme .
In Mac OS X , threads are relatively heavyweight .
Each thread maintains its own set of register values , stack pointer , and program counter , plus kernel data structures tracking its security credentials , scheduling priority , set of pending signals and signal masks , etc .
It all adds up to over 512 KB of overhead per thread .
Create a thousand threads and you 've just burned about a half a gigabyte of memory and kernel resources on overhead alone , before even considering the actual data within each thread .
Compare a thread 's 512 KB of baggage with GCD queues which have a mere 256 bytes of overhead .
Queues are very lightweight , and developers are encouraged to create as many of them as they need — thousands , even .
In the earlier animation , when the queue was given two threads to process its three tasks , it executed two tasks on one of the threads .
Not only are threads heavyweight in terms of memory overhead , they 're also relatively costly to create .
Creating a new thread for each task would be the worst possible scenario .
Every time GCD can use a thread to execute more than one task , it 's a win for overall system efficiency .
Remember the problem of the programmer trying to figure out how many threads to create ?
Using GCD , he does n't have to worry about that at all .
Instead , he can concentrate entirely on the optimal concurrency of his algorithm in the abstract .
If the best - case scenario for his problem would use 500 concurrent tasks , then he can go ahead and create 500 GCD queues and distribute his work among them .
GCD will figure out how many actual threads to create to do the work .
Furthermore it will adjust the number of threads dynamically as the conditions on the system change .
But perhaps most importantly , as new hardware is released with more and more CPU cores , the programmer does not need to change his application at all .
Thanks to GCD , it will transparently take advantage of any and all available computing resources , up to — but not past ! — the optimal amount of concurrency as originally defined by the programmer when he chose how many queues to create .
But wait , there 's more !
GCD queues can actually be arranged in arbitrarily complex directed acyclic graphs .
( Actually , they can be cyclic too , but then the behavior is undefined .
Do n't do that . )
Queue hierarchies can be used to funnel tasks from disparate subsystems into a narrower set of centrally controlled queues , or to force a set of normal queues to delegate to a serial queue , effectively serializing them all indirectly .
There are also several levels of priority for queues , dictating how often and with what urgency threads are distributed to them from the pool .
Queues can be suspended , resumed , and cancelled .
Queues can also be grouped , allowing all tasks distributed to the group to be tracked and accounted for as a unit .
Overall , GCD 's use of queues and threads forms a simple , elegant , but also extremely pragmatic architecture .

Spend some time on the Internet , and you ’ll start to see a peculiar usage of the word fail popping up everywhere .
A conservative blog posts an image of a United States - Russian diplomatic agreement with the president ’s name spelled “ Barak Obama ” and calls it “ White House Spellcheck FAIL . ”
Atlanta Braves fans take out their ire on outfielder Jeff Francoeur ( since traded to the New York Mets ) by changing his name to “ Failcoeur . ”
On Twitter , disgruntled CNN - watchers complain about the network ’s coverage of protests in Iran under the banner “ CNNfail . ”
Time was , fail was simply a verb that denoted being unsuccessful or falling short of expectations .
It made occasional forays into nounhood , in fixed expressions like without fail and no-fail .
That all started to change in certain online subcultures about six years ago .
In July 2003 , a contributor to Urbandictionary.com noted that fail could be used as an interjection “ when one disapproves of something , ” giving the example : “ You actually bought that ?
FAIL . ” This punchy stand - alone fail most likely originated as a shortened form of “ You fail ” or , more fully , “ You fail it , ” the taunting “ game over ” message in the late - ’90s Japanese video game Blazing Star , notorious for its fractured English .
In a few years ’ time , the use of fail as an interjection caught on to such an extent that particularly egregious objects of ridicule required an even stronger barb : major fail , überfail , massive fail or , most popular of all , epic fail .
The intensifying adjectives hinted that fail was becoming a new kind of noun : not simply a synonym for failure but , rather , a derisive label to slap on a miscue that is eminently mockable in its stupidity or wrongheadedness .
Online cynics deploy fail as a countable noun ( “ That ’s such a fail ! ” ) and also as a mass noun that treats failure as an abstract quality : the offending party is often said to be full of fail or made of fail .
A major vehicle for the success of fail has been FAIL Blog , a Web site set up in January 2008 and acquired a few months later by Pet Holdings , a blog conglomerate that has had great success with I Can Has Cheezburger ?

President Barack Obama barely had time to graciously note his unworthiness of the Nobel Peace Prize before it was time to duck back into the Situation Room for a meeting with his advisers about how to win the war in Afghanistan .
The irony of this is underscored by the apparent willingness of the administration to consider the addition of as many as 60,000 more troops , per Gen. Stanley McChrystal ’s request , to the occupation forces .
The Taliban has regrouped and is in clear control of much of the country .
Not only that , but the Afghan " government , " which was never very credible to begin with , has lost any vestige of legitimacy it may once have possessed on account of the brazen theft of the presidential election by fashion plate Hamid Karzai .
Not that this matters much in concrete terms , as Karzai ’s kingdom is limited to Kabul and the immediate vicinity .
To prevent Operation Enduring Freedom from turning into an enduring embarrassment , Gen. McChrystal and the regional commander , Gen. David Petraeus , have both recommended an Afghan variant of the Iraqi " surge . "
The military ’s new counterinsurgency doctrine – COIN – has been revamped and refined , and the Pentagon is counting on this newly minted wisdom to roll back the Taliban and regain the initiative in what is widely seen as a losing war .
What prevents this surge from occurring , however , is the one determinative factor in the making of U.S. foreign policy – and , indeed , all foreign policy that has ever been made anywhere – and that is domestic politics .
The pressures on Obama and his administration to pursue what is artfully termed a " minimalist " approach to the Afghan war are considerable : within his own party , a substantial ( albeit not too principled ) anti-interventionist wing is balking at McChrystal ’s call for escalation , and the polls support their reluctance .
For the first time since 9/11 , a majority of Americans think the Afghan war is n’t worth fighting .
Democrats , who are just now getting used to enjoying their congressional majority , were put in power in large part because of the war weariness of American voters , and they do n’t want to do anything to endanger that if they do n’t have to .
Moreover , the economic arguments against escalation are irrefutable : we simply do n’t have the money .
The tremendous drain on our resources necessitated by the Iraq and Afghan conflicts – measured in trillions , not billions – may be the coup de grace for a U.S. economy already in marked decline .
Add to this the cost of President Obama ’s extensive domestic " reform " package , including a substantial government investment in the healthcare industry , and we are suddenly revisiting that old 1960s dilemma : " guns vs. butter . "
This dichotomy , you ’ll recall , plagued another Democratic president with fanciful visions of generous domestic spending programs : Lyndon Baines Johnson .
That Johnson was driven from office by antiwar protesters and the left wing of his own party is a bit of political history that haunts today ’s Democratic leaders – or , at least , the smart ones .
Given these political and economic arguments against expanding the Afghan war , what could possibly persuade the administration to take McChrystal ’s advice ?
It seems like a no - brainer – and it is , if it ’s the interests of the country that we ’re talking about .
Unfortunately , there ’s another factor that could prove ultimately decisive , and that is the all - pervasive power and influence of the War Party .
The unpopularity of Obama ’s war is a problem , but hardly an insoluble one for the president and his crew .
After all , he ’s just had the Nobel Peace Prize conferred on him , so he ’s inoculated – if only temporarily – against the accusation that he ’s a warmonger .
Stacked up against George W. Bush , Obama comes off like the reincarnation of Gandhi – and that ’s what will really blunt the political impact of taking McChrystal ’s road to perdition , if the White House so chooses .
Because if the Obamaites pursue the path of escalation , there is only the perpetually ineffective and easily intimidated left wing of his party to answer to , and where else do those folks have to go ?
While a few Republicans may wise up and start echoing Ron Paul ’s call to bring the troops home , the supposedly reflexive anti-Obama stance of the GOP stops at the water ’s edge .
If anything , the Republicans are looking to pounce on the president if he does n’t jump into the Afghan quagmire with as much alacrity as they ’d like .
I can just hear Newt Gingrich and the other worn - out relics of the GOP ’s glorious yesteryears braying : " Who lost Afghanistan ? "
( Not that this will have much political effect on the Republicans ’ sagging fortunes when most Americans are asking " Who lost America ? " )
The interventionist monopoly on the leadership of the two state - supported major parties is n’t the only enabling factor involved in ramping up the Afghan war .
There is also the rising power of the imperial class to contend with – that is , the growing economic and political clout wielded by sectors of the U.S. economy dependent on military contracts and the direct links between lawmakers and " private " companies that profit from war .
A particularly brazen example of the latter is Sen.
Dianne Feinstein , Democrat of California and formerly the mayor of what is generally regarded as the most liberal city in the United States .
This past weekend she hit the Sunday talk show circuit to grouse :
" I do n’t know how you put somebody in who was as crackerjack as General McChrystal , who gives the president very solid recommendations , and not take those recommendations if you ’re not going to pull out .
" If you do n’t want to take the recommendations , then you – you – you put your people in such jeopardy , just like the base in Nuristan .
We lost eight of our men .
We did n’t have the ability to defend them , and now the base is closing , and effectively we ’re – we ’re retreating away from it .
And so I think the decision has to be made sooner , rather than later . "
What were those eight men doing out in the middle of that godforsaken hell to begin with – and who put them there ?
It ’s breathtaking to hear Feinstein blaming Obama for the deaths of those soldiers .
I ’m no Obama cultist , as the record makes clear , but that has got to be a new low in demagoguery , even for a woman who used a political assassination to catapult herself into the media spotlight , the mayoralty , and the U.S. Senate .
Feinstein plugged the nation - building strategic doctrine now being pushed by the Pentagon ’s best and brightest , as well as the Democratic " national security " crowd over at the Center for a New American Security ( CNAS ) , where the theoreticians of COIN hold court .
The timeframe of this strategy went unmentioned by the senator , but it is measured in decades .
Also unmentioned : the costs , not only in lives but in tax dollars .
Feinstein has personal knowledge of those expenditures , not only as former chairwoman and ranking member of the Senate ’s Military Construction Appropriations subcommittee ( 2001 - 2005 ) , but also as the spouse of one of the biggest war profiteers in the business .
Reporting in one of our excellent local northern California papers , The Bohemian ( yes , as in Bohemian Grove ) , Peter Byrne notes :
" Feinstein supervised the appropriation of billions of dollars a year for specific military construction projects .
Two defense contractors whose interests were largely controlled by her husband , financier Richard C. Blum , benefited from decisions made by Feinstein as leader of this powerful subcommittee .
" Each year , MILCON ’s members decide which military construction projects will be funded from a roster proposed by the Department of Defense .
Contracts to build these specific projects are subsequently awarded to such major defense contractors as Halliburton , Fluor , Parsons , Louis Berger , URS Corporation , and Perini Corporation .
From 1997 through the end of 2005 , with Feinstein ’s knowledge , Blum was a majority owner of both URS Corp. and Perini Corp . "
Blum and Feinstein are laughing all the way to the bank as URS Corp and Perini grow fat on the military appropriations gravy train – the only sector of the U.S. economy that seems to be thriving .
Perini , in which Blum owns a controlling interest , is the Democrats ’ Halliburton – indeed , Cheney ’s old corporate digs is Perini ’s chief competitor .
Blum bought it when it was nearly broke in 1997 .
In 2005 , Feinstein ’s membership on the subcommittee was " routinely " rotated , as the Soros - funded shills over at Media Matters made sure to point out , contrary to Byrne ’s assertions that she might have resigned under pressure .
By that time Perini was raking in $ 1.7 billion in annual income .
The infrastructure - intensive warfare championed by McChrystal and the COIN crowd is precisely the strategic framework that will enrich the Perini / URS military - industrial combine .
All those bases stuck out in the middle of nowhere that Feinstein wants to construct and defend will need to be built , supplied , reinforced , and regularly maintained .
This is a job tailor - made for the Blum / Feinstein war profiteers and all the other politically connected firms that feed at the public trough .
Do we even have to inquire any further into Feinstein ’s motivation for expanding this futile and unwinnable war ?
The economic and political interests that feed the Democratic Party machine and enable it to hand out the goods to its loyal activists are just as invested in a foreign policy of perpetual war as those who routinely support the Republicans .
In the particularly egregious case of Feinstein , her personal and financial interests are directly linked to the policy of global intervention – and this is emblematic of a larger problem with the two major parties , both of which are in thrall to corporate interests .
That ’s why we do n’t get to choose between war and peace , only between Halliburton and Perini .

“ Wait a minute ” you ’re thinking to yourself … ” Barefoot Running Shoes ?
Is n’t that an oxymoron ? ”
Yes , it is not the best name for these type of shoes cause you are right , how can one be both barefoot and have shoes on ?
But really when we say “ Barefoot Shoes ” we mean shoes that embrace the benefits and philosophy of barefoot walking and running .
Some people call these types of shoes minimalist footwear .
Some of these so called barefoot running shoes look even more technical and advanced than regular running shoes .
An example are Newton Running Shoes .

Presenting Your Foot
As simple as a foot looks on the outside it is an amazingly complex and well - adapted appendage .
It is composed of 26 bones ( 25 % of all the bones in your body ) , 33 joints , and over 100 muscles , tendons , and ligaments .
All of these components work in tandem to support your body as your run and walk .
Problems or flaws in the feet often can cause problems in other parts of the body .
In addition to providing tremendous support and shock absorption the foot is surprisingly malleable .
It conforms to the shape which it is bound within .
In a 1905 a group of doctors studied the feet of native people in the Philippines and Central Africa .
The study , which was published in the American Journal of Orthopedic Surgery , compared the feet of these natural barefoot populations with the feet of 1905 “ modern ” shoe wearers .
Below is what the average barefoot person ’s foot looked like :
The doctors noted that on the naturally barefoot person ’s foot that a line could be drawn to pass through the big toe , ball of the foot , and heel .
They also noted that their toes naturally spread out which would allow for a wider base for stranding , walking , and running .
Below is what the average shoe wearing indvidual ’s foot looked like :
Doctors observed that the foot seemed to form to the shape of the shoe that was worn .
The toes did not fan out like those of the barefoot populations and that a line no longer could be drawn directly from the big toe to heel .
The overall foot was more narrow which when compared to the barefoot people offered a less stable support base .
Benefits to Barefoot Running
What ’s so good about barefoot running ?
Why should I do that ?
Wo n’t my feet get dirty ?
While your feet will get dirty there is a growing amount of research that is showing that taking off your shoes might be a good idea .
People have experienced different results but many have reported :
Less problems with recurring ankle sprains , chronic foot injuries , and plantar fasciitis
Greater agility
Less deformed toes
Improved balanced ( which has helped prevent other injuries )
Prevention of varicose veins ( thanks to increased blood circulation in the feet )

Researchers lured the critically endangered bird , which had never been positively identified at sea , by throwing frozen fish into waters 25 miles south of Fiji's Gau island
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
A group of researchers in Fiji has captured for the first time images of the endangered and elusive Fiji petrel .
Scientists photographed the chocolate - coloured sea bird soaring above the ocean about 25 miles south of Fiji 's remote island of Gau in May , according to the UK conservation group BirdLife International .
The researchers ' findings were described in a paper published in this week 's Bulletin of the British Ornithologists '
Club .
" Finding this bird and capturing such images was a fantastic and exhilarating experience , " the paper 's lead author , Hadoram Shirihai , said in a statement .
The bird is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature , which compiles the world 's red list of endangered species .
The first Fiji petrel specimen was collected in 1855 on Gau , and a second not until 1984 .
Since then , there have been a handful of reports of birds crashing into houses on Gau , but no one had ever positively identified one at sea , the researchers said .
The finding is significant because there is so little information about the bird , said Nicholas Carlile , sea bird project officer with the New South Wales state Department of Environment , Climate Change and Water in Australia .
Carlile has studied the Fiji petrel for years and began to hunt for the animal 's breeding ground in 2003 .
Despite all his research , even he has never seen one of the elusive birds .
" There has been no positive sighting of the Fiji petrel at sea – it's very rare , " Carlile said .
" So it was absolutely fantastic to see those images . "
The researchers threw blocks of frozen fish pieces mixed with dense fish oil into the water , creating a smelly slick that attracted the birds .
The scientists spotted up to eight petrels over their 11 - day expedition .
Expedition member Dick Watling of the conservation group NatureFiji- MareqetiViti said more surveys to locate the birds ' breeding area are planned for next year .
" Once we know the location , we can assess what needs to be done to turn around the fortunes of this species , " he said .
You will hear people like me talking about hipsters , scenesters and other fakes .
Who are these people ?
Simple definition : anyone who makes the art the means and themselves the ends .
An artist makes the art the end , and themselves ( and anything else ) the means .
The hipster is the inverse artist , who wants the cachet and cool of being an artist .
They want to be unique , different , innovative , charming , etc. because inside they 're ordinary .
That 's part of their inversion … they turn themselves inside out to demonstrate to you how cool they are , and to justify their meaningless , modern lifestyles .
They make their ego the goal and use their lives as accessories to that end .
Two great definitions :
Kill the hipster : A modest proposal to save New York cool
Hipster :
The dead end of Western civilization
And some related articles :

Your Scene Sucks !
And here 's a stunner :
Hipsters are a subculture of men and women typically in their 20's and 30's that value independent thinking , counter - culture , progressive politics , an appreciation of art and indie-rock , creativity , intelligence , and witty banter .
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hipster
Let me re-write that for you :
Hipsters are a subculture of men and women typically in their 20's and 30's that value the appearance of independent thinking , the appearance of counter - culture , " progressive " politics , an appreciation of " unique " but banal art and indie-rock , the appearance of creativity , the appearance of intelligence , and cleverly self - righteous and vapid banter .

If all hipsters and scenesters died tomorrow , would life be :
( a ) better
( b ) worse

Well , OK , ... maybe not ALL of them ,
but I 'm willing to bet it covers
90 % of them .
If Team Columbia - HTC felt slightly aggrieved that they were left to do the bulk of the chasing on the road to Brignoles , they had better get used to it .
With a sprinter as dominant as Mark Cavendish in their ranks , few of their rivals are willing to waste energy helping to set up another win .
But Brian Holm , the Columbia directeur sportif , said that if the others continue to sit back and watch his team toil , they will see their chances of winning go from slim to non-existent .
He told CW : “ There ’s five or six stages for the sprinters , but not if we have to do all the work ourselves .
If no one shares some of the work , we ’ll let a group go one day . ”
It was a hot day , and the roads were lumpy , making it a lot harder for the four - man break of Stéphane Augé , Stef Clement , Cyril Dessel and Jussi Veikkanen , to stay away .
Their lead stayed at around five minutes as Saxo Bank did the bulk of the work to contain it for the race leader Fabian Cancellara .
Columbia came to the front in the final third of the stage , but no one came with them .
Cérvelo did contribute a little , but at one stage French television flashed up a caption saying that Columbia had done 80 per cent of the work on the front of the bunch in the previous 10 - kilometre spell .
On his Twitter feed Garmin - Slipstream ’s Jonathan Vaughters mulled over the possibility of instructing his riders to help .
Presumably he decided against it , because Garmin , though well placed , stayed well back .
But if the plan was to hang Columbia out to dry in the hot sun , it did n’t work .
They ’re too strong for that .
And if the plan was to let Columbia lead it out and then sprint to victory , that was n’t likely to work either .
Cavendish is simply too fast .
Once the lead quartet was caught , with 10 kilometres to go , Katusha ’s Mikhail Ignatiev had already launched a counter - attack .
He too was reeled in at around the time Milram began to arm - wrestle Columbia for control at the front of the bunch .
It was a fight they were doomed to lose , as they burned up their men noticeably quicker than Columbia , but without making much headway .
They drew level , but failed to beat Columbia into submission .
Garmin were still loitering but no one else was at all organised .
Quick Step ’s Tom Boonen is still suffering with an upset stomach .
Cérvelo decided not to get stuck in , so it was the boys from Skil - Shimano who got in amongst it in the closing stages .
Their rider Kenny Van Hummel actually banged bars with Cavendish , something Cavendish made a point of mentioning in the post - race press conference .
Columbia ’s Erik Zabel , who drove the run-in ahead of the race and passed his observations back to the team car , identified the big roundabout in the final couple of kilometres as the major obstacle .
“ I told them to take the left side , because that was the shortest line , and also the quickest , ” he said .
Then came the sweeping left - hander , which caught many by surprise .
There was a crash and several riders over - shot the corner , flying straight on instead .
Not that it derailed Columbia or Cavendish .
They were already round and closing in on the line .
There was never a moment when Cavendish looked threatened .
Tyler Farrar , glued to his wheel , barely made a mark .
By the line the gap was opening .
Tuesday ’s stage to La Grande Motte could well see more of the same , and when a break goes away , every team will look at Columbia , shrug , and make it clear whose responsibility it is to work .
The win was the 42nd of Cavendish ’s career , putting him above Chris Boardman in Cycling Weekly ‘s list of all - time British pro winners .
It also gave Cavendish the green jersey for the first time .
He may have played down talk of making the points competition his priority , but he ’s already in the lead and keen to win more stages .
And as today ’s stage shows , when Cavendish gets in front , his goal is to pull away .

PARIS -- French opposition politicians are accusing Nicolas Sarkozy of nepotism after the French president 's 23 - year - old son Jean said he was a candidate for head of a public agency that runs Paris 's financial district , La Défense .
The president once held the prominent administrative job .

At least 11 doctors with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health received more than $ 50,000 from drug or medical device companies last year , including seven who pulled in six - figure amounts , according to records obtained by the Journal Sentinel .
As part of an effort to enforce more stringent conflict - of - interest rules , UW doctors for the first time have had to specify how much outside income they receive .
The disclosure forms show that orthopedic surgeons , who command some of the highest salaries among university and state employees , also got some of the biggest outside income checks , mostly from companies that make medical devices .
With the outside payments , several of them had total annual income of near or more than $ 1 million .
Some of the orthopedic surgeons also were among the most vocal opponents to the university 's new disclosure requirements , referring to the more stringent disclosure requirements as voyeuristic .
In the past , they and other doctors who earned large sums working as consultants , speakers or from royalties could merely state that they received more than $ 20,000 without having to tell their patients or the university the actual amount .
The issue of doctors , especially those with university positions , working for drug and device companies has come under scrutiny in recent years , including in congressional investigations , medical journal articles and the media .
The Journal Sentinel has published an ongoing series of stories on connections between UW doctors and medical firms .
Topping the list of those receiving large sums from medical companies was a group of UW orthopedic surgeons .
They include :
• Paul Anderson , a professor of orthopedic surgery , who got $ 150,000 for eight days of work as a consultant from medical device - maker Medtronic .
Anderson , who could not be reached for comment , also earned a UW salary of $ 755,000 in 2007 .
• Ben Graf , an associate professor of orthopedic surgery , who got $ 770,000 in royalties from device company Smith & Nephew .
Graf , who could not be reached for comment , also earned a UW salary of $ 591,000 in 2007 .
• Clifford Tribus , an associate professor orthopedic surgery , who got $ 310,000 for 15 days of work as a speaker and consultant and from royalties from device company Stryker Spine .
Tribus also earned a UW salary of $ 618,000 in 2007 .
In an e-mail , Tribus said about $ 250,000 of the $ 310,000 he got from Stryker was from royalties on an implant invention .
The rest was from consulting work .
He said he does not receive royalties from devices he implants in his patients and the patients are informed of his financial relationship .
He said his consulting work involves giving talks about the devices to other doctors , for which he is paid $ 450 an hour .
He said that was a lot different than a doctor being paid to give a talk about a drug .
" These are technology - and technique - driven ideas , " he said .
" It 's not taking a pill with some milk or water . "
• The largest sum - $ 2 million - paid in 2008 , went to orthopedic surgeon Thomas Zdeblick from Medtronic .
The money came from royalties on inventions and from working eight days as a consultant .
In an e-mail response last week , Zdeblick said his 2008 income from Medtronic also came from royalties on his patented inventions .
" I do not receive any royalties for cases performed at UW , " he added .
" Patients are informed that I work on product development with industry . "
Zdeblick also received $ 890,000 in compensation from UW in 2007 .
He is a professor and chairman of the department of orthopedics and rehabilitation .
In January , the Journal Sentinel reported that Zdeblick received more than $ 19 million in payments from Medtronic from 2003 through 2007 .
The payments , mostly from royalties , were revealed in a letter from U.S. Sen .
Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) as part of an investigation of payments to doctors from medical companies that Grassley is conducting .
Doctor heads company
Diane Heatley , an associate professor in the division of otolaryngology - head and neck surgery , received the second highest payment from a medical firm .
Heatley , president and founder of Med- Systems Inc. , a Madison - based company that manufactures and markets the SinuCleanse over - the - counter saline nasal wash system , reported receiving $ 1.3 million from the company and working 40 days .
The company , in which she holds a 37.5 % interest , has sold millions of the devices over the years , she said .
Heatley , who works with pediatric patients , said that when nasal washing is deemed appropriate , the family is shown several different washing devices , including SinuCleanse , which is available through UW Hospital .
She said some patients already are using nasal washing when they see her .
" Those who use other manufacturers ' systems are never encouraged to switch systems , " she said in an e-mail .
When asked about whether she tells families about her financial interest in the device , she said , " Yes .
My name and picture are on the box as developer of SinuCleanse products . "
Jeffrey Grossman , head of the UW Medical Foundation , said all of the financial relationships will be formally reviewed by the university .
" The entire purpose of our exercise is to address the concerns of the public and the profession about the potential influence of drug and device companies on health care practice , " he said in an e-mail .
Because of the influence they hold , university physicians often are sought out by drug and device firms .
Often patients are unaware of the financial relationships .
Critics of these arrangements say they increase the cost of medicine , potentially compromise patient care and damage the integrity of medical research .
University doctors often are hired by the companies to work as consultants or to give talks .
That could lead to more prescribing of expensive , brand name drugs when cheaper generics might work just as well , or more costly procedures when less invasive therapy might be appropriate .
It also could lead to more off - label use of drugs and devices .
Off - label refers to using a drug or device for a condition for which it was not originally approved , which is legal and often advisable , but which also can lead to expensive prescribing that is not based on sound science .
Trend since 1980s
Arnold Relman , a former editor - in - chief of the New England Journal of Medicine and a doctor since the 1950s , said the financial relationships , which took off in the 1980s , have turned the practice of medicine into a huge business .
He said it also is destroying the American health care system .
" We can't afford it , " he said .
And simply requiring doctors to disclose how much money they are paid does n't eliminate their conflicts of interest .
" The time has come for medical schools and universities to recognize that disclosure is not enough , " Relman said .
" It is time to simply make conflicts of interest off limits .
" People have to choose .
Do they want to be salaried members of a medical school or freelance entrepreneurs of a medical company ? "
Relman said it was outrageous that seven UW doctors received more than $ 100,000 from medical firms last year .
But , he said , just as troubling are the many others who made less than $ 50,000 .
" It 's all bad , " said Relman , a professor emeritus of medicine and social medicine at Harvard Medical School .
" You can't draw a line . "
Practice defended
However , Kenneth Noonan , an associate professor of orthopedic surgery at UW , has an entirely different view .
Noonan said interactions between the medical industry and university doctors are important , and physician scientists can help improve patient care .
" In that capacity , the physician becomes a contractor who has a right to compensation generally achieved through contractual relationships , " he said in an e-mail .
" These contractual relationships must always bow to the primary interest of the physician and the patient - optimal patient care - but they are not inherently inappropriate . "
Noonan , who is a member of the committee that has recommended changes to the UW conflict - of - interest policy , received $ 181,000 from EBI - Biomet , a medical device company , in royalties from a variety of implant products in 2008 .
He said he did not get any royalty money from products implanted at any UW facility .
A MAN claims his pet cat is a bit too brainy for his own good and can speak English _ a total of seven different words so far , including the F - word .
Robert ' RJ ' Duncan , of Palmerston , in the Northern Territory says his budgie Picininny can also speak .
But when the Northern Territory News first visited the ex-boxer , 34 , and his wife Sandra , 32 , at their Gray home , the house - bound moggie grumpily declined to comment .

More cute animals at play
Instead he scratched Mr Duncan a few times before bolting to his bedroom and barricading himself in his cupboard .
But during a second visit , Mischief was much friendlier .
And more talkative .
All gathered heard him speak to Sandra , calling her " mum ' ' .
Mr Duncan said the two - year - old cat _ which he and his wife adopted from his feral mother in Katherine _ was most vocal at night .
" He starts mouthing off when he wants his food _ when we start cooking , '' he said .
" He can say seven words all up : mum , no , now , what , f**k , prick and why .
" He ca n't say ' dad ' yet , which is a bit of a prick .
That 's how he got the word ' prick ' I reckon , because I say it a lot . ''
Mr Duncan _ sitting at their wooden table rolling a roll - your - own _ said Mischief 's first word was `mum ' , which he started saying about the age of six months .
Human babies are a little slower than the skittish kitty .
They can usually manage to produce a slurred `mama ' or ' dada ' about 10 months of age .
Mr Duncan said Mischief was n't apeing the words _ he knew what he was saying .
" He calls out to ( Sandra ) and everything _ he 'll sit at the back window , while she 's in the garden , calling out ' mum ' . "
" In the evening time , if you do n't drop whatever you 're doing and pay attention to him , he calls you ' f **k prick ' .
" If he really cracks the s**ts , he 'll piss in his drinking water just to let you know he 's really s** ty . "
The foul - mouthed feline does n't take non-attention kindly .
Mischief spent his time during the Duncan 's wedding swearing at the guests in the backyard from his bedroom window .
Mr Duncan said the guests were pre-warned , so " they pretty much ignored him " .
The Duncans ' budgie is less adventurous with its words .
It just says " s**t " .
Mr Duncan will now be trying to film his moggie to prove Mischief can really talk .
" He 's a character ... he 's one of these cats that 's a bit too brainy for his own good . "

Could Sarah Palin 's puzzling speech last week mean the end of her political career ?
In September , GM launched a program putting its cars up against the industry 's best , offering a 60 - day money - back guarantee on all 2009 and 2010 model - year Buick , Chevrolet , Cadillac and GMC vehicles .
So far , it looks to be going well for GM , with just one customer taking the car in for a refund -- and even then , he ended up with another GM vehicle .
It 's still underway , so things may yet heat up , but Bob Lutz went on the record today saying that to date , just one customer has come for their money .
The reason ?
He bought a manual - transmission Chevrolet Corvette , and ended up wanting an automatic .
The point of the deal was to show GM had enough faith in its products to make the offer , and the company said at the time that it did n't anticipate many returns .
Seeing just one return after about a month in operation reflects the reality of the marketplace -- an alternative offer of $ 500 cash back could be opted for in place of the money - back guarantee .
Out of hundreds of thousands of cars sold during the period , Lutz says only a few hundred took the money - back guarantee over the cash , and so far there 's been just the one " substantiated " return .
Whether the new money - back guarantee and " May the Best Car Win " campaign deserve the credit or it's simply a sign of GM 's ongoing recovery from this summer 's bankruptcy , the average transaction price for GM cars was up about $ 8,000 in September , almost $ 5,000 more than the industry average improvement , though it still has a hole to pull itself out of , down 8.4 % in market share from last September 's 29.3 % .
The money - back guarantee allows GM customers to bring a new car to the dealership between 31 and 60 days after purchase for a refund of the purchase price .
The program runs through November 30 .

" The commonwealth wants to use [ the Schaible 's ] religious beliefs as a self - fulfilling prophecy that , somehow , because they are different and because they exercise religious beliefs that are not necessarily in line with the majority of us , " he said , " that is the cause of them failing to recognize that this child was as ill as he was . "
I have long suspected that fish are smarter than we give them credit for .
As a child , I had an aquarium with several pet goldfish .
They certainly knew it was feeding time when my hand appeared over their tank , and they excitedly awaited their delicious fish flakes .
They also exhibited a darker , disturbing behavior .
Evidently , a safe life with abundant food was not fulfilling .
From time to time , either sheer ennui or the long gray Toledo winter got to one of the fish and it ended its torment with a leap to my bedroom floor .
Maybe my anthropomorphizing is a bit over the top .
But , really , just how smart are fish ?
Can they learn ?
A 10 - gallon tank with a plastic sunken pirate ship is certainly not the most stimulating habitat .
But in the colorful , diverse and dangerous world of coral reefs , fish must be able to recognize not only food , but also to discriminate friends from foes , and mates from rivals , and to take the best action .
In such a complex and dynamic environment , it would pay to be flexible and able to learn .
I 've read a lot of novice Perl code over the past decade , often in response to requests for help .
One common feature of novice code is file - scoped variables :
#! perl use strict ; use warnings ; my @customers ; # array of customers my $ sth ; # database statement handle my $ i ; # index variable # ... my %records ; # hash of records
You 're lucky if the code is this good ; often it 's face - palmingly worse , as in the case of Microsoft 's awful Perl code for the 2008 Winter Scripting Games :
%dictionary = ( ) ; # create a hash table
The problem with the big block of variable declarations is that it fails to take advantage of the notion of scope -- that you can draw a little box around a unit of code and keep certain pieces of information inside that block private to the block .
If I went to my fridge and took out the leftover pizza you were saving in your fridge for lunch , you'd be confused and upset by our haunted magic refrigerators .
Similarly ( if less gastronomically pleasing to me ) , modifying a global variable somewhere where you did n't expect it to have an effect elsewhere is confusing and frustrating .
While advocates of certain dynamic languages decry the use of variable declarations as a relic of stupid static typing systems like you might find in the C , C++ , and Java languages , Perl variable declarations have an enormous benefit in clarity : they help you see the scope of variables .
Yes , this means that sometimes adding syntax to a language can improve clarity .
There 's a huge difference between :
my @customers ; # array of customers my $ dbh ; # database handle my $ sth ; # statement handle ... find_customers ( ) ; sub find_customers { $ sth = $ dbh -> prepare ( ' SELECT ...' ) ; while ( my $row = $ sth->fetchrow_arrayref ( ) ) { push @customers , $row ; } }
... and :
my $ dbh ; # database handle ... my @customers = find_customers ( $ dbh ) ; sub find_customers { my $ dbh = shift ; my $ sth = $ dbh -> prepare ( ' SELECT ...' ) ; my @customers ; while ( my $row = $ sth->fetchrow_arrayref ( ) ) { push @customers , $row ; } return @customers ; }
The second code may look more complex , but it has several advantages :
find_customers ( ) can modify the contents of the $ dbh and @customers variables internally without affecting code elsewhere .
can modify the contents of the and variables internally without affecting code elsewhere .
The $ sth variable does not conflict with other statement handles elsewhere .
As well , Perl will clean it up when the function returns .
variable does not conflict with other statement handles elsewhere .
As well , Perl will clean it up when the function returns . find_customers ( ) can work with several different database handles , if necessary : the code is more reusable .
can work with several different database handles , if necessary : the code is more reusable .
The inputs and outputs to the function are clear : every variable used within the function has a clearly scoped lifetime .
This issue may seem like a minor quibble over style -- after all , in small programs , scope really does n't matter -- but for programs over a few dozen lines , the decrease in the risk of error and improvement in maintainability and readability is substantial .

We are rediscovering the enigmas of the Moon and they 're really in our own backyard
Dr Jim Garvin , Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center
Moon water has world in a twitter A surprising amount of water has been found to exist in the Moon 's soil .
Data from three spacecraft , including India 's Chandrayaan probe , shows that very fine films of H2O coat the particles that make up the lunar dirt .
The quantity is tiny but could become a useful resource for astronauts wishing to live on the Moon , scientists say .
" If you had a cubic metre of lunar soil , you could squeeze it and get out a litre of water , " explained US moon researcher Larry Taylor .
The rock and soil samples returned by the Apollo missions were found to be ever so slightly " damp " when examined in the laboratory , but scientists could never rule out the possibility that the water in the samples got in only after they were hauled back to Earth .
The only safe scientific conclusion they could draw at the time was that the lunar surface was all but bone dry .
Now a remote sensing instrument on Chandrayaan - 1 , India 's first mission to lunar orbit , has confirmed that there is a real H2O signal at the Moon .
Two other satellites to look at the Moon - the US Deep Impact probe and the US - European Cassini spacecraft - back up Chandrayaan .
Both collected Moon data before Chandrayaan was launched ( in the case of Cassini , 10 years ago ) , but the significance of what they saw is only now being fully realised .
Indian success
The quantity of water is seen to increase the closer the observations are made to the poles - the very places the Apollo missions never went .
Scientists suspect the water is created in the soil in an interaction with the solar wind , the fast - moving stream of particles that constantly billows away from the Sun .
Harsh space radiation triggers a chemical reaction in which oxygen atoms already in the soil acquire hydrogen nuclei to make water molecules and the simpler hydrogen - oxygen ( OH ) molecule .
The amounts are small , say researchers , but boost the notion that astronauts based on the Moon could use it as a resource .
The LCROSS experiment will target a crater near the south pole " If it is a little or a lot , it 's easy enough to split into hydrogen and oxygen and then you have rocket fuel , " said Professor Taylor , a University of Tennessee , Knoxville , researcher who has worked on the Chandrayaan data .
The Indian Moon mission was launched late last year but radio communication with it was abruptly lost in August .
Nevertheless , the Indian space agency ( Isro ) will consider the water discovery a major triumph and a vindication of its endeavours .
A US space agency ( Nasa ) probe is due to impact the Cabeus A crater near the Moon 's south pole next month to see if it can kick up sufficient soil so that another satellite and Earth - based telescopes can detect the presence of water vapour in the dusty plume .
Researchers say the latest results , published online by the journal Science , give them confidence that the experiment performed by the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite mission , known as LCROSS , could have a positive outcome .
They speculate that the water seen elsewhere on the lunar surface may migrate to the slightly cooler poles , much as water vapour on Earth will condense on a cold surface .
This cold sink effect could result in vast quantities of water being retained in permanently shadowed craters in the form of ice , especially if it has being supplemented by water delivered by comets .
' Exciting place ' Nasa 's Lunar Prospector probe in the late 1990s saw a strong hydrogen signal at high north and south latitudes .
Some scientists on the mission suggested there could be up to 300 million tonnes of water - ice buried in crater soils that never see sunlight .
Chandrayaan made its observations using a US - provided instrument , the Moon Mineralogy Mapper , or M3 for short .
The Apollo missions stayed close to the Moon 's equator
The magic of Apollo The M3 assessed the nature of lunar soils by analysing the way that light from the Sun was reflected off the surface .
It could only see the top few centimetres of soil .
Nasa 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter , which is currently circling the Moon , has the capability to see down to nearly a metre .
Its data could determine if the presence of water is much more extensive .
Dr Jim Garvin is the chief scientist at the US space agency 's Goddard Space Flight Center .
He was asked if he thought the Moon had become an exciting place again for science .
" I think it always was ; it 's just we saw this big exciting Solar System and after touching the Moon with six human missions , we moved on - to Mars , to the outer planets , to comets and asteroids .
" And now we are rediscovering the enigmas of the Moon and they 're really in our own backyard .
They 're tantalisingly close , " he told BBC News .

Vladimir Putin has dived to the bottom of the world 's deepest lake in Siberia , aboard a mini-submarine .
The Russian prime minister descended 1,400 m ( 4,600 ft ) in a four - and - a - half hour mission to inspect crystals containing natural gas .
Mr Putin said it was a very special feeling and he had not seen anything like it before .
The mission is likely to add to the 56 - year - old 's carefully cultivated image as a man of action .
However , as he emerged after the dive , Mr Putin quickly played down reporters ' suggestions that his next challenge would be to travel in space .
" There is enough work on earth , " he said .
' Plankton soup '
Lake Baikal in Siberia is a UN world heritage site .
The largely untouched lake bed contains deposits of clathrate hydrate - crystals packed with natural gas .
Experts say the reserves of methane could rival some of the largest deposits in the world , although mineral extraction is banned .
" What I saw impressed me , " the Russian leader said .
" With my own eyes I could see how Baikal is , in all its grandeur , in all its greatness .
Mr Putin yesterday tagged a whale called Dasha
But Mr Putin expressed some surprise at how murky the water was .
And while he realised it was clean from an " ecological point of view " , he described it more as a " plankton soup " .
Mr Putin arrived for his dive a day after clipping a satellite transmitter onto a Beluga whale on Chkalov island in Russia 's far east .
These acts are the latest in a series that have helped create something of a macho image for the former KGB spy .
While president , Mr Putin was famously photographed on holiday angling , stripped to the waist and wearing a pair of combat trousers .
As well as being a judo black belt , he has also taken to the sky in a fighter jet , shot a Siberian tiger with a tranquilliser gun , and been pictured astride a Mongolian horse .
An airline passenger advocate has accused Delta Airlines of hacking her e-mail accounts and computer in order to sabotage her organization 's lobbying efforts to pass federal legislation to help stranded fliers , according to a lawsuit filed in Texas Tuesday .
Kate Hanni , the executive director and founder of the Coalition for an Airline Passengers ' Bill of Rights , also known as FlyersRights.org , recently learned from America Online that her organization 's AOL e-mail – which included spreadsheets , lists of donors and other data – was being redirected to an unspecified location .
Hanni alleges in her complaint ( . pdf ) that the e-mail hacking began in 2008 .
She 's suing Delta and Metron Aviation , Inc. to discover how they obtained her correspondence .
She also alleges that other files on her personal computer were " hacked , copied and then corrupted , " rendering all the data on her laptop useless .
She says Delta obtained the information and used it to sabotage her organization 's efforts to get the Airline Passenger 's Bill of Rights of 2009 passed through Congress .
The Passenger 's Bill of Rights would force airlines to recognize passenger rights during long tarmac delays and provide them with food , water , and access to restrooms and clean air .
Passengers would also have the option to leave the plane if the delay lasts longer than three hours .
According to the suit , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas , her opponents had good reason to target her , since airlines stand to lose at least $ 40 million in revenue if required to provide such services to passengers .
Delta denies the charge .
" Obviously the idea that Delta would hack into someone 's e-mail is clearly without merit , " said spokesman Trebor Banstetter .
Hanni had been in communication with Frederick J. Foreman , a consultant for Metron , who provided an analysis of airline flight delays for the Federal Aviation Administration .
Foreman co-authored a report ( .pdf ) , which found that Delta was one of the top airlines experiencing excessive tarmac delays .
According to the lawsuit , he was authorized by Metron to share with Hanni publicly available information and statistics .
But in late September , Foreman was fired by Metron after the company obtained e-mails that Foreman had exchanged with Hanni and two reporters – Gary Stoller of USA Today and freelance journalist Susan Stelling .
Delta is a client of Metron , and Foreman was told the airline was n't happy that he was providing Hanni with data she could use to get the Passengers ' Bill of Rights passed .
According to an affidavit from Foreman , the e-mails came from Foreman 's private Hotmail and Yahoo accounts .
Metron told Foreman that Delta had provided it with copies of his private e-mail correspondence .
Hanni is suing Delta and Metron to determine how they obtained the e-mails and her personal files .
She 's asking for at least $ 1 million in actual damages and $ 10 million in punitive damages .

Noel Sharkey thinks artificial intelligence is an illusion ( Image : Rex Features )
Robotics expert Noel Sharkey used to be a believer in artificial intelligence .
So why does he now think that AI is a dangerous myth that could lead to a dystopian future of unintelligent , unfeeling robot carers and soldiers ?
Nic Fleming finds out
What do you mean when you talk about artificial intelligence ?
I like AI pioneer Marvin Minsky ‘s definition of AI as the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by humans .
However , some very smart human things can be done in dumb ways by machines .

The Treasury has announced new " capital cushion " requirements for financial institutions to reduce excessive risk and prevent taxpayer bailouts .
Seems sensible enough .
Perhaps the Administration will even impose those safety and soundness standards on federal agencies .
One place to start is the Federal Housing Administration , the nation 's insurer of nearly $ 750 billion in outstanding mortgages .
The agency acknowledged this month that a new but still undisclosed HUD audit has found that FHA 's cash reserve fund is rapidly depleting ...
In deciding whether to welcome Mr. Prokhorov to their ranks , the owners will have much to consider .
Known as the bachelor billionaire , with a penchant for lavish parties , Mr. Prokhorov started out selling jeans in Moscow in the late 1980s and worked his way up from there .
Last April , he was pressured by the Russian government into selling his large stake in Norilsk Nickel just before the world financial crisis struck the Russian stock market .
For Mr. Prokhorov , it was a stroke of good fortune .
He ended up with a huge amount of cash  the business magazine Finans estimates his worth at $ 14.9 billion  while some of his fellow tycoons had tremendous losses .
Through his company , the Onexim Group , he still maintains an interest in other metals companies , including the Russian aluminum giant UC Rusal .
His interest in basketball appears genuine .
He played the sport when he was younger  he is described as being anywhere from 6 feet 6 inches to 6 feet 9 inches in height  and he owns a share of the Russian team CSKA Moscow .
In a blog post , he stated that one of the main motivations in pursuing the Nets was to improve the quality and financial health of basketball in Russia .
He said he envisioned a process in which his ownership of the Nets would encourage the use of N.B.A. training techniques in Russia , allow the best young Russian players to attend N.B.A. training camps and also allow for Russian coaches to serve internships in the N.B.A .
All that will probably sound fine to N.B.A. owners , and the most outspoken of the group , Mark Cuban of the Dallas Mavericks , was quick to give Mr. Prokhorov his backing on Wednesday , saying : “ I love the idea .
It will bring a whole new perspective and , with the dollar struggling , an entree to new financial markets . ”
Still , some parts of Mr. Prokhorov ’s past may give some owners pause .
In January 2007 , he was arrested while on vacation at a French ski resort on suspicion he was supplying prostitutes to wealthy friends .
He was kept in custody for several days before the charges were dropped , and he has vowed not to do business again in France until he gets an apology .
He was driving a fully - laden water tanker to a fuel reduction burn that had skipped control lines outside Marysville .
Michael Tinney , SC , prosecuting , said Beckett later told investigators he panicked when he saw the van and tried to avoid it .
Mr Tinney said it was the Director of Public Prosecutions ' position that Beckett should not receive any form of a jail sentence given the unique circumstances of the case .
Defence counsel Robert Richter , QC , said the request by Angela 's family that Beckett not be jailed was dignified and humane , while his client 's level of moral culpability was minimal .
But in his sentencing today , Judge Les Ross there were few crimes that caused such suffering as dangerous driving causing death .

The Swedish Presidency has invited Bulgaria to be a co-author of a project of a legal framework , allowing transfer of criminal jurisdiction within the EU .
So far , such a framework existed in the Council of Europe organisation , which was ratified by only 13 of its numerous members around the continent , Bulgaria including and which proved inefficient .
This is the reason why the EU has decided to create its own legal mechanism .
Although Bulgaria has accepted to be a co-author of the framework , still there are many questions that remain with no answers .
Among the conditions for requiring a transfer of criminal jurisdiction are : when the crime has been committed entirely or partially in a EU member state , foreign to the perpetrator , when the perpetrator is a citizen of one country but has committed a crime in another and when a large part of the evidence is in a country , different from the one that is a stage of the crime .
An example could be the Borilski case in which two Bulgarian citizens have murdered another Bulgarian in Paris .
But the representative of the Bulgarian Ministry of Justice Mr. Florian Florov who participated in the European Affairs Council yesterday , could not explain whether a member state whose citizen has committed a crime in another , has the right to require to proceed with legal activities according to its own legislation .
As was the case with the English football fan Michael Shields .
He was sentenced to prison for the murder of a Bulgarian bartender in Bulgaria but was sent to serve his sentence in the UK and was later released .
Mr. Florian Florov tried to explain that the only purpose of the new legal framework would be to simplify the cooperation among the competent bodies in the EU member states .
He added that there is nothing new , because elements of the framework are included in the national Penal Code of Procedure , in articles 478 and onward that settle the transfer of legal jurisdiction .
In spite of this , the idea of the project is other EU member states to join it too .
But it is possible that countries like the UK might reject it as they have an opt - out in their accession treaties with regard to justice and home affairs .
Mr. Florov also found it difficult to say whether if this framework is adopted it would lead to a change in the national legislation .
The issue will be discussed at the Council of justice and home affairs in Luxembourg on the 23rd of October .

Jerry ’s World
The Dallas Cowboys new stadium of course !
First conceived 15 years ago , owner Jerry Jones has finally realized his vision of creating an entertainment Mecca in the city of Arlington , Texas .
The stadium will also host College bowl games , major concerts , the 2011 Super Bowl and any event that requires 3 million square feet of space .
Did we mention the world ’s largest HDTV ?
Let ’s take a closer look at the one of the biggest domes on Earth .
Ronald Martinez / Getty Images
ARCHITECTURE
– Cowboys Stadium replaces the open-air Texas Stadium , which opened in 1971 , as the Cowboys ’ home .
It was completed on May 29 , 2009 and seats 80,000 , but is expandable to seat up to 111,000
– The Stadium was designed by the Dallas - based architectural firm HKS
– It is the largest domed stadium in the world and has the world ’s largest column - free interior
– The Cowboys Stadium site covers 73 total acres and the overall site encompasses approximately 140 total acres
– The stadium itself is approximately 3 million square feet containing 104 million cubic feet of volume
– The 180 - foot - wide by 120 - foot - high operable glass doors , located at each end of the stadium , are the largest operable glass doors in the world and take 18 minutes to open or close
– At 660,800 square feet , the stadium ’s roof is one of the largest domed sports structures in the world , opening 410 feet long by 256 feet wide with each panel weighing 1.68 million pounds
– Each roof panel is 215 feet long consists of 14,100 tons of structural steel and opens or closes in 12 minutes
– The stadium features a pair of nearly 300 feet ( 91 m ) tall arches that span the length of the stadium dome , anchored to the ground at each end
– The length from one end zone retractable wall to the opposite end zone retractable wall is a staggering 900 feet
– With 180,000 square feet of free space , the stadium accommodates more SRO ( standing room only ) fans than any other NFL venue

FINANCIALS
– Originally estimated to cost $ 650 million , the stadium ’s current construction cost has been pegged between $ 1.12 and $ 1.3 billion , making it one of the most expensive sports venues ever built
– The City of Arlington provided over $ 933 million ( including interest ) in bonds as funding , and Jones covered any cost overruns .
The NFL also provided the Cowboys with an additional $ 150 million , as per their policy for giving teams a certain lump sum of money for stadium financing
– The average ticket to a Cowboys game costs $ 159.65 , a record for the Fan Cost Index survey , which dates to 1991 .
The New England Patriots previously had the priciest ticket in pro sports and that cost remained the same at $ 117.84
– There is the $ 150,000 down payment required of season - ticket holders for 30 years of seats — which does n’t include ticket prices
– Suites will range from $ 100,000 to $ 500,000 per year .
That lease will include tickets to Cowboys games , but not third - party events
– According to the Cowboys , the 20 - inch pizzas at the new stadium will cost $ 60 .
There will be five different types of pizza available for that price .
Beer will be sold for $ 5
– On October 20 , 2008 , Cowboys owner Jones and New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner announced a joint business venture called Legends Hospitality Management LLC which would operate the concessions and merchandising sales at the new Cowboys stadium and at the new Yankee Stadium , along with the stadiums of the Yankees ’ minor league affiliates
– Former Pizza Hut President Michael Rawlings will run the company from its new headquarters in Newark , New Jersey .
The company was also backed by Wall Street investment firm Goldman Sachs and Dallas private equity firm CIC Partners LP

TECHNOLOGY
– The stadium includes more than 3,000 Sony LCD displays throughout the luxury suites , concourses , concession areas and more , offering fans viewing options that extend beyond the action on the field .
– It also features the largest high - definition television in the world .
The 160 x 72 foot ( 49 m × 22 m ) , 11,520 - square - foot ( 1,070 m2 ) scoreboard surpasses the 8,736 sq ft ( 812 m2 ) screen that opened in 2009 at the renovated Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City , Missouri .
The total cost was $ 40 million USD
– The screens were developed by Mitsubishi ’s Diamond Vision Systems .
Each center - hung sideline display consists of 10,584,064 LEDs , consuming some 635,000 watts .
– Since each pixel consists of four LEDs ( 2 red , 1 green , 1 blue ) , the 2,176 X 4,864 LED distribution corresponds to a 1,088 X 2,432 pixel resolution , the equivalent of 1080
p
– However the image can actually be considerably sharper than the resolution suggests , because Diamond Vision ’s “ Dynamic Pixel ” technology allows the corner LEDs of four neighbouring pixel clusters to function as a pixel cluster together , providing virtual pixels between each physical pixel
– The total size of all of the video displays inside the new Cowboys stadium is equal to 25,000 square feet .
The total size of the ribbon video boards circling the inside of the stadium is equal to 11,000 square feet

MISCELLANEOUS
– On March 10 , 2008 , Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones , joined by officials and coaches from Texas A&M University and the University of Arkansas ( Jones ’ alma mater ) , announced that the two schools would renew their rivalry with annual games at the stadium , beginning October 3 , 2009
– The stadium will also host Super Bowl XLV in 2011 , beating out bids from the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale , Arizona and Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis , Indiana
– It will also host the 2009 Big XII Football Championship and Cotton Bowl , the 2010 NBA All - Star Game and the 2014 men ’s Final Four
– The first regular season game at the Cowboys Stadium set an NFL regular - season attendance record with a crowd of 105,121 on Sunday night ( September 20 , 2009 )
– Prior to Sunday ’s matchup the largest crowd for an NFL regular - season game was 103,467 for Arizona - San Francisco in Mexico City in 2005 .
The record for a game in the United States was 103,985 for the Super Bowl between Steelers and Rams at the Rose Bowl in January 1980
– The record for any NFL game is still 112,376 for a pre-season game between the Cowboys and Houston Oilers in Mexico City in 1994
– The screens are the greatest source of debate thus far because they hang only 90 feet above the field and were hit by a punt in the pre-season opener .
If it happens again , the NFL has stated it will be ruled a dead ball and a do - over .
If it happens often , the league will likely force the Cowboys to raise them before next season

Video : Rubbery objects can control a computer
Consumers are now familiar with prodding at hard glass or plastic screens to interact with computers , phones and other gadgets .
But a new Japanese prototype has a touch interface with a squeezy , rubbery feel .
The system is based on a large LCD panel built into a tabletop .
Users interact with it by moving objects sculpted in transparent rubber over its surface , or by poking or deforming them to produce particular effects .
The system was built by Hideki Koike and colleagues at the University of Electro - Communications in Tokyo , Japan , working with Kentaro Fukuchi at the Japan Science and Technology Agency .
The LCD panel emits light polarised in a particular way , but a camera positioned overhead can only see light polarised in the opposite direction and so usually sees nothing .
Because the transparent rubber objects diffract light differently depending on how they are stretched or compressed , deforming them changes the light polarisation enough to let the camera track what is happening .

Rubber face
The team has demonstrated the technology through some simple applications .
In one of these , a rubber face sits above an image of a face on the LCD ; squeezing the rubber features alters the expression .
A second application involves rubber shapes that act as virtual paint sponges ; the user has to squeeze them to “ drip ” paint onto the LCD below ( see video ) .
“ You can easily imagine applying this to many fields , ” says Koike .
For instance , he suggests that a 3D model of the brain built from the material could give trainee surgeons feedback on their technique as they “ operate ” on it .
“ One disadvantage of our system is the overhead camera , ” he concedes .
As well as making the system less - than - compact , the camera can sometimes fail to register a squeeze because the user ’s hand gets in the way .
“ In future , it will be possible to embed the camera inside the LCD , ” Koike says .
Tangible future
Fukuchi says that providing tangible 3D objects to interact with is a “ major trend of display - based interaction ” .
He thinks they will become increasingly common , as touchscreens have in recent years .
Patrick Baudisch at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam , Germany , agrees .
He recently developed smart building blocks that a Microsoft Surface interactive tabletop can recognise and track in 3D .
Baudisch is impressed with the rubbery interface developed by Koike and Fukuchi ’s team : “ Other systems had sensed pressure against a table – [ this one ] senses pressure anywhere on the camera ’s field of view on any silicone object being squeezed . ”
The Japanese team presented their work at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology in Victoria , Canada , this week .
On October 16 , 1953 , Fidel Castro made a four - hour speech , but it was n’t one of his long stem - winders to his followers .
It was a speech he gave as a prisoner , while being tried in court for leading a small group of rebels in an attack on the Moncada military barracks in Cuba on July 26th .
The remarks Castro made during his trial included his famous quotation : “ History will absolve me . ” ( “ La historia me absolver . ” )
The Moncada Barracks attack was an attempt to start an insurrection against the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista .
It failed at the time and the men involved were either killed or captured by Batista ’s soldiers .
But it turned out to be the beginning of the “ Cuban Revolution . ”
The historical record makes it pretty clear why the revolution happened .
Fulgencio Batista was a ruthless dictator .
And , he got rich taking cuts and bribes from the U.S. corporations that ran most of Cuba ’s major industries and from the American mobsters who ran most of the hotels and casinos in Havana .
Meanwhile , most Cubans were poor , uneducated , ill - housed and disenfranchised .
In his remarks at his October 16 , 1953 trial , Castro reviewed the many political crimes of Batista and his illegitimate presidency .
The entire speech is famous among Marxists , but most books of quotations just give the “ History will absolve me ” line .
Batista made the mistake of not executing Castro after he was found guilty at the trial .
Instead , Fidel was put in prison and then – in an even bigger blunder – Batista allowed him to be released in 1955 , thinking he was no longer a serious threat .
The following year , Fidel , his brother Raul Castro , and Che Guevara began organizing disgruntled Cuban peasants into a growing revolutionary army .
A few years later they succeeded in driving Batista out of the country ( along with the American corporations and the mob ) .
For a brief time , it seemed like a victory for the Cuban people and potentially for democracy , since Castro had pledged to restore a democratic government .
Then , of course , Castro became a Communist , made himself the semi - godlike ruler of the country and brutally crushed any dissent .
History may absolve Castro for ousting the ruthless dictator Batista .
But I doubt if any honest historical accounts absolve Castro for becoming a ruthless dictator himself .
Here are some of the other famous quotes and phrases linked to October 16 :
When you ’re a successful producer and a slightly less successful solo artist , you can do stuff like cover a bunch of attractive , scantily clad women in green goo to use them in sort of advanced music nerd ’s science project in order to promote your new single .
Harris ’ babetastic recreation of his latest single , “ Ready for the Weekend , ” actually works out a lot better than you might think .
Any chance he ’ll be taking these girls on tour ?

I have been following the goings - on and happenings of a thriving community of atheists on reddit.com ( one of the less disreputable social news websites ) .
It is really comical to see this aggregate of supposedly free thinkers evolve along the lines of a gathering cult .
They strike me as extremely arrogant , unpleasant with anyone who does not follow strictly their ( at the moment confusingly ) evolving dogmas , and full of so many contradictions it would take me too much time to list .
I have my own little theory of why such atheist communities seem to evolve so much along the lines of an organized religion ; trying to convince others of their own righteousness ; intolerant of any opposition ; based around cliques of like minded people ; developing their own myths and lines of argument ; encouraging and supporting each other in their ( non ) - faith , etc .
It seems indeed that quite many of those atheists are ex-believers who have grown very disenchanted with their experience of religion , religions they often have encountered only in their most fundamentalist forms .
However , this disenchantment does not come with proper understanding of its sources , and without proper understanding of how religion has ingrained into them habits of minds and attitudes that are intolerant , inflexible and disrespectful of others ' integrity .
So basically , my thesis is that atheists are the rejects of the most extreme forms of religion in the US .
Not surprisingly , they find it difficult to digest their experience of rejection , which translates in bitterness and barely controlled anger towards religious people .
For example , there seems to be a gathering trend towards a more militant type of atheism , apparently prompted by the belief that atheism is under attack or that religious people have dominated for too long .
I saw them recently praising the actions of an atheist who aggressively preached to and harassed two clueless Jehovah 's Witnesses http://www.reddit.com/tb/9i3bi ) .
Other atheists in the UK for example have been circulating adverts claiming the inexistence of god(s ) ( http://www.atheistbus.org.uk/faq/ ) .
I am afraid I do not quite understand the sources of this militant atheism , and have little affinity with their special types of arguments and with the intricacies of the conflicts between their different churches .
It seems like Dawkins et alii have unwittingly attracted a number of rather second rate intellects to their cause .
The demographics of current adherents of the atheistic faith seems to consist mainly of disgruntled middle - class white men intent on using their new set of belief to humiliate and dominate other semi-educated individuals .
Goes to show how beliefs , any kind of belief and knowledge can always be misused when it falls into the hands of the essentially inferior , testosterone - fuelled half of humanity ( half , that is , when using the term " humanity " in its broadest sense ) .
Warning : the analysis of this song deals with disturbing subject matters .
What is Rihanna ’s Umbrella song about ?
First times I ’ve heard this song , I was confused .
Is it about a woman ’s unconditional friendship for her man ?
Is it a “ sexy song ” ?
At face value , it seems so .
However , if you listen closely to Rihanna and Jay - Z ’s words , you might notice that the lyrics do not make any sense .
The vocabulary used in this song is not about a relationship between two lovers .
The fact is , Umbrella is about a subject matter that is sinister , dark and disturbing : becoming possessed by evil .
What does “ under my umbrella ” mean ?
In a nutshell , the song talks about a storm that ’s about to take place and Rihanna offers her loved one protection under her umbrella .
In this song , “ You can stand under my umbrella ” can have a sexual connotation but it mostly means “ You can be under my protection ” .
When you are under something ’s protection , this something has more power than you regarding your own security .
You depend on it .
It has control over you .
IT possesses you .
The song is not about love between woman and man , it ’s about being protected .
It is not an equal relationship .
The one that protects basically owns the person that is protected .
Analyzing the song
The first thing that you need to know about the song ’s lyrics is that Rihanna sings the whole song but she actually takes on two roles .
During the first half of the song , she plays the role of an evil entity that is trying to seduce and possess Rihanna .
For the purpose of this analysis , we ’ll call this entity the Devil .
The second role she plays is herself .
So the song is basically a dialog between the Devil and Rihanna .
The video of the song makes this very clear and we ’ll explain how later .
What is possession ?
Possession , in relationship to non-human entities , deals with the phenomena wherein a non-human entity controls the human being through various methods .
In possession , the human being cannot think for themselves .
Instead , their thoughts are given to them by their possessor .
We ’ll see how the Devil tries and succeeds at possessing Rihanna in this song .
There is a reason why the album is called “ Good Girl Gone Bad ” .
Jay - Z’s verse
So the song starts off with a verse of rapper Jay - Z .
He plays the role of someone that has already been possessed and already “ under the umbrella ” of the Devil .
Here ’s his verse :
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain , I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone , we Rocafella
We fly higher than weather
And G5 ’s are better , You know me ,
an anticipation , for precipitation .
Stacked chips for the rainy day
Jay , Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where you at ?
Explanation
“ No clouds in my stones
Let it rain , I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones ”
So the “ storm ” is in fact related to the economy and the financial world .
“ Coming down with the Dow Jones ” reflects this situation .
The Dow Jones is the main indicator of the health of the stock market .
If it plummets , we can talk about a market crash .
You ’ll notice that the whole song has a pessimistic outlook concerning the future .
Jay - Z is saying “ Let it rain ” , he does n’t care about the financial crisis , he “ hydroplanes in the bank ” .
In other words , while the bank is being flooded by this storm and people are drowning in it , he ’s above the water and surviving the crisis .
When the clouds come we gone , we Rocafella
In other words , when the financial crisis will occur , we wo n’t be here to suffer through it .
“ Rocafella ” is the name of Jay - Z ’s record label .
It also refers to John D. Rockefeller and his family , the biggest industrialists in American History and huge actors in the formation of the social - economic world we ’re currently living in .
Many historians claim the Rockefellers have engineered the crash of 1929 to be able to obtain a stronghold on America ’s banking system .
Congressman Charles A. Lindberg Sr. accurately proclaimed in 1930 : “ From now on depressions will be scientifically created . ”
We fly higher than weather
And G5 ’s are better , You know me ,
“ We fly higher than the weather ” means that Jay - Z cannot be affected by the financial crisis because he is above the problem .
He enjoys a protection that makes him invulnerable to the storm .
The fact that he says “ WE fly higher than the weather ” implies that a select few can have the same kind of privileges he has .
G5 is a kind of private jet so he will live in luxury even when the crisis strikes the rest of the world .
an anticipation , for precipitation .
Stacked chips for the rainy day
Jay - Z says here that he was expecting this major crisis ( the precipitation ) and so he has prepared financially to face it .
Seems like he had prior knowledge of the events that would occur in the future .
Is he talking about the recession that is happening now ?
Jay , Rain Man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where you at ?
Jay aka “ Rain Man ” .
He has been possessed by the Devil , contrarily to Rihanna , who he calls “ little Ms. Sunshine ” .
Rihanna is the good girl .
Jay - Z is already bad and he is asking Rihanna to join him .
So Jay - Z lyrics have NOTHING to do with love , friendship or any type of relationship .
His lyrics are saying that he is part of the “ chosen ” , the elite , the secret group that cannot be harmed by the trials and tribulations of the “ small people ” .
Even if there ’s a major crisis , he ’s associated with the very people that make those crises happen , so he wo n’t be affected .
This group , however , bows down and worships evil .
If Rihanna wants to be part of them , she has to do the same .
Rihanna ’s lyrics
You have my heart
And we ’ll never be worlds apart
May be in magazines
But you ’ll still be my star
Baby cause in the dark
You ca n’t see shiny cars
And that ’s when you need me there
With you I ’ll always share
Rihanna sings this part , but it is actually the Devil talking to Rihanna .
He is “ sweet - talking ” her so she can accept the idea of the Devil entering her body .
Here ’s how we can translate the lyrics .
I love you
Even if I ’m not from your world , I ’ll never be far from you
You may be famous and in magazines
But you ’ll always be MY star , nobody else ’s
Because when you wo n’t be successful anymore
When you wo n’t be able to buy shiny cars and material things
That ’s when you ’ll need my protection
With you I ’ll always share my riches
So the Devil is offering Rihanna a lifetime of riches and luxury , even when she ’ll lose her popularity and stop generating money from her singing career .
Tempting , is n’t it ?
Chorus
When the sun shines , we ’ll shine together
Told you I ’ll be here forever
Said I ’ll always be your friend
Took an oath I ’ma stick it out till the end
Now it ’s raining more than ever
But we ’ll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella ( Ella ella eh eh eh eh )
Under my umbrella
( Ella ella eh eh eh )
Under my umbrella
( Ella ella eh eh eh )
Under my umbrella
( Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh )
Translation :
When you shine from your success , we both profit from it
I will always be part of you
I will always be on your side
I promised you I would protect you and I will do it as long as necessary
Now the financial crisis is afflicting the world
But I ’m still here with you
You can be under my protection
You can be under my protection
What ’s up with the Ella Ella eh’s ?
It sounds catchy , does n’t it ?
The repetitive and hypnotic rhythm of this chant makes it very reminiscent of magical spells , conjurations or summons .
2nd Verse
These fancy things , will never come in between
You ’re part of my entity , here for Infinity
When the war has took it ’s part
When the world has dealt it ’s cards
If the hand is hard , together we ’ll mend your heart
Translation :
All of your material possessions will never separate me and you
You ’re part of my entity , I own you , until the end of times
When the crisis has ravaged the world
When we ’ll know the final outcome of the world
If you ’re in trouble , me and you will stop the pain
“ You ’re part of my entity ” is very relevant here because “ entity ” is not a word in the vocabulary used between loved ones .
Nobody will say to his / her lover “ You ’re part of my entity ” .
An entity is not human .
An entity is something that has a distinct , separate existence , though it need not be a material existence .
- Wikipedia
“ Here for Infinity ” also gives a non -human feel to the lyrics , as if this power does n’t live or die , it is immortal .
“ When the war has took it ’s part / When the world has dealt it ’s cards ” is a particularly gloomy passage .
It basically predicts a terrible event that will strike severely the entire world and that will rearrange the way it will function afterward .
Once again , we refer to a huge crisis that is about to occur and the Devil is trying to convince Rihanna to let him protect her .
Bridge
You can run into my arms
It ’s okay do n’t be alarmed
Come into me
There ’s no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I ’ll be all you need and more
Because
This part is actually a dialogue between the Devil and Rihanna .
It is difficult to notice because there ’s no difference in the tone of voice .
The video , however , gives a visual clue of the dialogue by reversing the image when Rihanna answers the Devil .
So , the Devil is telling Rihanna
“ You can run into my arms
It ’s okay do n’t be alarmed ”
Translation :
“ You can come and seek my protection
Do n’t be scared of the crisis ”
Rihanna answers “ Come into me ” as in “ come inside of my body and possess me ”
Both Rihanna and Devil say : “ There ’s no distance between our love ” .
The Devil is effectively now INSIDE of her , there ’s no more distance between them .
And the Devil finishes by saying :
“ So go on and let the rain pour
I ’ll be all you need and more ”
Translation :
Let the world get what it deserves , I ’ll take care of you .
So now that you probably gained another perspective on the song ’s lyrics , we can proceed to analyze the video , which carries HEAVY symbolism and confirms the theory of the Devil trying to possess Rihanna .
The video also adds a layer of interpretation by depicting the process of possession as a rape .
Analyzing the video
At the beginning , we see Jay - Z with six black - clad women .
As previously stated , Jay - Z is already possessed in the song .
The six women represent Jay - Z ’s thoughts being controlled .
We see Rihanna dressed in black and wearing a top - hat , a visual clue to represent the evil entity , which is masculine .
The long , claw - like fingernails give a sense of a demonic , ungodly creature .
When Rihanna starts singing , she moves in a sexually seductive way to reflect the Devil ’s attempt to seduce Rihanna .
He wants to possess her not only mentally but physically also .
The picture above is the explosion we see in the video right after the first verse .
This explosion of chrome - colored liquid represents something truly disturbing : the rape of Rihanna by the Devil .
The frame above represents the rape of Rihanna .
Dressed in white and thus embodying “ the good girl with values ” , Rihanna dances while performing defensive gestures .
She is trying to protect herself from the chrome liquid , which represents the seminal fluid of the Devil .
The liquid hits her a total of 6 times .
We then see Rihanna naked , covered in chrome - colored liquid .
Rihanna has been raped by the Devil and covered with his s---n .
She seems in pain and not herself .
On the frame above we see her inside a triangle .
This is VERY symbolic .
For occultists , an upwards triangle represents the phallus , the p---s , male energy .
Rihanna is inside the triangle .
She is completely “ owned ” and under the spell of the Devil ’s energy .
=
Look closely at the frame above .
It appears very briefly at around 2:46 in the video .
It is Rihanna on her knees , her head on the floor .
It ’s also something else : the face of the Devil !
It has been made to look like “ Baphomet ” ( see image ) , who is an intricate part of occult mysteries .
You see the two eyes , snout and the antlers .
This frame has been digitally manipulated to look like this because it is anatomically incorrect .
No human can assume this position in real life .
This image has been placed on purpose and only for a fraction of a second .
Classic subliminal message .
So Rihanna has been abused and we saw the face of the Devil , so what ’s next ?
Rihanna has now become the “ Bad Girl ” dressed in black .
She is surrounded by 6 black - clad men ( like Jay - Z at the beginning ) , to represent her state of possession .
She dances suggestively with a closed umbrella , which represents a phallus .
The Devil has won , he has taken over Rihanna .
And she is asking for more .
At the end of the song , Rihanna asks her rapists to come into her again .
Sick .
It ’s raining
Ooh baby it ’s raining
Baby come into me
Come into me
It ’s raining
Oh baby it ’s raining
The “ ooh baby ” makes it clear that we ’re not talking about raindrops falling from the sky .
It means she is wet and ready to welcome the Devil again inside her .
The analysis of Rihanna ’s Umbrella was to prove the fact that the general public is blind to the hidden messages omnipresent in mass media .
Kids from all over the world sing and dance to this song while registering unconsciously the hidden layers of symbolism .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
More than twice as many former British servicemen are in prison , on probation or on parole than are serving in Afghanistan , the Guardian reported on Friday .
According to probation officers ’ union Napo , some 20,000 veterans are in the criminal justice system , with 8,500 of them in jail , making up almost 10 percent of the prison population , the Guardian said .
“ There is overwhelming evidence that support is not available of sufficient calibre when soldiers leave the service , ” Harry Fletcher , Napo ’s assistant general secretary , told the newspaper .
“ The preponderance of post - traumatic stress disorder and depression is also alarming . ”
The Napo survey of 90 cases of convicted veterans found nearly half suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder or depression as a result of their experiences in Northern Ireland , Bosnia , Iraq and Afghanistan .
The proportion of Britain ’s prison population who are veterans has risen by more than 30 percent in the last five years , according to the report .

Yes , it took thirty three seizures , 5 appeals , 4 years and 3 lawyers but Karen Jones was finally declared disabled and was granted full disability which included full health care coverage , far from an easy feat but quite reassuring to Karen as she continued on through life .
Unable to work due to her disability , Karen lived alone off of the $ 563 disability check each month as best she could , regularly robbing Peter to pay Paul , but all along able to make ends meet from check to check , and doing so always with a smile .
Even though times were really harder than Karen lead others to know she was thankful for the roof over her head , her access to medical care when needed , her monthly check and the ability to basically survive , which may be the reason that she developed the characteristic of never asking for help from others regardless of how much she may have needed it at times .
So she did n't like the fact that she had to trouble a neighbor to take her to emergency on Wednesday but she just could n't breathe well .
After the diagnosis that pneumonia was the culprit Karen signed the final papers as her prescription form was being handed to her .
" Get this filled , take 4 of these per day and this will clear up your breathing " were the directions given as Karen prepared to go home , wheezing profusely along the way .
The neighbor takes her directly to the pharmacy which is where Karen is told that this much needed medication will cost her $ 197 .
It 's the end of the month , funds are extremely low , and Karen is far from having an extra couple hundred dollars laying around , so she goes home , takes some extra inhales from her breathing machine , and decides to toughen it out until the first of the month , just a few days away , when she 'll get her next check and have the money to buy her medicine .
Being a prideful , independent woman Karen continues to tough it out each day never showing to others her true discomfort or need .
All day long on Thursday and Friday Karen constantly thinks to herself how much she wishes she had been able to afford to buy the medicine as she does a mental countdown to the first of the month with every inhale through her machine .
" I should n't have paid the light bill ... I should have bought less food " are just a couple of the thoughts that haunt Karen as she figures ways she could have had the much needed money .
And on that Friday night as she lay in bed she takes a few extra puffs from her breathing machine to get her through the night .
On the early eve of Saturday morning around 4:30 or so , Karen Jones , my only sister , died , age 51 .
Apparently , around 4:00 she had severe difficulties breathing , strained to call a neighbor who immediately got dressed and came down to the house , knocked on the door like crazy but there was no answer .
Feeling great concern a call was made to the police who quickly arrived , gained access into the house , and there lie Karen , dead on the floor , beside her breathing machine .
Although we all were well aware of Karen 's history of sicknesses I never expected my sister to die at such an early age .
Of course I am of great sorrow and pain over the loss of my sister but I am also very angry with our health care system .
I am angry , no actually in shock by the fact that my sister , Karen was declared to have full health care coverage through her disability benefits .
But since it did not cover her medication , which she could not afford to buy out of pocket , my sister died with this so - called full coverage .
What kind of full coverage does one really have if they are forced to pay for expensive medications out of their measly $ 563 monthly check ?
I truly believe that if my sister had had her medication she would be alive today .
It is absolutely disgraceful that our health care system has the gall to claim they are supplying full health care benefits to the disabled while simultaneous depriving them of the very medicines needed for survival .
Believe it or not , you could say Karen was actually one of the lucky ones only needing one medication compared to others who frequently need 2 and 3 medications , at costs which exceed their entire monthly check .
So many who are sick , struggling and classified as fully covered are are in fact struggling helplessly , going without vitally important medications .
Throughout the health care reform debate many have argued that there is no need for strong reform of our system .
Most others though do recognize the severe need to reform health care coverage in our country so that we no longer have 47 million Americans who have absolutely no health care at all .
47 million who do not have the basic right to get medical help when they are sick .
This is sad and pathetic .
Recently , an organization , RAM , known for offering free medical care in the Amazon has been forced to offer their services right here in our country .
In Los Angeles , in Iowa and other U.S. locales , hard working Americans who can't afford health care coverage line - up by the thousands for free , much needed health care , similar to scenes in third world countries .
And while we must make certain that health care reform addresses the needs of the uncovered we must also make certain that we address the needs of the category now known as the under - covered .
These are the people who have health care coverage but for one reason or another , tend to find out the hard way , usually when they are sick , that their coverage was n't as ' full ' as they thought .
Of course , it will haunt me forever as to why my sister did n't pick up the phone and ask me for the money , but folks that know her know , that 's just Karen .
And there are millions of other Karens out there , in desperate need and dire straits , but too independent to ask for much needed help .
It is our responsibility , our duty to do everything we can to help the 47 million uncovered and the additional millions of under - covered to have the basic right to true health care coverage .
I hope my sister 's passing did not include suffering .
And now , even more , I hope that we all across this great land , will unite , do the right thing and pass a strong health reform bill which includes a strong public option so that we can curtail the suffering of millions more ahead .
We must fight for the 47 million and the Karen Jones 's of America .
This is a battle that must be won !

AMES , Iowa – Srinivas Aluru recently stepped between the two rows of six tall metal racks , opened up the silver doors and showed off the 3,200 computer processor cores that power Cystorm , Iowa State University 's second supercomputer .
And there 's a lot of raw power in those racks .
Cystorm , a Sun Microsystems machine , boasts a peak performance of 28.16 trillion calculations per second .
That 's five times the peak of CyBlue , an IBM Blue Gene / L supercomputer that 's been on campus since early 2006 and uses 2,048 processors to do 5.7 trillion calculations per second .
Aluru , the Ross Martin Mehl and Marylyne Munas Mehl Professor of Computer Engineering and the leader of the Cystorm project , said the new machine also scores high on a more realistic test of a supercomputer 's actual performance : 15.44 trillion calculations per second compared to CyBlue 's 4.7 trillion per second .
That measure makes Cystorm 3.3 times more powerful than CyBlue .
Those performance numbers , however , do not earn Cystorm a spot on the TOP500 list of the world 's fastest supercomputers .
( When CyBlue went online three years ago , it was the 99th most powerful supercomputer on the list . )
" Cystorm is going to be very good for data - intensive research projects , " Aluru said .
" The capabilities of Cystorm will help Iowa State researchers do new , pioneering research in their fields . "
The supercomputer is targeted for work in materials science , power systems and systems biology .
Srinivas Aluru , left , and Steve Nystrom have worked for months to connect cables and cooling hoses and otherwise get Iowa State University 's second supercomputer up to speed .
( Photo Credit : Photo by Bob Elbert / Iowa State University )
Aluru said materials scientists will use the supercomputer to analyze data from the university 's Local Electrode Atom Probe microscope , an instrument that can gather data and produce images at the atomic scale of billionths of a meter .
Systems biologists will use the supercomputer to build gene networks that will help researchers understand how thousands of genes interact with each other .
Power systems researchers will use the supercomputer to study the security , reliability and efficiency of the country 's energy infrastructure .
And computer engineers will use the supercomputer to build a software infrastructure that helps users make decisions by identifying relevant information sources .
" These research efforts will lead to significant advances in the penetration of high performance computing technology , " says a summary of the Cystorm project .
" The project will bring together multiple departments and research centers at Iowa State University and further enrich interdisciplinary culture and training opportunities . "
Joining Aluru on the Cystorm project are five Iowa State researchers : Maneesha Aluru , an associate scientist in electrical and computer engineering and genetics , development and cell biology ; Baskar Ganapathysubramanian , an assistant professor and William March Scholar in Mechanical Engineering ; James McCalley , the Harpole Professor in Electrical Engineering ; Krishna Rajan , a professor of materials science and engineering ; and Arun Somani , an Anson Marston Distinguished Professor in Engineering and Jerry R. Junkins Endowed Chair of electrical and computer engineering .
Steve Nystrom , a systems support specialist for the department of electrical and computer engineering , is the system administrator for Cystorm .
The researchers purchased the computer with a $ 719,000 grant from the National Science Foundation , $ 400,000 from Iowa State colleges , departments and researchers , and a $ 200,000 equipment donation from Sun Microsystems .
Because of Cystorm , the computer company will designate Iowa State a Sun Microsystems Center of Excellence for Engineering Informatics and Systems Biology .
While Cystorm is much more powerful than CyBlue , Aluru said Iowa State 's first supercomputer will still be used by researchers across campus .
" CyBlue will still be around , " Aluru said .
" Researchers will use both systems to solve problems .
Both systems enhance the research capabilities of Iowa State . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The New York Times said on Monday it would cut 100 newsroom jobs through buyouts or layoffs as it tries to counter lost advertising revenue .
A man speaks on his mobile photo in front of the New York Times building in New York City May 21 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Joel Boh
“ Let me cut to the chase :
We have been told to reduce the newsroom by 100 positions between now and the end of the year . ”
Times Executive Editor Bill Keller told employees in a memo obtained by Reuters .
This is the second time in little more than a year that the Times has sought to reduce its newsroom staff .
In 2008 , the newspaper cut 100 newsroom jobs .
Earlier this year , it cut salaries by 5 percent .
“ When we took our 5 percent pay cuts , it was in the hope that this would fend off the need for more staff cuts this year , ” Keller wrote in the memo .
“ But I accept that if it ’s going to happen , it should be done quickly .
We will get through this and move on . ”
The newspaper has 1,250 editorial employees , down from 1,330 , the Times reported on its website .
It said no other U.S. newspaper has more than about 750 journalists .
The New York Times
Co , which owns the newspaper , plans to report third - quarter results on Thursday .
The company has experienced declines in advertising and mounting debt that have forced it to cut costs and sell assets .
Many publishers , including USA Today publisher Gannett Co Inc , which reported its quarterly results on Monday , have had the same problems .
Last week , the Times stopped trying to sell The Boston Globe .
It had threatened to close that newspaper unless its unions agreed to cut costs .
It also has been trying to sell its stake in the company that owns the Boston Red Sox professional baseball team .
BUYOUT BUY-IN
Many staffers who are union members would get three weeks pay for each year of service if they take a buyout , said Bill O’Meara , president of the New York Newspaper Guild .
At most , employees would get two years of pay and extended medical insurance coverage , he said .
Nonunion staff would likely get two weeks pay for each year of service , up to one year ’s pay , New York Times spokeswoman Diane McNulty said in an e-mailed response to questions about the buyouts .
Earlier this year , the union agreed to the 5 percent pay cut in the hope that the newspaper would offer buyouts instead of layoffs if it had to cut more costs , O’Meara said .
He said the buyouts would not reflect the 5 percent cut .
“ It ’s a great paper , but it ’s not immune to many of the same forces that are hitting newspapers nationwide , ” O’Meara said .

Mr. Schaeffer ,
That letter is the most nonsensical pile of lies , hypocrisy and lunacy that the left has produced within the last ... oh , 48 hours or so .
Glenn Beck is , at worst , a little bit conspiratorial , but he does not foment racism or hate .
I am thankful that his voice is out there , whether I agree with him or not .
And get something straight :
The left in America can't lecture a single human being about hate .
http://www.zombietime.com/zomblog/?p=621
Want to talk about fomenting hate , pal ?
Have you ever seen these " kill Bush " protest signs ?
Keep this in mind , too : Remember when Vice President Cheney was in Afghanistan and the military had to stop an assassination plot while he was there ?
You had commenters at sites like the Huffington Post that were pissed off because the plotters did n't succeed .
You even had Bill Maher dreaming on - air how much better life would be if Cheney had been murdered .
Hey , if something had happened to either Bush or Cheney , would you have blamed Air America ?
Or Keith Olbermann ?
And have you ever heard any of the filthy , disgusting crap spewed on - air by Mike Malloy - the left - wing yakker that Friedman fills in for sometimes ?
Mr. Murdoch , thank you for supplying us with the voice that is Fox News .
And thank you for hiring Glenn Beck .
Keep him .

Maybe I need to type slower .
Anybody who advocates for the assassination of President Obama ( or Bush , or Clinton , or Bush the elder , or Carter ) should get a not - so - friendly visit by the Secret Service .
The author of that Zombietime article made that clear on his blog , too .
By the way , I just heard Gore Vidal on the Joy Behar show fantasize about murdering Bush - and Behar did n't bat an eye .

An anonymous comment ( even if it has a name , it 's still anonymous frankly ) on Huffington Post , is not the same as an FCC frequency allocated , Station ID exploiting transmitting intelligence ( an fcc term ) across the public frequency spectrum via psyop crap coming from the pentagon , mixed with spin , disinfo , and blacklisted topics .
I also take offense to being labeled " left wing " or " liberal . "
You do n't know a god damn thing about me .
If your packed in a box of oranges do n't be trolling for apples .
While I am glad your not personally calling for assassination of anyone .
It 's sad , you have to clarify , such things now .
( I 'm actually on your side here . )
With that said though , the KEY to all this is the FCC , the public , and station 's public file .
The public files for stations who transmit intelligence across public broadcast spectrum need to be made available online and made to have real consequences when they rub the public the wrong way .
e.g.
Transmitting intelligence which is not in the public interest and generates thousands of complaints should lose their frequency allocation / and station id .
It 's not illegal in the United States to fantasize or dream up shit yet .
However dreaming up a cartoon , or a motion picture , or an indy film , or anything really is n't the same as broadcasting intelligence which contains threats from a licensed station who calls itself news .
Hopefully we all agree here .

Not that murdering anyone is a good idea , but the results of Bush in office , is the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of innocent people .
The continuation of the Afghanistan war will be Obama 's blood stain , on our flag , compliments of the military industrial complex .

Something like that ?
And we do have him on tape calling Tiller all kinds of horrific and incendiary things ....
While he probably thought he was just jacking up his anti-abortion base to keep voting Republican , sitting back and listening to himself might have given him a clue that he was also jacking up the MILITANT anti-abortion crowd .
That should have been plain enough even to him .
I mean , while just because a psychopath is psychotic , does n't mean he or she is stupid .
Eventually some of them figure out that this voting thing does n't work , that the polemic is stoked just to keep everyone at each others ' throats , and if they want something done , they figure , they have to do it themselves .
Clearly , even very intelligent people , who are NOT psychopaths , just keep falling for this SHOW BUSINESS being perpetuated by BOTH sides , while the evil bastards running this world just cackle and continue to pillage ... continue to ruin ALL our lives ....

Damail ,
When was the last time any Democrat had to show fealty to those sign carriers or Air America / Green960 / Progressive talkers ?
Give up ?
Never .
In fact , the Democrats fall all over themselves to be the first to put forward a Congressional resolution to condemn such things , in some idiotic effort to show people who hate them how pathetic they can be .
MoveOn , ACORN , etc .
Never a repudiation from Republicans of the extremist right no matter how disgusting .
The Republicans celebrate and bow their heads to extremists .
The Republican party picks up and propagates far right conspiracy theories from birtherism to death panels to socialism and communism .
In fact , you would have a very difficult time finding a voice on the extreme right that was not echoed by the republican party .
The Republican conversation is no different from the most pathetic and vicious of rightist extremists .
When 's the last time you heard a Democrat argue a point from the Communist Party of America ?
From the Earth Liberation Front ?
From the Animal Liberation Front ?
Why is n't Noam Chomsky ever referenced by democrats ?
Would the majority in this country even know who he is ?
Why is Soros the only billionaire political funder this nation talks about when there are a hell of a lot more on the right ?
Now compare that to the voice heard on the right and echoed by the national Republican party .
Not even freakin ' close to being as moderate or timid in ideology as the opinions supported by Democrats .
You could go to Stormfront or any other militia / right wing extremist group right now and find Republican talking points and conspiracy theories being promoted almost word for word by those sick morons .
What voices are represented in the media ?
Chomsky and those sign carriers ?
No. Strange for a " liberal media " , no ?
Deathers and gun carrying morons and Orly Taits ?
Yep .
So save your ridiculous comparison .
You have no idea what the hell you are talking about .

Damail , " Stormfront and others spouting Republican talking points ? ? " -
You assume , as do all cons , that talking points evolve from the top down - as it conforms to the basic authoritarian tendencies of cons .
The talking points are from the slithering community of filth that Stormfront represents .
The talking points fester and bubble up from there to the national conversation via the Republican party and its members and its media operations .
" No Republican I know that has any name recognition spouts birther crap or any other conspiracy theory . " -
You must not know any republicans , then , and throwing in the caveat " that has any name recognition " is a pathetic hedge .
Let 's see - Grassley - " kill grandma " .
Inhofe - climate change is " a conspiracy " .
Liz Cheney - " enemies list " .
Lamar Alexander - " enemies list " .
Romney - Public Option ‘ Is Absolutely Death ... Across This Country ’.
Palin - " death panels " .
Shadegg -
‘ We ’re getting full on Russian gulag , Soviet - style gulag healthcare . ’
Should I continue ?
Bachmann , Beck , Limbaugh ... there is no end to the lunatic crap that is promoted by cons and their media establishment .
" Maxine Waters has been spouting CIA theories ever since I can remember . " - 1 . Maxine Waters is hardly a major Democratic party leader ( using your " logic " ) .
2 . CIA " theories " do not suggest any Democratic or Republican plot , nor attacks on any political party member .
3 . There is abundant evidence of CIA wrongdoing , both past and present .
4 . Democrats do not have a entire media establishment devoted to promoting conspiracy theories and partisan attacks , unlike Republicans .
" Pelosi has said she was a fan of " disruptors " - until the town hall meetings and tea party protests , that is . " - ( That is hate or conspiracy talk , how exactly ?
lol ) Typical con nonsense .
Assuming you actually saw the video of her statement , she was referring to political leaders as " disrupters " , not crowds , as is evident from the video .
Looks like you need a new talking point , hack .
The vast majority of republicans are birthers , as is evident from polls .
And the national republicans do not want to alienate the only freaks they have left .
There is no comparison at all to the shit storm of crazy that comprises the republican party and their media operations .

RAY ,
The " liberal media " accusation is a joke .
The media is no more liberal than Fox is trustworthy .
And Fox is so far to the right that white supremacists feel at home there .
Hell , the talking points are the same .
You and the rest of the cons need to stop confusing cultural bias for ideological bias .
There is no liberal media bias whatsoever .
None .
The overall narrative and direction of traditional media is right wing .
Two examples - the NY Times held back the report on bush admin spying until after the 2004 election - at the request of the bush admin - and then only put it out because the reporter was going to publish a book involving the story .
Take the regressives favorite target , MSNBC .
Before the aggressive invasion of Iraq started , MSNBC , the " liberal " network , fired Donohue , its number one program , because he had on anti-war voices .
The network demanded that he put on at least two pro-war for every anti-war , but even that was not enough .
So they fired him .
Their number one program .
Not even money was enough for MSNBC to be liberal when it mattered .
So save the typical con whining that confuses lack of gun toting fundamentalist Christians reading the news for a liberal bias .
There ain't one and the media is overwhelmingly conservative , in narrative and ideology .
Cons love to point to an outdated survey of political opinion involving reporters as somehow being proof of bias .
Irrelevant .
All reporters could be Marxists and it would n't make a difference to the conservative bias in the traditional media .
Ever hear of editors , assignments , and owners ?
Unless you think employees get to tell their bosses and company owners the direction their company will take and what it will produce ...
I 'd like to see the paranoid con argument for that .
Evil unions , maybe ?
Democrats do better on every single economic issue other than inflation .
Especially gov deficits .
Did n't know that did you - look it up .
Better on the stock market .
Better on job creation .
Better on wealth creation .
Yet republicans continuously get away with the " fiscally responsible " bs talking point .
Every time .
For decades .
Some liberal media .
It ca n't even dispense with myths that take five minutes on google to disprove .
Yet , republicans get away with it every time .
The media completely ignores the " starve the beast " financial destruction - a con policy of destroying the government by bankrupting it .
Started with con god Reagan - look it up .
And the country ai n't conservative .
It is misinformed .
Like you are .

Marxist .
Putting massive amounts of public money into private hands .
Right .
Do you even know the meaning of Marxist ?
Like " liberal media " you have your " FACTS " reversed .
If Obama were a Marxist / socialist / communist / whatever slur the right needs to use because they are too stupid to have an informed discussion so just yell out words they think are sufficiently " evil " - he would have , at the very least , nationalized the banks .
He would have stopped our state capitalism in which the government foots the bill for everything from war to infrastructure to research then hands the results of the public investment into private hands .
He would have stopped the insane process of privatization , especially that of war , that takes the public money and puts it into private hands for basic functions of government .
( Hint : that would be the opposite of Marxist .
Do n't tell your rightist buddies , though - let them keep their precious myths .
Like " liberal media " )
Seriously , are you even aware of how ridiculously stupid the talking points of the rightists are ?
Does the evidence of rightist media bias , including the examples I cited above , even register or are you too far gone to even acknowledge fact ?
Are your illusions so precious , and you so desperate , that you will cling to the narrative and con " solutions " after they fail again and again and again ?
How many failures of the right , in propaganda and action , does it take for a rightist to stop believing in his easily refuted illusions ?

Ray , I think Steve 's point was that , no , Obama is not a Marxist because he 's doing exactly the opposite of what Marxists do .
I should also point out that since he's not trolling this thread , he may well not answer you further than he already has .
You might benefit from studying up on Marxism .
Since Obama is avidly bailing out Wall Street at Main Street 's expense and increasing private contractor presence in our military adventures in the Middle East and failing to get relief for the people going jobless , homeless and hungry , there is just no basis for accusing him of being a Marxist .
All you have to do is get Marxism straight in your mind , and this will be readily apparent to you .

Ray -
I think the question you mean to ask is : " If Obama violated the constitution in any way , would that matter to you ? "
Because that 's the oath he took and that 's the measure of whatever he does , no matter what school of thought you 've deluded yourself to believe it comes from .
With that in mind then , I 'll ask you two questions : 1 ) If Obama violated the constitution in any way , would that matter to you ?
2 ) If Bush violated the constitution in any way , would that matter to you ?
I suspect I 'll have some followups if I remember to check back on this item again , after I hear your answers .
Actually , I 'll ask one now :
If the answer to either question is YES , then what do you think should be done about it in order to demand accountability for such a violation of his oath and the U.S. Constitution he 's sworn to protect ?

Im fairly shocked that ive now recieved responses from 3 seperate people , 637 words in all , multiple definitions of what a Marxist is , statements about Bush , Wall st , Main st , how stupid the rightests are , how stupid the leftest are for falling into the rightest trap , the middle east , joblessness , homelessness , etc ... and still no one will answer my question .. So , now its out there to all of you ..
Please , just step up to the plate and be a MAN ( orwoman ) , and give me YOUR personal yes or no answer ..

I guess your question just does n't compute , Ray , because , love them or hate them , NO Marxist would behave as Obama has .
Your question was so asinine it seems none of us could figure a way to answer it .
It does n't even work as a hypothetical .
What ?
You think he has hidden this leftist ideology away for his entire adult life , gets into office , begins appeasing fascists just as hard as ever he can , and at some unspecified future date he will pipe up declaring himself a Marxist and all this fascistic stuff was just a fake - out ?
Oh. No. Wait .
If you do n't understand Marxism , you probably do n't understand fascism either .
Some people prefer to use the term " corporatism " .
In any case , he 's transferring what 's left of our wealth to the plutocrats at an astonishing clip , and the correct answer to your psychedelic question is to stress that he 's not a Marxist .
There is n't anything remotely Marxist about him .
He has not done one even vaguely Marxist thing .
EVERYTHING HE DOES IS DISTINCTLY ANTI - MARXIST .
Very plainly extremely anti-Marxist and no Marxist , even a secret one , could be Barack Obama .
So there is NO basis even for a hypothetical .
Even if he harbors a secret love for Marxism , which he surely does n't , NONE of his actions comport with it ... and ... even if he suddenly began acting like one , what the hell difference would it make ?
It would so totally rock if he could just declare the nationalization of Goldman Sachs !
Or the oil companies .
Or , or , or HALLIBURTON !
Yay !
We 'd get a bunch of our money back !
He 's kept up with Bush 's privatization of profit and socialization of loss , though ....

It 's not a well - formed question --- not genuine , not a question but a device , a mindfuck , a game .
All you can say by answering it is that you 're okay with Marxists or not okay with Marxists or okay with Obama or not okay with Obama , and no one , not even you , could tell which of those four things were being answered .
It 's impossible to answer two of them together with a yes or no because of all the reasons stated and responses you 've gotten .
That question is designed to give a negative impression of the person who answers " yes " and a positive impression of the person who answers " no " to people party operatives want to dupe into getting up and causing a stir ... against their own best interests .
Obama is the best Republican you 've had in office to date .
His " healthcare reform " is actually " mandatory health insurance " and will make the insurance companies billions more than they make already .
So why is it necessary to whip the minions up with ideas like " Obama is a Marxist " and " death panels " and " no birth certificate " , etc . ?
Two reasons : [ 1 ] it gives the president and congress good political cover for not delivering on their promises ; and [ 2 ] sets up the possibility that Republicans can get back into position to receive all those millions in bribe money and other means of personal profit built into our system .
Our government is broken .
Corrupt bastards are running interference for plutocrats , and fighting over which group gets to play majority , which gets the White House , which gets to do the bidding of the criminally insane .
Your question can be seen as dirt ignorant blather , or evil mindfucking by criminal geniuses .
It 's both .
Anyone who equates the word Marxism with " bad " will hate a " yes " answer and want to get rowdy to defend our anti-Marxist country , and far from being satisfied with a " no " answer , they will only feel they have scored a point against Obama by making someone say they would n't be okay with him being a Marxist .
Even somebody who loves Marxism can't answer that question without helping to heap delusion on poor manipulated saps who are all riled up to ruin their own lives ... recently referred to as " teabaggers " and " village idiots " ... which also only serves the plutocrats because it reinforces the enmity they have worked to create .
It 's a lose / lose for the people , and a win / win for the plutocrats .
It 's a black hole .
IT ISN'T KIND TO GIVE YOU A YES OR A NO .

Good job agent99 , someone finally got the point .
Gold star for you .. See , it wasnt that hard to tell me .
Your all beyond liberals , and pres Obamas not nearly Left enough for you guys .. So now that I no the answer to my 1st question , I got another :
What do each of you ( or collectively ) consider yourselves ?
Your not Democrates , and I dont think liberals either .
Actual Marxists ?
Socialists ?
Collectivests ?
I really dont know .
Please tell me ..
Im NOT a Republican .
Id call myself a Conservative with libertarian leanings .
I dont believe in God , but have no problem what so ever with people of faith ( actually , I think its nessary , and we need more of it .
Kinda keeps people in line ) .
Im pro choice , but I believe
It is a child in there , I just dont really care if a Woman doesnt want it and want to kill it .
Fine with me .
And I hated 90 % of Bushes policys , and believe theres not a whole heck of a lot of difference with him and Pres Obama ..
There , thats me .
What are you guys ?

Ray , you pretty much described my view on those issues , except for the part about thinking that more people of faith would make us better off .
The problem most of us have with the right - wing faux news attacks on Obama is that they 're completely ludicrous and untrue .
Just because we point out how ludicrous and non-factual the hate - news about Obama is , does n't mean we 're Obama diehards .
Agent 99 listed a TON of reasons I do n't like Obama , and there are more : corporate bailouts , suspension of habeus corpus , covering for bush / cheney torture policies , catering to the insurance industry over the citizenry , etc .
But the bottom line remains : Obama is n't a racist , he is n't a socialist , he is n't a communist , he 's not a terrorist or a terrorist sympathizer .
He IS , however , another in a long line of presidents that backs corporate interests before the interests of the people .

Hey !
Some actual dialog , not just tired talking points !
Thanks Disillusioned !
So , then is there a particular politician or party , or just even a person out there that espouses views or an idealogy that you agree with , or just closely relate to ?
Im goin to assume that im a fairly lone voice on this site , but I dont really care .
I like to try and see how and why the polar opposite of my own views thinks ..
Im not gonna be able to change anyone heres mind , so I dont try .
Thats why I dont respond to the majority of the comments and statements posted to me .
Therefore , please dont try and tell me why im wrong on issues ; you wont change my mind .
People come to their own belief and conclusion on their own .
So ill respect yours and please respect mine .

Ray @ 37 said : No and No ... Meaning " No and No " , in response to my questions ?
It would n't matter to you if either Obama or Bush violated the Constitution ??
Surely you 're answering someone else 's question , right ?
I did not ask Steve if he THOUGHT Obama was a Marxist .
I simply asked him , " If he KNEW , for a fact , that Obama WAS a Marxist , would it matter .." .. And Brad , with all due respect , I asked exactly what I ment to ask .
Please dont patronize me , and ill afford the same due respect in kind ... " Patronize " you ?
I was trying to help you , since your question , about Obama being a " Marxist " is absolutely meaningless , unless you are willing to define what the hell a " Marxist " is .
And even then , whether Obama is or is n't a Marxist ( which he clearly is n't ) does n't actually matter one way or another , since being a Marxist ( whatever that is ) is not against the law .
What IS against the law , is defying the Constitution and , in the bargain , breaking ones oath of office which clearly Bush has done in spades .
One could even make an argument that Obama has done same , if they liked , though you did n't as far as I can tell .
But I fail to see what it matters as to whether he , or any other President , fits into your vague , red - baiting label or not , even though Obama clearly does n't .
So to answer your question , no , it would n't matter .
What matters is whether he keeps his oath of office and follows and protects the Constitution , unlike his predecessor ( who , if your answer " No and No " applies to the question I asked you , clearly you do n't seem to care about , which makes you far more dangerous to our nation than a " Marxist " , whatever that is ) .
Im fairly shocked that ive now recieved ( sic ) responses from 3 seperate ( sic ) people , 637 words in all , ... and still no one will answer my question ..
You 're " shocked " nobody wanted to answer your phony , red- baiting question ?
Really ?

Wow Brad .
Seriously ?...
Ok , Ill talk slow for you ( lighten up Francis , its a lil joke ) .
My no and no was not an answer to your questions ( ive already explained this , but .. ) .
My first " no " was to agent99 's post before yours , becouse he still thought I was somehow calling Pres Obama a " marxist " , which I was not , but his whole post was based on the wrong assumption that I was , hence the " NO " ( It was even explained in the first sentence ) .
The second " NO " , WAS to you B - R - A - D , but it wasnt an answer to you questions ( I didnt answer your questions becouse you presented them from a misunderstood basis ) .
The " NO " simply ment that " NO " , I ment to ask exactly what I did , not what you assumed ( which yes Brad , I do understand that that was just a cute n clever way of spinning ) I did ( again , that was explained in the first sentence ) .. Brad , I think your brighter than your letting on here , but you cant help but to try and attack and belittle ..
Agent99 sorta got the point , and even explained it in his own way .
.
At least I finally got a true answer outta you ( had to pull teeth but .. ) .
You answered " no " it wouldnt matter to you if he was a Marxist .
Good for you for finally being true , I at least respect that .... Oh , and Brad , Ive never been married .
Thats just really childish , and kinda makes you look immature ..

So you 're not just a red - baiter , but also irony impaired ?
You were asked about when you stopped beating your wife , because it 's the same type of phony , trick question as " Would you care if Obama was a Marxist " .
Apparently you missed that point ?
So , again , I ask my questions , for the third time , since you 've avoided answering in five different comments since , 733 words in all .
Here 's what was asked and you 've avoiding answering ever since :
1 ) If Obama violated the constitution in any way , would that matter to you ?
2 ) If Bush violated the constitution in any way , would that matter to you ?
I suspect I 'll have some followups if I remember to check back on this item again , after I hear your answers .
Actually , I 'll ask one now :
If the answer to either question is YES , then what do you think should be done about it in order to demand accountability for such a violation of his oath and the U.S. Constitution he 's sworn to protect ?
Thanks for answering both the two questions and the follow up question below it .

Hey Brad .
Im sorry for taking up any of your time here .
I was merly trying to have a " conversation " , as you guys like to say , with people of a differing opinion than mine .
I can now see that thats not acceptable here , so Ill go away .
I really do enjoy a good political discussion / debate from the other side , but I get tired of the same old name calling , belittling , psychological intimidation tactics , and talking points again and again and again .
Ive heard it all a million times ..
I think there were a few posters that I could tell wouldnt mind engaging in a discussion with me , but I think were hessitant becouse thats a no - no here ..
So , Its no biggie to me , ill find another thread somewhere else .. Good luck in life to all -

Sorry , didnt know you were right there , so one last one before I go away ... Yes , I got your point on the wife beating Bradley .
My question was for real though , just to try and figure out the type of politics on this site .
I really had no idea( I did no that it wasnt conservative tho , lol ! ) , to what extent you guys and gals were .
Ive never been here before and never heard of you , so I honestly had no idea .
I wasnt calling Obama a Marxist , I simply wanted to know if you wished he was ... So , to answer your 2 question , and your follow up ;
Yes it matters to me on both .
Im a strict constructionist , so of course it matters to me .. and
Ive already told you that I didnt agree with 90 % of Bushs politics , so that doesnt work on me .
Now , to your follow up .
This is a much much more difficult question to answer in a quick simple format .
Im also a presidential historian , and EVERY president all the way back to Washington , in one form or another violated the constitution .
The degrees to which greatly vary , but make no mistake , they ALL did it .
Some claimed they did it to save the Republic ( eg Washington , Lincoln , Kennedy , Bush ) , others do it becouse they feel their cause is so just , that it has to be done ( eg Roosevelt , LBJ , Carter ) .
Others for more nefarious reasons ( Teddy Roosevelt , Nixon , Clinton ) .
Now , the hard part ; whats to be done about it ?... Your not going to like my answer , but , I dont know ...

The majority of folks here tend to be progressives .
That could be conservative progressive or liberal progressive or a mix of both .
They also tend to be constitutionalists ( once a conservative value , but apparently no more ) .
You have gone on to belittle others and then claim that you are being belittled .
In the bargain , you whine about it and tell us you are facing " psychological intimidation tactics , and talking points again and again and again " ( ironic , given your original crusade to get someone to answer whether they felt Obama was a " Marxist " , a generally belittling label , as used in this country , that you refused to define for anybody ) .
We have many types of readers , however , from all sorts of political persuasions and they are all welcome to discuss anything openly here , so long as they do n't violate our few rules for posting comments .
You have now played your martyr card , and even insisted that this is not the place for discussion , so you must run along .
That , despite have such a discussion , but apparently being disappointed that the readers here were too smart to fall for your silly Hannity - style tricks .
Now you announce , as Hannity would be proud to hear , that you are a " strict constructionist " , which I presume refers to a strict reading of the constitution as constructed by the founders .
If so , I imagine you 've come up with some reason to ignore their construction of that document as stating that African - Americans equal just three - fifths of a white man .
But , more to the point , you say you do n't know what 's to be done about Presidents who violate their Constitutional duties .
So a hint for you --- one that you should not need as a self - proclaimed " strict constructionist " and " presidential historian " --- the answer to that question is found in the very document you claim to be a " strict constructionist " of .
So , if you " do n't know " the answer , I suspect you may not be so " strict " or " historian " - like after all .
Go read your Constitution , and feel free to get back to us with an answer to the question , if you wish .
If you remained silent for the last 8 years on that question , however , during the most severe and dangerous case of Constitutional shredding this country has ever seen , then your new - found interest in the rule of law and the Constitution will find little purchase here .
I suspect there are other sites , however , who have the type of politics you imagine we have here .
Perhaps you 'll have more luck with your red-baiting and martyrdom there than here , where people actually believe in the Constitution and the rule of law , and not just when Fox " News " instructs us to .

He even put out an olive branch and tried to find common ground to agree with us on , and you agressivly shut him down .
He was n't calling Obama a Marxist , explained that he was n't , and even now your still twisting his words .

The latest round of celebrity boxing will feature Rodney King taking on a former Delaware County police officer in a " justice " battle in the ring .
King entered the national spotlight after a group of Los Angeles Police officers were videotaped beating him .
The ensuing court case was eventually the spark plug for the L.A. Riots and left King asking “ ca n’t we all just get along . ”
King will have the chance to get his punches in against a law enforcer when he takes on former Chester cop Simon “ The Renegade ” Aouad on Sept. 11 in Essington , Pa .
The original date of the event was Sept. 12 in Boothwyn , Pa. but due to an overwhelming response it was moved up a day to accommodate more people at a larger venue .
“ I know some people will see the irony here , ” said King about boxing a police officer .
“ But I would have fought anyone who was worthy . ”
The 6 - foot , 215 - pound Aouad should be worthy enough .
He has fought in many tough man fights and will bring a 36 - 0 record and 34 knockouts into the ring against King .
But the 6 - foot - 4 , 250 - pound King is ready to bring his size advantage to the ring .
He was training in California to prepare for the battle in the squared ring .
“ I take this very seriously , ” King said .
But King wo n’t be entering friendly territory when he comes to fight Aouad on the former cop ’s home turf in front of plenty of men in blue .
“ I ’m honored to be in the same ring as [ King ] , ” Aouad said .
But Aouad does n’t plan to be friendly once he enters the ring .
“ When I get in the ring I ’m there to fight , ” the 31 - year - old boxer said .
Aouad 's view on King and his " Ca n't we all just get along " was simple -- “ Simon sez NO , ” Aouad told NBC Philadelphia .
The former cop plans on giving King a beating that ’s “ going to make him think the Los Angeles Police Department were simply playing footsies , ” he said .
The original date of the bout held significant meaning for the challenger .
Aouad will dedicate this fight to every single law enforcement officer out there and especially to a " major " figure in his life who he holds very dear to his heart who died on Sept. 12 , 2007 .
After their bout next month Aouad hopes to return the favor and challenge King on his home turf .
There were no plans released about any possible rematch .
The former cop also is an aspiring actor so he should be able to relate to actor ( and former Donald Trump bodyguard ) Thomas Walton who will be fighting on the undercard .
An official press conference about the celebrity boxing bouts will be held Thursday , according to promoter Damon Feldman .
King vs. Aouad will take place at the Philadelphia Airport Ramada Inn on Friday , Sept. 11 with the bell at 8 p.m .
Anyone who wants to see “ justice ” served in the ring can purchase tickets from Center Stage Tickets , 800-677-8499 or contact 484-318-6133 .
Recent reports that the Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) will suffer default rates of more than 20 % on the 2007 and 2008 loans it guaranteed has raised questions once again about the government 's role in the financial crisis and its efforts to achieve social purposes by distorting the financial system .

The owner was walking the dog , described as a brown pit bull type , in Washwood Heath Park without a lead .
The man , described as Asian , about 5ft 10in ( 1.77 m ) and in his mid 30s , appeared to kill the dog in front of passers - by , police said .
The boy was treated at hospital after suffering small wounds to the head in the incident on 26 September .
' Not controlled '
West Midlands Police issued CCTV footage of the man leaving the park dragging the apparently dead dog and appealed for witnesses to the killing .
Earlier the animal had approached a group of young children playing and attacked the boy before running back to its owner .
He then appeared to strangle the dog and tried to put it into a bin bag before leaving the park shortly after 1915 BST , police said .
He is clearly not a responsible pet owner in any regard
Sgt Alan Hands , West Midlands Police
The boy was treated at hospital but discharged the same night .
Sgt Alan Hands , from Nechells Green police station , described it as a " horrific " incident .
He said : " It was terrifying for the little boy who was attacked and bitten by this dog which was not properly controlled on a lead .
" When it returned to the owner he appeared to destroy the dog with no regard for those who witnessed his actions or the animal itself without checking to see if the child was hurt .
" He is clearly not a responsible pet owner in any regard . "
The owner was dressed in a cream - coloured hooded jumper and blue jeans .

Embed :
Manipulating subtitles was for many years a difficult task to perform in GNU / Linux Operating Systems .
Many steps in the process of ripping , editing and embedding subtitles on a video file were and still are quite complicated .
Lots of users still complete many of the above steps using Microsoft Windows or running Windows applications with Wine .
Below I tried to gather programs written for GNU / Linux that do all the above ( and more ) as simply as possible , through a friendly Graphic User Interface ( GUI ) .
I know that programs that perform similar tasks in the terminal do exist and work perfectly , but they wo n’t be listed here .
Rip subtitles only
The following applications can be used when you wish to rip only the subtitles from a movie file , fast and easy .
Ksubtitleripper : A very light program written for KDE .
I installed it in Ubuntu .
It did n’t appear in the Applications menu , but I ran it by typing ksubtitleripper in the terminal .
It first extracts subtitles from .vob files and then creates the .srt file , by converting subtitle images to text .
OGMrip :
Even though this is a program that rips subtitles with the video , you can use a smart trick to get the subs without having to rip the whole movie .
Nice !
Avidemux : A great application for ripping DVD’s .
It comes with some powerful tools to rip subtitles .
Again , you begin by extracting the subs from vob files to vobsubs , and then using a character recognition program to create the srt .
If you used SubRip in Windows , you will find the procedure very familiar .
The first time you use it you must enter the characters manually , but you can save them to a file and use it repeatedly in the future .
Here is a step by step guide I find very handy .
Rip subtitles with the video
These applications can also rip subtitles , but they do it simultaneously with ripping the video file .
The first two give you the choice of saving the subtitles separately in a file , whilst Handbrake only burns them into the picture .
In general I like having subtitles in a separate file because I want the freedom of manipulating them as I wish .
However lots of users prefer to attach them to the movie in order to play them on home DVD - players without troubles .
Edit subtitles
Whatever you need to do to a subtitle file these are the programs for the job .
They can be used for creating new subtitles , to transform , edit , correct and refine existing subtitles .
Change times or frame - rate , translate , join two files in one , save as another format , etc .
Gaupol :
An editor for text - based subtitle files .
It supports multiple subtitle file formats and provides means of correcting texts and timing subtitles to match video .
Gnome Subtitles : A subtitle editor for the GNOME desktop .
It supports the most common text - based subtitle formats and allows for subtitle editing , translation and synchronization .
Subtitle Editor : Subtitle Editor is a GTK 2 + tool to edit subtitles for GNU / Linux /* BSD .
This program also shows sound waves , which makes it easier to synchronise subtitles to voices .
Attach subtitles to a video file permanently :
DeVeDe : A widely used application for creating video suitable for home players , from any number of video files , in many formats .
The link directs to a bit outdated but still usable and complete guide on how to add subtitles to a DVD or CD using DeVeDe .
Avidemux :
This program is turning up to be one of my favourites !
Here is a guide on how to add subs to an AVI file
I should notice that all of the major Video Players for GNU / Linux systems support loading subtitles from a separate file through very easy interfaces , so you probably wo n’t have any problems playing your video files with subs .
Before going ahead and start ripping and editing , make sure to check that this act is legal in your country .
If I left out one of your favourite applications or you have a guide for other programs , do post it below .
The New Census Numbers
The new U.S. Census numbers are out , and they do n't show much in the way of changes : Median income dropped a bit , poverty rose a bit , and so too did the number of Americans without health insurance .
But the actual changes are n't very large .
There are two reasons for that .
The first is that the " new " numbers cover 2008 rather than 2009 :
That period was more about the financial crisis than the recession .
For comparison , in August of 2008 , the unemployment rate was 6.1 percent .
By August of 2009 , it was 9.7 percent .
The second is that the safety net picked up the slack .
This graph from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities tells some of the story :
That seems a bit strange , right ?
Why would middle - income families drive the growth in the uninsured rate ?
The answer , basically , is that low - income families , or families that became low - income , were saved by public programs .
One lesson of these numbers is that middle - income families are indeed vulnerable .
If I 'm reading the data correctly , a solid 5.1 percent of the non-elderly population lost employer - sponsored health insurance in 2008 .
That suggests health costs have left employers pretty sensitive to changes in the economy .
But the Obama administration is building its health - care reform around the employer market .
That 's a pretty fragile foundation .
There 's been a lot of attention paid to the promise that people in the employer market can keep what they have , at least so far as the government is concerned .
But employers and the economy have made no similar promise .
Lewis Hamilton was the fastest man in qualifying for the Singapore Grand Prix - whether that be on the grid , or once the weights of the cars are taken into account .
The top 10 drivers in qualifying are not allowed to refuel before the race , so their pace is dictated by the amount of fuel on board , which also defines when they will come in for their first pit stop .
Once the weight of fuel in the cars is published , it is therefore possible to calculate a fuel - adjusted grid , and work out who is theoretically in best shape for the race .
Taking that into account , BBC Sport 's fuel - adjusted grid , with projected first pit stops , looks like this :
Health reform 's ' gang of 6 ' reaps political cash HEALTH CARE

The bipartisan " gang of six " senators who helped craft the health care reform bill going before a key Senate committee Tuesday represent less than 3 percent of the U.S. population - but they hold a lot of power at a crucial policy - shaping moment in Congress .
That 's why , analysts say , health care industry lobbyists have showered them with more campaign cash on average than other senators this year , in an attempt to influence the outcome .
Three Republican and three Democratic senators in the group , all of them members of the Senate Finance Committee , received an average of $ 74,600 from health industry lobbyists , according to The Chronicle 's analysis of records through June .
That is about 25 percent more than the average of $ 59,632 in such donations that the gang 's other Senate colleagues raked in from lobbyists for the pharmaceutical , hospital , insurance and nursing home industries , according to the analysis , which was based on records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics , a nonprofit watchdog group .
" Money buys access , " said Henry Brady , a professor of public policy and dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley .
Campaign contributions - along with volatile public opinion , confusion about what 's in the reform plans in Congress and a lack of clarity from President Obama on his vision of reform - could also " swing some Democrats to the center on health care , " said Larry Berman , a professor of political science at UC Davis .
" I 'm not saying it 's the only thing , but it could be a factor , " Berman said .
Grassley , Baucus at top
Sen .
Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa , the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee who is seen as key to influencing other conservatives , received the most this year - $ 223,600 .
Committee chair Sen. Max Baucus , D - Mont. , was second with $ 141,000 .
In times of rowdy town hall meetings , middle - of - the - road Washington legislators hold more power in this increasingly pitched battle for a simple reason :
They are seen as holding opinions that could be influenced , analysts said .
" There is not a quid pro quo but there is an expectation that a contribution gives you a chance to be heard by the member , " said Sheila Krumholz , executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks the influence of money on politics and government .
" Money is a huge consideration for members of Congress , who are constantly running for re-election , " she said .
" Their constituents are n't always running up to them on Capitol Hill .
But these lobbyists are . "
Baucus ' $ 856 billion , 10 - year bill , which is scheduled to be amended and voted on beginning Tuesday , has been criticized by liberals and conservatives across Capitol Hill .
Conservatives blasted the plan for increasing the tax burden on some Americans .
The plan imposes a 35 percent excise tax on so - called " Cadillac " insurance plans that cost more than $ 8,000 a year per person , or $ 21,000 a year per family .
Liberals dislike the Baucus plan because it does not allow consumers to choose a government - run insurance option , which could hold down costs by promoting competition with private insurers .
Baucus ' bill would allow cooperatives to sell insurance as a form of competition for private insurers , but Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf said co-ops " seem unlikely to establish a significant market presence in many areas of the country . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco has held off on a House vote until the Senate acts .
She has not decided how to move forward .
Blue Dog Democrats
In the House , the key players are the conservative , Blue Dog Democrats .
Their 52 members are self - described fiscal conservatives who largely represent southern and Midwestern districts that swing back and forth between Democrats and Republicans .
Blue Dogs have received an average of $ 31,467 from health care lobbyists this year , more than the $ 27,385 average of other House members , according to federal figures compiled by The Chronicle .
But that dynamic does n't hold true among California Democrats .
The Golden State 's seven Blue Dogs received less on average than their generally more conservative Blue Dog colleagues in other states , and less than California 's other Democrats .
One reason : California is home to some of the House 's top leaders , including Pelosi and committee chairs , including Rep. Pete Stark , D - Fremont , and Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles .
Committee chairs generally pull in more campaign contributions because of the power they wield over the legislative flow .
" The feeling among the health care lobbyists may be that the California Democrats would n't be able to contradict their leadership , " Berman said .

" There would be many historians up in arms about those claims .
I can't speak for the French or the Americans but there were no British black battalions in Germany , " he said .
US study on external costs of energy
23 October 2009
Share
The US National Research Council has published a study on the hidden health and environmental costs of energy production and consumption in the USA .
It put these costs at $ 120 billion in 2005 .
The study - entitled Hidden Costs of Energy : Unpriced Consequences of Energy Production and Use - was conducted at the request of Congress and examines external energy costs in the USA .
These are those costs that are quantifiable and attributable to energy production or consumption , but not passed on to customers in the energy prices .
The figures reflect mainly health damage and exclude the effects of climate change .
The report suggests , " Because these effects are not reflected in energy prices , government , businesses and consumers may not realise the full impact of their choices . "
It added , " When such market failures occur , a case can be made for government interventions - such as regulations , taxes or tradable permits - to address these external costs . "
" Life - cycle CO 2 emissions from nuclear , wind , biomass and solar power appear to be negligible when compared with fossil fuels . "
The committee that wrote the report focused on monetizing the damage of major air pollutants - sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , ozone , and particulate matter - on human health , grain crops and timber yields , buildings , and recreation .
When possible , it estimated both what the damages were in 2005 and what they are likely to be in 2030 , assuming current policies continue and new policies already slated for implementation are put in place .
The committee also separately derived a range of values for damages from climate change ; the wide range of possibilities for these damages made it impossible to develop precise estimates of cost .
However , all model results available to the committee indicate that climate - related damages caused by each tonne of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emissions will be far worse in 2030 than now ; even if the total amount of annual emissions remains steady , the damages caused by each tonne would increase 50 - 80 % .
Electricity generation accounted for more than half of the external costs in 2005 , practically all being from coal .
Coal - fired power plants are the single largest source of greenhouse gases in the USA , emitting on average about a tonne of CO 2 per megawatt - hour of electricity produced , the report says .
The external cost of damages , primarily caused from emissions from burning coal , were $ 62 billion , or 3.2 cents per kilowatt - hour ( c / kWh ) of electricity produced from it .
The report expects damages from coal to fall to 1.7 c/ kWh by 2030 .
Electricity produced from natural gas produced $ 0.74 billion in damages ( 0.16 c / kWh ) in 2005 , primarily from air pollution .
By 2030 , these are expected to fall to 0.11 c/ kWh .
" Life - cycle CO 2 emissions from nuclear , wind , biomass and solar power appear to be negligible when compared with fossil fuels , " according to the report .
However , the report says that the life cycle of nuclear power " does pose some risks .
If uranium mining activities contaminate ground or surface water , for example , people could potentially be exposed to radon or other radionuclides through ingestion .
Because the US mines only about 5 % of the world ’s uranium , such risks are mostly experienced in other countries . "
Motor vehicles produced $ 56 billion in health and other non-climate damages in 2005 , considering the full life cycle of vehicles - only one - third was from their operation .
Electric and plug - in hybrid vehicles resulted in higher non-climate damages than other technologies , due to reliance on fossil fuels for the electricity .
Energy used to create the batteries and electric motors adds 20 % of the manufacturing portion of life - cycle damages .
Zunehmend mehr Menschen in Deutschland misstrauen der Schulmedizin oder wünschen sich eine Alternative zum sonst üblichen Gang zum Allgemeinmediziner .
Eine alternative Behandlung im Krankheitsfall bietet ein Heilpraktiker an .
Dieser nimmt eine Behandlung mit Hilfe von unterschiedlichen Therapien und Arznei - und Heilmitteln vor , die alle auf die heilende Kraft des eigenen Körpers und der Natur setzen .
Eine der bekanntesten Therapien welche ein Heilpraktiker mit anbietet , besteht in einer Akupunkturtherapie .
Darüber hinaus ist auch die Bach Blütentherapie bekannt welche die Krankheit als Konflikt des „ höheren Selbst “ betrachtet und versucht mit einer Blütenmischung eine Lösung dieses Konflikts zu finden und somit die Heilung des Schmerz zu erreichen .
Dies sind natürlich nur zwei Beispiele von der großen Auswahl an Behandlungen und Therapien welche ein Heilpraktiker bietet .
In jedem Fall kann ein Heilpraktiker in einigen Fällen Patienten weiterhelfen , mitunter ist dies sogar schon nachgewiesen ( so bei der Akupunktur ) .
Das Problem ist allerdings , dass die Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung und sogar manche Tarife der Privaten Krankenversicherung keine Kostenübernahme für Heilpraktikerbehandlungen vorsehen .
Möchten sich also Versicherte der GKV bei einem Heilpraktiker behandeln lassen , müssen Sie diese Kosten vollständig selbst bezahlen .
Das kann zum
Teil recht teuer werden , denn gerade Therapien können mehrere Hundert Euro kosten – Geld welches die Haushaltskasse unter Umständen stark in Mitleidenschaft zieht .
Damit die gewünschte Behandlung bei einem Heilpraktiker nicht an den kosten scheitert , können sich Interessenten für den Abschluss einer reinen Heilpraktikerzusatzversicherung entscheiden .
Heilpraktikerversicherung bezahlt Behandlungen und Therapien
Am Markt existieren eine ganze Reihe von unterschiedlichen Krankenzusatzversicherungen welche auch eine Leistung für Behandlungen bei Heilpraktikern vorsehen .
Möchten Versicherte aber in jedem Krankheitsfall zu einem Heilpraktiker gehen , so empfiehlt sich hier eigentlich nur eine reine Heilpraktikerversicherung .
Nur diese besitzen eine ausreichend hohe Leistungssumme pro Versicherungsjahr ( z.B. einer der stärksten Anbieter verfügt über eine Kostenerstattung bis 2.000 Euro im Versicherungsjahr , schlechtere Anbieter gerade einmal 500 Euro ) .
Bei dem Leistungsumfang sollten Versicherte darauf achten , dass
Ihre ausgewählte Heilpraktikerversicherung eine Erstattung von Abrechnungen gemäß der Gebührenordnung für Heilpraktiker und optimalerweise auch darüber hinaus , vorsieht .
Auch sollten Behandlungen die nach dem Hufelandverzeichnis abgerechnet werden mitversichert sein , falls sich Versicherte von einem entsprechend ausgebildeten Arzt ( Homöopathie Diplom ) behandeln lassen möchten .
Neben den Kostenerstattungen für Behandlungen , sehen gute Heilpraktikerzusatzversicherungen eine 100 prozentige Kostenerstattung für Arznei- , Heil - und Hilfsmittel welche ein Heilpraktiker verschreibt bzw .
verwendet .
Versicherte der Gesetzlichen Krankenversicherung welche sich für eine natürliche Behandlung bei einem Heilpraktiker interessieren , empfiehlt sich durchaus der Abschluss einer Heilpraktikerzusatzversicherung .
Wird hier ein leistungsstarker Tarif gewählt , erhalten Versicherte eine umfangreiche Kostenerstattung für Behandlungen , Therapien , Arznei- , Heil - und Hilfsmittel .
Damit wird der Besuch bei einem Heilpraktiker keine Frage des Geldes , sondern ob diese gewünscht ist .
Die Risikolebensversicherung sichert das biometrische Risiko , meist den Todesfall , sehr preiswert ab , trägt aber nicht wie die Kapitallebensversicherung zum Ansparen größerer Summen bei .
Dies ergibt sich schon aus dem rein rechnerischen Vergleich : Für ein Todesfallrisiko , dass mit 100.000 , - € abgesichert ist , zahlt ein 30 jähriger Mann – je nach Anbieter – etwa 4 , - bis 5 , - € monatlich ( günstigste Anbieter ) , womit der Jahresbeitrag unter 60 , - € liegt .
Dies bedeutet , auch wenn bis zur Rente eingezahlt wird und die Versicherung in eine Erlebensfallversicherung umgewandelt wird , sprich der Versicherungsnehmer sie sich auszahlen lässt , kommen trotz erwirtschafteter Überschüsse keine enormen Summen zusammen .
Dafür sichert man die Familie sehr preisgünstig ab .
Als Beispiel für die Bedingungen und Leistungen einer Risikolebensversicherung kann man den Anbieter Asstel wählen , der durch Focus Money Ausgabe 13/2010 zum besten Risikoschutz mit 30 Jahren Laufzeit aller Direktversicherer gewählt wurde .
Ökotest Ratgeber Gesundheit und Fitness 2010 verlieh dem Produkt den 1 .
Rang .
Bei Onlineabschluss erhält man sofort vollen Versicherungsschutz , der bei Heirat , Geburt eines Kindes oder Immobilienerwerb ohne neue Gesundheitsprüfung erhöht werden kann .
Der Monatsbeitrag bei einer Todesfallabsicherung von 100.000 , - € beträgt für einen 30 jährigen Mann 4,25 €. Bei positiver Risikoentwicklung kann der Beitrag sinken .
Die Vertragslaufzeit kann individuellen Lebensumständen entsprechend angepasst werden – bis zur Altersrente , bis die Kinder aus dem Haus und / oder Kredite abgezahlt sind .
Ebenso kann die Summe an geänderte Umstände angepasst werden , zum Beispiel bei beruflichen Veränderungen .
Als Absicherungssumme schlägt der Anbieter für Familien ohne Kinder das 3 fache , für Familien mit Kindern das 5 fache Jahreseinkommen vor .
Durch einen Familienbonus kann der Beitrag reduziert werden .
Die Versicherung kann beitragsfrei gestellt und auch bis 10 Jahre nach Abschluss in eine Kapitallebensversicherung umgewandelt werden .
Sie kann mit BU kombiniert werden , die Beiträge können als Vorsorge steuerlich geltend gemacht werden .
Die Leistungen sind kapitalertragssteuerfrei .
Ähnliche Bedingungen haben andere Anbieter – zu differenzierten Preisen – ebenfalls .…
Representatives from the Treasury Department , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and House Financial Services Committee discussed the plan by phone Thursday , said California Bankers Association Chairman Dan Doyle , who was on the call .
Small community banks are struggling as commercial real estate and other loans go sour .
Officials and industry representatives are considering how to get money to those banks , Doyle said Friday .
Other banking industry leaders confirmed that the conversations are taking place .
They did not know when Treasury might announce the plan .
Spokesmen for Treasury and the FDIC did not respond to requests for comment .
The money could go to banks whose ratings by regulators made them too weak to qualify for earlier rounds of funding .
It may be limited to banks with less than $ 5 billion on their books .
The banks could be required to raise matching money in the private markets , Doyle and others said .
" The rules were pretty restrictive , " he said .
" They want to give another opportunity for some of the community banks . "
CNBC Slideshows :
As with earlier capital injections , banks eventually will have to repay Treasury with interest .
The move could prevent some small bank failures , which would ease pressure on the FDIC 's dwindling fund that insures bank deposits .
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank , D - Mass. , has been " very , very supportive " of extending the program to reach more community banks , said committee spokesman Steve Adamske .
Adamske said Frank had talked with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner about the plan .
" We 're very concerned about the community banking sector , " Adamske said .
" We await Treasury 's decision . "
More From CNBC.com
Adamske said one challenge is that the program was designed for larger banks that are publicly traded .
Many community banks are privately owned or held by small groups of investors , making it more complicated for them to participate .
Rep. Maxine Waters , D - Calif. , at a forum Friday , told Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that she worries about the ability of small and minority - owned banks to access capital .
Bernanke responded that the " the best source " was the government 's $ 700 billion bailout fund .
He also said the government was looking at expanding the program to make it available " very broadly for access . "
He offered no details .
Small banks have until Nov. 9 to apply for the money .
If more banks are deemed eligible , the deadline could be pushed back as the application process can take months to complete .
The plan could prevent officials from winding down a key bailout program .
The $ 700 billion fund is set to expire on Dec. 31 .
Republican lawmakers and some Democrats want Treasury to stop lending now that the financial markets have stabilized .
Frank said this week that he supports extending the program beyond the end of the year .
Geithner has trumpeted the end of some emergency financial programs as signs the economy is recovering .
The department expects to see tens of billions of dollars in additional repayments to the fund in coming months .
But Doyle said FDIC officials still expect up to 150 bank failures this year .
So far , 94 banks have been closed .
That 's the most since 1992 , during the savings - and - loan crisis .
Officials are scrambling for a way to add money to the deposit insurance fund , and may levy a second extra fee on the banking industry .
Officials have said the capital injections from Treasury are intended for healthy banks not at risk of failing .
Lobbyists for small banks say the rules have been too restrictive , discriminating against smaller institutions that are likely to succeed .
" We believe the criteria to determine viability have been too strict , " said Karen Thomas , the top lobbyist with the Independent Community Bankers of America .
Banks that want government money should be required to raise some private capital to prove that the market believes they will succeed , she added .
The program would help " avoid any preventable bank failures , " bolster the FDIC 's deposit insurance fund and help small banks " weather the storm , " Thomas said .
From John L. Perry at Newsmax :
There is a remote , although gaining , possibility America 's military will intervene as a last resort to resolve the Obama problem .
Do n't dismiss it as unrealistic .
America is n't the Third World .
If a military coup does occur here it will be civilized .
That it has never happened does n't mean it wont .
Describing what may be afoot is not to advocate it .
So , view the following through military eyes :
Did you get that ?
Perry does n't advocate a military overthrow of the Obama administration , he's ... just sayin ' .
Does anyone doubt that we 'll see " military coup " signs at the next tea party ?
Mr. Perry believes he has the pulse of our military , but his assumptions go beyond the pale , straining the limits of credulity :
Top military officers can see the Constitution they are sworn to defend being trampled as American institutions and enterprises are nationalized .
They can see that Americans are increasingly alarmed that this nation , under President Barack Obama , may not even be recognizable as America by the 2012 election , in which he will surely seek continuation in office .
They can see that the economy ravaged by deficits , taxes , unemployment , and impending inflation is financially reliant on foreign lender governments .
Read on ...
There are so many flaws in this clown 's logic , I do n't know where to begin .
What he 's actually describing is George Bush 's presidency , not Barack Obama's .
If you can stand to click through to Perry 's article , I would be most interested to hear your thoughts on his assumptions .
As Jamie asked -- can you say treason ?
Also worth remembering : Rush Limbaugh actually promoted this idea a few months ago .

Black Panther Courtroom Sketches
October 13 , 2009
From the The Black Panthers Trial : Courtroom Sketches by Robert Templeton
CBS News commissioned Connecticut sketch artist and painter Robert Templeton to produce several large drawings of the trial to broadcast on the television news .
Templeton made small pastel sketches from life in the courtroom and prepared larger drawings from these sketches in a helicopter on his way to New York City .
Because the courtroom was closed to artists and photographers , Templetons sketches were made surreptitiously , without the permission of the court ; his drawings are , perhaps , the only visual record of the courtroom during this critical case .
The collection includes small preliminary notebook sketches made in the courtroom as well as larger , finished drawings later displayed on CBS news broadcasts .
Defendants Bobby Seale and Ericka Huggins , Prosecutor Arnold Markle , and Judge Harold Mulvey are among the subjects represented .

OpenID has many advantages .
For the average user , the main one is not having to remember a thousand passwords .
That ’s obvious .
But also consider not having to remember the username .
Many web sites use the email address as username and that ’s nice , but many do n’t .
And most people are not lucky enough to have a username that ’s free everywhere .
For my wife , remembering the username is sometimes as hard as remembering the password .
Not having to worry about poorly programmed web sites leaking your password because they stored it in plain text and they have phpMyAdmin open without any password is also a big plus , but not something the average user would see .
But for the developer , it has many , many advantages .
Not having to decide on what identifier to use for your users ( users vs emails vs ids ) .
Not having to implement a log in screen , which means not having to worry about SSL encryption which means not having to get a dedicated IP address , a certificate , configure the web server accordingly and ensure that the site switches to https when it must .
Not getting password for the user means you do n’t have to store a password .
You do n’t have to figure out what is the appropriate encryption mechanism so that if your encrypted password leak , they are not readable .
Not using plain text is not enough , as some encryption mechanisms are easily broken .
Not having to worry about that is huge .
You do n’t have to create a signup page , people just log in .
You do n’t have to validate the password by asking for it twice or validate its strength or any other stuff like that .
You do n’t have to create a remember password page , which means one less place where you have to deal with sending emails .
That ’s always good .
Also it means that you do n’t need to store the email of the user .
You may want to , but that ’s your option .
I ’ve always been a fan of canned authentication and authorization systems .
I ’ve been using them since the days of PHP 4.0 and I used them in Django and ASP.
NET ( MVC ) .
But with OpenID , it seems the authentication became almost trivial .
Canned solutions were always troublesome because they had to work for everybody so they implemented a lot of stuff you do n’t actually need and sometimes you spend more time fighting the bureaucracy of the system than producing something .
Is it possible that without OpenID authentication and identity for the developer of a web site becomes something simple and trivial ?
Where rolling your own solution not only is simple enough , but also the way to go .
I ’m looking forward to my users being just in the user table , and not all over the place in users , profile , membership , etc .
I ’m giving the roll - your - own - with - OpenID a try .
I hope to post positively about it soon .

A senior manager with auditing giant KPMG works on his laptop at a beef cattle farm near the small Australian town of Harden , four hours drive away from Sydney .
From snowy mountains and sun-baked deserts to the steamy tropical north , Australia has begun wiring its vast expanse with a high - tech broadband network in a giant project being closely followed abroad .
From snowy mountains and sun-baked deserts to the steamy tropical north , Australia has begun wiring its vast expanse with a high - tech broadband network in a giant project being closely followed abroad .
Workmen are already digging trenches in island state Tasmania , the first step in a 37 billion US dollar scheme which Prime Minister Kevin Rudd calls Australia 's biggest ever infrastructure venture .
The ambitious plan aims to connect 90 percent of homes , including remote Outback settlements and sprawling coastal cities , with fibre - optic cable by 2017 , accelerating lagging network speeds and boosting the economy .
The sheer scale of the project has drawn interest from foreign governments including the United States , where President Barack Obama has outlined similar plans .
Engineers will lay cable across 7.7 million square kilometres ( 3 million square miles ) of often challenging terrain which covers an area equivalent to two European Unions .
" There 's no kidding about it , it 's a massive job , " telecommunications analyst Paul Budde told AFP .
" You have to physically go to 10 million premises and bring a cable there , either ( by ) digging it or via ( power ) poles and then obviously it 's not just having the cable , you have to have the installation in the house . "
Specialised French digging machines have been shipped to Tasmania to lay the first of millions of kilometres of fibre - optic cable .
By next June , three pilot towns are expected to be enjoying connection speeds of 100 megabits per second .
Just 0.1 percent of Australians are currently linked to fibre - optic cable with most accessing the Internet over the 100 - year - old copper telephone network , prompting Rudd to call the country a " broadband backwater " .
Rudd , announcing the project in April , said Australia had some of the developed world 's slowest Internet speeds and lowest access rates .
Some Outback communities rely on dial - up connections and others have no Internet at all .
" It is good for business , good for productivity , good for the delivery of e-health , good for e-education and good for Australia , " Rudd said this month .
Industry expert Reg Coutts , who advised the government on the network , said the venture had attracted top - level attention in the United States and other countries .
" There 's really an absolute interest , particularly in America , but also in Europe , " he told AFP .
" People are asking , ' What the hell are you doing and how are you doing it ? '
People of course are sceptical , " he said .
Laying the network was only the first step , he added , with the real challenge transitioning 10 million customers from old TV , telephone and Internet networks to the new system .
" That alone , we have never seen on that magnitude anywhere in the world , " Budde said .
Once laid , there was " really no limit " to what the fibre network could do , said Ravi Bhatia , CEO of Primus Telecom and spokesman for industry consortium Terria .
He said technological advances in areas such as satellite mapping would make the roll - out easier than it would have been even three years ago , allowing for " smart " deployment of resources and machines to dig and pull cable .
" By using the latest technology building this network we create another set of skills which we can then export to other countries and build their networks , " said Bhatia .
Government adviser Coutts said every developed country was grappling with the same question : how to replace ageing once - public infrastructure that now belonged to private companies .
Teams of lawyers and economists were racing to untangle complex commercial questions of how to use existing exchanges , underground ducts and power lines to minimise building work , said Budde .
Australia moved to deal with the problem by serving telco giant Telstra , the former state - owned monopoly , with an ultimatum to split its network and retail businesses or face being barred from further wireless spectrum .
Coutts said there was " a lot of infrastructure that could potentially be utilised in the NBN ( National Broadband Network ) " but estimated it was only about 10 percent of what was needed .
" Most of what 's going to go on is purely civil works , actually pulling in and splicing optical fibre to replace the copper , " he said .

There 's no stranger figure on Indian television news at the moment than retired atomic scientist K Santhanam .
One of the driving forces behind the country 's weapons nuclear programme , Santhanam has gone rogue in the past few weeks , denouncing the timidity of Indian government 's pursuit of the most powerful weapons ever devised .
Santhanam wants the country to stop worrying and love the bomb .
According to the scientist , India 's nuclear tests conducted more than a decade ago were a dud .
The country now stands " naked " before China – unable to deter the People 's Liberation Army .
The only solution , says Santhanam , is to defy world opinion and explode a massive thermonuclear device – in his words for India " to cross the Rubicon " by dropping its voluntary testing moratorium .
This runs against the grain of current thinking , which envisages a shrinking of nuclear weapons .
The old cold war mentality of mutually assured destruction and the idea of deterrence have been replaced with a call for a nuclear weapons - free world .
This shift can be traced back to AQ Khan 's atomic supermarket , run from Pakistan , which spread technologies to hostile regimes – with American indifference .
The result is that a host of states from Iran to North Korea stand on the threshold of going nuclear .
More worrying is an assessment that Pakistan 's own nuclear weapons facilities have been attacked three times in two years by extremists .
Al - Qaida openly says it wants the bomb to wage war on America .
Nuclear weapons in such hands would make deterrence less effective and more hazardous .
Little wonder that one of Barack Obama 's key messages at the UN this week will be about global nuclear disarmament .
The securitists in India have a different agenda .
They see nuclear weapons as a route to respect .
Santhanam is undoubtedly a hawk , one who has chafed against the restraints India faced since it refused in the 1960s to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty – Delhi said it was a version of nuclear apartheid .
The NPT banned countries , apart from the five security council members , from owning atomic weapons and simultaneously benefiting from civilian trade in such technologies .
The result was that India tried to build its nuclear weapons industry from scratch .
India did get the bomb – exploding the Smiling Buddha in 1974 and 15 years later it tested five devices .
The uber - nationalists say that India 's home - grown nukes could be geared up for bigger things – citing Pakistan 's expanding nuclear arsenal and China 's vast armoury as reasons to explode bigger devices .
There is an opportunity lurking in the rhetoric gap between Obama 's speeches on disarmament and the implementation of such ideas .
That opening , say hawks , could be filled by a series of massive Indian nuclear tests , which would deter Delhi 's enemies and secure its stockpile – while the world frets about AQ Khan , Iran and North Korea .
Bizarre as this might sound , Indian testing could be justified by the president 's soaring idealism .
Although Obama wants to Washington to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty , it has yet to be passed by the Senate .
As long as the US has not signed the treaty , Delhi's hawks reason , Washington can denounce Indian nuclear tests but the rest of the world is going to ask why senators have blocked the treaty for years .
For a section of India 's elite , the US 's political gridlock is a boon .
They point to China , which tested its arsenal until 1996 before signing up to the NPT and endorsing the CTBT .
Why , runs the thinking , should n't India be allowed to do the same ?
It 's a dangerous game .
India has not signed the NPT or the CTBT .
It has been a nuclear rogue state .
Yet it was brought in from the cold last year by the international community and permitted to trade in nuclear technology despite not having signed the NPT .
It is the only exception ever made for any state with nuclear weapons – a coup and recognition of its rising global status .
France , Russia and the US have signed lucrative deals with India .
Canada and Britain want in too .
The world signalled that it wanted to turn swords into ploughshares – converting nuclear weapons know - how into nuclear energy know - how .
A series of massive Indian nuclear tests would snatch defeat from the jaws of diplomatic victory .
It might provide a short - cut to international status – but it would be one of a pariah .
Questions would be raised about India 's pursuit of intercontinental ballistic missiles , its plans for nuclear - powered submarines and its burgeoning space industry .
It would rightfully be seen as a renegade act , sparking an arms race in Asia when the world least needed it .
Should India test again , the country would once again be subject to sanctions and be seen as a nation engaged in a needless military build - up while its population languished in poverty .
Ever - growing nuclear stockpiles are seen as a threat to the international order and a distraction from economic progress .
For India to go nuclear all over again in a bigger , more deadly way would be a sign of weakness not strength .
The Massachusetts proposal would involve a more ambitious restructuring of health care than any of the cost - cutting ideas being discussed in Washington .
Under a global payment system , doctors , hospitals , nursing homes , and other providers would form large networks , called accountable care organizations , that would provide most of the care for individual patients and divvy up the payments .
Doctors would try to coordinate patients ’ care within these networks , which would share electronic medical records and treatment plans .
And to manage costs , they would try to direct patients to the hospital within the network that could provide good - quality care at the lowest cost , while generally using teaching hospitals for advanced care .
In 1990 , 36 percent of Massachusetts hospital patients were treated at teaching hospitals , but by 2007 the percentage climbed to 44 percent - more than twice the national average of 19 percent .
The percentage of Massachusetts births at teaching hospitals also has increased .
Some of this expanded use of teaching hospitals is understandable , because for many Boston residents academic medical centers in their neighborhoods are their community hospitals .
In other cases , residents bypass less - expensive community hospitals , but this is a freedom many patients desire .
There is little doubt that the state ’s current system of broad choice and sometimes uncoordinated care has helped push Massachusetts health care costs above the national average .
It can lead to unnecessary duplication of medical tests , when patients see multiple providers , each often unaware of what the others have done .
And thousands of residents get knee replacement surgery , have babies at teaching hospitals , or other care , when often a less - expensive hospital would be more economical and provide good - quality care .
This new system of “ global payments ’ ’ would discourage overuse of expensive medical services , force providers to live within a budget , and improve coordination of care for patients , supporters argue .
A state commission recommended in July that insurers largely scrap the current fee - for - service system - in which insurers pay doctors , hospitals , and other providers a negotiated fee for each procedure and visit - and instead pay providers a per-patient annual fee to cover all of the patient ’s medical care .
“ You ca n’t reap these savings without limiting patients ’ choices in some way , ’’ said Paul Levy , chief executive of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center .
“ It ’s a huge issue , it ’s huge . ’’ Dr. James Mongan , president of Partners HealthCare , a Beth Israel Deaconess competitor , agreed that it would n’t “ work without some restriction on choice . ’’
But a growing number of hospital officials and physician lead ers warn that the new payment system proposed by a state commission would not work without restrictions on where patients receive care - an issue some providers say the commission and the Patrick administration have glossed over .
Efforts to keep patients in a defined provider network , or direct them to lower - cost hospitals could be unpopular , especially in a state where more than 40 percent of hospital care is provided in expensive academic medical centers and where many insurance policies allow patients access to large numbers of providers .
The state ’s ambitious plan to shake up how providers are paid could have a hidden price for patients : Controlling Massachusetts ’ soaring medical costs , many health care leaders believe , may require residents to give up their nearly unlimited freedom to go to any hospital and specialist they want .
The release of the report sparked a lobbying campaign by Massachusetts health care executives , who are urging Governor Deval Patrick ’s administration and state legislators to move cautiously because they fear a new payment system could bankrupt some providers and compromise patient care .
Many changes recommended by the commission would have to be approved by the Legislature before being put in place .
In its report , the commission , which includes high - ranking Patrick administration officials and legislators , said patients would n’t necessarily be restricted to providers within their primary care doctor ’s accountable care organization .
And , during a hearing at the State House Thursday , Dr. JudyAnn Bigby , secretary of Health and Human Services , said “ the people benefiting from the new system should not even notice it . ’’
Writing in the New England Journal of Medicine last month , staff writer Dr. Robert Steinbrook said the state commission failed to address the choice issue head - on .
Global payments would save money only if networks “ limited the volume of services , and denied certain requests from patients and providers , ’’ among other measures , he wrote .
“ Since patient choice is such a sensitive issue , the commission waffled . ’’
But Sarah Iselin , head of the state Division of Health Care Finance and Policy and cochair of the payment commission , said the panel understood the importance of addressing the effect of its recommendations on patient choice , but “ felt these issues could be figured out ’’ later by a board that would be created to oversee the transition to a new payment system .
The commission recommended that all residents choose a primary care doctor , because many patients will listen to their doctor ’s recommendations about where to get care , she said .
Under global payments , those doctors would have an incentive to refer patients within their organization .
And , she said , educating patients about low - cost , high - quality providers also will play a major role , and may preclude the need for forced restrictions on choice .
“ Over time , patients may very well be inclined to go there all by themselves , ’’ Iselin said .
Even if patients continue to seek basic care at teaching hospitals and go outside their doctors ’ networks , she said , global payments have the potential to save money in other ways .
The state estimates , for example , that reducing preventable hospital stays and emergency room visits would save $ 1 billion a year .
But Lynn Nicholas , president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association , pointed out that even saving money in these areas requires more coordinated care .
One way to address the issue and still give people choices , she said , is for insurers to offer plans that charge higher premiums for unlimited access to providers , and lower premiums for members willing to stay within a defined network .
Many insurers offer these types of limited networks now - premiums are about 15 percent lower than in plans with unlimited access - but they have n’t been popular among employers and employees .
Nicholas said that may be because the financial incentives to join plans with limited networks are n’t strong enough .
She wants providers , insurers , and employers to work together to develop benefit programs that will encourage patients to stay within limited networks .
Another way to cut the cost of academic medical centers is to reduce the prices they are paid .
In an analysis done for the state this summer , the RAND Corporation estimated Massachusetts could save $ 1.3 billion to as much as $ 18 billion over 10 years if teaching hospital payments for certain conditions were set at average community hospital rates , depending on how many conditions are included .
It ’s unclear whether the Legislature or the board that would oversee the new payment system would embrace such a controversial change .
But the payment commission recommended that the board address in some way the issue of hospitals being paid vastly different amounts for similar care .
During her testimony , Bigby , the state Health and Human Services secretary , said that in the transition to global payments , “ we must be careful . . . not to enshrine the inequities that exist in the current system . ’’

All over the Earth human beings are multiplying at staggering rates , threatening the human future as well as that of all other forms of life .
Our struggles against global warming , against environmental degradation , and against terrorism stemming from poverty and hopelessness , are all doomed to failure unless we stabilize population and even reduce it where we can .
offer incentives for family planning .
Several religious denominations are still blind to their role in contributing to increased population and resultant poverty .
The oppression of women and their absence from education in many countries is also a major problem .
Politicians are often unwilling to have the courage to speak out about the “ population bomb . ”
They do not wish to offend powerful clerics , followers of pro-growth cults or members of ethnic groups or political groups who feel threatened by neighbors numerically ( as for example , Israelis and Palestinians ) .
But the stakes are far too high !
Here are a few ideas of how we might begin to move in a positive direction : first , in the USA we might end the tax deduction for more than two children .
If parents wish to have more than two children , they may , but they should not be subsidized by the public .
Second , all adults having vasectomies or other procedures to permanently prevent impregnation , will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the deduction for having a child .
This would include women as well as men , but would not apply to abortions .
Third , devices to prevent impregnation , such as condoms and pills will be made available to all persons above a certain age , free of charge .
Fourth , educational programs will be put in place to encourage mothers to nurse their children for as many years as possible , and to space children accordingly .
Public spaces might be developed specifically for nursing mothers where they may nurse their children in a women - only setting if desired by the mother .
Parenting must be a required course of instruction in all schools , since raising children properly is one of the most important functions for many persons .
Internationally , it is vital that the rich nations of the world establish a fund to establish and subsidize schools throughout the world for every girl and every boy .
These schools should fit in with the cultures and educational plans of the country where they are placed , but they must allow young women to go as high as they can .
This is because literate and informed women , I would think , are a key to stabilizing population growth .
We must also plan for ways to maintain employment for people in a society where population growth is not taking place .
Our ways of looking at economic activity must be weaned from a dependence on “ growth . ”
What can we do if we are not building new suburbs , if we do not need new towns , and if the demand for construction flattens out ?
Obviously , we will have to concentrate upon cleaning up the messes that we have created , fixing up decaying neighborhoods , repairing abused rivers and streams , and , in general improving the quality of life for all human beings .
There will be plenty to do !
But such a change will also depend upon providing funding to people who now cannot afford to fix up their homes , who cannot afford to go to college , who can not now afford medical care , and on and on .
In other words , a more just and equalitarian society will be needed .
I do not believe that many of our current politicians have the courage to speak the truth to us !
But we , as citizens , must put them on the spot and force the issue .
It is Mother Earth and future generations whose voices must be heard .
[ Jack D. Forbes bases his philosophy on Native American ideas of using Mother Earth sparingly and respectfully . ]
When the Wii first launched , there was a brief window of opportunity in which customers could download the Internet Channel for free and browse the net via the gift of motion control .
However , despite being a rather inconvenient , slow and altogether rubbish feature , Nintendo started charging 500 Wii Points for it .
Anybody stupid enough to buy it must be kicking themselves now , because it 's free again .
If you are among the retards who paid good money for it , however , do not worry .
Nintendo has n't forgotten its gullible audience and will be rewarding anybody who bought the Internet Channel with a free NES game from the Virtual Console .
There 's no word on what the game will be , but it will launch in late October .
I hope it 's something really awful , like Bart vs. The Space Mutants .
This feature should always have been free , really , since it could n't hope to replace a real Internet browser and exists as a mere curiorisity and a poor man 's method of watching Youtube videos on the TV .
The Office for National Statistics suggests that the increase in the population to 61.4 million is mostly attributable to an increase in the birth rate – for the first time in a decade the increase in births has overtaken net immigration as a factor .
But the figures do n't suggest that Brits from all classes and communities are merrily procreating to the same extent .
More than half the increase is attributable to mothers born outside the UK , and many of those mothers born here will be second generation immigrants .
Of the indigenous mothers , many are in their twenties and some of the increase there is attributable to more generous benefits .
As the French twigged some time ago , if you make it worth women 's while to have children , more will .
Alan Saunders : Hello , I'm Alan Saunders and on ABC Radio National this is The Philosopher 's Zone .
Well , if you were just listening to All in the Mind , you might have some idea now of what makes a ' creative brain ' , but what about the products of all that creativity ?
How do you know it when you see it , or rather , how do you know that what you are seeing is one form of creativity - let 's call it art - rather than another , which we can call craft .
In other words : it 's in a gallery , it 's carrying a heavy price tag , but is it art ?
And how can we know that it's art when it looks suspiciously like a Campbell 's soup can or the artist 's own unmade bed ?
I 'm devoting the whole of this week 's program to a conversation with Arthur C. Danto , Emeritus Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University , and one of the most significant philosophers in the English - speaking world , who has evolved an elaborate theory of what art is , and how we can know it when we see it .
And it all came about in the sixties when he saw some facsimile Brillo cartons , displayed as art by Andy Warhol .
Arthur C. Danto :
That 's right .
To be a little bit more exact , there were several different kinds of commercial shipping cartons that he had facsimiles of .
There were , I think , about eight different kinds of cartons : there were Kellog 's cornflakes , Pine 's ketchup , Campbell 's tomato soup , but the Brillo box was clearly the star of the show , it 's the one that everybody basically remembers .
They were all piled up , so you made a turn off the lobby in a very upscale town house on the East side of Manhattan , and it was like you were walking into the stock room of a supermarket .
There was nothing really except for the incongruity of the situation to let you know that you were in an art gallery .
That was called the Stable Gallery .
Alan Saunders :
So here we have facsimiles of commonplace objects being displayed as works of art .
This is not entirely new , because of course at the beginning of the century Marcel Duchamps had used genuine commonplace objects as works of art ; like a urinal , had n't he ?
Arthur C. Danto :
Well , that 's right .
In 1917 , he made an effort to - he was n't entirely commonplace because he splashed signature on it and so forth , but basically that is right .
But I think Duchamps came from a very different kind of background and movement in art than Warhol did .
Duchamps was part of a Dada movement which was out in a way , to make fun of the pretensions of fine art , and Duchamp was polemical in attacking the celebrated artist 's eye and the artist 's hand .
And so he was interested in finding objects that he was prepared to consider works of art which were manufactured , so that there was no hand involved , and pretty commonplace , so that there would be nothing aesthetically distinguished about them , and in most cases probably nobody , unless they were deeply involved with research , would know who even designed them , and so forth .
Like the urinal he purchased out of a plumbing supply shop in downtown New York .
Whereas Warhol came from the pop movement , which was gaining steam by 1964 , and I think that they were involved in something parallel .
They were involved in demoting the pretensions of high art , but they were interested in the celebration of vernacular culture you might say : advertising logos , comic strip panels , things that everybody would be entirely familiar with .
But a lot of these things had a certain aesthetic distinction , whereas Duchamp was mainly interested in objects which had no aesthetic distinction whatsoever .
And I think that the other thing is that in the context , in New York City , the history of art had just gone through a period in which people took high art very seriously .
This was the abstract expressionist movement , the artists were quite prepared to regard themselves as shamans , as metaphysicians , in touch with the deepest currents of the universe , and the artists like Lichtenstein and to some degree , Warhol , were out to deflate those attitudes , and to think that it was probably just as difficult to draw Mickey Mouse as to draw something that , I do n't know , William de Koenig or one of the other high - flying abstract expressionist painters would draw .
So it was a very different set of polemics .
Duchamp was against high art because and the Dada movement thought that it was the art that was celebrated and revered by the classes that made World War I an actuality in which millions and millions of very fine people were killed .
And in a way it was a punitive movement .
It was out to disgrace the kind of art in which the ruling classes believed , and a decision on the artist 's part to act like buffoons rather than wise persons , whereas in New York in ' 64 it was a very different situation .
I do n't think that the artists in the pop movement were out particularly to punish anybody but they certainly were involved in deflating , the ironising really , the pretensions at least of abstract expression .
So that there are the outward similarities , but very different artistic impulses and very different , what one might call art historical explanations of the two bodies of work .
Alan Saunders : OK , well returning then to the Brillo pads , here we have these facsimile Brillo pad cartons , which are , as far as appearance goes , indiscernible from the real thing , and this brings us to what is known as your method of indiscernibles .
Now this seems to me to be a very profitable approach , not just to art but to the history of philosophy .
So can you tell us what it is ?
Arthur C. Danto :
Well , what I had in mind was ; there was a photograph of Andy posed in front of Brillo boxes by a man named Fred McDarrah and he looked like a pasty - faced stockroom clerk in front of a box of shipping cartons .
You could n't have told from the photograph that these were anything except shipping cartons , because until 1964 nobody saw them as anything else , and what Warhol had done had been to duplicate them .
Now my interest in this show , and as you said , I 've been thinking about it , started thinking about it a long time ago ; but you 've got two objects , which are to all outward appearances , indiscernible , they look exactly alike , but one is a piece of avant - garde art , and the other one is just a utilitarian container .
And I thought ,
Well that raises the question of what is art in a very different form than has ever been raised before .
Before , people would just ask blankly , What is art ?
What Warhol did was to put it in a different way .
How , if you have two objects which look exactly alike , are , as I put it , indiscernibles , one being a work of art and the other one not , what 's the difference ?
And it seemed to me that the difference has to be invisible .
You can't tell really the difference between one art and the ordinary object just by looking .
And then somebody said , ' Well there 's a difference , I mean , Warhol 's boxes are made out of wood , the Brillo cartons are made out of corrugated cardboard ' , and I said , ' You mean to tell me that the difference art and reality is the difference between wood and cardboard and so forth ?
That can't be the answer . '
Philosophers have been pecking away at the question of art for 2500 years .
I mean the history of philosophy basically begins with that discussion in Plato .
So it 's been regarded of some importance to mark the difference between art and reality , but nobody had ever come across anything where art and reality were so indiscernible that you realised that you were going to have to do some serious thinking to try and make the difference , and make the difference count .
That was the method that I was working with , and I thought that it had the character of any classical philosophical question where you 've got two things that can't be told apart , but they 're momentously different .
Like in the beginning of Descartes ' Meditations , Descartes says , ' Well what better evidence can I have for what the senses provide me with ? '
And then he says , ' Well that would be true if only I knew I was sensing , because as a matter of fact , I dreamt that I was having certain experiences and the dreams were very vivid , and I would have had no idea that there was nothing in front of me , nothing being perceived until I woke up , and realised that I 'd been dreaming ' .
So , the difference between dream experience and waking experience is momentous , but there 's no way of telling one from the other until something happens and you wake up , for example , and even then you 've got a serious problem .
So , I tried to show that all classical philosophical questions are like that ; that you 've got a difference which is un-empirical ; you can't tell the difference , and yet the difference is momentous in a certain way , and that 's what got me going .
I think that my positivistic teachers felt that philosophy should be like science and it should all be a matter of observation and verification as to whether something goes this way or that .
But I thought , all genuine philosophical distinctions are invisible in that kind of way .
So as a philosopher of art as I started out to be , I had n't taken myself to be that until these very exciting days in the sixties , then I really saw this as an exciting question .
But all of a sudden there was a problem and after that , I tried to say what the problem could have been .
For example , when I began to look for a definition , I began to think that one way of thinking about a work of art is that it 's got some kind of content ; it 's about something .
About the Brillo box : I know what the content of a Brillo box is , it 's virtually what the Brillo box contains ; it 's about Brillo , and you look at the outer decoration of the surfaces of the Brillo box and you discover that it really is a piece of brilliant rhetoric proclaiming the virtues of Brillo .
But if I tried to say what his work was about , I might say , Well , it 's about the Brillo box .
The Brillo box is about Brillo , but his work was about the Brillo box , it had a different meaning .
Maybe why he was doing something like making a facsimile of a Brillo box was because he was celebrating commercial culture , celebrating everyday life , celebrating the commonsense world , or just celebrating , the way a boy who came from a very poor family celebrating these delicious things that are available , like canned soups and so forth .
Whatever was in Warhol 's mind , and for that one would have to do a certain amount of digging .
So it does n't wear its meaning on its face the way the Brillo carton wears its meaning on its face .
That was a kind of beginning .
And I poked along until I could find , as philosophers have done since Plato , a set of necessary conditions for something to be an art work .
This was in a much later book , The Transfiguration of the Commonplace .
Alan Saunders :
In his book , The Transfiguration of the Commonplace , Arthur Danto illustrates these issues by way of Pierre Menard : Author of The Quixote , a short story by the Argentinian writer , Jorge Luis Borges .
Menard is an early 20th century French writer who decides to rewrite a 16th century Spanish masterpiece , the Don Quixote of Miguel Cervantes .
Arthur C. Danto :
What he actually did , nobody can quite figure out , but he produced a piece of prose that corresponded word for word to the prose that Cervantes wrote in the 16th century .
But as the writer of the story says , ' His Spanish was quite affected , after all he was doing it in 16th century Spanish , whereas Cervantes handled effortlessly the common speech of his time ' .
And so he then begins to show how different these two indiscernible pieces of writing are , and by the time you 're finished , you begin to realise what an extraordinary feat it was that Pierre Menard had done .
And I began to look for those kinds of examples , not in the visual arts necessarily , but in literature .
A beautiful example I found in Nabokov 's novel Pale Fire where he talks about a poem by the American poet , Robert Frost , which is called , Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening , and it ends with two lines :
But I have promises to keep ,
And miles to go before I sleep ,
And miles to go before I sleep .
The last two lines are a repetition of one another .
And then Nabokov says ,
The first one is a simple autobiographical statement , " Miles to go before I sleep " .
And the second one is a metaphysical utterance , " I have a lot to do before I die " .
It 's a beautiful example of showing how two lines , although they read the same , just because of their position are making very different kinds of statements .
So I think that phenomenon can be found in a lot of different places and there 's nothing , so to speak , typographically to distinguish the two lines , but there 's a deep difference between them - as I thought there was with Warhol .
And I was n't aware of this fact when I wrote The Transfiguration of the Commonplace ; it was published in 1981 .
But the Brillo box , the actual Brillo box , that Brillo boxes are shipped in , was designed by an abstract expressionist painter , a second generation abstract expressionist painter by the name of James Harvey .
He died very young but would have been in the next generation of great American gestural painters , but as I say , he died .
But there 's a photograph in which Warhol is shown giving Harvey one of the boxes that Harvey actually designed .
It is one of those ironies that it 's almost a sort of story that Borges could have written , that Harvey designed this box , but his conception of art would have been inconsistent with even thinking of it as a work of art .
For him , to be a work of art meant , in 1964 , ' 63 , whenever he designed the box , a large splashy canvas and so forth .
But I found , actually found , a photograph in which Harvey is shown kneeling in front of one of one of his expressionist paintings , holding the Brillo box up .
It 's a very touching , very pathetic kind of story .
Alan Saunders : Once Andy Warhol has done what he did with the Brillo box , does our relationship to actual Brillo boxes change ?
Arthur C. Danto :
It might .
We 've got to think about them in a very different kind of way .
We 're going to think about them as designed , and once we know they were designed by an artist we 're going to say , ' Well of course it 's such a marvellous piece of visual rhetoric that only an artist could have done it . '
A friend of mine who did some research found an application for a grant that James Harvey made in answer to the question , ' How do you make your living ? '
Basically , he said , ' I 'm a part - time package designer ' .
But it 's a brilliant design : it 's red , white and blue , which of course in America are the colours of patriotism .
And then there 's a kind of river of white that goes all the way around it , which gives you the sense of the world being cleaned and so forth .
So you 're connecting cleanliness with patriotism and almost making buying Brillo a patriotic duty and so forth .
I mean it 's an astonishing piece of work .
But Warhol does n't get any credit for that at all , it was done by Harvey .
He just copied it , but in copying it he was maybe doing something philosophical paying tribute to this world of commonplace objects .
After all , these products were designed to be consumed ; you have to choose some kind of a soap pad or some kind of tomato juice , some kind of soup , and you might as well pick the one that 's most appealingly designed , which is what design 's all about , that 's what commercial art is .
And then all these sudden visual virtues , you look at them as if they were art , as if they were art .
Maybe Andy's box inherits some of that beauty , I do n't know , but most of the boxes he designed are n't particularly beautiful at all .
Alan Saunders :
One of the problems here , if we take say , the example of Pierre Menard .
Supposing his Don Quixote had reached publication and I picked up a copy of it , without knowing that it was the Pierre Menard Don Quixote , rather than the Cervantes one , I would n't realise that .
Similarly , I might make a similar mistake with the Andy Warhol .
So in order to admire the works in both cases , the fictional one and the actual one , I do need knowledge , in addition to what I can see in front of me .
Arthur C. Danto :
Yes , I do think that 's important , that when you pick it up and you start reading it you think you 're reading about an adult Spanish nobleman in La Mancha etc. , and all his hallucinations and fantasies and so forth , and somebody says , ' Oh no , this was written by a 19th century Frenchman , a poet , a symbolist poet , and it 's really about language , it 's not about Spain at all ' , you 'd say , ' But I would never have known that ' , and I 'd say , ' Well , no , but if you look on the copyright page , you 'll see that it 's copyrighted 1897 ' - and so forth , and you 'd have to give it a very different interpretation .
And suddenly you realise , Well if that 's true , we never know whether we 're in the presence of art or not .
And that really is kind of amazing when you think about it .
I began to have these experiences , I remember once I was out in California , I was invited to give a talk for some of our history students , and I walked past a classroom that was being redone , and I thought to myself , How do I know that that 's not just an installation ?
How do I know that 's not a work of art that happens to consist of ladders and paint buckets and so forth ?
I could do some digging ; I 'd have to check it out .
I mean if I went into the office of somebody and said , ' Is that a work of art or are you just redecorating the room or something ? ' they'd think I was nuts , but that 's the situation .
And I love the idea that you might be in the presence of art at any moment , and not know it and then say , ' Suppose I were in the presence of art , how different would it be ? '
Well in terms of appearance , not different at all , but in terms of meaning it would be pretty different , and would be , as I say , momentously different .
And you get all these funny situations that happen .
Somebody makes a work of art which consists of a lot of cigarette butts and the janitor just throws it away .
I mean that kind of thing has been happening in avant - garde art for a long time .
Alan Saunders :
Who then determines whether a particular object is a work of art ?
I mean is there some , as it were , institution however informal , that 's deciding on this , is the custodian of the knowledge , is providing the information that we need to understand that something is a work of art ?
Arthur C. Danto :
Well , after my paper was published , there got to be a kind of institutional theory of art where there actually was proposed that the art world is an institution , which makes determinations of that sort .
Obviously it 's not like an election that 's held , but there 's a certain grain of truth in it .
That is to say , that Warhol 's box was art in 1964 only for a handful of people who had been participating in a discussion which would have included I suppose , discussing the meaning of Duchamps , and for them , the Brillo box was a work of art whose time had come , and would know what were the reasons , what was the history in virtue of which something like that became possible as art and so forth .
And nobody who was not privy to that discussion would have been in any position to talk .
Alan Saunders :
You take the view , do n't you , that now art is over , the history of art has ended .
Arthur C. Danto :
Well no ; in a way I do , I did write a fairly well - known paper called The End of Art ; what I meant really was it was a dramatic way of saying that there 's no longer the possibility even of a direction .
I think up until the sixties , it was possible to think of the history of art as an unfolding narrative and what we have to do is to wait and see what 's produced , and the next season , and the season after that , and everybody would be interested in what 's the next big thing and things like that .
Then suddenly , once you begin to get a situation where anything can be a work of art , but you can't tell in advance whether you 're in the presence of a work of art or not , then at that point , there 's no longer the possibility of an unfolding narrative at all .
And when anything is possible , that seemed to me to be the end of things .
I did n't mean that people were n't going to go on making art and the paper , The End of Art , was published I think in 1984 .
There 's plenty of art that 's been made since then , in fact probably more art 's been made since 1984 than had been made from the beginning of time until 1984 .
So there 's a lot of it around .
But there 's no longer , I think , as I wrote someplace , there 'll be surprises , but there wo n't be any philosophical surprises .
Alan Saunders : Arthur Danto , I 've enjoyed our conversation .
Arthur C. Danto :
So did I , thanks a lot .
Alan Saunders :
Thank you very much for joining us .
Arthur C. Danto :
You 're altogether welcome .
The FCC voted unanimously yesterday to move forward with the debate in an effort to formalize net neutrality guidelines .
Senator John McCain followed up by introducing a bill that would prohibit the FCC from governing communications .
In the wake of FCC chairman Julius Genachowski's initial announcement of his intent to pursue formal net neutrality rules , a group of GOP lawmakers already initiated a similar attempt .
However , that amendment was retracted almost as quickly as it was filed .
McCain 's bill , the Internet Freedom
Act , seeks to do the opposite of what its name implies by ensuring that broadband and wireless providers can discriminate and throttle certain traffic while giving preferential treatment to other traffic .
Basically , those in power or those who pay more will have better access .
Apparently we have different definitions of ‘ freedom ' .
According to the text of the McCain bill , the FCC " shall not propose , promulgate , or issue any regulations regarding the Internet or IP - enabled services . "
Is n't that what the FCC does ?
Is n't that sort of like introducing a bill to prohibit the Treasury from printing money , or a bill to prohibit the IRS from collecting taxes ?
Oddly , the bill also contains text stating that any regulations in effect on the day before the Internet Freedom
Act is officially enacted are grandfathered in and exempt from the provisions of the Internet Freedom Act .
The implication seems to be that if the FCC can formalize net neutrality rules before McCain can get the Internet Freedom
Act signed into law , the net neutrality rules would still apply .
Net neutrality opponents claim that the free market can police itself and that any net neutrality restrictions will stifle innovation and competition .
However , Comcast tried to throttle peer - to - peer networking traffic and only changed policy after the threat of FCC net neutrality rules .
AT&T sought to block customers from using VoIP services from its wireless network , but changed policy out of fear of the net neutrality rules .
The trend seems to be that these providers only do the ‘ right thing ' when the net neutrality gun is pointing at their head .
What the FCC voted on yesterday is simply to start the debate .
Its an open discussion , so what are net neutrality opponents afraid of ?
They have 120 days to gather information and collect data and present their case .
If there are valid issues that need to be resolved , then go ahead and bring them to the table .
Do n't initiate legislation that seeks to pretend the table does n't exist .
During the Presidential election campaign last year the differences between the two candidates was stark .
While Obama was attached surgically to his CrackBerry and his staff leveraged social media from their Macbooks , McCain admitted having little or no knowledge or interest in modern technologies like email or the Internet .
It seems suspicious that the Internet is suddenly a major concern for him .
Maybe he just missed seeing his name in the paper .

Last year , Edmonds claimed that foreign intelligence agents had enlisted the support of US officials to acquire a network of moles in sensitive military and nuclear institutions .
Among the hours of covert tape recordings , she says she heard evidence that one well - known senior official in the US State Department was being paid by Turkish agents in Washington who were selling the information on to black market buyers , including Pakistan .
... Edmonds said , " He was aiding foreign operatives against US interests by passing them highly classified information , not only from the State Department but also from the Pentagon , in exchange for money , position and political objectives . "
She claims that the FBI was also gathering evidence against senior Pentagon officials – including household names – who were aiding foreign agents .
However , Edmonds was under a gag order imposed in 2002 by Attorney General John Ashcroft , preventing her from naming the senior US officials who were alleged to have divulged state secrets to foreign agents .
Sibel Edmonds , founder of the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition ( NSWBC ) , told IPS , ' National Security employees ' should not have to sacrifice their careers or financial security in doing what is right .
Good employees are being chased out of jobs and fired by those who either are engaged in wrongful behaviour or do n't want to hear about . "
She added , " A national security employee has to choose between career and conscience when confronted with agency wrongdoing .
We need to adopt protections for employees that allow them to be secure in their jobs and encourage them to report waste , fraud , and abuse of power . " ... In October 2002 , at the request of FBI Director Robert Mueller , then Attorney - General John Ashcroft imposed a gag order on Edmonds , citing possible damage to diplomatic relations or national security .
Edmonds sued and appealed her case all the way to the Supreme Court .
But the high court agreed with lower courts that trying her case would compromise " state secrets " .
On Monday for the first time in an interview with former CIA officer Phillip Giraldi , Edmonds has named three senior officials , Douglas Feith , Paul Wolfowitz , and Richard Perle , who are alleged to have been involved .
Giraldi : ISI — Pakistani intelligence — has been linked to the Pakistani nuclear proliferation program as well as to al - Qaeda and the Taliban .
So the FBI was monitoring these connections going from a congressman to a congressman ’s assistant to a foreign individual who is connected with intelligence to other intelligence people who are located at different embassies in Washington .
And all of this information is in an FBI file somewhere ?
Edmonds :
Two sets of FBI files , but the AIPAC - related files and the Turkish files ended up converging in one .
The FBI agents believed that they were looking at the same operation .
It did n’t start with AIPAC originally .
It started with the Israeli Embassy .
The original targets were intelligence officers under diplomatic cover in the Turkish Embassy and the Israeli Embassy .
It was those contacts that led to the American Turkish Council and the Assembly of Turkish American Associations and then to AIPAC fronting for the Israelis .
It moved forward from there .
<...>
Giraldi :
So the network starts with a person like Grossman in the State Department providing information that enables Turkish and Israeli intelligence officers to have access to people in Congress , who then provide classified information that winds up in the foreign embassies ?
Edmonds : Absolutely .
And we also had Pentagon officials doing the same thing .
We were looking at Richard Perle and Douglas Feith .
They had a list of individuals in the Pentagon broken down by access to certain types of information .
Some of them would be policy related , some of them would be weapons - technology related , some of them would be nuclear - related .
Perle and Feith would provide the names of those Americans , officials in the Pentagon , to Grossman , together with highly sensitive personal information .
<...>
Giraldi :
So they were doing favors for other reasons .
Both Feith and Perle were lobbyists for Turkey and also were involved with Israel on defense contracts , including some for Northrop Grumman , which Feith represented in Israel .
Edmonds :
They had arrangements with various companies , some of them members of the American Turkish Council .
They had arrangements with Kissinger ’s group , with Northrop Grumman , with former secretary of state James Baker ’s group , and also with former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft .
The monitoring of the Turks picked up contacts with Feith , Wolfowitz , and Perle in the summer of 2001 , four months before 9/11 .
They were discussing with the Turkish ambassador in Washington an arrangement whereby the U.S. would invade Iraq and divide the country .
The UK would take the south , the rest would go to the U.S.
They were negotiating what Turkey required in exchange for allowing an attack from Turkish soil .
The Turks were very supportive , but wanted a three - part division of Iraq to include their own occupation of the Kurdish region .
Sibel Edmonds documentary – Kill the Messenger
The sign on the nondescript industrial building by a Highway 237 offramp still calls it a glass company , but inside is a throwback to that seminal band of Silicon Valley hackers who created the world ’s first personal computers .
Welcome to Hacker Dojo , a “ community center ” for code monkeys , startup dreamers and anybody else with an unquenchable thirst to take technology in new directions .
A typical evening at the Dojo in Mountain View sometimes looks like chaos — two friends cobbling together a robot out of chips , circuit boards and servo motors ; a clump of technical writers packed like sweaty sardines into a meeting ; people squinting silently into their laptops , oblivious to the coming night .
But the nearly - 2 - month - old , one - of - a- kind Dojo ( a Japanese term for a place martial arts practitioners gather to learn from one another ) already has the support of valley heavyweights .
Google and Microsoft are financial sponsors , mindful of the potential value of ideas , relationships and businesses that could be born here .
And a key member of the renowned after - work hobby club that helped spawn the personal computer says the Dojo just might spark the same lightning bolt of innovation .
As the founders put it , the Dojo is a place for events , lectures , parties , hackathons , knitting circles , tinkering or brainstorming .
“ This is a place where those who are passionate about creating things , who want to create something bigger than themselves , can come to meet other people like themselves , ” said Brian Klug , one of the founders of the Dojo .
That ’s what happened with the Homebrew Computer Club in the 1970s , said Lee Felsenstein , an organizer of the storied Silicon Valley hobby club whose members included Apple founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak , and that helped launch more than 20 tech companies .
A senior adviser and participant in Hacker Dojo , Felsenstein said he does n’t know of anything like it before in Silicon Valley .
Homebrew was a seedbed for Wozniak ’s world - changing personal computer , the Apple II , and the club always intended to establish a permanent workshop , a place where people could come and cross-pollinate .
But Homebrew never did .
Felsenstein thinks the boom in online social networking may have , paradoxically , made people appreciate the potential of an actual physical gathering of creative minds , as Homebrew was .
“ At the early meetings , Steve Jobs was running all around the place , ” said Felsenstein , whose Dojo title is Sensei — “ esteemed master ” in Japanese .
“ I never heard him say anything .
He just wanted to hear everything that was said .
Here we are 35 years later , and we have a lot more tools at our disposal , the Internet and so forth , but there is still no good substitute for people meeting in person . ”
Culture of creativity
For the Dojo ’s founders , a hacker is not the dirtbag in Latvia phishing for your credit card number .
David Weekly , another Dojo founding director , said being a hacker is about embracing a culture of creativity .
“ If you are digging the act of intellectual property creation , you ’re a hacker — whether you are a painter or an artist or a linguist or whatever .
If you dig what you ’re doing , and you are doing it for the love of it , then you are a hacker . ”
The idea to create a permanent , always - open “ community center ” for technical creativity grew out of a regular tech party on the Peninsula organized by Weekly and other friends called SuperHappyDevHouse , where young software developers would convene every few weeks with laptops , energy drinks and beer to code - up projects and hang out .
DevHouse grew and in time began to draw people in their 40s , 50s and even 60s — including Felsenstein , who designed the Osborne 1 , the world ’s first mass - produced , portable computer .
When about 400 people showed up for the 30th DevHouse in February , Weekly had an inspiration .
“ It just struck me , we need to make this permanent . ”
The Dojo opened in late August , but no one felt it important to remove the stained and smoked glass and somewhat cheesy light fixtures from the former occupant , Glass Paradigm .
Organizers just moved in a few desks and beanbag chairs .
With more than 80 members , the Dojo is nonprofit and all - volunteer ; several founders are still shelling out as much as $ 500 a month to subsidize it .
Mixed bag of techies
It ’s near midnight in Mountain View , and from the parking lot outside a few hackers can be seen through the Dojo ’s windows , their faces washed in the ghostly light of their laptops .
It ’s about the time Lecole Cole usually heads home from his second “ job . ”
Cole has a day job as an engineering director for a Silicon Valley tech company .
But he shows up at the Dojo late most weekday afternoons to start his second shift — founder and CEO of his startup — a company called Skydera that plans to offer a quick response to companies that want to lease data servers on the Internet - based “ cloud . ”
When Cole heard about the Dojo ’s plans for 24/7 Wi-Fi , he quickly ponied up the $ 100 monthly membership fee .
On weekends now , he might log 15 hours a day at the Dojo .
“ For quite some time , I had been doing the coffee shop shuffle — bookstores , college libraries — just looking for someplace quiet where I did n’t have to move every 30 minutes , ” he said .
“ I knew the schedule for every single library in the Bay Area . ”
Cole is one of a number of regulars at the Dojo , regularly hammering away on their nascent startup .
But everywhere , ideas are literally in the air .
He fell into a discussion recently with three or four people kicking around ideas for iPhone and Facebook applications , and saw how a spontaneous talk between people with different areas of expertise helped trouble - shoot problems and enlarge the vision for their ideas .
Dojo denizens say those creative interactions happen all the time .
For others , the Dojo is a cherished place to be with like - minded acolytes of technology — to find their tribe .
“ These are my people , ” said Laura Rubin , 26 , of San Jose , who called herself “ socially a geek ” and “ culturally a geek ” as she tinkered in the Dojo ’s hardware workshop with a friend one recent evening .
Even in Silicon Valley , a truly passionate hacker can sometimes feel like a bit of an outcast , said Jeff Lindsay , a Dojo founding director .
“ To find a place to go where people do n’t think you ’re crazy , ” said Lindsay , 24 , a senior developer on Nebula , a cloud computing platform being built at NASA ’s Ames Research Center , “ is just the greatest thing in the world . ”

Advertisement A retired pilot has told how he managed to control a bomber which unexpectedly took off during an airshow .
Bob Prothero , from Portsmouth , and his co-pilot were inside the Victor which was meant to speed along the runway before stopping .
But the co-pilot froze and failed to close the throttle meaning it took off .
An investigation into the incident in May at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome , Leicestershire , decided that no one could be blamed .
The retired group captain , who had last flown the plane 29 years ago , told the BBC that although he was " petrified " there was no time to think during the nine seconds it was airborne .
Footage of the incident , which happened at the Cold War Jets airshow , has been posted on the video - sharing website YouTube showing the aircraft taking off and being blown about by the wind .
Underneath it all there was really too much to do in the nine seconds we were airborne to actually think too much what I was doing
Gp Capt Bob Prothero Gp Capt Prothero , 70 , said : " We set out to do a normal fast run taxi for the public 's pleasure , the attempt was to go to 100 knots and then stop .
" In the event I called for ' throttles closed ' which closed us down , but the co-pilot froze , the throttles did n't close and the aircraft kept accelerating until it reached flying speed .
" It was a case of what shall I do now , it was quickly instinctive and although I was rather petrified at the time , underneath it all there was really too much to do in the nine seconds we were airborne to actually think too much what I was doing - it was a case of do it . "
The retired group captain took control of the 75 - tonne aircraft which he managed to bring to a halt .
No one was injured .
Gp Capt Prothero had last flown the plane 29 years ago An investigation was launched by the Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) as neither the pilot or co-pilot were licensed to fly but no legal action was taken .
Investigators found no intention to breach the rules and that the incident occurred because the co-pilot had frozen .
A spokesman added that a new " risk assessment " of the operation of the craft has been launched .
" As as a result , a number of changes have been made to their operating procedures to further enhance the safety of similar events . "

While debugging an issue with an application that relies heavily on MySQL , an issue was brought up regarding the cardinality of the keys selected , and , the order in which the keys were indexed .
With any relational database , in order to get the fastest performance , your query should reduce the result set as quickly as possible .
Your data should have a high cardinality or variation in the data so that the B - Tree ( or R - Tree ) is more balanced .
If your data consists of :
One thousand records with the date 2009 - 01-01
One thousand records with the date 2009- 01-02
…
One thousand records with the date 2009 - 12- 31
The cardinality or uniqueness of that column is low given the fact that you ’ll have 365000 rows with blocks of one thousand having the same key .
If you consider 125 different IP addresses per day generating those same thousand records , the cardinality or uniqueness of the IP addresses will be very high .
In order to show the performance differences in multiple indexing schemes and representations , a table has been created with an Unsigned Int column for the IP address , a varchar ( 15 ) for the IP address , a date column , and a varchar ( 80 ) for some text data .
Because of the way the MySQL query processor works , it is possible to construct your query so that the results are answered from the index and the data file is never hit .
A test sample was created that will be used for all of the tests .
The file will be indexed , optimized , and the test run five times with the cumulative time used .
The sample data that generates the queries against the database include 48000 of the ten million rows , plus 2000 randomly generated queries .
Those results are then shuffled and written to a file for the tests .
Testing hits versus misses emulates real world situations a little more accurately .
All of the code used to run these tests is included in this post .
Test Setup
Creation of the table :
CREATE TABLE `querytest` ( `iip` int ( 10 ) unsigned DEFAULT NULL , `ipv` varchar ( 15 ) DEFAULT NULL , `date` date DEFAULT NULL , `randomtext` text ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 ;
Filling the table with data :

Generate test set :
#!/usr /bin/python import MySQLdb import random import datetime import time import socket import struct db = MySQLdb.connect ( host=" localhost " , user=" querytest " , passwd = " qt1qt1 " , db=" querytest " ) cursor = db.cursor ( ) jan_1_2009 = time.mktime (( 2009 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) ) cursor.execute ( " select iip , ipv, date from querytest order by rand ( ) limit 48000 " ) data = list ( cursor.fetchall( ) ) for i in range ( 1 , 2001 ) : # generate a random IP address rand_ip = random.randint(1,4294967295 ) # pick a random date in 2009 rand_date = time.strftime ( " %Y - %m-%d " , time.gmtime(jan_1_2009 + random.randint( 1,365*60*60*24 ) ) ) data.append (( rand_ip , socket.inet_ntoa(struct.pack ( ' L' , rand_ip ) ) , rand_date ) ) random.shuffle( data ) for datum in data : print " %s , %s , %s " % ( datum [ 0 ] , datum [ 1 ] , datum [ 2 ] ) cursor.close ( ) db.close ()
At this point we have created the table , filled it with ten million rows , and generated a fifty thousand row query set to run against the table .
Now , we need to categorize the theories to see whether cardinality plays as large a role as it used to .
The following tests will be performed
Index of iip, date
* Use the unsigned int representation of the IP address and the date
* Use the text representation of the IP address passed through inet_aton ( ) and the date
Index of ipv , date
* Use the text representation of the IP address and the date
* Use the unsigned int representation of the IP address passed through inet_ntoa ( ) and the date
Index of date , iip
* Use date and the unsigned int representation of the IP address
* Use date and the text representation of the IP address passed through inet_aton ( )
Index of date , ipv
* Use date and the unsigned int representation of the IP address
* Use date and the text representation of the IP address passed through inet_aton ( )
Each of the above tests will be run twice , once with select * and once with select ipv,date .

There are multiple tests that could have been run without dropping the index , recreating the index and optimizing the table .
When testing a more limited set , results were a little sporadic due to a smaller initial test set and portions of the table and index being cached in the kernel cache .
To ensure more consistent test results , every test was run in a consistent manner .

Conclusions
Based on the data , I think we can say that the argument of B - Tree versus Hash does n’t seem to make much difference .
Neither is consistently better , and since the data and query test is identical , the results do n’t really point to a clear winner .
Avoiding Select * and pulling only the required fields makes a difference and if your result can be answered from the index rather than the data file , there is a substantial boost .
Analysis of the results suggests that cardinality is n’t as important as it used to be .
I am devising a method to further test cardinality as I do believe that live data will have somewhat different results from data after an optimize table has been run .
The winner in this case is :
Test : select ipv,date from querytest where ipv=%s and date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( ipv, date ) Duration : 167.049333 seconds
Test : select ipv,date from querytest where ipv=%s and date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( ipv, date ) using HASH Duration : 167.016152 seconds
I had actually expected int represented as unsigned int would be the fastest .
However , there is probably a reasonable explanation why these two queries are slower :
Test : select iip , date from querytest where iip=%s and date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( iip , date ) Duration : 179.039791 seconds
Test : select iip , date from querytest where iip=%s and date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( iip , date ) using HASH Duration : 178.993962 seconds
Data in MySQL is represented as binary .
The IP stored as an unsigned int takes 4 bytes , and the date takes 3 .
The key length in this case would be 7 bytes versus the index on IP stored as varchar ( 15 ) and the date taking 18 bytes .
Even though the index in the second case is almost three times the size of the unsigned int IP , the MySQL client library converts all binary data to ASCII when communicating to avoid endian issues .
That extra conversion results in a slightly slower result — measurable when you do 250000 queries against a 10 million record database .
A quick modification of the test shows the results of select * , versus select keyvaluea , keyvalueb and select data , keyvalueb .
As you can see from the results below , MySQL will answer queries from the index if it does n’t need to hit the data file .
Test : select * from querytest where iip=%s and date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( iip , date ) Duration : 637.420786 seconds
Test : select iip , date from querytest where iip=%s and date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( iip , date ) Duration : 178.434477 seconds
Test : select ipv,date from querytest where iip=%s and date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( iip , date ) Duration : 690.804990 seconds Test : select inet_ntoa( iip ) as iip , date from querytest where iip=%s and date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( iip , date ) Duration : 183.817643 seconds
If you can structure your data well , there are significant performance gains to be had .
What does this mean ?
Do you store IPs as unsigned int in the database ?
If you use varchar ( 15 ) or char ( 15 ) , you ’re talking about an eleven or ten byte savings per record at the expense of some conversion time .
varchar uses 1 character to store the length of the stored data plus the length of the data .
char is a fixed length based on the column length you specify .
Make sure you return only the columns that you need in your calculations — especially if you are running MySQL over a network .
Try to create your index to match the conditions that you are looking for , and , when possible , if you are searching for the result from a particular column , consider adding it to the index as well .
Always use count (*) rather than count ( column ) unless there is a valid reason for that column to contain NULL .
The Effect of count (*) versus count ( date )
count (*) gives you the number of rows in the set that match the criteria you have set. count ( date ) counts the number of rows in the set that match the criteria where the date is not null .
Many times , you ’ll see someone do a count ( id ) , and id by definition is a primary key , auto_increment and cannot be null .
Because count ( column ) must read the table to ensure that the column specified is not null , it is forced to check every key , or , read the table for all of the matching rows to make sure the column retrieved does n’t contain a null value .
If the column being counted is one of the keys in the index , the performance change wo n’t be as dramatic .
By counting a column that is n’t in the key and having to read the data , count ( column ) is considerably slower .
Results when the counted column is within the key and only 1 or 0 rows are expected :
Test : select count (* ) as ct from querytest where iip=%s and date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( iip , date ) Duration : 175.727338 seconds Test : select count ( iip ) as ct from querytest where iip=%s and date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( iip , date ) Duration : 176.495198 seconds
When count returns more than one row , you can see the effect is much more detrimental .
The first iteration of this test took so long that I shortened it to do five iterations of 100 queries .
After 4 hours , and 18 % complete , I shortened the test to do one iteration of ten queries .
The results clearly demonstrate the issue without taking 20 + hours to run a single simple benchmark .
Simply stated , unless you really have a valid reason to check your results to see if the column is null , DON’T !
Test : select count (* ) as ct from querytest where date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( date , iip ) Duration : 0.408268 seconds Test : select count ( ipv ) as ct from querytest where date= %s with Index : create index querytest on querytest ( date , iip ) Duration : 3085.770998 seconds
The Fine Print
* Index columns used in your where conditions
* B- Tree versus
Hash does n’t appear to materially affect results
* storing IP as char ( 15 ) if the data is being returned to the client can be faster than storing an IP as an unsigned int .
If the IP is not fetched but only used in comparisons , unsigned int is probably the better choice .
* Consider adding that extra column to your index to prevent MySQL from having to read the data file .
Answering your query from the index is significantly faster .
* count (*) rather than count ( column )
Live data will not act precisely as the benchmark — what live scenario ever does ?
But , I believe the tests above should show some of the performance gains available by structuring your tables and queries .
While MySQL 4 , 5.0 and 5.1 will reorder conditions to match the index key , there are some significant performance gains from 4.x to 5.0 .
MySQL 5.1 did n’t show considerable gains from MySQL 5.0 , but , there are some minor speed increases .

Workmates of a Queensland man whose six - year - old daughter was scalped in a horrific dog attack last week have set up a fund to meet the girl 's mounting medical bills .
Isabella King lost the top of her head when a dog grasped hold of her hair and tore it from the roots as she played in a neighbour 's yard in Cape York last Thursday .
The mixed - breed dog , used for pig hunting in the far north township of Weipa , also bit her shoulder to the bone , local media reported .
She was rushed to the Weipa Hospital but has since been transferred to the Royal Brisbane Women 's and Children 's Hospital for surgery to reattach 70 per cent of her scalp , which was torn off in two pieces .
Hospital officials have refused to discuss her condition with the media , but in an interview with , Isabella 's father , Asa , said 50 per cent of the reattached tissue had died , forcing surgeons to use skin grafts .
Handy approximation for square roots
( para espanol : Aqui por favor . )
As part of my ongoing quest to emulate Richard Feynman , I ’ve taken an interest in mental math .
Particularly , trying to get a “ sense ” of different calculations .
I thought it would be cool if I had a decent method of calculating square roots in my head .
They come up often enough , any time you ’re trying to find the length of the Hypotenuse of a right triangle , for instance , or figuring out what the dimensions of a square - ish room might be , if you know the square footage .
I came up with a decent method , which can be expressed as follows :
( The φ n part is a magic function I made up for the sake of notation .
It equals the closest perfect square less than n .
So φ 32 = 25 , and φ 80 = 64 .
The part to the right of the “ + ” gives the whole number part of the answer .
The fraction to the left gives the decimal part of the answer . )
That ’s mostly for show , and is probably the most complicated possible way to express the method .
I have it there because fancy symbols make me feel important .
But it does explain exactly what my method is .
The idea of it is , that if you memorize the perfect squares , then you can make a pretty good guess as to the square root of a number that falls between them .
X 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 X2 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100
If you ’re given the number 47 , you can tell right away that the square root is between 6 and 7 .
To find the next decimal place , the key is that the closer the original number is to the next perfect square , the closer the square root is to the next value .
There are 13 numbers between 36 and 49 ( 72 – 62 ) , and 47 is 11 parts of the way there .
So , we estimate that √ 47 is 6 and 11/13th ’s , which works out to 6.846 … which is actually 99.86 % of the true answer ( 6.8556 … ) .
–
Try again with 27 : 52 is 25 , 62 is 36 .
So the answer is between 5 and 6 .
There are 11 numbers between 25 and 36 , and 27 is 2/11ths of the way there , so 5 + 2/11 = 5.1818 … = 99.72 % of the true answer : 5.19615 …
So how accurate is this method ?
For numbers greater than 10 , you ’ll always be within 2 % ( and < 1 % in nearly all cases ) .
The higher the number , the more accurate the method gets .
Here ’s a cool chart .
For each number “ n ” , it tells how far off your approximation of √n will be :
Doing this mentally is a bit cumbersome at first , but gets quicker and quicker with moderate amounts of practice .
I ’ve started finding little shortcuts for Weird fractions like 7/13ths - approximations upon approximations , but that ’s what I was after I suppose .
One further note : I tried doing a string of 10 random square root problems using the calculator on my cell - phone .
The buttons were awkward enough , that it took me about the same amount of time as it did to do it in my head .
Of course , the cell phone was much more accurate .
Still though , it could make a good bar wager , to race someone in square roots , mentally vs. calculator , to one decimal point .
Iranian artist Emil Baddal has unveiled several new renderings of his Porsche Supercar Concept .
Looking like the offspring of a Bugatti Veyron and a Ferrari F430 , the PSC features an aggressive front bumper , huge side scoops , and a panoramic glass roof .
Other design details include Panamera - style headlights , LED taillights , and a bold rear diffuser .
While Baddal declined to speculate about the model , it 's safe to assume the concept is a spiritual successor to the critically acclaimed Carrera GT .
Unfortunately , this is the closest we 're going to get to a Porsche supercar for some time .

If you ’ve been paying attention lately , you may be under the impression that the United States was spiraling into mass incivility .
The evidence keeps mounting : Congressman Joe Wilson yelling .
Serena Williams yelling .
Kanye West . . . whatever .
All of these uncouth characters have been strung together by critics to establish , indisputably , that there is a societal explosion of boorish and coarse behavior .
On the political front , columnist Kathleen Parker calls this “ a political era of uninhibited belligerence . ”
House speaker Nancy Pelosi , lamenting an imaginary climate of violence , wishes “ we would all , again , curb our enthusiasm in some of the statements that are made . ”
Such a preposterous statement should be actionable .
Pelosi , who only recently compared her political opponents to Nazis , is n’t exactly a paragon of civil discourse .
American politics has always been unsightly .
Most of the time , in fact , far worse than today .
Have we transformed into so brittle a citizenry that we are unable to handle a raucous debate over the future of the country ?
If things were quiet , subdued and “ civil ” in America today , as Pelosi surely wishes , it would only be proof that democracy was n’t working .
It ’s no accident , either , that those in power are generally the ones choking up about the lack of decorum .
The truth is , we could use far less bogus civility in Washington .
Some of us , for instance , would prefer the superb system of debating used by the British Parliament .
Watching those foppish MPs holler “ poppycock , sir ! ” at each other during speeches is a pure pleasure .
The British trade courteousness for a more productive , more honest and , most important , more entertaining debate .
( The occasional Taiwanese - style free - for - all parliamentary slap - riot would n’t hurt C - Span ’s ratings either . )
Instead , here at home , stilted House rules dictate that a congressperson may not refer to the government as “ something hated , something oppressive . ”
Its members shall not call any unnamed officials “ our half - baked nitwits handling foreign affairs ” no matter how true the statement may be .
And they never , ever can describe the president as a “ liar , ” a “ hypocrite ” or claim he is “ intellectually dishonest . ”
It ’s a miracle anything is discussed , actually .
Obviously , congressman Wilson broke the rules when he rudely blurted out , “ You lie ! ”
The vulnerable souls inhabiting Congress — people who spend half their lives and millions of dollars smearing political opponents as child - hating , warmongering , brown - shirted socialists — were profoundly offended by this act of rudeness .
For many , it was another sign of the intensifying coarseness in American society .
Now , tennis ( unlike politics ) is , without question , one of the most civilized sports in the world .
If there was any chance that Williams was going to shove a EXPLETIVE ball down the EXPLETIVE throat of a line judge , it might even be a sport worth watching .
After that , despite the overwrought finger - wagging of critics , the incident tells us nothing about society at large — other than that athletes can be competitive and lose their tempers .
Neither does a hammered celebrity rapper making an idiot out of himself on the MTV ( the exemplar of proper etiquette , no ? ) Video Awards .
Yes , I too yearn for the bygone era of hip - hop chivalry , but those days , sadly , have passed .
Where does that leave us ?
Exactly where we were 10 years ago — or 20 .
I ’ve been around this country a bit and most of the people I ’ve encountered have been extraordinarily civil — even if they occasionally drink too much or embarrass themselves or curse at each other while playing pick - up basketball .
This new focus on civility is meant to cloud another issue .
Let ’s not confuse personal civility with political civility .
A “ civil ” citizenry can mean a pliable citizenry , waiting — sometimes forever — to speak their minds .
We have no duty to say “ please ” and “ thank you ” to elected officials .
Not yet .

Role of Disabilities Ignored for Tens of Millions Experiencing Income Poverty
Stephen Crowley / The New York Times
There ’s more than one option when it comes to the public option .
The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday debated and voted down two amendments that were meant to add a government - run health insurance plan to the major health care legislation .
The first , offered by Senator John D. Rockefeller IV , Democrat of West Virginia , was defeated around 3 p.m .
The second , by Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , was voted down about an hour later .
The defeats had been expected , and both Senators were really looking beyond the committee for a chance to have the full Senate consider a public option .
Senators Rockefeller and Schumer are allies in the effort to create a public plan to compete with private insurers .
But the differences between their proposals highlight a point that is often overlooked in the health care debate : there are lots of different ways to structure a government - run health plan .
Stephen Crowley / The New York Times
While Republicans denounce all proposals for a public plan , Democrats who support the idea disagree sharply over the best ways to design it — and in some cases individual lawmakers have put forward multiple proposals in hopes of winning over colleagues .
Mr. Rockefeller , for instance , proposed a public option called the Consumer Choice Health Plan , which for the first two years would pay doctors , hospitals and other health care providers according to rates tied to Medicare , the government insurance program for Americans over 65 and for the disabled .
In debate , Senator Kent Conrad , Democrat of North Dakota , said that such a public plan , tied to Medicare rates , would devastate hospitals in his home state .
Under Mr. Rockefeller ’s plan , the payment rates would be renegotiated after two years .
Mr. Schumer , by contrast , put forward an amendment calling for a public option with a “ level playing field , ” seeking to reassure Republicans that a public plan would not have unfair advantage over private insurers .
Mr. Schumer ’s public plan would not predetermine the payment rates for providers , but would leave the payment rates to be negotiated later .
Aides said the rates would be higher than what Medicare pays , but lower than current market rates .
Stephen Crowley / The New York Times
Mr. Rockefeller has also proposed another amendment , designed to look like the version of a public option included in legislation under consideration in the House .
That proposal would base payment rates on Medicare for three years , but would pay a premium of 5 percent above Medicare rates for providers that also accept Medicare .
( Not all health care providers accept the government insurance . )
There are other differences as well .
Mr. Rockefeller ’s first proposal would create a public plan to be run by a director appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate .
Other proposals would have the public plan run by the secretary of health and human services .
Mr. Schumer ’s proposal , for instance , calls for the public plan to be offered in several tiers : basic , enhanced and premium , and also allows for a premium - plus plan .
Most of the public plan proposals bar the federal government from providing any additional financing for the insurance program beyond initial start - up costs , as a way of being sure that the government plan competes fairly with private insurers .
But Mr. Rockefeller ’s proposal would allow additional government support , provided that a super - majority of Congress ( three - fifths in both the House and Senate ) votes to approve the funding .
It ’s not clear that any of these differences mattered much in the Finance Committee .
There simply were not enough votes .
But again , proponents of a public option are still hoping to have their ideas receive a fuller airing by the full Senate .

The state of Illinois has barred known sex offenders from Facebook , MySpace , Twitter , and just about any other website that gives you a digital account for communicating with others .
As reported by The Chicago Tribune , Illinois governor Pat Quinn has signed a new law that makes it a felony for registered sex offenders to " access or use a social networking website . "
The statute defines a social networking site as " an Internet website containing profile web pages of the members of the website that include the names or nicknames of such members , photographs placed on the profile web pages by such members , or any other personal or personally identifying information about such members and links to other profile web pages on social networking websites of friends or associates of such members that can be accessed by other members or visitors to the website . "
So , if you 're an Illinois sex offender , it seems you can't even use a professional job - hunting site like LinkedIn - or a restaurant - review site like Yelp .
Some have even argued that this bans the use of Google , which recently added public profiles , and Yahoo ! and Amazon .
But the statute seems to pinpoint sites whose profiles include a built - in comment engine .
" A social networking website provides members of or visitors to such website the ability to leave messages or comments on the profile web page that are visible to all or some visitors to the profile web page and may also include a form of electronic mail for members of the social networking website , " it continues .
The new law takes effect on January 1 .
Obviously , the legislation is intended to prevent known sex offenders from approaching new victims online .
" The Internet has been more and more a mechanism for predators to reach out , " said Illinois State Senator Bill Brady , one of the bill 's sponsors .
" The idea was , if the predator is supposed to be a registered sex offender , they should keep their Internet distance as well as their physical distance .
" The object is to protect innocent individuals on the Internet from sex offenders . "
Yes , sites like MySpace and Facebook have been known to house countless registered sex offenders .
And under pressure from states ' attorneys general , the two sites have worked to cull such names from their rosters .
But surely , in his effort to land the Illinois governorship , Bill Brady has gone too far .
Barring sex offenders from Facebook and MySpace is one thing .
Barring them from vast swathes of the internet is quite another .
Even a nonce has his rights . ®
Venezuela and the Caribbean .
By Faiz Ahmed
The military coup carried out by masked soldiers in the early hours of June 28 against the democratically elected President of Honduras , José Manuel Zelaya Rosales , was a bandit act with differing messages intended for different audiences .
One such audience is the oligarchical groupings throughout the hemisphere , who will be emboldened by Washington 's tacit tolerance of the coup makers .
Another audience is the Latin American leftist and popular governments , who are being told that their agendas can be trumped by non-democratic means .
And there is yet another audience : the predominantly English - speaking Caribbean governments who , like Zelaya , are far from ideologically opposed to capitalism , but are aware of their inability to improve the overall quality of life of their societies within capitalism 's current configuration .
As a result , many of these island governments are edging towards regional agreements based on principles antithetical to the capitalist system .
This is perhaps why English - speaking Caribbean nations account for ten of the eighteen countries participating in the Venezuelan - led regional agreement PetroCaribe .
Launched in 2005 , PetroCaribe enables Caribbean governments to purchase oil and natural gas on terms that allow for the financing of upwards of 60 per cent of the costs over a twenty - five year period at interest rates close to 1 per cent .
Also included in the agreement are mechanisms to finance costs associated with building energy infrastructure projects such as refineries and fuel storage facilities , as well as costs of fertilizer purchases to increase food production .
These Caribbean countries typically have been grappling with debt - to - GDP ratios ranging between 50 per cent and 150 per cent for the better part of the past two decades .
They are economically dependent on tourism and the export of a very narrow range of agricultural commodities and natural resources .
They remain highly vulnerable to the effects of hurricanes , tropical storms , sea level rises and climate change .
As a result , this new ability to finance a large portion of their energy requirements creates much needed economic space to pursue domestic agendas which , among other objectives , include : creating national food security ; repairing and maintaining physical infrastructure such as roadways and airports ; and strengthening social services such as healthcare and education .
Or more simply , building some degree of self - sufficiency , albeit within a program that does not deviate from a capitalist approach to development .
The ability to more freely pursue their domestic agendas is the main reason why , over the past eighteen months , three English - speaking Caribbean states have developed a rather perspicacious outlook and become members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America ( ALBA -- an acronym that also means " dawn " ) .
In their view , the regional bloc is not oriented towards a competitive model that exploits weaknesses but is instead an example of a cooperative model that creates space for states to cultivate some degree of self - sufficiency .
The coup against Zelaya , the utterly illegal removal of Haitian President Jean - Bertrand Aristide five and a half years before that and the short - lived coup against Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez two years before that all show that international capitalism cannot tolerate any domestic agenda which includes an objective of self - sufficiency .
Added to this intolerance is capitalism 's long - standing fear of the threat of a good example .
Located in the eastern Caribbean , the three English - speaking states of Antigua and Barbuda , Dominica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines form one - third of the nine - member ALBA .
In fact , these islands are also members of three other important regional blocs , namely : the fifteen - member Caribbean Community ( CARICOM ) , the twelve - member Caribbean Single Market and Economy ( CSME ) and the nine - member Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States ( OECS ) .
All of these groupings , composed mainly of English - speaking Caribbean islands , have done much to create a unified relationship among its members .
As such , the experiences of Antigua and Barbuda , Dominica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines within ALBA will undoubtedly be watched by other islands in the region .
Each of these islands has been trying to mitigate the myriad challenges facing them over the past two decades , yet are experiencing very little success , as demonstrated by their weakening economies , degrading environments and alarmingly , declining social indicators such as mortality .
By one measure , life expectancy in the English - speaking Caribbean has fallen by four years over the past decade . [ 1 ]
ALBA and the road to self - sufficiency
Alongside the commitment to facilitate cooperative development , ALBA 's strength lies in its ability to identify member - states ' weaknesses within capitalism and devise projects to mitigate and overcome their challenges .
This analytical quality has allowed for the emergence of a large number of projects organised under ALBA 's four main institutions : the ALBA Oil Agreement , the Bank of ALBA , the ALBA Peoples ' Trade Agreement and the ALBA Cultural and Sport Initiative .
The sometimes overlapping projects are in various stages of development and implementation and are free to be used or ignored , at will , by any member state .
ALBA Oil Agreement
Modeled on the principles governing PetroCaribe , the ALBA Oil Agreement is a mechanism for member states to finance their oil purchases on a long - term , low - interest basis , of which a portion can be repaid in goods and services .
For countries in the Caribbean , whose annual energy costs represent expenditures between 15 per cent and 30 per cent of their GDPs , the agreement is quite attractive .
Furthermore and similar to what exists under PetroCaribe , infrastructure projects designed to facilitate or increase oil delivery , oil storage capacity and oil refining capabilities have been undertaken , all of which have the explicit goal of reducing the overall cost of each barrel of oil these countries import .
Also within the ALBA Oil Agreement is a project that sees 25 per cent of every oil receipt accumulate in what has come to be known as the ALBA fund , which is designed to be loaned to member states to pursue social development projects .
Bank of ALBA
In line with the objectives of the ALBA fund and probably because of the example set by the fund , the Bank of ALBA was established in 2008 to offer member states access to capital to pursue social development projects .
Although the Bank has a total capitalisation of only a small fraction of the value of other regional multilateral lending institutions , it offers a far more egalitarian governance structure , exampled by a rotating directorship among member states and a decision - making structure where each member has an equally weighted vote .
Established in the shadow of the ongoing global food crisis , the bank 's first projects have been the establishment of a food - distribution company tasked with creating an efficient distribution network between member states and a regional food - production fund meant to be allocated to member states to assist them with domestic agricultural initiatives .
Both projects have an explicit goal of creating some degree of regional food security .
ALBA Peoples ' Trade Agreement ( ALBA - TCP )
Devised to coordinate the trading of goods and services within the bloc , ALBA - TCP outlines the specific obligations in the form of actions to be taken by each participating member state .
The actions stipulated in the agreement attempt to locate areas of need within each participating state and then to match these areas with goods and services available in partnering member states .
The result is a series of bilateral agreements between participating member state .
To date , only Bolivia , Cuba and Venezuela are active in ALBA - TCP .
ALBA Cultural and Sport Initiative
The ALBA Cultural and Sport Initiative takes the form of developing localised independent media outlets and cultivating cultural exchange through sport .
The most developed of these initiatives is the ALBA Games project , which has been held on a biannual basis since 2005 and is meant to facilitate competition and training among the hundreds of athletes from around the world who participate .
There are very good reasons to project that , left unmolested , ALBA has the potential to offer Caribbean states a space where self - sufficiency can be striven for .
An appealing quality of ALBA and its sister initiatives such as PetroCaribe is that they do not have political strings attached to them .
Countries are signing on because the regional arrangements primarily offer economic flexibility .
Countries are able to follow development paths of their choosing , which in the Caribbean still seem to be a Keynesian - inspired form of state capitalism .
For most countries in the region , this means establishing a much greater degree of self - sufficiency , in the form of food security , social development and economic growth .
In keeping with imperialism 's sordid history , the reactionary forces in Honduras have demonstrated the lengths to which they are prepared to go to obstruct any goal of self - sufficiency that excludes oligarchical domination .
The government of Zelaya was not revolutionary .
However , it was looking to better the lives of the people who elected it and saw that ALBA was one mechanism by which it could fulfill this objective .
This is precisely why the coup against the democratically elected government of Honduras is rightly being seen as a threat against the bloc and it should also be seen as a threat against like - minded governments throughout the region , who are slowly edging towards ALBA .
Note
[ 1 ] Life expectancy estimates for the English - speaking Caribbean were taken from United Nations Human Development Reports .
Taken in the aggregate , life expectancies in the region have fallen by roughly six months over the past decade .
However , when the populations of these islands are assigned values based on their proportion to the entire population of the English - speaking Caribbean , we see that life expectancies have fallen by four years .

Keith Baker , creator of Eberron , took time out of his busy schedule to answer 13 questions for us .
When we ran our early Eberron Campaign Guide review in July , it generated a lot of buzz and a lot of comments .
I was thrilled to see that the book ’s author , Mr. Baker himself , not only took the time to read our review but offered his 2 cents by leaving some comments of his own .
I was fortunate enough to meet Mr. Baker in person a few times during this summer ’s GenCon .
He ’s a very friendly and down - to - earth guy .
I sat in on his free - for - all discussion about Eberron and it was well worth it .
As you ’d probably expect , he speaks of Eberron with remarkable enthusiasm .
His insights into the draconic prophecy , resurrection in Eberron and undersea adventuring was awesome .
When Mr. Baker agreed to answer a few questions for us , the team at Dungeon ’s Master tried to come up with something unique .
We wanted to pose questions that Mr. Baker may not have been asked before or probably is n’t asked that often .
We finally decided to just ask the questions that we , as gamers who play in Eberron every week , would find interesting .
We hope that you find this Q&A as enlightening and enjoyable as we do .
Is there a single element of Eberron that you are most proud of ?
Making people afraid of gnomes .
Are there any aspects or details about Eberron that you feel get overlooked or missed by players and DMs ?
I think many people – including some Eberron writers – have failed to consider the impact of the Last War .
In some early works , it feels like everything is peaceful and happy .
And it ’s not .
The war only ended because people were terrified of the Mourning , and that ’s what holds it at bay .
There are those who want peace , but tensions and grudges remain .
The damage is far from completely repaired , and you have villages isolated by the loss of a lightning rail or burnt out ruins along the former front lines .
You have riots in Thaliost and Stormreach .
You have political tensions in Breland , warlords challenging Kaius in Karrnath , and the growing aspirations of the Dragonmarked Houses .
It ’s a tense and unstable time .
It ’s there in the underlying assumptions of the original book , but not always clearly called out ; it ’s something I think comes across more clearly in chapter one of the 4E Eberron Campaign Guide ( ECG ) .
Were there any changes you wanted to introduce to Eberron in 4e that were left out ?
Not really .
I ’d still like to explore the undersea world of Eberron in more detail , but that ’s not a change to the world , simply a space that we ’ve never explored .
I did n’t particularly want to change anything in Eberron ; my goal was simply to let people see things in more detail .
In 4E we get more detail on the tension in the world , more space for groups like the Lords of Dust , Zilargo , Droaam – I ’d always like to write more , but it ’s a good start .
In your opinion , which monarch has the strongest claim to the throne of Galifar ?
Originally , definitely Mishann of Cyre. However , that does n’t mean that Oargev has the strongest claim today .
Personally , I think Galifar is a lost cause ; the nations have drifted too far apart .
If hostilities were to break out again , which nation do you think would be the aggressor ?
I think hostilities will break out again ; it ’s only a matter of time .
If I had to pick , I ’d say Aundair … though if Kaius was overthrown and Karrnath taken over by more aggressive warlords or the Swords of Karrn , that would be another story .
What is your favourite locale in Khorvaire ?
Be it a country , city , building or natural phenomena .
It ’s hard .
There ’s so many places I love in Eberron , whether from a gaming perspective or purely conceptually .
If I had to choose , it would probably be Droaam .
I love exploring the concept of how creatures traditionally considered to be monsters could use their natural abilities for the benefit of society if they were brought together by a clever leader .
Is there a plan to advance the timeline of the Eberron campaign setting ?
No .
The timeline of the setting is advanced in certain novels , such as Don Bassingthwaite ’s Legacy of Dhakaan series and my own Thorn of Breland books , but Eberron novels are n’t canon and do n’t change the default of the setting ; it ’s up to you to decide if those events occur in your version of the world .
We want them to be inspiration you can use for your own adventures , but you do n’t have to .
How do you think allowing any race to manifest a Dragonmark changes the Eberron campaign setting ?
It ’s something that is misunderstood .
In 4E Eberron , a PC of any race has the potential to manifest a dragonmark .
But this does n’t change the default rules of the world .
Page 21 of the EPG and page 18 of the ECG include the same race - mark table from the original ECS , and the campaign guide says “ Dragonmarks that appear outside these bloodlines are called aberrant marks , whether they ’re recognized marks appearing on people not connected to the mark ’s normal bloodline , or unusual marks beyond the recognized twelve ” … adding
“ The character might be a member of a race unconnected to the dragonmarked houses , even a race that does n’t normally manifest dragonmarks .
Such a mark has nothing to do with bloodline and everything to do with the touch of the Prophecy .
These characters are extremely rare — it ’s not recommended that you create NPCs who fall into this category unless the story of your campaign demands it . ”
It ’s something you CAN do .
It ’s not something that it ’s recommended that you do casually , and it ’s not the default for the setting ; it ’s an option you possess that lets you tell a story you could n’t otherwise tell .
Beyond this , bear in mind that the Eberron books are designed so that you could take the mechanical elements and use them in another setting or homebrew campaign .
The idea that the Mark of Scribing is tied to gnomes is a specific flavor aspect of the Eberron campaign setting .
But if you want to use dragonmarks in Forgotten Realms , that setting is n’t designed with scribing gnomes in mind , and you may decide that you want to attach it to another race , or no race at all .
The racial restrictions are part of the flavor of the setting , and do n’t need to be tied to the raw mechanic – and they still are part of the flavor of the setting , as addressed by the tables and sidebars in the ECG and EPG .
How do you see House Tarkanan affecting the other Dragonmarked houses and the Draconic Prophecy ?
The quick answer to that is easy – read The Son of Khyber in November and see for yourself !
Are there any plans to bring the Mark of Death back to Eberron ?
No .
It ’s supposed to be something you can explore , or not .
Personally , I like it as it is , as a mystery on Erandis Vol ’s dead skin .
But I ’m fine with people doing their own thing with it .
What new Eberron supplements can we expect over the next year ?
None .
Under the current plan , WotC will not be producing any print Eberron supplements .
However , you will see additional Eberron novels , and continued support for Eberron in D&D Insider ; I ’m currently talking to Wizards about a variety of articles for Dungeon and Dragon .
What can you tell us about your upcoming second novel in the Thorn of Breland series , The Son of Khyber ?
Thorn has to infiltrate House Tarkanan in Sharn , on request of House Cannith .
It explores the balance of power between the nations and the houses , and what it means to have an aberrant dragonmark .
And it may address some unresolved issues from The Dreaming Dark series …
What advice would you give to DMs discovering Eberron for the first time with the release of the 4e Eberron Player ’s Guide and Eberron Campaign Guide ?
Would you have different advice for DMs who discovered Eberron when it was still 3e D&D ?
Honestly , nothing comes to mind .
I ’m very pleased with the Eberron Campaign Guide .
Chapter one is an excellent summary of the dominant themes of the setting .
With that said , I would advise a new DM to check out the Dragonshard articles archived on the Wizards of the Coast website .
They ’re free , and they provide a great deal of detailed information on subjects only covered briefly in print .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The tally of bank failures easily broke past the No. 100 milestone on Friday night , with regulators announcing the year 's 106th closure .
That 's more than four times the number that were closed in 2008 , and the highest total since 1992 , when 181 banks failed .
Earlier on Friday evening the dubious honor of the 100th failure went to Partners Bank , of Naples , Fla. , which had $ 65.5 million in assets , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
The 101st failure was American United Bank , of Lawrenceville , Ga. , which had $ 111 million in assets .
The 102nd failure was another Naples , Fla. , institution : Hillcrest Bank Florida , which had $ 83 million in assets .
The 103rd closure was Bradenton , Fla. - based Flagship National Bank , with $ 190 million in assets .
The 104th was Bank of Elmwood , based in Racine , Wis. , which had $ 327.4 million in assets .
The 105th failure was Riverview Community Bank of Otsego , Minn. , with $ 108 million in assets .
The 106th failure was First Dupage Bank in Westmont , Ill. , which had $ 279 million in assets .
Customers of all seven banks are protected , however .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , which has insured bank deposits since the Great Depression , covers customer accounts up to $ 250,000 .
This is funded through premiums paid by member banks .
In fact , to reassure borrowers , FDIC chair Sheila Bair posted a video message to the agency 's Web site , saying " for the insured depositor , a bank failure is a non-event . "
Still , Bair cautioned that " until the healing process is complete , there will be more bank failures . "
What happens to the banks .
Fort Lauderdale , Fla. - based Stonegate Bank will assume control of all Partners Bank's $ 64.9 million in deposits .
It will also take over Hillcrest Bank's $ 84 million in deposits .
The two branches of Partners Bank and six branches of Hillcrest will reopen on Monday as branches of Stonegate .
Moultrie , Ga. - based Ameris Bank will pay the FDIC a premium of 1.02 % to take control of American United 's $ 101 million in deposits .
The FDIC and Ameris Bank entered into a loss - share transaction on $ 92 million of American United 's assets , an agreement in which Ameris will share in the losses on the assets covered .
The single branch of American United Bank will reopen on Monday as a branch of Ameris .
Lake City , Fla. - based First Federal Bank will take over all of Flagship National Bank's $ 175 million in deposits .
The four branches of Flagship will reopen Monday as branches of First Federal .
Bank of Elmwood 's $ 273.2 million in deposits are now controlled by Tri City National Bank , based in Oak Creek , Wis .
The five branches of Bank of Elmwood will reopen on Saturday as branches of Tri City .
Stillwater , Minn. - based Central Bank will take control of Riverview Community Bank's $ 80 million in deposits .
The FDIC and Central Bank entered into a loss - share transaction on $ 75 million of Riverview 's assets .
First Dupage Bank's $ 254 million in deposits are now being handled by First Midwest Bank of Itasca , Ill .
The FDIC and First Midwest Bank entered into a loss - share transaction on approximately $ 247 million of First Dupage Bank 's assets .
The sole First Dupage branch will reopn Saturday as an outpost of First Midwest .
The failure of the six banks will cost the Deposit Insurance Fund an estimated $ 356.6 million , according to the FDIC .
Why regional banks are failing .
While larger financial institutions have received aid from the federal government , smaller banks have found themselves left adrift .
Like their larger counterparts , many of these banks made risky loans to individuals and real estate developers during the boom years and are now facing large numbers of defaults as the recession drags on .
Rising unemployment has made it difficult for many individuals to keep up with expenses , and businesses are feeling the crunch of consumers ' reduced spending power .
As a result , regional banks are left holding loans their customers can't repay .
Problem banks list looms .
The FDIC keeps a list of " problem banks , " though it does not disclose the names to the general public out of fear that depositors at those institutions may prompt a " run on the bank . "
In June , the agency said 416 banks were at risk of failure -- the highest level in 15 years .
It 's a whopping figure , to be sure .
But even as the pace of failures accelerates , 2009 's numbers remain far from what happened during the savings and loan crisis two decades ago .
More than 1,900 financial institutions failed from 1987 - 1991 , peaking at 534 closures in 1989 .
Federal coffers running dry .
An average of 10 banks have failed per month this year , and the federal coffer is thinning under the massive strain .
The fund now stands at $ 7.5 billion , down significantly from $ 45 billion a year ago .
When the FDIC factors in expected closures , the agency says the fund is in the red and will likely remain there through 2012 .
Bank failure costs are expected to total $ 100 billion over the next four years , leaving regulators strapped for cash .
Last month , the FDIC discussed how to raise quick cash to replenish the fund .
The agency proposed that banks prepay their deposit insurance premiums for the next three years .
Some have voiced concerns the scheme will do little to stop unscrupulous drivers who never bother to insure vehicles , but could instead hit law - abiding motorists who unwittingly allow their insurance to lapse when they are working abroad or taking a holiday .
It will rely on the motor insurance industry database that is currently used by the police .

Advertisement Gordon Brown has denied being snubbed by the US president after diplomatic sources told the BBC his team had been " frantic " to secure bilateral talks .
Mr Brown said he and President Barack Obama " talk all the time " and he insisted the special relationship was " strong and continues to strengthen " .
No 10 said they had a wide - ranging chat after a UN dinner - understood to have taken place in the UN 's kitchens .
And the White House described the claim of Mr Brown being snubbed as " absurd " .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
I do n't mean to suggest the president has any negative feelings towards Britain , I just do n't see why he would see us as all that special
Mark Mardell
BBC North America editor
Read Mark 's thoughts in full US host asks Brown about eyesight Asked about the alleged snub during an interview with NBC news on Wednesday , the prime minister said : " I met President Obama last night and we had a long talk about some of the big issues affecting us and I 'll be meeting him in Pittsburgh one to one .
" But of course we 're meeting all the time .
We 're both involved in all the main meetings and talk all the time .
" I do say that the special relationship between Britain and America is strong , it continues to strengthen and I think the reason it 's strong is that it 's based on common values . "
He later told the BBC 's political editor , Nick Robinson , that he and Mr Obama had " a strong personal friendship " .
The prime minister , who earlier referred to his Labour colleagues as " fighters " , also said he had been " right " about his actions to restructure Britain 's banks and tackle the recession .
' Without foundation ' Northern Ireland secretary Shaun Woodward told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the reported snub was the type of " trivia " which tended to accompany prime ministerial trips abroad .
He also said if he counted the times this week the two men had already talked in New York he " would run out of fingers on one hand " .
It reveals how keen Labour strategists were to play the Obama and Gordon card before their conference

Read Nick 's thoughts in full
He was responding to the news that White House officials rejected repeated requests from Britain for a formal meeting - even though the president has held private meetings with the leaders of Japan , China and Russia .
Downing Street said reports of a snub were " completely without foundation " .
A spokeswoman said " formal bilaterals were not pinned down " , and added : " We have said all along that the meeting situation was fluid , but the prime minister and Barack Obama would be together and have an opportunity to meet which has happened . "
Asked whether there were five requests for a bilateral meeting as has been suggested , she said that in the run-up to the trip there would have been numerous calls , but the number was not the issue .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson dismissed the story of a snub as a " rumour " that ordinary people were not interested in .
" I think it would really just strike them as , frankly , pretty juvenile to have this personality stuff substituted for what really are very serious issues that these leaders are talking about in New York , " he told the BBC .

The White House also rejected any suggestion that Mr Brown had been given a lower priority than other leaders .
A spokesman said : " Any stories that suggest trouble in the bilateral relationship between the United States and UK are totally absurd .
" We would add that President Obama and Prime Minister Brown enjoy a terrific relationship , they speak regularly on a range of the most difficult challenges facing our two nations and meet frequently . "
The spokesman pointed to " the tight and extensive work our countries carry out together to address common challenges across the globe " as evidence of the closeness of the relationship .
The row comes after Mr Obama described the Lockerbie bomber 's release as a " mistake " .
But Dr Robin Niblett , from think tank Chatham House , said the Obama government was " pragmatic " and understood that the decision over Abdelbaset Ali al - Megrahi had been a difficult one .
" I think this administration , including President Obama , was very upset by the release , but I do n't think that they would make the point of trying to do a snub in retort , " Dr Niblett told the BBC .
HAVE YOUR SAY
My respect for Mr Obama grows and grows , whilst Mr Brown is just an embarrassment Darkseid , London
He said Mr Obama simply had other priorities at the summit such as working on relations with Russia and China , adding : " This was the wrong time to be pushing for a special bilateral meeting . "
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the whole episode revealed how keen Labour strategists were to play " the Obama and Gordon card " before their annual party conference , which starts on Sunday .
He said : " If they had n't been so desperate , this would never have been a story at all .
After all , no other EU country 's leader got a meeting with Obama . "
The two leaders will co-host an event for the Friends of Democratic Pakistan in New York on Thursday .

Video : Robot chauffeur in action
Driverless , battery - powered pod-cars will soon zip passengers around part of London ’s Heathrow Airport .
The manufacturers of the Ultra personal rapid transit ( PRT ) system say it is the world ’s first public transport to balance the convenience of a taxi with the efficiency of a bus or light rail – albeit only for business passengers arriving at the world ’s third busiest airport .
Personalised rapid transit has been an elusive dream of engineers and city planners .
Since the mid 1970s , many schemes have been proposed at sites around the world , and a PRT - like system has been built at Morgantown in West Virginia .
But Ultra is the first PRT system to give passengers control over their destination .
Ultra has been in the works since 2005 , when BAA – the company that runs Heathrow – ordered a pilot project from Advanced Transport Systems ( ATS ) of Bristol , UK .
Four years later , Ultra is undergoing final tests before its opening to the general public , planned for later this year .
The Heathrow Ultra system will initially carry passengers between the business car park and terminal 5 .
Each pod-car holds up to four passengers and can travel at speeds of up to 40 kilometres per hour on 4.3 kilometres of dedicated roadway , stopping at any of three stations .
The journey takes around 3 minutes , non-stop , with wait times of no more than a minute for the next available car .
A central computer system monitors demand and controls traffic .

Bus buster
“ It ’s faster and more convenient than [ airport ] buses , and uses half the energy ” to move the same number of passengers in the same amount of time , says Martin Lowson , who first came up with the Ultra concept and is deputy chairman of ATS .
That ’s because it only stops at the station the passengers require , and it ’s so small that there ’s no wasted capacity even if just one or two people need a ride .
Lowson says 70 per cent of passengers have zero waiting time – the buses currently used at Heathrow run every ten minutes .
He also claims that the system averages 0.55 megajoules per passenger kilometre , making it the most energy efficient system of its kind .
Buses average just over 1 megajoule per passenger kilometre .
According to Peter Muller , president of PRT Consulting of Franktown , Colorado , which has helped roadtest several PRT systems including Ultra , the promise of PRT goes beyond airport transit .
“ It has the ability to transform our way of life , ” says Muller .
“ You could have a city where the automobiles are kept on the periphery , with PRT bringing people into the city . ”
As an example he points to a PRT system being installed in Masdar City , a new city under construction in Abu Dhabi that is intended to be carbon neutral .
Built by the Dutch company 2GetThere , based in Utrecht , it could go online later this year .
“ All of a sudden you have a city that is very pedestrian friendly .
You do n’t have to waste space on roads and parking garages inside the city , ” says Muller .
We are the Jetsons
Muller says that other locations are starting to consider PRT systems .
The city of San Jose , California , and the US army ’s Fort Carson base outside Colorado Springs are looking at the feasibility of installing such a system .
ATS recently announced that it has been commissioned to study how Ultra might be used in the city of Bath in the UK .
Despite widening interest in the idea , Muller says that many city planners and architects do not consider PRT a feasible option for urban public transport .
“ People think PRT is The Jetsons and it ’ll never be here , ” says Muller .
“ They do n’t realise it ’s here now . ”
If the Heathrow pilot proves successful , ATS hopes to expand Ultra to cover all the airport – from its current three - station , 21 - car set - up to 50 stations attended by 400 cars .
The clocks go back at the weekend , giving more daylight in the morning A prominent historian has called for the UK to adopt the same time zone as the rest of central Europe , leaving Scotland to its own " tundra time " .
Sir Alistair Horne said it was " absolutely crazy " for the UK to have a different time zone from the rest of central Europe .
The clocks will be put back one hour on Sunday , providing more daylight in the morning but making the evenings darker .
Sir Alistair said it might benefit Scotland but not the rest of the UK .
He told the BBC's Today programme : " The Scots do have a problem because , being that much nearer the North Pole , they do have a very short day .
" But when you look at the map of time zones it is absolutely crazy . "
Sir Alistair said Central European time stretched " from the eastern frontier of Poland to the western frontier of Spain " and Britain and Ireland were on the same western time zone as Portugal .
Own decisions Sir Alistair , who said he was 99 % Scottish , said the rest of the UK should not lose an hour of evening daylight just because Scottish farmers did not want to milk in the dark .
He said the Scottish argument had traditionally been that it made it safer for children going to school in the morning .
However , he claimed more children were run over when they were returning from school tired and in the dark .
The historian said the progress of devolution and the release of Lockerbie bomber Abelbasset al - Megrahi had led him to think that Scotland could take its own decisions and the rest of the UK should no longer be tied to a time zone which does not suit it .
He said Scotland could have its own " tundra time " .
Tundra is a geological term relating to a vast treeless zone with permanently frozen subsoil .
Sir Alistair said the rest of the UK could adopt a more fitting time zone .
He cited the example of the Eurostar link between London and Paris .
" You can be in France in 21 minutes but you have to change your clocks and work out when all your appointments are , " he said .

It ’s a good indicator of how far the sitcom genre has advanced that John ( Jim from The Office ) Krasinski ’s directorial debut — an adaptation of David Foster Wallace ’s Brief Interviews With Hideous Men , currently in theaters — strikes one as a fairly reasonable idea .
The show ’s best moments , after all , do approach the squirmy revelations of Wallace ’s prose .
Vulture spoke with Krasinski on Friday afternoon , and he was just as amiable and puppyish as we ’d hoped — even when talking about directing ( and then discarding ) Hideous Men ’s rape scenes .
You have a significant moment in the film where a professor showing his students Nanook of the North instructs them to “ watch the documenter , not the documented . ”
So …
Oh , my God , you got this one !
Fantastic !
Can you write every review of this movie ?
So who is the documenter here ?
Unlike in the book , you ’ve inserted the character of a female researcher ( Julianne Nicholson ) between the men and the audience .
She is definitely the documenter — she is documenting it through her eyes .
And the whole idea is to question whose perspective we ’re listening to , how tainted that perspective may be .
As you find out in the end , it ’s about the way our own experience colors information .
How did you cast this ?
Did any material / actor pairings jump out at you early on ?
For instance , did you read the “ I love women ” monologue and just go , “ Will Forte ? ”
First of all , directing out of ignorance helps a great deal — you think it ’s no big deal to cast a movie .
Also , I was writing the script before I got the rights — again , super - smart ! — and in writing it , at the time I was still waiting tables , I had a few actors in mind .
And then I kept seeing these amazing performances , like Bobby Cannavale in The Station Agent , and mentally adding them to the cast .
Hey , Ben Gibbard is good !
You might someday be credited with discovering him as an actor .
Yeah , he ’s great , is n’t he ?
As for discovering him , well , I think enough people know who he is already .
And you gave yourself an interesting part [ of a boyfriend whose departure forces the researcher to undertake the interviewing - men project ] .
It ’s not a traditional plum part an actor would give himself in a directorial debut .
But you kind of hover over the whole thing .
And the other thing is , I was n’t even supposed to be in it at all .
Riiight .
No , seriously !
There was a scheduling conflict at the last moment , and the actor — I ca n’t name him — could n’t do it .
We had two weeks left to shoot .
So the producers basically decided that I should do this because I had read the book so many times .
It was the most terrifying performance I ever had to give .
It ’s stressful enough to be a director and to see it on the monitors every day , watching these actors do this awe - inspiring work … and then you jump in and go , “ I ’ll take us home , guys ! ”
I feel like the central line in the film is the one Christopher Meloni delivers : “ Men are mostly shits . ”
Do you subscribe to that ?
I do n’t , actually .
I think the way he delivers it , there ’s a pathetic quality in this character .
We ’re not inherently shits , it ’s just our process of dealing .
It goes back to the 1950s , the whole idea that you can never be vulnerable .
The book is rather explicit , but the film is kind of timid .
There ’s no nudity , for one thing .
Someone like Neil LaBute , in your place , would have put some pretty explicit stuff on the screen .
My mom asked me not to .
Just kidding !
There actually is n’t so much explicit stuff in the book .
And we had shot footage of the rape scene I ’m talking about in the end .
We were thinking about splicing it in , in flashes .
But in the end , it was a letdown .
You ’re asking the audience to go on a cerebral journey , and human imagination is more powerful than anything we could show .
You ’re entering an interesting company here , a subgenre of these small theatrical films where people talk to the camera .
I ’m thinking of Tom Noonan ’s The Wife , David Hare ’s The Designated Mourner .
My biggest mistake in the first draft was to try to make it “ cinematic . ”
Open it up in a million ways .
Open with the breakup scene .
In other words , answering all the questions for the audience .
And you know , it looked like any other movie .
So I made a decision to make it nonlinear , because it reflected the book much better .
It ’s funny — you ’ve gone as far from The Office as you could get , but all this speaking to the camera … well , it ’s the signature Office device .
Oh , my God , you made a parallel I ’m comfortable with !
I did n’t even see the parallel until I was done .
I was scared people would think I was doing this only to get away from The Office , to be super - dark and cerebral .
But you know , this is fine .
After all , Brief Interviews is the book that made me want to act to begin with .
And The Office is a job you do n’t run away from — you beg for that job to come back year after year .
So , hopefully , [ my sensibility ] is somewhere in the middle between the two .
I DON'T know who we have to thank for the conflation of campaigning and governing , but I wish it were a gift that came with a return receipt .
Pat Caddell , a Democratic pollster , is credited with elucidating it and giving it a name in 1976 — the permanent campaign — so it goes back at least as far as Jimmy Carter .
It appeared to have reached its apotheosis — or , perhaps , nadir — during the administration of George Bush , who jetted off to some city in the heartland seemingly every other day to flog his latest legislative initiative before adoring , flag - waving , hand - lettered - placard toting " real Americans " .
But Barack Obama — the undisputed heavyweight champion of soaring rhetoric and effective use of the teleprompter — has embraced it with an abiding passion .
And American policymaking is all the worse off because of it .
Even the appearance before a joint gathering of Congress — after the inaugural address , the pinnacle of presidential public pronouncement — has become merely another campaign speech , directed toward the television - viewing audience , with the House chamber and assembled lawmakers serving as props .
Barack Obama 's exhortations tonight on health - care reform will be nothing loftier .
Indeed , his speech already has been framed in terms befitting an election - season debate , or World Cup qualifying match .
Sane , workable public policy is hammered out in a republic — as opposed to a direct democracy — in the often - Byzantine legislative process .
It 's one of the reasons republics have thrived over the past three centuries .
It is slow and messy and fails to make any single group happy ; but as the Sicilian expedition demonstrated , painfully , to the Athenians during the Peloponnesian War , policies quickly enacted under the influence of the eloquence — the campaign - like oratory — of gifted leaders appealing to the emotions of the masses usually just create a bigger mess .
The smoke - filled room of yore is much - maligned , but nothing makes it clearer than the frenzy that has become the health - care reform debate that the time has come for America to end its love affair with the permanent campaign .

A student holds a hoary bat she found injured in Pincher Creek 's turbine fields .
( ( CBC ) )
Alberta researchers have found a simple way to drastically reduce bat deaths at a wind farm in Pincher Creek .
Slowing the speed of the turbines at night during peak bat migratory periods reduces fatalities by 60 per cent , according to a joint study by the University of Calgary and power company TransAlta published in the Journal of Wildlife Management .
The researchers looked at the Summerview Wind Farm near Pincher Creek , where 500 to 600 bats die every year , compared with the 30 bats usually killed annually at wind farms in the province .
Robert Barclay , a professor of biological sciences at the University of Calgary , said the bats died after hitting turbines that could spin as fast as 200 kms an hour .
The air conditions created by those spinning blades also killed the bats , he said .
" They get caught in the low pressure area around the blade and it causes damage to their lungs and they die as a consequence of that . "
The condition , known as barotrauma , affects bats more than birds because bat lungs are balloon - like and can over - expand , bursting surrounding capillaries .
Experiment during migration season
As an experiment , TransAlta slowed the blades down at night during the bat 's peak migratory season , from August to September , and found it reduced bat deaths by 60 per cent .
Fewer bats hit the blades and the slower speed reduced the intensity of the low pressure pockets , causing fewer lung collapse .
TransAlta is making the change permanent , said spokesman Jason Edworthy .
" We 're now moving to that being the new operational mode , " he said .
The University of Calgary researchers will now continue their work on finding out what is attracting the bats to the turbines in the first place in the hope of reducing the mortality rate even further .
Preserving the bat population is crucial because a single bat can eat thousands of insects a night , said Barclay .
" Pest species of crops and forests for example .
Species of insects that directly influence humans [ such as ] mosquitoes and other biting sorts of flies . "
The fate of eBay - owned Skype has been in question for months now .
Back in April , it looked as if eBay was going to spin - off the VoIP service as a publicly traded company .
Now we 've learned that Skype will be sold to private investors .
According to the New York Times , eBay will announce a deal tomorrow that will send the popular Internet telephone service to an investment group .
It seems as if the group includes the newly formed Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm , co-founded by Netscape 's founder Marc Andreessen .
The deal terms are not yet disclosed .
This deal comes during a very public battle between eBay and the founders of Skype , who are threatening to cut off one of the key peer - to - peer technologies that power Skype and have expressed interest in rebuying their company .
It 's even possible they are also part of the sale - we just do n't know yet .
We 'll bring you more information as it develops .
Update : Others involved in the deal include Index Ventures ( London venture capital firm , early Skype investor ) and Silver Lake Partners ( private equity firm ) .
THE precursor to Gourmet , and the first truly successful American food publication , was founded in the 1890s and titled The Boston Cooking School Magazine of Culinary Science and Domestic Economics .
It eventually changed its name to American Cookery and then died in 1947 , forced under , in part , by the founding of Gourmet in 1941 by Earle MacAusland , who had patterned his new brainchild on the catalog - magazine of a famed Boston food purveyor , S. S. Pierce .
It was the end of domestic science and food economy and the beginning of the era of the gourmet , “ the honest seeker of the summum bonum of living ” as set forth in the charter issue .
MacAusland ’s recipes made few accommodations to reality ; he even suggested that subscribers save the issues and use the recipes once rationing had ended .
Now , 68 years after its founding , Gourmet has followed American Cookery , ending a long and masterful turn at the helm of the food publishing world .
This , hard on the heels of the death of Julia Child in 2004 , makes one tremulous about the future .
Is American magazine publishing on the verge of being devoured by the democratic economics of the Internet ?
Has the media industry fully become an everyman ’s playing field , without the need for credentials or paid membership ?
Or , to ask the questions that every media executive is really whispering , “ Will I have a job next year ? ”
My first experience with Gourmet was a head - on collision .
In 1990 , 10 years after I had founded Cook ’s Magazine , Condé Nast purchased Cook ’s and then immediately shut it down , Gourmet swallowing up our subscribers .
It was the triumph of the American magazine model , one driven by lifestyle rather than nuts and bolts , and floated by the billions of advertising dollars that poured through a narrow spigot into the magazine industry , controlled by a select few , the chauffeured , hard - charging publishers of New York ’s powerhouse magazine corporations .
It was a top - down , winner - take - all proposition , an oligarchy of sorts , a business with a huge barrier to entry and no welcome mat for the upstart entrepreneur .
In a serendipitous turnabout 19 years later , Cook ’s is today alive and well ( I restarted the magazine in 1993 ) and Gourmet has foundered .
The difference ?
We abandoned advertising in 1993 for a 100 - percent subscriber - financed model , including a thriving paid Web site .

Yet the media world was not without charm , as I learned in 1985 during my first meeting with S.I. Newhouse , the chairman of Condé Nast .
( Mr. Newhouse had just purchased The New Yorker , a magazine that already owned a controlling share in my Cook ’s Magazine . )
It was 7 a.m. , his favored meeting hour , and I discovered him shoeless , stuffed into a baggy gray sweater , and shuffling about , half - swallowing his words in a manner that spoke of humility and intellect , rather than New York arrogance .
Here was a guy , I thought , who really loves the magazine business .
He poured his fortune into his magazine properties and his editors , even when the prospect of return seemed dim .
His was a world of philanthropic publishing .
Revolutionary discovery means world may not run out of crude By By Stephanie Dearing Sep 13 , 2009 in Science A team of scientists based at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden have made a " revolutionary " discovery about how hydrocarbon is formed , learning that animal and plant fossils are not necessary to form crude oil .
“ Using our research we can even say where oil could be found in Sweden , ” Kutcherov told The article , titled Methane - derived hydrocarbons produced under upper mantle conditions , and published in " Whether hydrocarbons can also be produced from abiogenic precursor molecules under the high - pressure , high - temperature conditions characteristic of the upper mantle remains an open question .
It has been proposed that hydrocarbons generated in the upper mantle could be transported through deep faults to shallower regions in the Earth ’s crust , and contribute to petroleum reserves . "
Kutcherov has said that his next step is to conduct experiments that will help him refine his new method for finding drilling points .
The idea of endless oil might be a bane to environmentalists and high - stakes oil production fields , such as Canada 's oil sands , but most of the world 's population will thrill to the idea that they will not have to give up their beloved automobiles .
Not only will it be a much Kutcherov had recently proven that hydrocarbons can be created out of water , calcium carbonate and iron , and this means that crude oil is a sustainable , renewable resource , according to Last year While Kucherov 's experiments have been proven in the laboratory , they have yet to be translated into reality , and there is no word on how long the world might have to wait to take advantage of the new discoveries .
The discovery , the scientists say , means that the world will never run out of crude oil .
Currently , theory states that crude oil is formed very slowly - over millions of years - from the remains of dead plants and animals .
Buried under rock , over time the pressure and temperature of natural earth processes results in the creation of crude oil .
But that theory is now old news , as the scientists , led by Vladimir Kutcherov , say they have proven that fossilized plants and animals are not needed to create hydrocarbons .
Kutcherov told Science Daily
The article , titled Methane - derived hydrocarbons produced under upper mantle conditions , and published in Nature Geoscience states that Kutcherov has said that his next step is to conduct experiments that will help him refine his new method for finding drilling points .
The idea of endless oil might be a bane to environmentalists and high - stakes oil production fields , such as Canada 's oil sands , but most of the world 's population will thrill to the idea that they will not have to give up their beloved automobiles .
Not only will it be a much simpler matter to find and extract petroleum fuels , but , as Kutcherov 's theories become reality , prices for natural gas and gasoline products should decrease .
Kutcherov said the world is reliant on crude oil and natural gas , which makes up 61 % of fuels currently used .
Kutcherov had recently proven that hydrocarbons can be created out of water , calcium carbonate and iron , and this means that crude oil is a sustainable , renewable resource , according to reports .
However , this discovery does not mean that emissions from the combustion of hydrocarbons do not create climate change .
Kutcherov is a professor at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden .
Last year Science Magazine published an article that said crude oil is created by an abiotic process and not from fossil fuels .
These recent discoveries were found by building on a German process referred to as the Fischer - Tropsch type ( FTT ) genesis .
Germany had plenty of coal but very little petroleum , which prompted a serious push by German scientists to find a way to create a substitute fuel .
The FTT process was developed and patented in the 1920s , and was subsequently used throughout World War II by Germany and Japan .
The process has been the basis for the creation of jet fuel made from water in the United States , as reported by Wired magazine .
While Kucherov 's experiments have been proven in the laboratory , they have yet to be translated into reality , and there is no word on how long the world might have to wait to take advantage of the new discoveries .

Yesterday the mystery deepened as an Italian blog quoted Colonel Rodolfo Mecarelli of the Como provincial finance police as saying the two men had been released .
The colonel and police headquarters in Rome both declined to respond to questions from the Financial Times .

~~Revised : I 've added a couple more possibilities to cover all the bases , and a few more thoughts , after a fun discussion with some associates . ~~
Three days ago we told the story of the detention in Italy of two Japanese nationals crossing the border into Switzerland who were found by border authorities to be carrying $ 134 billion in purported US bearer bonds in the false bottom of a suitcase .
Since then a very strange thing has happened : Nothing .
This story has gotten a lot of play in Europe , but US media coverage has been virtually zilch ( as of when I checked Google News a couple hours ago ) .
Even at Bloomberg , the only US news agency to file original reports in the subject , however brief , the longest piece has been an opinion column wondering how strange it is that nobody has been reporting the story .
And it is indeed strange because either ... A)
The bonds are counterfeit , and this is one of the largest counterfeiting frauds in history ; orB )
The bonds are real , and represent a potential earthquake - blow to the world financial system in the midst of the ongoing financial crisis , as some major government has tried to get out of US bonds and dollars in a big way , on the sly .
Is n't either of these a real story ?
Moreover , on its surface this appears a case worthy of Sherlock himself , because each of the two major obvious possibilities seems , well , incredible to the point of being impossible . [ ]
Scamming someone into buying $ 134 billion of fake bearer bonds would be considerably more difficult than scamming them into buying a fake Mona Lisa .
If Mona was n't missing from the Louvre , any buyer would immediately know any copy being offered is a fake .
If Mona was reported missing from the Louvre , well , it 's possible a fanatic art lover might pay to buy a copy passed off as the real thing to hang in his den and admire until he dies , I guess .
But people buy US bonds for the dividends they pay and to cash them in .
These bonds were issued in denominations of $ 500 million each .
Nobody is paying for those without calling up the Fed to verify that they are real .
Which is easy -- call , give the Fed the serial numbers and other descriptive information , and it replies , " No , fakes " or " Yes , real , and owned by the Chinese government to whom we are paying interest " , and if you are n't buying from the central bank of China you know the bonds are either fake or hot , and you are n't going to get your money back from them .
End of scam .
Moreover , who could buy $ 134 billion of US bonds ? -- $ 134 billion is more than the GDP of New Zealand .
Only the Chinese , Japanese and Russian governments own that much .
Major governments like them are the only buyers , they all have hotlines to the Fed , and they are n't going to be scammed .
A counterfeiter would be better off producing mere millions of dollars of fake currency or of , say , $ 10,000 bonds that could be peddled to many buyers .
How a $ 134 billion scam could even be conceived is ... hard to conceive .
So , Sherlock might say , eliminating that as impossible we have these possibilities ... [ ]
The bonds are real and were being moved by the Japanese ( or Chinese ) government to get out of the bubble in US bonds before it bursts , via an " under the table " trade in Switzerland for something else of value -- instead of by making market sales that would themselves bust the bond bubble in ways that could rebound against the seller ( grievously ! ) .
That 's an idea that in fact may make sense on its face .
But why would the Japanese government move $ 134 billion into Switzerland by taking the crazy risk of having a couple guys try smuggling it in a suitcase on a train reportedly full of itinerant workers , through a border crossing known for smuggling , and so subject to scrutiny by customs authorities ?
Would n't it instead use the near absolutely safe option of sending the bonds by diplomatic pouch ?
Which makes us look at parties who can't use a diplomatic pouch .
Maybe ... [ ]
The bonds are fake and were sent by a " rogue " nation .
It would take a government to work a deal on the order of $ 134 billion .
And maybe , say , the North Koreans would try to pull something like this off with a third party .
Yeah , they'd have to be nuts , and ignorant of how western finance works -- but they are .
And the North Koreans are well known for mass counterfeiting of dollars , either to pay their own bills or as an act of economic warfare ( or both ) -- perhaps they decided to " go nuclear " with the option ?
Or maybe ... [ ]
The bonds are real and were sent by a " non-official " person from a foreign nation .
The few news stories published on all this typically say that the US stopped issuing bearer bonds in 1982 .
But , as I noted in my prior post , the law that ended the issuance of bearer bonds in the US contains exceptions that enables the Treasury to still issue them to foreigners .
Now imagine , hypothetically , that the Chinese government , for reasons of its own , asked that , in exchange for its continued support in financing the US deficit , the Treasury issue some of the bonds it was buying in " bearer " form , and that the Treasury did .
The Chinese government still has roots in communism , is trying to make the jump from third - world to first - world in one generation , and is rife with factionalism .
Suppose next that the bearer bonds wound up in the hands of an individual government functionary , and he decided to keep them under his personal control to secure his position and " influence " over the government , not to mention a well - funded retirement .
Might those bonds then find themselves on their way to an anonymous safe deposit box in Switzerland ?
This idea eliminates the awkward requirement of a buyer for the bonds , and offers entertaining James Bond - type story possibilities .
But why would the government of nation like China ever open itself to such a risk by demanding bearer bonds , rather than registered bonds , in the first place ?
Well then possibly the bonds are fake and not from a government ... [ ]
The bonds are fake and part of a small - money " Nigeria " - type scam .
In this the scammer claims to hold some huge asset , but for some strange reason needs your help to cash it in , in the form of an advance payment of money from you , in exchange for which he promises you a share of the asset after he cashes it in .
( Nigeria scams require seemingly unbelievable stupidity on the part of their victims -- but experience shows human stupidity is something one can always safely believe in . ) I guessed before that " Probably this was all some lunatic scam gone bad , a ' Nigerian ' scam of insane proportions " -- primarily because it gets the dollar amount involved down to plausible levels .
Making it even more likely , it turns out that this scam has been pulled with bearer bonds before
But the idea of a Nigeria - scam still leaves plenty of questions :
This scam has to be pulled on rubes , real dummies .
You need a big market of people in which to find them -- the big old USA , as in the linked example , is fine !
But if you were going to pull this scam using fake bearer bonds , why would you smuggle them into Switzerland , which has probably the smallest and most financially astute population outside of Liechtenstein ?
It does n't seem like anyone would take these bonds into little Switzerland unless there was someone there already committed to wanting them .
Who ?
Moreover , with a Nigeria scam the victim would n't be buying the bonds , acquiring them , but would be paying money to help the scammer dispose of them .
So why would the bonds be going into the country at all , instead of the victim 's money going out ?
And why all the secrecy after a routine Nigeria scam was busted ?
Should n't they be publicizing it as a public service , a lesson on consumer safety ?
I think the five general scenarios above cover all the logical possibilities ( real / fake bonds , govt / non - govt actors , etc . ) .
But there are two more peculiarities about this case that are odd in any scenario ... [ ]
Nobody 's been arrested ( !)
Multiple reports say this -- and even that the two men carrying the bonds have been released .
These two guys either were part of the one of the biggest counterfeiting scams in history or owe 40 % of $ 134 billion -- that 's $ 53.6 billion -- as the penalty under Italian law for smuggling undeclared real securities over the border ... and they 've been released ?
( Does this suggest they have the protection of a legitimate government ?? )
Even if this was " merely " a Nigeria - type scam involving $ 134 billion of forged securities being smuggled over the border , would you expect the perps to be released and allowed to walk away ? [ ]
The news blackout .
After the initial reports from Italy , there 's been virtually nothing of substance reported of any kind .
Why ?
If the bonds are fake and this was a routine scam of some sort , why not say so and give the details ?
Why were the smugglers released ?
Who where the smugglers ?
The most simple fact of whether or not they were really even Japanese has n't been confirmed .
The initial multiple reports from Italy said that the bonds if counterfeit are excellent counterfeits ( although how many $ 500 million US bonds do local Italian police see ?
so how would they know ? ) and that US authorities have been asked to examine them and are expected to do so next week .
But today a brief statement from the Fed declared the bonds to be fake even without examining them .
" Based on the photos we 've seen on the Web , they 're not even close to looking like a Treasury security .
" They are judging by photos on the Web ?
Like this
All of this has me putting on my Holmesian deerstalker cap , and for the first time in my life seriously considering ... maybe ... conspiracy theory .
If the bonds were real and you were the US government , what would you do ?
I 'd think ...1 ) Declare definitively that the bonds are " fake " ( no need to even look at them ) to protect the world financial order in general and the value of the US dollar and US debt in particular , then ...2 ) Suppress all media investigation into the genuineness of the bonds , for obvious reasons , and then , just maybe ... 3 ) Burn the bonds !
Subtract that $ 134 billion from the national debt .
Why not ?
The bonds are fake , right ?
Is the government of Japan ( or China ) belatedly going to say : " No , no , the bonds are real !
Hey , give them back to us !
We were just trying to smuggle them onto the world 's financial black markets ... " ?
I doubt it .
Why not teach 'em a lesson and save the taxpayers some real money at the same time ?
Well , I 'm not quite a conspiracy theorist yet .
If I was forced to wager , I 'd still put my money on " Nigeria scam " as least implausible .
I do n't know what the truth is -- but should n't any of these possibilities be a real story for the press ?
Whatever went down , something happened on an historic scale : attempted fraud , smuggling , forgery , act of economic warfare , James Bond - like intrigue , Nigeria scam , something .
The news blackout itself would seem to be a story .
Yet not one hound in the entire pack of the press is barking .
Which seems very strange , considering all the endless inanities that the entire pack goes yap !
yap !
yap !
yap !
yapping about all the time .
It 's a mystery to me .
Access to the nation 's federal law proceedings just got a public interest hack , thanks to programmers from Princeton , Harvard and the Internet Archive , who released a Firefox plug - in designed to make millions of pages of legal documents free .
Free as in beer and free as in speech .
The Problem : Federal courts use an archaic , document - tracking system known as PACER as their official repository for complaints , court motions , case scheduling and decisions .
The system design resembles a DMV computer system , circa 1988 – and lacks even the most basic functionality , such as notifications when a case gets a new filing .
But what 's worse is that PACER charges 8 cents per page ( capped at $ 2.40 per doc ) and even charges for searches – an embarrassing limitation on public access to information , especially when the documents are copyright - free .
The Solution : RECAP , a Firefox - only plugin , that rides along as one usually uses PACER – but it automatically checks if the document you want is already in its own database .
The plug - in 's tagline , ' Turning PACER around , ' alludes to the fact that its name comes from spelling PACER backwards .
RECAP 's database is being seeded with millions of bankruptcy and Federal District Court documents , which have been donated , bought or gotten for free by open - government advocate Carl Malamud and fellow travelers such as Justia .
And if the document you request is n't already in the public archive , then RECAP adds the ones you purchase to the public repository .
The plug - in was released by Princeton 's Center for Information Technology Policy , coded by Harlan Yu and Tim Lee , under the direction of noted computer science professor Ed Felten .
That 's a pretty good hack , but it 's still just a stop - gap measure until the federal courts figure out that in the age of the internet , charging citizens to search and read public documents should be a federal crime .
Using it should not cause journalists , lawyers or law students ( PACER 's main customers ) any legal trouble .
After all , court documents are never copyrightable .
But you never know how the justice system might react .
Last fall , the federal court system shut down a pilot program that offered free PACER access at a few libraries around the country after it figured out that Malamud and hacker Aaron Swartz took them at their word and started downloading court decisions by the gigabyte .
That got Malamud 20 percent of the fed 's court filings and an interrogation by FBI agents earlier this year .
Hopefully RECAP will get a friendlier reception from the U.S. Federal Court System .

As a passionately jaded observer of news media and the insane human spectacle it is so painfully wont to wallow in , I find there are always a number of choices when it comes to analyzing something like the horrific Jayee Lee Dugard / Phillip Garrido saga , that sickening kidnapping / rape / confinement tale spanning 18 years , multiple offspring and countless layers of psychological torment often too disgusting and sad to ponder for long without a book of poetry , a puppy and a large glass of Scotch .
Nevertheless , it remains one of the more fascinating and revealing of questions :
How do you parse it ?
What the hell do you do with such bizarre and soul - curdling information ?
Through what sort of lens do you observe , take in , try to make even a passing hint of sense of such stories ?
Do you even try ?
Maybe you take the easy route .
Maybe you , like millions of others , go for the knee - jerk , right - wing reaction and simply say , " Great , another psycho rapist madman .
Let 's just kill Phillip Garrido right now and be done with it .
Or maybe throw him in prison and let him suffer for a while first and then inject him , hang him and zap him with 2,000 volts all at once because he 's obviously an unspeakable monster who does n't deserve another breath on this planet . "
Easy , right ?
It 's a hugely typical , mindless , even comfortable sort of all - American pseudo - cowboy response , allowing all sorts of bogus calls for " justice " and retribution while doing absolutely nothing to offer perspective and help you walk down the street with just a little less taste of fear and misanthropy in your mouth .
But hey , it 's what we do .
Or perhaps you realize the ignorance and small - mindedness of such a perspective , and hence you go a layer or two deeper , attempt to examine such a bizarre spectacle from various socio- psychological angles , try to see how it might fit into the human circus , the Jungian shadow side , the convoluted world in which we live , as you ponder the seemingly endless levels of cruelty the human animal is capable of .
This is where it gets ugly .
This is where you start to imagine the worst , the nastiest , the darkest deeds of man , as you begin to tie the Jaycee Lee Dugard story into all the other horrors you 've read about over the years , every sort of rape and incest and brutality -- like that recent saga from Austria , the even more horrific tale of Josef Fritzl who raped his own daughter for 24 years and fathered seven children by her and kept most of them locked deep in a homemade suburban dungeon .
But then you get a bit trapped .
Because then it becomes all sorts of terribly morbid , horror - movie fun to imagine , in your most cynical fears , that these sociopaths are surely not the only ones , that there are probably thousands more like them who just have n't been caught , living right this minute in all sorts of neighborhoods , maybe even down the street from where you live , maybe right next door , and , gosh , maybe it 's more wicked and scary out there than you ever thought possible , and maybe sustained fearful disgust / mistrust really is the best way to endure this horrible little planet .
You think ?
The unrelenting media coverage , of course , plays right into this perspective , amplifies the fear to such a degree that you think this sort of thing simply must be happening all the time , even if it 's completely untrue .
Like Internet predators , like porn exploitation , like a hundred other largely bogus cultural terrors that have been exaggerated to the point of undue paranoia , and so we are trained to think the worst .
It does n't really matter if they 're often completely fallacious .
Or perhaps you wonder , in your inverse cynicism , why it 's always the God zealots , or the right - wing militants , or the gun-loving fanatical loners who seem to be the ones who enact the worst offenses .
Is n't there an obvious pattern here ?
Why do you never read about , say , that pacifist Buddhist yoga teacher who suddenly snapped and opened fire on a playground ?
Why is it the worst a hardcore liberal lefty is capable of appears to be , say , hurling a brick through the window of the Nike store , whereas the your average knee - jerk neocon likes to bring his a machine gun to Glenn Beck 's Obama - is - a - Nazi pool party ?
Again , too easy .
Too unsubtle .
And completely lacking in the obvious fact that violence and brutality ain't exactly the sole dominion of the religious or the hyperconservative ( well , not completely ) .
The potential is , of course , universal .
As Joseph Conrad put it , " the bitterest contradictions and the deadliest conflicts of the world are carried on in every individual breast capable of feeling or passion . "
The real danger lies in denying it .
Or maybe you simply skip over all these options entirely , and choose not to even try and understand any of it at all .
Maybe you saw the Dugard headline itself and said , " No , no way , I am simply not allowing that into my worldview ; I refuse to let that kind of poison drip into my daily coffee .
There 's enough horror and sadness , war and pain , sickness and trauma in the world already without letting some extreme example stab at my spirit . "
Despite the willful ignorance , this is often the most appealing response of all .
I wish I had the correct answer .
I wish I knew which perspective was the healthiest , the safest , the least depressing and spiritually disturbing , while still allowing an examination of the lessons such sagas might hold .
Maybe it has more to do with taking the open - ended view itself , and seeing the Dugard story as simply that : a compelling opportunity to ask yourself how to respond , which perspective holds even a modicum of compassion and humanity .
Maybe there is no " right " way to take it all in ; there is only a sigh , a shudder , a wincing nod to the demon in us all , and a breathing through .

For once , you can take the " @ " symbol at the front of a Twitter account name literally .
The Twitter name " @arjanelfassed " is not only the Twitter account of one Arjan El Fassed ; it 's also the name of an actual location , " @ arjanelfassed tweetstreet , " which is now a street in a Palestinian refuge camp .
The Dutch website Jouw Eigen Straatnam charges $ 146 for each of 200 street names in the Askar camp and gives the proceeds to the Palestinian Child Care Society ( PCCS ) , according to Al Fassed , to fund " cultural and expressive after - school activities " for the up to 1,000 children in the camp at its youth center .
Part of the program 's allure , he says , is that the corresponding street signs are temporary .
" Since a refugee camp by definition should not remain permanent , selling street names of the camp is a creative way to connect people and support these children after school , " said Arjan El Fassed .
" Naming the street to my Twitter account is a symbolic way to connect both online and offline with the children of Askar . "
There are n't many places in the world where you can buy a street name , which leads us to believe that his claim that his is the first street named after a Twitter account is accurate .
Has anyone seen another ?

At equinox , the rings turn edge - on to the Sun , reflecting almost no sunlight Raw images of the moment Saturn reached its equinox have been beamed to Earth by the US Cassini spacecraft .
Scientists are studying the unprocessed pictures to uncover new discoveries in the gas giant 's ring system .
Equinox is the moment when the Sun crosses a planet 's equator , making day and night the same length .
During this time , the Sun 's angle over Saturn is lowered , showing new objects and irregular structures as shadows on the otherwise flat plane of the rings .
Saturn 's orbit is so vast that Equinox happens only once every 15 Earth years .
At the moment of equinox , the rings turn edge - on to the Sun and reflect almost no sunlight .
This is the first equinox since 1994 and the first time there has been an observer , in the shape of the joint US and European spacecraft , Cassini .
In an email , Dr Carolyn Porco , leader of Cassini 's imaging team , said the long - awaited images did not disappoint : " Even a cursory examination of them reveals strange new phenomena we had n't fully anticipated .
" Over the next week or two , the [ Cassini ] imaging team will be poring over these precious gems to see what other surprises await us , and , as usual , we will announce what we have found as soon as we can . "
Cassini was launched in October 1997 from Florida 's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station .
It arrived at Saturn in July 2004 to embark on a four - year mission of exploration around the planet and its moons .
The spacecraft is still operating well and has been re-programmed to carry out new tasks .
Its current mission is to answer some of the questions raised by its earlier observations .

I maintain the Class : : Accessor module .
It appears to be used a lot , but the API is a bit ugly .
In YAPC :: Asia the ugly API was criticised in at least three different talks , and each time it was compared to the fashionable Moose API .
In one of these talks JRockway asked Shawn Moore how to turn a bad API into a good API , so I ’m going to try that : adding antlers to Class : : Accessor !
So now instead of writing :
package Foo ; use base qw( Class :: Accessor ) ; Foo->mk_accessors ( qw( alpha beta gamma ) ) ;
If you prefer Moose - style you can write :
package Foo ; use Class :: Accessor " antlers " ; has alpha => ( is => " rw " ) ; has beta => ( is => " rw " ) ; has gamma => ( is => " rw " ) ;
The original API is still available , and everything is the same underneath .
Ich wette , ihr erkent nicht von Anfang an , wieviele Kinder er da genau betreut .

Migration experts have challenged new official projections that Britain 's population will hit 70 million by 2029 , largely as a result of a future influx of people and births to foreign nationals in the UK .
Tim Finch , head of the Institute for Public Policy Research 's migration programme , said the Office for National Statistics projections published today assumed migration patterns over the next 10 years would mirror those of the last 10 .
The ONS figures are based on the average pattern of migration into Britain over three years up to the middle of 2008 , before the economic recession began to bite .
" Early indications suggest that the peak of net migration , mainly from eastern Europe , has passed , " said Finch .
" The next few sets of migration figures will suggest that inward migration is steadying and emigration is increasing .
If that trend continues then some of the assumptions that net migration will go on and on that lie behind the projection of 70 million by 2029 may be wrong . "
The ONS projections show that the current UK population of 61.4 million would rise to 71.6 million by 2033 , passing the 70 million mark by 2029 .
Should that happen it would be the fastest rate of population growth seen since the postwar baby boom , with the ONS saying it would mean adding a city the size of Bristol to the population each year .
But claims that a new " immigrant baby boom " are fuelling the rise appear wide of the mark .
One in four babies born last year had non-British - born mothers .
This partly reflects the younger age profile of recent migrants and the greater prevalence of women of childbearing age , and a higher fertility rate than among British - born women .
Statisticians say 55 % of the 10.2 million projected rise over the next 25 years will come from a natural increase in births over deaths , and 45 % will be due to more people coming to Britain than leaving .
The home secretary , Alan Johnson , said earlier this year that he did not " lie awake at night " worrying about the population hitting 70 million .
Guy Goodwin , of the ONS , stressed that the figures were not forecasts and did not " take account of new or future policy initiatives " .
" Really , they 're just a benchmark that policy - makers and politicians can look at and say , ' This is where we are heading if things continue very much as they are . ' "
The projections are actually lower than the set published last year and are based on the immigration picture in 2006 , 2007 and provisional figures up until the middle of 2008 .
The ONS has revised net migration downwards by 10,000 to 180,000 a year and projected that the 70 million mark will be passed a year later , in 2029 , compared with last year 's projections .
Phil Woolas , the immigration minister , said the ONS projections showed that population growth was starting to slow and reforms that the Home Office had made to the immigration system over the past two years were working .
" Last year saw a 44 % fall in net migration and we expect that fall to be sustained and reflected in future projections . "
The ONS also suggests the oldest age group is likely to grow the most quickly , with the number of Britons over 85 due to more than double over the next 25 years , from 1.3 million in 2008 to 3.3 million by 2033 .
The number of centenarians is due to rise from 11,000 to 80,000 by 2033 .
Even taking account of increases in the state pension age , those qualifying for a state pension are expected to rise from 11.6 million in 2008 to 15.6 million by 2033 .
New life expectancy figures confirm the north - south divide in Britain .
Life expectancy is highest for men at 79.2 years in south - east England and for women at 83.1 in south - west England .
It is lowest in Scotland , at 75 for men and 79.9 for women .
Life expectancy at birth has improved across the UK since the early 1990s , but while London saw an increase of 4.9 years for men , life expectancy for Scottish men rose only by 3.5 years .
A boy born this year in Kensington and Chelsea can expect to live for 84.3 years compared with only 70.7 years for a boy born in central Glasgow .
NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - A meeting of a 17 - country group of the world ’s worst polluters in Italy this week will likely agree on a token joint declaration because President Obama will be chairing , Indian officials said on Sunday .
The 17 - member Major Economies Forum ( MEF ) is trying to agree on a climate plan on the sidelines of a G8 summit in Italy .
A substantive pact would go a long way in defining a new U.N. climate treaty due to be agreed in Copenhagen in December .
The MEF members , who discussed a draft text in Mexico last month , account for 80 percent of global emissions .
Officials said persistent differences , particularly over the size of reductions in carbon emissions and the base year for comparisons , might scupper efforts to agree a joint declaration and result instead in a chairman ’s summary of countries ’ views [ n L3655179 ] .
However , a top Indian climate official said : “ A chair ’s summary would have been seen as a failure , and given that President Obama is chairing the MEF meeting there is going to be a political declaration . ”
“ Whether it is going to be a meaningless or meaningful document is left to the reader ’s judgment . ”
Leaders of MEF nations are due to meet on Thursday , July 9 on the sidelines of the G8 summit .
But climate officials are holding urgent negotiations on Tuesday to agree on the MEF declaration .
The current draft statement , discussed at talks in Mexico last month , omits a base year for emission comparisons and there is disagreement over language and nuances on long - term goals , Indian diplomats said .
Developing countries , including India , would like a base year of 1990 because this would force rich nations to cut back their emissions more sharply , leaving developing nations more carbon space to expand their economies .
But wealthy nations , such as Japan , are pushing for a more recent base year .
The final MEF communique , however , is unlikely to mention any key figure to avoid upsetting countries such as India , which says mentioning any figure or target now would be prejudging the outcome of negotiations for a new U.N. pact in Copenhagen .
“ India feels that the declaration will aim to demonstrate the political intent of the major economies to arrive at a consensus for having a robust agreed outcome at Copenhagen , ” Dinesh Patnaik , a top Indian climate official , told Reuters before leaving for Italy for Tuesday ’s negotiations .
Developing countries want their industrial counterparts to reduce emissions by up to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 , while rich nations want developing states to commit to boosting their economies in an environmentally friendly way .
The MEF proposal says major economies are to consider setting a goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , a target developing nations say leaves them less room to grow .
“ Prospects of any substantial agreement is poor , ” said former India foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal .
“ The debate will continue . ”
Urumqi quiets down after protest against syringe attacks
( Xinhua )
Updated : 2009-09-04 02:49
URUMQI : The city of Urumqi , capital of northwest China 's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region , quieted down late Thursday night after tens of thousands of people took to streets to protest against syringe attacks .
There were few pedestrians on the Youhao , Karamay , Altay and Beijing Roads .
Police were persuading about 100 people to leave the Nanhu Square in front of the municipal government .
Passage in areas including Youhao Road , Guangming Road and Renmin Square was prohibited for vehicle as a traffic control in place on major roads in downtown areas took effect at 9:00 pm .
The daytime protest , attended by tens of thousands of people , crippled city traffic and forced shops in major commercial streets to shut .
Police said Thursday 's protest started at 10:50 am when more than 1,000 people gathered in the residential quarter of Xiaoximen .
Another crowd of protestors gathered at the Beiyuanchun farmers ' produce wholesale market at 10:30 when a man was caught after allegedly stabbing a five - year - old girl .
The demonstration spread to major streets including Guangming Road , Xinmin Road and Youhao Road .
People also turned out in big crowds in front of the Renmin Cinema and at the Renmin Square .
Protestors held the national flag and the flag of the Communist Party of China and shouted " Severely punish the mob . "
Members of the Uygur ethnic minority were among the protesting crowds .
Wang Lequan , secretary of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) , and Li Zhi , secretary of the CPC Urumqi City Committee , called on the crowds , on two separate occasions , to stay calm and show restraint .
Wang and five representatives of the public held talks in the office building of the regional committee during the afternoon , but no details were available .
Stabbing attacks occurred during the protests and an attacker was caught at the scene .
The police stopped the crowd who were about to beat her .
Police said that attacks with syringes against innocent people have been carried out in Urumqi since August 17 .
The regional health department said 476 people have sought treatment for stabbing , of whom 89 were showing obvious signs of needle sites .
As of Wednesday , there had been no deaths reported and no symptoms have been found of infectious disease viruses or toxic chemicals .
Parents are worried about the safety of their children as the Fall semester has started .
Zhu Hailun , head of the political and legal affairs commission of the CPC committee in Xinjiang , said members of nine ethnic groups including Han , Uygur , Hui , Kazak and Mongolian had reported stabbing incidents to the police in recent days .
Local police had seized 21 suspects , of whom six are in police custody and four arrested for criminal prosecution , said the regional information office in a mobile phone text messages to the public on Thursday .
It also said that the court would hand down severe punishments to those found guilty according to the law .
The attacks came less than two months after the July 5 Urumqi riot when 197 people , mostly from the Han ethnic group , were killed , and 1,600 others injured .
Authorities have issued arrest warrants to 196 suspects and prosecuted 51 for involvement in the riot , the regional government information office said in a statement Thursday .
The police have further requested the procuratorate to approve the arrest of another 239 suspects thought to be involved in 140 crimes .
Another 825 are being held in criminal detention , the regional information office said .
WiiMote is the best Gaming gadget you could ever dream of .
Though Originally designed for Nintendo Wii console , WiiMote can be used by interfacing to PC , MAC via Bluetooth .
What you need :
1. Bluetooth dongle ( Integrated BT might not work , try your luck )
2. Right Bluetooth stack ( BlueSolelil or WIDCOMM or Toshiba ) .
3. Software to control WiiMote ( GlovePie on Windows or WMGUI and CWIID on Ubuntu , DarwinRemote on MAC )
4. Last but not the Least – Wii Remote ( WiiMote ) .
( You can buy it separately from eBay as well around $ 20 . )
Instructions :
Step 1 .
Make sure you have Bluetooth plugged in and proper Bluetooth stack installed .
First , you need to get your wiimote into discovery mode .
You do this by pressing the 1 and 2 buttons .
The blue lights at the bottom of the wiimote should be flashing .
You may have to keep pressing these buttons until the wiimote connects with your PC .
Now Turn ON Bluetooth and try to discover for devices .
You should be able to detect a device named “ Nintendo RVL - CNT -01 “ .
Keep holding down the buttons until pairing is complete .
If you let up , the Wiimote will time out and turn off .
If it does this before pairing is complete , pairing will fail .
Step 2 .
If you have a compatible Bluetooth stack , it will be detected directly as a HID device and displayed in device manager .
I used IVT BlueSolelil as shown in screenshot .
Now you need to install the software to actually make WiiMote usable .
For Windows , GlovePie , Extract the contents of the zip into a new folder and run GlovePIE .
Now , go to File and Open and navigate to the WiimoteScripts ( included in the zip ) , look for NESController.pie .
Click Run and your wiimote should be able to control NES Emulators !
I tested it with the default settings in VirtuaNES and it worked great !
GlovePIE comes with may more scripts for you to try out , so have fun with it !
It ’s only a matter of time before we have some games on the PC to play with the Wiimote , but in the meantime , enjoy all of the things GlovePIE already allows you to do !
On Mac , Ubuntu , it ’s similar .
You have to run the application and load a profile or configure yourself .
Else , Google for any game profiles you are looking for .
On Mac with DarwinRemote running , Once paired , DarwiinRemote will display a graph showing the forward , up and down , and left to right sensors on your remote .
You can let go of the ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) buttons now .
Once you ’re done playing with that , press the ( 1 ) button on your Wii Remote once to toggle the motion sensor mouse feature .
Tilt the remote to move you mouse up , down , left and right .
To move it left and right , turn the remote instead of moving it .
Press the ( 2 ) button to toggle the IR sensor mouse feature .
Please note that this only works if you have a Mac that supports the original Apple Remote .
Now you can literally point and click on the things on your screen .
On Ubuntu ,
Follow this guide .
More ..
There are few more softwares that can replace GlovePIE on Windows .
Like WiinRemote , BlueTunes .
Check them out , they are also pretty cool .
You can control iTunes , Winamp , Napster , Windows Media Player , VLC , Quintessential Player , Media Player Classic , Foobar2000 , Zune , etc with them .

( CNN ) --
A series of spooky lights above parts of the northeastern United States Saturday sparked a flurry of phone calls to authorities and television news stations .
NASA said strange lights seen in the Northeast on Saturday were caused by an experimental rocket .
CNN affiliate stations from New Jersey to Massachusetts heard from dozens of callers who reported that the lights appeared as a cone shape shining down from the sky .
However , the lights were the result of an experimental rocket launch by NASA from the agency 's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia , a spokesman told CNN .
Keith Koehler said the Black Brant XII Suborbital Sounding Rocket was launched to study the Earth 's highest clouds .
The light came from an artificial noctilucent cloud formed by the exhaust particles of the rocket 's fourth stage about 173 miles high .
Natural noctilucent clouds , also called " polar mesospheric clouds , " are " found in the upper atmosphere as spectacular displays that are most easily seen just after sunset , " according to a NASA statement published earlier in September .
" The clouds are the highest clouds in Earth 's atmosphere , located in the mesosphere around 50 miles altitude . "
Normally , noctilucent clouds are not visible to the naked eye and can only be seen when illuminated by sunlight below the horizon .
The launch took place at 7:46 p.m. Saturday , just as the sun was setting for the day .
Observation stations on the ground and in satellites will track the artificial noctilucent clouds created by the rocket for months , NASA said .
" Data collected during the experiment will provide insight into the formation , evolution , and properties of noctilucent clouds , which are typically observed naturally at high latitudes .
" In addition to the understanding of noctilucent clouds , scientists will use the experiment to validate and develop simulation models that predict the distribution of dust particles from rocket motors in the upper atmosphere , " the NASA statement said .
CNN 's Greg Morrison contributed to this report .
All About NASA
Eventually , we learn to take an individual at his word .
Andy Stanley is a master communicator , and he communicates very well and very often .
His preaching and teaching often bring controversy , and he quite regularly makes arguments that subvert the authority of Scripture and cast doubt upon biblical Christianity .
He returns regularly to certain themes and arguments — so regularly that we certainly get the point .
He evidently wants us to understand that he means what he says .
Mr. Dodd and others say that the market crisis last year was caused in part by banks that were able to choose which agency would regulate them , and by bank agencies that reduced regulations to encourage more banks to choose them .
That problem would be eliminated if there were only one bank agency .
The Dodd plan is certain to run into sharp resistance from banking industry lobbyists , who have already been urging lawmakers to defeat it even before it is formally introduced .
It is also likely to face stiff opposition from bank regulators , who are protective of their turf and have already raised objections about the more modest Obama plan .
Image Senator Christopher Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , wants changes in President Obamas financial plan .

Mr. Dodd , who faces a difficult re-election campaign in Connecticut partly because of the perception that he is cozy with the banking industry , decided two weeks ago to remain chairman of the banking committee rather than succeed his close friend , the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy , as head of the health committee .
Senior Democrats in Congress say Mr. Dodd may have to thread a needle as he publicly takes on the financial services industry  whose members have a heavy presence in Connecticut and are some of his biggest campaign contributors  while trying to project an image of independence from it to get re-elected .
But as chairman , he may also have to make compromises with industry lobbyists to move the legislation through a chamber in which bankers hold political sway .
Mr. Dodd said he decided to remain chairman after conversations with the senior committee Republican , Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama .
He said Mr. Shelby persuaded him that it would be possible to get bipartisan support for stronger financial regulation despite major disagreements between even the two senators .
Today 's announcement marked a major uptick in business resistance to the U.S. Chamber .
SAN FRANCISCO -( Dow Jones ) - PG&E Corp. ( PCG ) said Tuesday it is leaving the U.S. Chamber of Commerce over objections to what its top executive called the chamber 's " extreme position on climate change . "
In a letter to the U.S. Chamber published on PG&E 's blog , www.next100.com, PG& E Chairman and Chief Executive Peter Darbee wrote that company employees " find it dismaying that the Chamber neglects the indisputable fact that a decisive majority of experts have said the data on global warming are compelling and point to a threat that cannot be ignored . "
( Source : DJ Newswires , via CNN )
Resistance within the business community had been brewing since the U.S. Chamber stepped up its efforts to oppose climate change legislation and obstruct the EPA .
More than 20,000 small business owners have weighed in with their local chambers to oppose the position of the U.S. Chamber ( The various chambers are autonomous bodies and sometimes take opposing policy positions . )
This is more than a spat within the business world and will have major effects on the public framing of climate change .
The reason it's so important is that mainstream media almost universally accept the conservative frame that climate change is matter of " jobs vs. polar bears " or something similar .
This frame implies that we can't take climate change seriously because it costs too much to do anything about it , particularly in a recession .
Much of the coverage plays off a spokesperson who claims to represent business -- often from U.S. Chamber -- counterposed against another spokesperson , often representing an environmental group .
This crucial announcement from PG&E is the beginning of a massive reframing , away from jobs vs. polar bears , and focusing on the growing divide within the business community : innovative and forward - looking companies that " get it " vs. old line extraction companies that cling to the past .
Many business groups understand and support the need for climate protection .
Some of the important ones are : Business Alliance for Local Living Economies , Green America , Social Venture Networks and others , Business Forward , Small Business Majority , American Sustainable Business Council , Progressive Business Leaders Network , and Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities .
Businesses that are members of these forward thinking groups deserve your patronage .
( Disclosure : I 'm a co-founder of one of these )
But we need more of them , and particularly , more of the big household name companies -- particularly ones like PG&E which make their money in energy -- to break from the past .
Then the media will frame this as old business vs. new , and not jobs vs. polar bears .
And then public support for real action will become even stronger .
update : First time on rec list !
Thanks !!!
update 2 : If you are part of a business association or network , or know of one , that would like to join with other businesses to protect the climate and reframe this debate , please send an email to American Sustainable Business Council or get in touch with me through my website at Brodwin & Associates .
Sexy WordPress Plugins used by the HART - Empire Network 0
HART Blogging , Plugins , Recommendation
Okay .. maybe “ sexy ” is a little overdoing it – but , I ’ve been blogging since May 2005 and have many blogs and I like to think that I have some experience in selecting the right wordpress plugins for my blogs .
Plugins are like the backbbone of your blog , and just like your theme .. determines the functionality and look of your blog .
I thought I would share all of the major plugins that I am using around my network of sites .
Here ’s how I keep track of all my plugins ..
On my local hard drive , I have a folder something like this :
c:\2009 -Latest -Wordpress
Whenever I find a plugin I like , I copy it into a folder such as this :
c:\2009 - Latest -Wordpress\plugins \
If there are specific plugins – e.g. – my translator plugin configured for the PetLvr blog only ..
I would do something like this :
c:\2009-Latest-Wordpress\special\petlvr\plugins \

Google says one aim is to " bring the world 's lost literature back to life " Google has offered concessions to European publishers who are concerned about the Internet giant 's plans to put books into a massive online library .
Material which is out of print in the US , but still available for sale elsewhere , will not be added to Google Books , unless consent is granted .
Google has already digitised millions of out - of - print titles .
The European Commission wants concerted action to allow more books in Europe 's national libraries to be scanned .
Only 1 % of the holdings in national libraries across the 27 EU members states have been digitised - and complex copyright laws are partly blamed .
" We also need to take a hard look at the copyright system we have today in Europe , " said a statement from the European Commission , as hearings got under way in Brussels to assess the latest Google plans .
The Google scanning project has so many more titles than any comparable scheme that many publishers and booksellers fear it will exploit a monopoly position .
In the US , copyright holders get 63 % of the price of each book printed to order from Google Books , with the Internet service retaining the remaining 37 % .
Out - of - copyright books are available free of charge .
' Land grab '
Under the new deal , Google will have to negotiate rights with individual European publishers and authors .
Millions of out - of - print books have already been digitalised
The original plans caused concern because books out - of - print in the US would have been added to Google Books , even though they might be in print and for sale elsewhere , in English or other languages .
" People have described it as a big land grab , " said Philip Jones of the UK book trade magazine , The Bookseller .
" Publishers want to see more clarity . "
Google also proposes to add a European publisher and a European author to the board of its Books Rights Registry .
Google Books scanning director Don Clancy said the project would offer scanned versions of books to similar organisations , such as Europeana , backed by the EU .

PITTSBURGH 
Six groups that want to demonstrate during the Group of 20 summit meeting here on Sept. 24 - 25 filed a federal lawsuit Friday claiming they were being denied the right to protest .
The groups , which engage in a wide array of social justice advocacy , have been talking for over a month with the defendants  the city , the Secret Service and the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources  about logistics surrounding demonstrations .
But only 2 of 13 permits sought have been granted , and those are for events that will be held either outside the downtown area , where leaders of 20 of the world ’s largest and emerging economies are to gather , or before the meeting , the lawsuit asserts .
“ What they ’re essentially doing is refusing permits for any demonstration in downtown Pittsburgh , and that ’s unprecedented , ” said Witold Walczak , a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania , which is representing the six plaintiffs : Codepink , the 3 Rivers Climate Convergence , the Thomas Merton Center , Pittsburgh Outdoor Artists , Bail Out the People and G - 6 Billion .
How to Break Bad Habits
Our habits may be based on our core principles , but the surrounding elements will often change them on a daily basis .
Be it frugality , way of life or our morals , people around us slowly change our behaviors in a big way .
When we were young , our parents help shape our values by setting examples .
Once school started , we start learning from our friends and classmates .
Then as we grow older , the sum of our experiences act as the ultimate trial and error experiment that forms our habits .
Do you have spending problems that cannot seem to be controlled ?
Are you always in a rut and ca n’t seem to be able to get out ?
Do you want to increase your motivation to do better ?
If you want to break your bad habits , you should surround yourself with people who do n’t have that habit in question .
My Spending Buddy
One of our friends came to visit us for a few days and let me tell you why he ’s special .
Every time he comes over , both of us end up buying something we otherwise would n’t have bought .
There ’s a tiny portion of peer pressure involved , but it ’s mostly because we fuel each other ’s enthusiasm when we talk about our shopping wish list .
We seem to like the same stuff , and we get excited every time we discuss why we should make another purchase .
We laugh about it , because the stuff we buy are affordable but you can see how it could potentially get out of control .
Mentoring Without Knowledge
There are a few people I always have lunch with .
I cherish their friendship , but they also unknowingly helped steer me towards a successful path .
There are big ah - ha moment I can share with you today , but the questions they ask , the way they act and the attitude they portray all stimulate my mind and improve me in every way .
The Frugality in Me
If my parents never cared about money , it would be very difficult for me to develop my frugal habits .
If Emma thinks of nothing but which handbag she wants to buy next , it will tempt me to buy everything I ever wanted without regard to finances as well .
What I ’m Trying to Say
The people closest to you will always affect how you think and act .
If you want to save money , then hang around people who also appreciate the value of a dollar .
If you want to climb up the corporate ladder , then strike up a conversation with people who are enthusiastic about the company you ’re working at .
If you want to have a better relationship , then make friends with people who seem to be loved by everyone around them .
Our behaviors are shaped by people we are closed to .
The good news is that there is always a way to improve .
Evaluate , come up with a plan and take action .
It works every time .
UTTARADIT , Thailand ( Reuters ) - A
Thai man is keeping more than 4,600 scorpions as pets to atone for the years he spent cooking the arachnids to sell as snacks .
Scorpions , insects and worms are commonly eaten in Thailand , especially in the northern regions .
But after years of serving up scorpions , Suang Puangsri , a practicing Buddhist , felt it was time to befriend them instead .
“ Although I was happy to have money , I felt suffering deep inside as they were being harmed by me , ” he told Reuters .
“ I felt scared that I was committing a sin . ”
The 38 - year - old has given up the bottom floor of his two - storey home to the scorpions , who scuttle about a 6 meter by 5 meter ( 19 ft by 16 ft ) enclosure decorated with branches and stone so that very little light and heat come in .
Suang buys up to one kg of live cicadas and other inspects daily to feed his pets , who have stung him so many times that he says he is immune to their venom .
He also spends at least an hour every day meditating inside the enclosure , often placing scorpions in his mouth .
Suang ’s pets have attracted a few tourists to his sleepy town of Fark Ta in the northern province of Uttaradit , and he now makes a living by selling figurines and stone carvings of ants , frogs , turtles and Buddhas .
Although the $ 570 he earns a month is a far cry from the $ 860 he made selling cooked scorpions , he and his family are content .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
“ I feel good about what is he doing .
I did n’t like it when he made the scorpions suffer .
I ’m not scared of those scorpions , but I do n’t dare touch them , ” said Suang ’s wife , Lampoon Pimtoom .
Suang is so determined to atone for his past sins that he even buys scorpions from other people who want to sell them to restaurants .
When the arachnids become too many , he and his son release a few hundred back into the forest .
Suang ’s fixation with scorpions is unusual , but not totally unheard of in Thailand .
Earlier this year a Thai woman went into the record books for spending 33 days and nights with 5,000 live scorpions .
She also held a 7 - inch live scorpion in her mouth for 2 minutes and 3 seconds .

Ever since the N900 was announced , I ’ve had people ask me whether it ’s difficult , or in some cases even possible , to write apps for it .
Well , it is possible , and it ’s pretty easy : let ’s write a simple app together and you ’ll see .
We ’ll make a basic client for the social bookmarking site reddit , and I ’ll call it ræddit , because I have no imagination .
First , a bit of handwaving .
I ’m not here to teach you C , or Glib programming , or GTK programming .
There are plenty of good tutorials about those already , and I ’ll assume you know a bit about them .
In keeping with this , we wo n’t be writing the client ’s back end ; we ’ll just assume that there ’s a Glib - friendly client library for reddit already in existence .
Oh , look , a handy Glib - friendly client library just conveniently sprang into existence for us : source , headers .
Learn to love Scratchbox .
If you ’re doing any development for the N900 , you ’ll run into a cross - compiler toolkit called scratchbox .
It ’s packaged in most major distros , so install it before you go any further .
There are two reasons you ’d use scratchbox :
In case you do n’t have an N900 handy , you can run an entire Maemo environment inside scratchbox .
But we ’ll assume you have an N900 lying around , because otherwise we ’d have to explain how to set up the desktop environment inside scratchbox , and that would be a bit of a diversion .
( On the other hand , this would be a good subject for a future post in this series . )
You can also use scratchbox just for running a compiler , in order to make binaries .
This is what we ’ll do .
My First Compile .
So first of all , let ’s not bother with any of the graphical stuff , or with packaging .
Let ’s just write a program that dumps the contents of reddit ’s front page out to standard output , and then let ’s run it on your phone .
Here ’s a pretty minimal program to do that : raeddit - 01.c .
Put that in your scratchbox , along with the reddit client library linked to above , and at the scratchbox prompt type :
apt - get install libcurl3 - dev libjson - glib - dev gcc `pkg - config -- cflags -- libs glib - 2.0 hildon - 1 json - glib - 1.0 libcurl dbus - glib - 1` raeddit - 01. c greddit.c -o raeddit-01
There are some extra libraries listed in the pkg - config statement which we ’ll be needing later .
Caveat :
You may currently find a difficulty getting the correct packages installed to compile against json - glib ; as of the time of writing there was a version dependency problem in the Maemo repository between libjson - glib - dev and libjson - glib - 1.0 - 0 .
I solved it in a rather ugly way by downloading the package directly and doing dpkg - i -- force - depends libjson - glib - dev_0.6.2-5_armel.deb .
Your mileage may vary .
I hope they ’ve fixed this by the time you read this .
If not , you know what to do .
So anyway , you should now have a binary called raeddit - 01 .
Now , either find out your trusty N900 ’s wifi IP address , or hook it up via USB , in which case its IP address is 192.168.2.15 .
Give the command
scp raeddit-01 root@192.168.2.15 :
( The default root password is well - known . )
Your binary is now on the phone in the directory / root .
Make sure the phone is connected to the Internet , fire up a terminal on the device , and type
/root / raeddit-01
If you see the current contents of reddit ’s front page printed out on the terminal , you ’re doing fine :
First steps into Hildon .
So , now we have a very basic reddit client .
Let ’s think about making it pretty .
What we want is a series of buttons going down the page that look something like this :
Eventually we ’ll need to make a custom widget for that , but fortunately there ’s a standard Maemo widget called a HildonButton which holds two labels , a title and an optional subtitle , which is close enough to what we want for a basic tutorial .
It looks like this :
We can just stick a bunch of these into a GtkVBox .
But we also want the user to be able to flick through them with her finger , and there ’s a specialised Maemo container widget to allow that : it ’s called HildonPannableArea .
So the GtkVBox will live inside one of those .
So here ’s raeddit - 02.c ( diff to raeddit - 01.c ) , which knows how to put up a window and fill it with buttons .
The buttons do n’t go anywhere , but at least we ’re getting somewhere !
Compile it , transfer it to the phone , and run it again :
Making the buttons into links .
So next we need to make the buttons go to the various sites .
Now , there ’s two important things you have to consider when porting or building an app on the N900 .
One of them , which we ’ve just mentioned , is that sometimes there are widgets which do n’t exist on the desktop , because they work in ways which are better adapted to life on a phone .
The other is that there ’s a whole ecosystem of programs on the device with which we must play nicely .
One such program is the web browser , and right now that ’s exactly the program we need to talk to .
The polite way to ask the browser to show a particular page is by using a DBus call .
Here ’s raeddit - 03.c ( diff to raeddit - 02.c ) , which knows how to do that .
Compile it , transfer it to the phone , and run it again .
I would show you a screenshot , but it looks just the same as the last version .
And it works .
And now we have a first approximation to the program we wanted , which is at least good enough to call version 0.01 !
Where can this go next ?
The program needs to live in a package , so that it can be installed easily , so that it can have a little icon in the launch menu , and so that it can be uploaded to maemo - extras and perhaps one day to Maemo Select .
We ’ll be looking at that next time .
There are lots of things you might want to do with a post on reddit , beyond just viewing the site it links to .
So rather than the buttons going directly to the sites , it would be better if they popped up one of those rather stylish menus saying things like “ Go to site ” , “ Go to comments page ” , “ Vote up ” , “ Vote down ” , and so on .
( That kind of menu is called a HildonTouchSelector ) .
We ’ll do that the time after next .
Clearly the page should refresh every so often .
The download should really be done asynchronously .
The buttons should really be custom widgets that look more like our mockup .
Many posts on reddit consist only of a picture , and launching the browser for these is probably overkill .
We could do these in - process with a GdkPixbuf .
This should be another option on the popup menu , “ View image ” , so that people still had the option of using the browser .
Also for picture posts , we could display them inline in the custom widgets , as is done on the website .
Of course , it would be lovely if you could use the client to log in , and vote posts up or down .
Also , the ability to post links would be pretty useful .
There should be an app menu with some useful buttons on it .
The client should support subreddits .
It would be extra fun to have this as a home applet rather than an app .
There should be a way to sort posts by newness , hotness , and so on .
( Yes , I noticed after I wrote it that the current version sorts posts backwards . )
It should be possible to hide posts you ’ve already seen .
There should be a “ share ” button , to share posts you like with other people by email or twitter / identica , and so on .
It would be a nice touch if there were gestures to access the most common options on the popup menu ( slide your finger from left to right across a post to open the associated link , and so on . )
I can imagine adding a new addressbook field called “ reddit username ” , and being able to single - tap open a contact ’s reddit user page from their contact information .
The iPhone app has a thing where it goes to a random page if you shake it .
We could do that … … your idea here …
Let me know where you ’d like this series to go in future .
I ’m speaking only as a fascinated individual here , and I ’d also welcome any corrections you have , as well as any questions about things I left unclear .
If this whets your appetite , you can find out a lot more detail in the official developer guide , or the official porting guide .
This summer Muslims were murdered in Holland , Germany , and Belgium – four victims of hate crimes .
These murders are just the latest examples of Islamaphobia coming out of Europe .
But Europe is not the only place intolerant of its Muslim citizens .
Even in some Muslim countries , expression of religion is often perceived as a threat to the secular state .
One of the best places for a Muslim to live is the United States .
In a lot of ways , conditions are better here than almost anywhere .
As a Muslim not permitted to wear my head covering as a politician in my home country , Turkey , I know .
Think about it :
In Turkey , where the vast majority of the population is Muslim , you will not find a lawyer with a beard or a student at a university wearing a head scarf , but you can find plenty in New York City .
In Tunisia , you wo n't see a religiously dressed physician at university hospitals – but you can in Alabama .
In the majority of Muslim countries the government is an intrusive enterprise with eyes and ears everywhere .
The result is bleak .
Countries reward only sycophants of the " divine " state .
Muslims feel stifled by the encroachments of the establishment and lack of religious tolerance .
If a man or a woman wanted to organize a protest against the government to gain the right to practice their religion more openly or be politically active against the status quo , may God help him to escape from the wrath of the state .
Many Muslim countries promote homogeneity while their citizens yearn for a right to diversity , which will give them the ability to practice their religious rituals freely .
In America , on the other hand , doors open to accommodate people 's religious beliefs .
And that , along with citizenship rights and the opportunity to exercise the freedom to practice Islam day in and day out , is what makes the US so good for the millions of Muslims here .
American Muslim women can engage in any sport they choose wearing their religious garment – unlike in France and Italy where Islamic - approved swimsuits , and therefore Muslim women , are not welcome in the pools .
The White House and universities alike host iftars to celebrate Muslims ' holy month of fasting .
Elementary school students can attend Friday prayers without having to worry about absentee records .
These small but significant examples of freedoms attest to the country 's sine qua non of inalienable citizenship rights : freedom of expression and freedom of religion .
That is not to say that the US is exempt from the mistreatment of Muslims .
Racial profiling and workplace discriminations sometimes do occur .
Yet the difference is when American Muslims face an unjust treatment , they have recourse where they can find justice .
Examples abound : The Justice Department sided with Muslim high school students in Texas who were n't allowed to pray on school premises during lunch break in 2005 , when they took their complaint to the federal government .
This year , a judge has ruled favorably in the pretrial lawsuit brought by six imams who were detained in 2006 for " flying while Muslim . "
This would not happen in many Muslim countries since judiciary bodies are generally under the thumb of the regimes that promote coercive secularization .
Post - 9/11 , the US did mistreat some Muslims .
But today , the Obama administration is making amends by probing alleged CIA torture and by closing the Guantánamo prison .
There , after early abuses , officials accommodated detainees ' religious needs .
So - called Muslim nation - states could learn from these steps in their treatment of devout citizens .
As President Obama tries to mend America 's relationship with the global Muslim community , he should promote " democratic " change from within , supporting any push from within countries for more heterogeneity .
Supporting the will of the " people " alone rather than the ( semi ) dictators , even when it is difficult , could make a huge difference .

For the past year or so , greed has been popping up all over the place like dandelions in a vacant lot .
Lately , I 've encountered blatant attempts to sway and pressure me into buying products , services and even ( sigh ) signing up for credit cards .
Due to This Recession 's continuing lack of jobs and creeping inflation ( i.e. grocery store prices ) , some people who might normally go about their business , suddenly seem hell - bent on padding their incomes with pie - in - the - sky promises or suspicious referrals that could include kick - backs .
These people are exhibiting the sick signs of greed when they selfishly put their interests above what 's fair and right .
As we agree ( you and I ) , in This Recession , money does not grow on trees nor can it be produced in great quantities by a magician ( the U.S. Mint ) .
Therefore , it is vital for us to be on the lookout now for people attempting to induce us to hire their friends or take their suggestions regarding services and companies .
Of course , our trustworthy friends have good referrals to make ; but acquaintances may be another story .
In order to avoid being a victim of a greedy 7 - letter - word , you must literally grow a new set of eyes in the back of your head .
So here 's what I suggest as 5 steps to combat this contagious ailment .
1 . When it comes to hiring a service or a contractor , always get a second , third or even fourth quote before signing up .
You can save your self a lot of agony by checking the going rates of services in your area ( it many cases , it should be lower than last year ) .
You can visit the internet to " YELP " consumer opinions on services like movers or restaurants .
I have found Yelp to be reliable and helpful , but you must also do your homework if you want to get the best service for the best price .
Do not let some one else 's self - interest steer you wrong .
2 . If the person who refers you to a product or a service insists that you follow his / her recommendation , smell a halibut , because something fishy is going on .
This happened to me several times lately - not only for services but for products .
In one situation where I was shopping for carpet stretching and cleaning ; the first referral , from a supposedly reputable source , was 3 times higher than what I eventually paid .
I suspected a kickback , because the first quote was so outrageous and when I went with someone else , my acquaintance stopped talking to me .
3 . Avoid sales people who pitch they can help you make money fast .
These sales people are more popular than ever - many of them promoting pyramid schemes or home - sales or telephone soliciting .
Be sure to check out the track records of those approaching you .
If the promise involves a new company or one without a history , beware .
This idea may be based more on their greed than your need .
Recently , a neighbor approached me with a get - rich - quick scheme that involved recruiting people to sell a type of legal insurance .
It was a pyramid scheme , although my naive neighbor only saw the dollar signs for her and for me ( her recruit ) .
That business idea is another form of greed .
I know she meant me no harm , but her excitement could have been contagious .
There are very few ways to get rich fast , especially in This Recession .
4 . Fact - check people promising to hire you - especially if they suggest starting on a trial basis for little or no money or working from home .
There are , of course , many legitimate home - based businesses and employers , but there are also many who may be promising work they can't deliver .
Never give our your personal information to any of these people - no matter how perfect the job or the opportunity seems ( " Be a model on TV " or " make $ 5,000 a week from your home " ) .
By searching the companies or the people , by name , on the internet , you are likely to find some reference to them - good or bad .
If there is no reference at all , be concerned .
And there is another greedy gambit that can snare job seekers .
A family member , applying for a creative job , was asked to bring along a creative design to her interview .
She did n't get the job , but the design showed up in a store window several months later .
I have heard this story from different people about different job interviews .
Apparently , this is one way some businesses have to get free help without feeling any obligation to the people who only want jobs .
Unconscionable .
5 . Do not telegraph your dire straits to strangers .
Greedy people can see the desire in your eyes , like professional poker players hoping for a fat cat ( whale ) to sit in at their card game .
It 's human nature to want to make the most out of something , and those who gamble also bear responsibility for losing out to greed .
But consider the fact that during This Recession , many people have become more like card sharks , as they seek an easy way to pad their income or prop up their businesses .
Be aware this is an ugly trend we are like to see more of until the economy eventually improves .
Greed does not evaporate .
In good times , greed thrives , as well .
But bad times seem to bring out the worst in many people .
You can save money and avoid the pitfalls that greed always produces by cost - comparing and checking references before opening your wallet or divulging personal information .
There is nothing of lasting good that greed ever produces .

At the end of August , Microsoft confirmed what we 've known for months : the 120 GB XBox 360 Elite would be seeing a price drop to $ 300 .
Sure , the new system wo n't include high - definition cables of any kind , but what 's the price of an HDMI cable between friends ?
While Microsoft claimed this price drop had been in the works for months and was n't a reaction to Sony 's own price reduction and hardware redesign , another wrinkle has been added to the pricing story .
Microsoft is now offering a $ 50 mail - in rebate to those who purchase the $ 300 Xbox 360 Elite , starting immediately .
That 's not all the news we have for your today , though , as the Mole spills the beans on an Elite holiday bundle , as well as information on an upcoming refresh of Microsoft 's wireless adapter for the Xbox 360 .
" Xbox 360 Elite puts all your entertainment in one place so you can play games , watch movies and TV shows , listen to music , and , coming this fall , keep up with your Twitter and Facebook social circles , all from your living room , " the announcement states .
" Additionally , with a Netflix unlimited membership and an Xbox LIVE Gold Membership you can instantly watch movies and TV episodes streamed from Netflix , recommend your favorite shows and share in a movie party night with up to 7 friends — all on Xbox LIVE . "
The deal is valid for anyone who buys a system between September 22 and October 5 , so the window for getting your hands on the rebate is rather small .
This fits in with remarks Microsoft 's Aaron Greenberg made recently to Eurogamer .
" I do n't believe the price cuts that both companies have made will impact the market dynamics too dramatically in the long term , " he stated .
" We typically see a month or two of lifts and share adjustments , but then things tend to settle back to roughly the established market ranking . "
Adding this rebate on top of the $ 100 price drop is a good way to steal some of Sony 's momentum , and to maximize the short - time sales boost Microsoft expects from the recent price cut .
Right now the specific details on the rebate are not available online , but you should be able to find the information page on Microsoft 's site in the next few hours .
With $ 50 , you can pay for a year of Xbox Live , get an extra controller or game , or you could simply pocket the money .
This brings the price of the Xbox 60 down to the cost of the Nintendo Wii , although by all accounts Nintendo 's hardware will see a price drop by the end of the month .
Is there a connection between that nearly confirmed rumor and this rebate ?
Anything is possible in this generation 's pricing war .
The Mole has also chimed in with some more info on Microsoft 's plans .
Starting in the middle of October we 'll be seeing an Elite system bundled with copies of both Pure and Lego Batman , giving you a little more value for your $ 300 through Christmas .
Microsoft has also confirmed the existence of an 802.11n adaptor for the Xbox 360 , and the Mole has let us know that the hardware will be released for $ 100 , with the existing 802.11g adapter dropping in price to $ 79.99 .
The hardware will feature two antennae for better reception , and should help deliver the bandwidth needed to stream 1080 p video instantly , as Microsoft claims is possible with the upcoming Zune video store update to the Xbox 360 .
A rebate , new bundles , and less expensive wireless .
This is a big day for Microsoft news .

Intel is on the verge of transitioning to 32nm .
We 'll see the first parts this year .
What do you do with your 45 nm fabs when you start moving volume away from them ?
Make really cheap quad - core Nehalems of course :
I 'm talking $ 196 .
I 'm talking faster than AMD 's entire lineup .
I 'm talking about arguably the best processor of 2009 .
I 'm talking about Lynnfield , and here 's its backside :
Mmm
I spent much of the past year harping on AMD selling Nehalem - sized Phenom IIs for less than Intel sold Nehalems .
With Lynnfield , Intel actually made Nehalem even bigger all while driving prices down .
Like I said , what do you do when you 're still making boatloads of money in a recession and are about to start emptying your 45 nm fabs ?
I should clear things up before we progress much further .
Lynnfield is the codename for mainstream 45 nm quad - core Nehalem , while Bloomfield refers to the first Nehalem launched at the end of 2008 :
Processor Manufacturing Process Die Size Transistor Count Socket Bloomfield 45nm 263 mm2 731M LGA - 1366 Lynnfield 45nm 296 mm2 774M LGA - 1156
Despite being cheaper , Lynnfield is larger than Bloomfield .
The larger die is due to one major addition : an on - die PCIe controller .
Bloomfield , The First Nehalem , circa 2008
Lynnfield , Nehalem for All , circa 2009
The pink block to the right of the die is the PCIe controller , that 's 16 PCIe 2.0 lanes coming right off the chip .
Say hello to ultra low latency GPU communication .
You'd think that Intel was about to enter the graphics market or something with a design like this .
Sacrifices were made to reduce CPU , socket and board complexity .
Gone are the two QPI links that each provided 25.6 GB /s of bandwidth to other CPUs or chips on the motherboard .
We also lose one of the three 64 - bit DDR3 memory channels , Lynnfield only has two like a normal processor ( silly overachieving Bloomfield ) .
Intel 's Bloomfield Platform ( X58 + LGA - 1366 )
The sum is that Lynnfield is exclusively single - socket ; there will be no LGA - 1156 Skulltrail .
While the dual - channel memory controller is n't really a limitation for quad - core parts , six and eight core designs may be better suited for LGA - 1366 .
Intel 's Lynnfield Platform ( P55 + LGA - 1156 )
The loss of QPI means that Lynnfield does n't have a super fast connection to the rest of the system , but with an on - die PCIe controller it does n't matter : the GPU is fed right off the CPU .
The Lineup
We get three Lynnfield CPUs today : the Core i7 870 , Core i7 860 and the Core i5 750 .
Intel 's branding folks told us that the naming would make sense one we saw the rest of the " Core " parts introduced ; yeah that was pretty much a lie .
At least there are n't any overlapping part numbers ( e.g. Core i5 860 and Core i7 860 ) .
The i7 in this case denotes four cores +
Hyper Threading , the i5 means four cores but no Hyper Threading .
The rules get more complicated as you bring notebooks into the fray but let 's momentarily bask in marginal simplicity .
Processor Clock Speed Cores / Threads Maximum Single Core Turbo Frequency TDP Price Intel Core i7-975 Extreme 3.33GHz
4 / 8 3.60 GHz 130W $ 999 Intel Core i7 965 Extreme 3.20 GHz 4 / 8 3.46GHz 130W $ 999 Intel Core i7 940 2.93GHz
4 / 8 3.20 GHz 130W $ 562 Intel Core i7 920 2.66GHz
4 / 8 2.93 GHz 130W $ 284 Intel Core i7 870 2.93GHz
4 / 8 3.60 GHz 95W $ 562 Intel Core i7 860 2.80 GHz
4 / 8 3.46GHz 95 W $ 284 Intel Core i5 750 2.66GHz 4 / 4 3.20 GHz 95 W $ 196
Keeping Hyper Threading off of the Core i5 is purely done to limit performance .
There are n't any yield reasons why HT could n't be enabled .
Intel was very careful with both pricing and performance of its Lynnfield processors .
I 'm going to go ahead and say it right now , there 's no need for any LGA - 1366 processors slower than a Core i7 965 :
This is only one benchmark , but it 's representative of what you 're about to see .
The Core i7 870 ( LGA - 1156 ) is as fast , if not faster , than every single LGA - 1366 processor except for the ones that cost $ 999 .
Its pricing is competitive as well :
For $ 196 you 're getting a processor that 's faster than the Core i7 920 .
I 'm not taking into account motherboard prices either , which are anywhere from $ 50 - $ 100 cheaper for LGA - 1156 boards .
I do n't believe LGA - 1366 is dead , but there 's absolutely no reason to buy anything slower than a 965 if you 're going that route .
I thought Civil War was great .
It started to tackle a big " what if " in comics that was never really answered .
What if a superhero screwed up and not only got themselves killed but a bunch of those around them .
That 's the spark .
The fire is the reactions of the different heroes as to how to fix the problem .
I thought it was interesting to see Captain America become an outlaw because he believed that registering was unconstitutional and he stood up for that belief .

WASHINGTON -- Government efforts to funnel hundreds of billions of dollars into the U.S. economy appear to be helping the U.S. climb out of the worst recession in decades .
But there 's little agreement about which programs are having the biggest impact .
Some economists argue that efforts such as the Federal Reserve 's aggressive buying of Treasury debt and mortgage - backed securities , as well as government efforts to shore up banks , are providing a bigger boost than the administration 's $ 787 billion stimulus package .
The U.S. economy is beginning to show signs of improvement , with many economists asserting the worst is past and data pointing to stronger - than - expected growth .
On Tuesday , data showed manufacturing grew in August for the first time in more than a year .
" There 's a method to the madness .
We 're getting out of this , " said Brian Bethune , chief U.S. financial economist at IHS Global Insight .
Much of the stimulus spending is just beginning to trickle through the economy , with spending expected to peak sometime later this year or in early 2010 .
The government has funneled about $ 60 billion of the $ 288 billion in promised tax cuts to U.S. households , while about $ 84 billion of the $ 499 billion in spending has been paid .
About $ 200 billion has been promised to certain projects , such as infrastructure and energy projects .
Economists say the money out the door -- combined with the expectation of additional funds flowing soon -- is fueling growth above where it would have been without any government action .
When the knot sets in - a selection of rogue ties ( BBC and Joana Christina )
By Finlo Rohrer
BBC News Magazine
As schools go back after the summer break they are being driven to adopting clip - on ties .
Why ?
Because of a wave of youthful rebellion that is seeing some very oddly - tied ties in the playground .
Something has happened to the humble school tie over the last few years .
SUPERFAT STYLE
Very large knot Wide but very short tie beneath
Can be achieved by traditional four - in - hand style knot Wider part wrapped repeatedly over narrow part Narrow part slipped inside shirt No-one can be precisely sure when the process started - it may even have been decades ago - but it 's clear that it 's reached crisis point .
The British school tie has gone rogue .
Instead of the neatly tied four - in - hand , or even a slightly plumptious Windsor , tens of thousands of teenagers , and even younger children , are sporting a cornucopia of weird knots .
Pass by a group of schoolchildren on a bus and you will see a variety of subverted ties .
The micro tie , or " bonsai " , is in proportion but often only three or four inches long .
Rather more common among the nonconforming children is the " superfat " , a grotesquely large knot , fatter even than those on display at a footballer 's court appearance , above a short tie .
More traditional is a normally - tied tie but loosened considerably .
Finally , and perhaps the rarest of the bunch , is a completely rogue tie , where the wide part of the tie is done extremely short , while the thinner part - the " tail " - is long .
BONSAI STYLE
Perfectly proportioned
But only three or four inches long Can be achieved by reversing four - in - hand Narrow part is wrapped over wider part Sadly , this is no laughing matter for schools .
Quietly , it has become a persistent disciplinary issue chewing up precious teacher time .
If uniform code is there to provide an atmosphere of discipline , then it must be enforced .
Ruth Harker is principal of Shenley Court Academy in the West Midlands .
They have just made the decision to switch to clip - on ties .
" It is basically to ensure consistency in the way the ties were tied .
It is also to try and avoid this half - tied look . "
It 's a trend that has been noticed by the Schoolwear Association , the trade body for wholesalers and retailers .
" Lots of schools are doing it - 14 or 15 % of our schools have converted and there are a lot of inquiries , " says Philip Linz , operations director at Clive Mark Schoolwear .
" They are fed up with pupils coming in with ties in disarray and not doing their top buttons up .
With a clip - on tie , you have to do your top button up .
It 's about making schools tidy . "
Of course , those pupils who like to customise their ties are not going to be happy .
OTHER MISBEHAVIOUR
Peanutting : Child yanks other child 's tie hard Tiny knot ensues which cannot be unpicked Can be avoided by tying tie around two pence piece Blazer customisation : Jacket lined with bright material then cuffs turned up " More often than not it is a boy thing , " says Matt Whyman , author of Unzipped , and agony uncle for Bliss magazine .
" Boys need to subvert the authority .
But it 's kind of a tribal thing , looking to fit in , in a weird way .
On the one hand you are doing it to rebel but also you do n't want to stand out in a crowd . "
So it is n't just that children want to thumb their nose at authority by subverting the uniform code .
They also fear persecution .
" You are leaving yourself vulnerable if you are the only one walking around with a nicely knotted tie .
You are opening yourself to abuse . "
One way to get around the problem is not to have ties at all .
Ben Slade , principal of Manor Community College in Cambridge , does not have ties in his uniform and he has seen problems in schools which do have them .
" Wherever there are ties there are issues .
Wearing a tie smartly means wearing it down to your belt and done up to the top .
That just is n't what students tend to do .
" They will try to do anything to subvert that requirement .
In almost every school I worked with , it seems to be uniformly scruffy . "
And uniform subversion is not restricted to ties .
" We 've gone to polo shirts .
[ But ] they will turn up in a [ non-regulation ] Umbro .
Almost anything is subverted .
It is a sort of controlled rebellion .
They might well be behaving very well . "
Mr Whyman concurs that clip - ons wo n't cure subversion .
Zammo was naughty but at least he could tie his tie " There will just be other ways to rebel .
You will always find a way .
Look at school bags - they are customised to within an inch of their life .
You can probably compare it to gang signs in LA .
It 's about conforming with your mates . "
And some children are willing to fight for their right to have weirdly - tied ties .
When McAuley Catholic High School in Doncaster recently moved to bring in clip - ons , angry students launched a Facebook group opposed to the measure .
Over at the Shenley Academy , Ms Harker insists the pupils are OK about clip - ons .
She says 95 % are happy about the idea of ties in general .
And they all know how to do one properly .
" Most of the students do know how to tie a tie , it 's just that they do n't always do it in a way we want . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
I can certainly confirm that the short " superfat " tie was in vogue when I was at secondary school in the early 1980s .
This " rebellious " phenomenon is n't confined to boys either - I went to an all girls ' school .
Helen , London 1 .
Clip -ons are n't necessarily the answer as pupils are now clipping them on to any part of their person ( lapels , trousers etc ) , replying that they are still wearing their tie .
2 . Part of the reason why schools have what pupils consider unnecessary petty rules is so that they can subvert or break them without any real danger to themselves or anyone else .
Pupils will always break rules .
If the only rules are serious ones then a lot more children will get into real trouble .
Minor rules are a buffer to protect children , but at the same time to give them the opportunity to rebel safely .
So , rejoice that their energies are occupied with playing with their ties and not doing any real harm .
Graham McNeil , Misterton , UK I am 46 years old and I went to an all girls school but we still did what we could to make our uniform slightly different .
We went through a range of " tie " styles , and we also wore black socks one year , on mass .
The uniform code stated white socks but they could n't send every girl home , so eventually black socks became part of the uniform .
Karen , Loughborough , Leics I left school back in 1977 .
We used to get a pin and pull the silver threads out so the tie would become black .
Also we used to tie our ties really big knots .
I can remember I had a narrow skinny tie so I burnt it on purpose with the iron so my mum would buy me a trendy wide tie .
Maggie , Plymouth
When I was at grammar school in 1956 we used to narrow our ties by ironing in the sides .
Our little rebellion was ignored by the teaching staff but we felt great .
Good luck kids .
Gordon Law , Solihull , UK
The best way to avoid peanutting in my day was 1 ) be too cool so people would n't do it or 2 ) for the other 98 % of us , use a modified Windsor knot ( no 2 p needed ) that was 100 % peanut proof .
I still tie my tie like that to this day .
Jeffrey , Bath , UK
Of course , clip - on ties have a bad side , as I found out the hard way .
When someone tries to " peanut " you while wearing such a tie , it 's actually possible for the clip to come off the shirt and attach itself rather painfully to the skin of your neck - and it's incredibly difficult to remove it if this happens .
The design of the clips may be different now to how it was 10 years ago , but it 's still something to consider .
Jeremy , E Sussex , UK Schoolchildren should be allowed to wear their ties as they like .
What other way of expressing individuality do we have ?
We are not allowed piercings , which is fair because of health and safety fears .
We cannot colour or style our hair as we would like .
We cannot wear the clothes we wish to .
Constantly during drama classes , or English or art , students are encouraged to show their individuality .
But the same teacher can later be telling you to do up your top button and put your tie on like everyone else .
Give us this last little bit of individuality .
Chloe Miller , Bristol , England
We used to wear our ties the wrong way round , with the very thin end on show .
We also used to pick at and pull threads with a compass to create extra stripes within the pattern of the tie .
Ruth Williams , Mold , North Wales
We tied ties in a variety of means 30 years ago , and there was n't any problems .
After all , the tie is a poor relation of the cravat , for which books were written about the many and varied ways in which it could be tied .
It looks and sounds as if ties are being used to cover for a general lack of respect and poor behaviour displayed by a minority of school children .
For those that wish to display a little individuality , let them .
Most will wish it to enhance their appearance .
Rob Key , Edinburgh I can remember having a very short tie by wrapping it round a number of times - back in the mid 70s .
David Williment , Leeds
In the 60s we used to roll the waistbands of our knee - length skirts up to make them minis .
At my brother 's school , they used to be fined for having too wide or narrow trousers and not wearing their caps on buses travelling to and from school .
What is the problem , other that clip - on ties mean that you never learn to tie a Windsor ?
Val , Devon Being Scandinavian
I obviously find the British school uniform tradition as something very conservative and irrational indeed .
But I have to confess that it is through all of Britain 's strict and authoritative culture , that you are - and have been for a long time - the world leader in rebellious youth movements .
God bless the Queen !
David Ingemarsson , Walthamstow , London

New research from the Journal of Marriage and Family shows that children born outside of marriage are less likely to be visited by their father when the mother is involved in a new romantic relationship .
Many children born outside of marriage are born to parents in unstable relationships and often live apart from their fathers .
The study finds that a mother ’s social decisions have a direct effect on the contact between a father and his child .
Fathers are likely to not visit their child at all when the child ’s mother forms a new relationship early in the child ’s life , especially if the new relationship is co-residential and the new partner is involved in childrearing activities .
Additionally , fathers who initially visited their child at an earlier point are likely to stop visiting their child if the mother becomes romantically attached to someone .
However , if the relationship ends , fathers have an opportunity to re-enter their child ’s life .
The study examines the interactions non-residential fathers have with their children when a non-paternal figure ( or co-residential partner ) enters the life of the child .
The research suggests that non-residential fathers should continue visitation despite the more complicated parental roles and relationships that may arise when mothers enter new relationships .
The study notes that biological fathers can still make a unique contribution to their children even when their children have a new potential father - figure .
More generally , this research also shows that decisions concerning parental responsibility and involvement do not operate in a vacuum , so efforts to promote responsible fatherhood need to consider both mothers ’ and fathers ’ behaviors .
The research , conducted by Dr. Karen Benjamin Guzzo of Kutztown University , looks at the significant decisions made by both parents when raising a child outside of marriage .
It uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study , a nationally representative longitudinal study of nearly 5,000 children born in large U.S. cities between 1998 and 2000 , the majority of whom are born outside of marriage .

Lily Allen has led an artists ' campaign for a crackdown on file - sharing The European Parliament is hammering out a final agreement on how member states should deal with file - sharing .
It has watered down its original amendment to the Telecoms Package which stated that member states could not cut off net pirates without court authority .
A number of European countries are considering tough anti-piracy laws .
The French government has just approved plans which could see pirates removed from the net for up to a year .
The UK 's file - sharing policy is also likely to include a clause about disconnecting persistent offenders .
The new proposal reads : " Any such measures liable to restrict those fundamental rights or freedoms may only be taken in exceptional circumstances ... and shall be subject to adequate procedural safeguards in conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights .. including effective judicial protection and due process . "
It stops short of demanding a court ruling on the matter .
Members of the European Parliament have until the end of the year to agree to the draft proposal .
Persistent problem
Without compelling services piracy will not be beaten
Mark Mulligan , Forrester Research
File - sharing Q&A
There has been much debate around Europe as to whether internet access is a fundamental right .
The European Parliament has already adopted a provision stating that internet access is " critical for the practical exercise of a wide array of fundamental rights " .
UK prime minister Gordon Brown has said that people are as entitled to internet access as to gas , water and electricity .
At the same time Business Secretary Peter Mandelson has moved to toughen up anti-piracy legislation to include the ability to remove persistent file - sharers from the net .
According to figures from analyst firm Forrester , 14 % of European internet users engage in illegal file - sharing .
Legislation may not be the answer , thinks Forrester analyst Mark Mulligan .
" Piracy will not be solved by legislation alone .
Without compelling services piracy will not be beaten , " he said .
There have been a flurry of announcements about legitimate services in recent months , including Sky's SkyTunes service and tie-ups between the likes of internet service provider CarphoneWarehouse and music service Napster .
New methods
Peer - to - peer networks are likely to be the main targets of any anti-piracy legislation .
At network level , internet service providers are able , if asked , to identify the particular machines from which music or other content is being illegally downloaded .
But non-network piracy methods , including using instant messaging , e-mail , music blogs , bluetooth and iPod ripping , are on the rise .
It is likely that legislation will be too slow to catch pirates , thinks Mr Mulligan .
" Technology just moves quicker .
Already we are seeing around 20 different alternatives to peer - to - peer piracy , " he said .
This week France 's constitutional court approved its revised anti-piracy plans .
The proposed legislation operates under a " three strikes " system .
A new state agency would first send illegal file - sharers a warning e-mail , then a letter and finally cut off their connection if they were caught a third time .
Under the revised law , a judge must rule on the issue of whether to disconnect users .
The UK 's policy on file - sharing is due to be revealed next month .

David , who will also be performing at the Wiltern on Monday took some time to talk to LAist about the book , his writing process , the tour , Glenn Beck and his time living in a UCLA frat house .
Of course , we also had to ask him about SFist .
In the cleverly crafted book , which David will be signing tonight at Book Soup at 9:30 , the comedian / actor tackles everything from religion to breaking up to scrapbooking to Jim Belushi .
The book also includes three pages devoted to a review of a Cross gig found on our sister site , SFist .
David Cross has made audiences laugh their asses of on stage with his brilliant and vicious style of stand - up , on television in his incredibly funny work on " Arrested Development " as never nude analrapist Tobias Funke and as one - half of the team that gave us the hilarious HBO sketch comedy show " Mr. Show with Bob and David , " on CD with is Grammy nominated Shut Up You Fucking Baby ! and on the big screen .
Now , David brings his brand of humor to the written form with his first book , I Drink for a Reason .
David Cross will perform at the Wiltern on Monday | Photo by mecredis via flickr
1 ) In the preface of your book you say " I love to write .
And , at the very same time , I hate to write . "
What do you hate most about writing ?
The responsibility aspect of it .
The sitting down and making myself write .
For better or worse , my writing style in stand - up is to kind of write on stage .
I 'll think of an idea , write it down .
Then I 'll riff on stage until I hone it .
When you 're writing this kind of stuff ; prose or essays or whatever , you do n't have the benefit of performance , accents or cadence .
So it 's a different approach , and an approach that I 'm learning as I go along .
2 ) The book is a mixture of long essays with lists like , the chapter " Ideas for T - Shirts to be Sold at Urban Outfitters " thrown in between .
What did you have in mind as far as the general outline for the book ?
I knew I wanted to do a bunch of different stuff .
I knew I did n't want it to be a memoir or an anecdotal thing .
I did n't have any idea for a real schematic thing , but there are things that are referenced in other pieces .
If you read the book in order , you 'll see that some of the things in early pieces pop up in the later pieces .
Outside of that , the only thing that I was really concerned about was , and not just my editor actually , lumping all of the religious stuff together .
I 'd say , just like my act , at least 25 % of the book touches on religion or God or those ideas or themes .
I tried not to make it too heavy - handed .
3 ) What do you think of the response to the book so far ?
I know that people who have talked to me in person , at book signings , gigs or whatever have said they liked it .
I know there are two reviewers who said they did n't .
Well , one review was not that great the other was kind of mixed , I 'd say .
It was the AP review which gets put everywhere .
They did n't hate it but they thought that it seemed thrown together .
I do n't know , in a sense that 's true .
It is a bunch of different , very different types of comedy but I did that intentionally .
I do n't know what to say that I guess .
They have n't been terrible reviews but the two not good ones that I 've seen felt like the book was lacking overall .
Outside of those it 's been pretty good .
It 's been pretty well received .
Certainly the people who 've read it , have liked it .
I 'm certainly happy with how many we 've sold and the interest that people have had in it .
So that 's been great .
For the most part , the tour is selling really well and people are psyched for me to come to wherever I 'm going .
So yeah , all in all , it 's pretty positive .
I 've never done anything that did n't have some negative reaction to it .
It 's kind of par for the course .
When I bought it , the guy at Borders could n't stop telling me how much he loved it .
Good .
Good .
Yeah like regular old folks who want some chuckles and some thought will like it .
I think if you 're looking for genius , you 're not going get it .
I can tell you that right now .
I 'm not Mark Twain or Voltaire , never will be .
I think for my point of view , my language , my style , I think you 'll enjoy it .
Although now I just remembered , in the review that was pretty mixed , they said that the comedy does n't translate to the page .
I do n't know if it 's just that benefit of knowing my own voice , but I disagree with that .
But if that 's their take then that 's their take .
I 'm glad that people are enjoying it .
4 ) Our sister site , SFist is featured in the book .
Why did you decide to reprint the review from SFist along with your comment that followed ?
When I was putting the book together ; oh and I will say this though , one negative thing about the book - Whoever proofread it did n't do the best job .
I 've done some readings and I 'll be reading along and I 'll see something that is n't the best and will have to switch it up as I go along .
Obviously I have as much responsibility as anybody but I sort of send it in that way thinking , ' There 's some guy who gets fucking 20 bucks an hour just to do this , he 'll clean it up . '
But I do n't think that happened .
Anyway , the SFist thing just sort of felt like it made sense in that piece that my kind of stream of consciousness lent itself to putting that in there .
Basically , it serves as an example .
That 's certainly not the only exchange I 've ever had .
That 's literally one of maybe hundreds of experiences where I said something on stage and people do n't hear the joke in it .
They just hear the word " retarded " or " Jew " or " gay " or whatever and they shut down and they do n't hear the joke .
And then of course that taints the rest of the set and the memory of that set .
I use it as an example of how once you start heading down that path it 's almost irreversible , you know .
It certainly happens a lot .
I do n't have a problem with people going , 'hey that joke 's not funny . '
Here 's the problem with the Internet though , a theory is posited and it's based on a false assumption and then that assumption is n't ever questioned and then that just becomes the reality .
So within four exchanges , there 's a new reality .
In this case , I bombed last night and I was making fun of Mormons and I did n't tell any jokes and people start commenting , ' That 's why he sucks . '
That 's dangerous , not dangerous in the sense that the world is going to blow up but it 's really not responsible .
It 's kind of thoughtless .
So I just use that as an example and a pretty good example of the inherent dangers in that kind of thing .
You have a responsibility if you 're going to blog about stuff .
And guess what , you can do that and I 'm absolutely in my right to respond to it .
And then should I get an offer from a publishing company to print a book , I can put that response in my book , I have every right to do that .
And if you do n't like it ; you can skip ahead , it 's only three pages .
It 's just irresponsible and I 'm not losing sleep over it but since I had that I thought I 'd include it in the book because I thought it was pretty good example of what I was just talking about .
5 ) On this tour , including your stop here in LA where you 're performing at the Wiltern , you are doing larger venues .
Does the size of the audience affect the show ?
What can the Wiltern audience expect from your set ?
First and foremost , I 'm doing theaters on this tour because I 've never done theaters before .
I 've done comedy club tours , I 've done music clubs , I 've done music festivals .
I 've done a couple one off shows in theaters for benefits or whatever but I 've never done a theater tour .
The initial reason I wanted to do theaters was just because I 've never done it .
I feel up to the challenge of it .
I was stressing a little bit before I did shows at Bumbershoot to get ready , but now I feel very confident now .
I 'm doing things in the theater that I can't necessarily do in a music club where the energy is completely different .
There 's more milling about and people standing , it 's just different .
With the theater , it 's about having all of the focus on you all the time .
I 'll say this , I will be showing about seven minutes of the pilot I shot for the UK .
It could potentially never play here , so I got permission to show some of it here .
Not a ton of it but
It will be shown either pre or post show .
I 'm so psyched about that show .
6 ) You have a chapter in the book about Bill O'Reilly and you 're friends with Keith Olbermann , what are feelings on cable news ?
Would you ever go on Glenn Beck 's show ?
I would go on Glenn Beck for the story of it .
He 's a clown .
He 's not a reporter he 's just kind of a loud mouth fearmonger .
He 's silly .
Reasonable people do n't take him seriously but there 's lots of unreasonable people in America that deserve to be entertained as well .
There 's very little on cable news I respect .
Just watching the way they treat these tea party people with a sense of respect that they do n't deserve because they 're afraid of losing that audience is depressing .
I think every time that they talk about , and I mean this is network news or cable news I do n't care who it is , whenever they mention FreedomWorks , the anti-public option healthcare folks which is funded by and run by Dick Armey the old Republican from Texas who 's deep in the pockets of the health insurance industry , and every time they do n't mention that connection it 's tantamount to lying .
7 ) Lastly , I read that when you first moved to LA you were living in a UCLA frat house .
The way you described it in the interview I read just sounded like the worst possible living conditions .
Oh no , what preceded that was actually the worst possible living conditions which was a car .
I think we lived in a car for 10 days .
John Ennis from Mr. Show and I were out there living in a car because of some circumstances that came up the place we thought we were going to be staying in was no longer available .
It was Barry Sobel 's place , where you were supposed to stay , right ?
Yeah !
You 're good .
So what was it about LA that made you want to tough it out through such awful conditions ?
It was actually a girl .
I mean I wanted to go to LA because I 'd never been and had never been to the West Coast .
At that point , I had only been on the East Coast , Atlanta and Boston and wanted to go to LA .
I had no future options or anything tying me to Boston and I had no money no nothing and some buddies were going out there so I went .
There was this girl who told me she was going to come out and set me up with a job .
She never came out to LA .
I spent a decade just lost .
Enjoying myself and experiencing lots of cool things but just lost .
Part of that time was spent in LA .
Did you end up staying out here at that point ?
I stayed for a couple months , went back to Boston and then went back to LA about two years later and stayed for about six months and then went back to Boston .
Then I moved out to LA again in ' 92 or something like that .
Meet David Cross tonight at Book Soup at 9:30 , where he 'll be signing copies of his book , I Drink for a Reason and catch him on stage at the Wiltern on Monday .
The National Marriage Boycott is a student - driven movement to urge Congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) .
DOMA states that the federal government may not treat same - sex relationships as marriages for any purposes , limiting the rights and scope of same - sex marriages in states that allow them .
Participants boycott marriage by signing the online pledge , wearing an equality ring , vowing not to marry , and by organizing and recruiting new members .
New chapters are being created weekly including ones being currently organized at UCLA , UCSB , Florida State University , San Diego High School , and Williams College .

Ben Goldacre , 18 July 2009 , The Guardian .
We ’d all like to help the police to do their job well .
They , in turn , would like to have a massive database with DNA profiles from everyone who has been arrested , but not convicted of a crime .
We worry that this is intrusive , but some of us are willing to make concessions , on our principles , and the invasion into our privacy , in the name of preventing crimes .
To do this , we ’d like to know the evidence on whether this database is helpful , to help us make an informed decision .
Luckily the Home Office have now published a consultation paper on the subject .
They defend their database by arguing that innocent people who have been arrested are as likely to commit crimes in the future as guilty people .
“ This ” , they say , “ is obviously a controversial assertion ” .
That ’s not true : it ’s a simple matter of fact , and you could easily assemble some good quality evidence to see if it ’s true or not .
The Home Office have assembled some evidence .
It is not good quality .
In fact , this study from the Jill Dando Institute , attached to their consultation paper as an appendix , is possibly the most unclear and badly presented piece of research I have ever seen in a professional environment .
Or I am having a bad day .
Join me in my struggle to understand their work .
They want to show that the level of criminal activity in a group of people who have been arrested , but on whom no further action has been taken , is the same as the level of criminal activity in people who have been arrested and convicted of a crime , or who accept a caution .
On page 30 they explain their methods , haphazardly , scattered about in the text .
They describe some people “ sampled on 1st June 2004 , 1st June 2005 and 1st June 2006 ” .
These dates are never mentioned again .
I have no idea what their plan was there .
They then leap to talking about Table 2 .
This contains data on people each from a “ sample ” in 1996 , 1995 , and 1994 , followed up for 30 months , 42 months , and 54 months respectively .
Are these anything to do with the people from 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 ?
I have no idea .
In fact I have no idea what “ sample ” means , perhaps that was the date they were first arrested .
I do n’t know why they were only followed up for 30 , 42 , and 54 months , instead of all the way to 2009 .
Crucially I also do n’t know what the numbers in the table mean , because they do n’t explain this properly .
I think it is the number of people , from the original group , who have subsequently been arrested again .
Anyway .
Then they start to discuss the results from this table .
They say that these figures show that arrested non-convicted people are the same as convicted people .
There are no statistics conducted on these figures , so there is absolutely no indication of how wide the error margins are , and whether these are chance findings .
To give you a hint about the impact of noise on their data , more people are subsequently re-arrested over the 42 month period than over the 54 month period , which seems surprising , given that the people in the 54 month group had a much longer period of time over which to get arrested .
This is before we even get on to the other problems .
At a few hundred people , this study seems pretty small for one that is supposed to give compelling evidence that there is no difference between two groups , because to prove a negative like this , you ’d generally want a large sample , to minimise the chance of missing a true difference in the noise .
There is no evidence that they have done a “ power calculation ” to determine the sample size they ’d need , and in any case , their comparison group feels a bit rigged to me .
In their “ convicted ” sample they only count people who had a non-custodial sentence , and exclude people who got a custodial sentence , on the grounds that those people would be incapable of committing a crime during their incarceration .
This also has the effect , however , of making the “ criminal ” group not quite so criminal , and so a bit more likely to be similar to innocent people .
I could go on .
Table 1 is so thoroughly “ not as described ” as to be uninterpretible .
In the text they talk about different cells on the table which are “ solid red ” , “ stippled yellow ” , and “ blank ” .
In fact the whole thing is just blue .
This research was incomprehensible and unreadable .
Anybody who claims to have been persuaded by the data quoted here is telling you , loudly and clearly in the subtitles , that they do n’t need to understand a piece of research in order to find it compelling .
Such people are not to be trusted , and if research of this callibre is what guides our policy on huge intrusions into the personal privacy of millions of innocent people , then they might as well be channeling spirits .
It 's not immediately obvious what this curious gadget does .
That 's exactly why its manufacturers are trumpeting it as a major technological breakthrough .
The Air Multiplier is the first ever fan without rotating blades .
Instead , it uses a combination of basic physics and cutting edge aerodynamics .
The device features a plastic loop , sitting on a round base which incorporates an electric motor .
According to its manufacturers : " A jet of air passes over an airfoil - shaped ramp that channels its direction .
Surrounding air is drawn into the airflow . "
Roughly translated , a tiny fan in the bottom pushes out small amounts of air which pass over a curved surface , similar to an aeroplane wing .
This creates a powerful jet stream , drawing through more air from behind and beside the fan .
Overall , the Air Multiplier blows out 15 times more air than its motor creates .
Its maker , Dyson , began developing the technology for a range of hand dryers .
High cost
However , innovation comes at a price .
The Air Multiplier will sell at £ 199 through high - end retailers .
Perhaps oddly , the product is being launched in mid-October , with UK temperatures hovering around 13C ( 55 F ) .
The company defended its timing and price tag .
People are willing to pay for quality new technology , even during a recession Dyson spokesperson
" After four years of development the fan is ready and it happens to be spring - time in Australia , " said a spokesperson .
" On pricing … as we 've seen with the vacuum cleaners , people are willing to pay for quality new technology , even during a recession . "
Dyson enjoys a large share of the UK vacuum cleaner market , however , not all of its products have proved a runaway success .
Its Contrarotator washing machine was short - lived .
Despite selling for around £ 1000 , the company stopped producing it after just four years , blaming high manufacturing costs .

 We hope there will be a change in monetary policy as soon as they have positive growth again ,  he said at the Ambrosetti Workshop , a policy gathering on Lake Como .
 If they keep printing money to buy bonds it will lead to inflation , and after a year or two the dollar will fall hard .
Most of our foreign reserves are in US bonds and this is very difficult to change , so we will diversify incremental reserves into euros , yen , and other currencies ,  he said .

Having done the stupidest things a nation can do — for a period of about half a century — the Chinese are getting smart .
They ’re discovering the wisdom Americans have forgotten .
 A penny saved is a penny earned ,  is another of Franklin ’s quips .
In China it is practically the national motto .
The Chinese save 25 % to 40 % of their income .
And now , with their $ 2 trillion in national savings , they ’re going on a buying spree .
But unlike Americans in the Bubble Epoque , the Chinese are n’t buying cheap consumer goods .
They ’re buying real assets raw materials and key supplies of essential resources , such as rare metals .
Ultimately , gold is money it ’s a way to store wealth over the long term .
Just ask Terry Herbert .
The man spent his time with a metal detector , looking for treasure in England ’s green and golden fields .
He ’d been looking for years , but when he finally found something important it brought tears to my eyes ,  he says .
What Mr. Herbert found was perhaps the greatest discovery of buried treasure in English history — 1,500 different artifacts of gold and silver dagger hilts , crosses , helmet cheek pieces and other items of war booty from the Anglo - Saxon period , about 1,400 years ago .
The Golden Constant : T... Leyland , Jill Best Price : $ 121.86 Buy New $ 130.00 ( as of 05:50 EST - Details )
Had Mr. Herbert stumbled upon some IOUs from a Saxon chieftain , it would have been a remarkable discovery .
Its historical value might have been inestimable .
But what he found weighed in at 11 pounds of gold .
In addition to the value to museums and historians , it has monetary value .
Even if you melted it down , erasing all trace of its history and provenance , it would still be worth about $ 160,000 at today ’s price — probably about as much as it was when the Saxons stole it .
Gold ’s price has been remarkably similar for centuries at a time ,  wrote Roy W. Jastram in his 1977 book , The Golden Constant .
 Its purchasing power in the middle of the twentieth century was very nearly the same as in the midst of the seventeenth century . 
Gold outlives paper money , empires , governments all of us and all our institutions .
The Chinese have metal detectors too .
And they know there ’s not much real value behind the dollar .
 The dollar is finished ,  says historian Niall Ferguson .
The Chinese are dumping it , he says .
Ferguson speaks for the popular intelligentsia .
His ideas reflect those of fund managers , hedge fund operators , bankers , politicians and speculators .
They ’re all convinced that the dollar is doomed .
The Financial Times elaborates :
 The financial crisis vividly taught investors the importance of tail risk , a massive one - off event that can crush the value of portfolios .
As the dust settles , fear of another tail ’ to sting portfolios is uppermost in the minds of many investors and money managers . 
Oh , Mr. Market where ’s thy sting ?
It ’s inflation , they believe .
It ’s the risk that the huge liquidity injections being made by central banks could spark a surge in either inflation and / or long - term interest rates beyond 2012 ,  continues the FT .
 Inflation is the single biggest topic for discussion among our clients ,  says a private banker .
What ’s remarkable about inflation is that there is so little of it .
It makes us think this story may have a twist .

While states like Michigan , New Mexico and Rhode Island have recipriocity for out - of - state medical cannabis patients , to date NORML was not aware of a AUSA recognizing such ( though , on occasion , we ’ve seen the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) not act upon medical cannabis patients caught with small amounts of their medicine ) .
This may well be another change under the current Obama administration as both the Clinton and Bush 2.0 administrations prosecuted state authorized medical cannabis patients caught up in federal arrests .
PRESS RELEASE – AUGUST 2 , 2009 – FROM JOHN MCCALL , ATTORNEY
On June 30 , 2009 in the Federal District Court of New Mexico , Assistant US Attorney John Anderson agreed , on the record , to Honor the Medical Marijuana Recommendation of Charles Smith of Shasta Lake , California .
Federal District Court Magistrate Judge Lorenzo Garcia further agreed to accept the State ’s proposed recommendation of a Conditional Discharge upon provision of Mr. Smith ’s Medical Marijuana Recommendation to the US Attorney ’s office .
This historic moment occurred during the federal Government ’s prosecution of cases related to the Annual Rainbow Gathering that occurs in different states around the country and involves a large Federal Law Enforcement presence .
The cases were prosecuted as civil collateral forfeitures and the records have been transferred to the Central Violations Bureau for the Federal Government .
Five Medical marijuana recommendations were honored including those from Wyoming , California , Hawaii and Washington State .
This is the first time in modern history , in which it is known that the US Attorney and the Federal District Court agreed to accept medical marijuana recommendations and licenses in order to dismiss marijuana possession charges .
This historic series of events followed the filing of a law suit by Bryan Krumm of New Mexicans for Compassionate Use in New Mexico Federal District Court in 2008 .
During those proceedings members of New Mexicans for Compassionate
Use were able to speak to Justice Department representatives about the statements in March of 2009 by Eric Holder , US Attorney General , that medical marijuana would no longer be prosecuted .
After this conversation in May of 2009 , Attorney General Holder came to New Mexico in June of 2009 and again gave a public presentation on the matter stating that legally established medical marijuana distribution operations and legally sanctioned medical marijuana users ( all under state laws ) , would not be prosecuted by the Federal Government .
During the proceedings it was revealed that the AUSA ’s prosecuting the cases in New Mexico told Defendants that they were not returning the medicine and that they would be prosecuted if they were caught with Marijuana in the National Forest again .
During discussions with the US Attorney and his Assistants at the Court , long time Federal Criminal Defense Attorney Judy Rosenstein discovered that the US Attorney for New Mexico , Gregory J. Fouratt , was not involved in that decision to impose conditions on the Defendants .
Contact Attorney John McCall for more information on this case .
Charles Smith has given permission for this information to be released to the public and is available , somewhere in the woods around Shasta Lake , if you want to find him and talk to him about his experience .

Some might call him brave , others naive , or even reckless , but the one thing Joachim Crima is not is ordinary .
He is black , and he is Russian .
And now this watermelon seller , and former student from Guinea Bissau , is attempting to become the first black man ever to be elected to public office in Russia .
At first people thought I was joking .
They asked me if I was doing this to promote my business .
But now I am a registered candidate they take me more seriously
Joachim Crima Mr Crima has become an overnight media sensation here .
On the day I visited him in his home town Srednyaya Akhtuba in southern Russia , two other TV crews were with him .
The next day two more were due in town .
The country 's newspapers have dubbed him Russia 's Barack Obama .
The implication is that Russians could be ready to elect a black man , even if it is only for a local county council .
Mr Crima 's optimism and exuberance are infectious .
As I followed him around the local market you could see people warming to him .
Even the dour country folk found it hard to resist his warm smile and open hand as , in lilting Russian , he joked and bantered with the stall holders .
" Good for you , " said one tall man leaning against his Lada car " we need new leaders in this place " .
Battle ahead " At first people thought I was joking , " Mr Crima told me .
" They asked me if I was doing this to promote my business .
But now I am a registered candidate they take me more seriously . "
A neo -Nazi movement has grown among Russia 's disillusioned youth
And he is optimistic that he can win : " There is a chance of winning because I see the way people react to me , " he told me .
But to do so Mr Crima has a massive mountain to climb .
In his election slogan " I will work like a negro for Russia " Mr Crima adopts a word commonly used a racial slur .
It is an acknowledgement of what everyone here knows , that racial prejudice in Russia is as common as Ladas are .
Some have even joked that his election slogan should be changed to " No we can't " .
It was all supposed to be very different .
The Soviet Union touted itself as a friend of Africa - hundreds of thousands of African students were encouraged to come here to study , and thousands still do every year .
But since the collapse of the Soviet Union , attitudes to immigrants have soured , and a vicious neo -Nazi movement has grown among Russia 's disillusioned youth .
Now Africans living in Russia 's big cities , which include refugees fleeing war and economic migrants looking for a better life , live in constant fear of being attacked .
Bodyguard
In Moscow I met a Nigerian man who had fallen victim to such an attack .
As he was being examined by an American doctor I could see a series of huge grey scars running down his side and across his back , the result of a brutal knife and gun assault two months ago .
" I was on the phone to my girlfriend when they jumped on me and stabbed me in the back , " he told me .
" I was stabbed through the side , and then I heard a gunshot and that prompted me to run . "
Being attacked has left this man regretting his decision to go to Russia
He was lucky to be found and taken to hospital , but the attack has left him in deep despair .
" We Africans in Moscow live in fear and pain , " he told me .
" Coming to Russia was the worst decision of my life ... the worst mistake of my life . "
Sadly he is not alone .
Recent research by the Moscow Protestant Chaplaincy suggests nearly 60 % of Africans living in Moscow have been physically assaulted .
It is hard to believe , but this is actually an improvement on 10 years ago .
Back then the idea of a black man standing for election in Russia would have been unthinkable .
" Sooner or later things will improve in Russia , " Mr Crima told me .
" I am now a pioneer on this evolutionary path .
There will come a time when the racists may even stand before me and say thank you for what I have done . "
In the meantime Mr Crima is not taking any chances - as he walks the streets of his home town touting for votes his bodyguard , a huge kick - boxer with vicious looking tattoos on his arms , is never far from his side .

I believe the brain trust behind the Obama White House has made a huge tactical error .
As Rahm Emmanuel likes to say , one should “ never waste a crisis ” — and the White House has done just that .
There was a narrow window to effect a full regulatory reform of Wall Street , the Banking Industry and other causes of the collapse .
Instead , the White House tacked in a different direction , pursuing health care reform .
This was an enormous miscalculation .
I ’m not sure who to blame , but the leading suspects ( in order ) are Larry Summers , Rahm Emmanuel , Tim Geithner , and ( perhaps ) David Axelrod .
Instead of a populist clean up of The Street ( ala Eliot Spitzer circa 2,000 ) , Obama advisors allowed a smoldering resentment to take hold and build amongst the electorate .
The massive taxpayer wealth transfer to inept , corrupt , incompetent bankers has created huge resentment amongst the populace — regardless of political affiliation .
There was widespread popular support for a full reform of finance .
What the White House should have pursued was : 1 ) Reinstatement of Glass Steagall ; 2 ) Repeal the Commodity Futures Modernization Act ; 3 ) Overturning SEC Bear Stearn exemption allowing 5 biggest firms to leverage up far beyond 12 to one ; 4 ) Regulating the non bank sub - prime lenders ;
5 ) Continuing high risk trades to be compensated regardless of profitibility ; 6 ) Mandating ( and enforcing ) lending standards , etc .
All of this could have been accomplished in the first 6 months of the Obama administration .
The consumer protection stuff could have been tossed in as well , though it was not the cause of the collapse .
What we got instead , was the usual lobbying efforts by the finance industry .
They own Congress , lock stock and barrel , and they throttled Financial Reform .
It did not help that the Obama economic team is filled with defenders of the Status Quo — primarily Summers , but it appears Geithner also — the dynamic duo that fiddled while the economy burned .
Such dithering can be fatal to an administration .
This was a colossal blunder .
Passing reform legislation successfully would have fulfilled the campaign promise of “ Change ; ” it would have created legislative momentum .
It could have provided a healthy outlet for the Tea Party anger and the raucous Town Hall meetings .
It might have even led to a “ throw the Bums out ” attitude in the mid-term elections , forcing the most radical de-regulators from office .
Also wasted :
The enormous anti-Bush attitude throughout the country that swept team Obama into office .
He should have been “ Hooverized , ” and O should have tapped into that same wave to force the greatest set of Wall Street and Banking regulatory reforms seen since the 1930s .
Instead , we have a White House that appears adrift , and the most importantly , may very well have missed the best chance to clean up Wall Street in five generations .
Never waste a crisis , indeed . . .

“ Little difference ” between Obama , Bush in substance
Noam Chomsky interviewed by Richard Hall
The Daily Star , June 24 , 2009
Q : Do you see any difference between the policies of former US President George W. Bush and his successor Barack Obama regarding the Israeli - Palestinian conflict ?
A : In substance , there is little difference .
Obama has reiterated Bush ’s positions , in virtually the same words .
Like Bush , he has called for a “ Palestinian state , ” and like Bush , he leaves what he means entirely vague .
It can easily be interpreted to be the same as Netanyahu ’s position in 1996 , when he became the first Israeli prime minister to countenance the establishment of a Palestinian state , a fact that seems to be forgotten .
Shimon Peres had just left office declaring forcefully that there would never be a Palestinian state .
Netanyahu ’s information minister , when asked whether he would adopt the same policy , answered that if Palestinians wanted to call the fragments left to them “ a state , ” that was fine :
Or they could call them “ fried chicken . ”
We do not know whether Obama means “ fried chicken . ”
We do know that he very carefully evaded the core of the Arab Peace Initiative that he praised .
He called on the Arab states to proceed to normalize relations with Israel .
But he scrupulously omitted the fact , which he surely knew , that this step was conditional on acceptance of the long - standing international consensus on a two - state settlement that the US and Israel have blocked for 35 years , with rare and temporary departures from this stern rejectionism — not just in words , but more importantly in deeds .
On settlements , Obama avoided any mention of existing settlements , and repeated the words of the “ road map ” on expanding settlements .
He also made it clear he would not follow the precedent of George Bush senior , and impose a slight penalty on Israeli expansion of settlements .
Rather , he said , his steps would be only “ symbolic . ”
Q : Do Obama ’s recent overtures to the Muslim world signify a different US approach to the Middle East ?
A : The rhetoric is different .
On substance , there is little that is new .
Obama has cultivated a style of presenting himself as engaging and friendly , and as a blank slate , on which his audience can write their hopes and wishes , believing , if they choose , that he is “ on our side . ”
The same is true on the domestic scene .
Q : Does Israel ’s refusal to halt settlements risk damaging relations between it and the US ?
A : There is always a risk , and as I mentioned , for a brief period under Bush senior , Washington imposed a slight penalty .
What will happen now , we can not be sure .
Israel has just exploited the focus of attention on Iran to announce substantial settlement expansion , so far eliciting no response in Washington .
And it may be noted that Obama is implementing an increase in military aid to Israel for an unprecedented 10 years into the future .
Also of significance is the rapid expansion of US hi-tech investment in Israel , notably a huge Intel plant intended to carry out a revolution in chip manufacture .
There is , typically , a close relation between government and corporate policy , for obvious reasons , and there are other close ties , particularly military and intelligence , that are well - known and stable .
Q : How will the decision taken by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to form a government without Hamas affect the peace process ?
A : Whether one likes it or not , Hamas won a free election in January 2006 .
Israel and the US ( with the EU tailing behind politely ) reacted instantly by harsh punishment of the population for this transgression .
Those familiar with modern history should have been aware that there is nothing at all surprising about this reaction , or about the unwillingness of the intellectual classes to face what it indicates about the fashionable concept “ democracy promotion . ”
Later Israel imprisoned much of the elected government .
Israel and the US then instigated a Fatah military coup to overturn the government .
When this failed , punishment of the population became more severe .
Meanwhile US - backed Israeli programs are crushing Gazans and expanding Israeli control over the West Bank .
The US and Israel , meanwhile , continue to reject the long - standing consensus on a two - state settlement .
What exactly do we mean by the phrase “ peace process ” under these circumstances ?
Q : The right of return for Palestinian refugees has been a barrier to previous peace negotiations .
Do you think it will be again ?
A : Not really .
It is useful to consider the one break in US - Israeli rejectionism : January 2001 , Bill Clinton ’s final month in office .
By late 2000 , Clinton realized that his proposals at the failed Camp David conference could not be accepted by any Palestinians .
In December , he proposed his “ parameters ” : imprecise , but more forthcoming .
He then announced that both sides had accepted the parameters , and both had reservations .
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met in Taba to deal with their differences , and came very close to a final settlement , more or less in line with the international consensus .
In their final news conference , they reported that with a few more days , they might reach a complete agreement , but Israel called off the negotiations prematurely , and they never continued formally — informal talks led to the Geneva Accord of December 2003 .
There is extensive evidence available in Hebrew and English sources .
The Taba negotiations and the Geneva Accord reached essentially the same formula : Israel should recognize the right of return , but Palestinians should recognize that it will not be implemented within Israel except in small numbers , and refugees would have to be absorbed in the Palestinian state or elsewhere .
One may argue that that outcome is unjust , but in the real world , it is the most that can be attained .
To dangle vain hopes before the eyes of miserable refugees is hardly a moral stance , in my opinion .
Q : Is an attack by Israel on Iran a likely scenario ?
A : No one knows .
The Bush administration made it quite clear that it opposed an attack .
During the 2008 presidential campaign — the most sensitive period in domestic politics — the Israel lobby pressured Congress to pass a resolution that amounted to a blockade against Iran , an act of war .
They had lined up many supporters , but the effort suddenly ended , presumably because the Bush White House indicated it was opposed .
I presume Obama is continuing this policy .
It is I suppose technically possible for Israel to attack Iran , possibly using submarines armed with nuclear missiles .
The consequences could be very severe , in many domains .
We might also recall that Israel ’s attack on the Osirak reactor in Iraq in 1981 initiated Saddam Hussein ’s nuclear - weapons program .
That was reasonably clear from physical inspection at once , later confirmed by defectors , and more recently by high - level US intelligence .
M.C. Escher 's four circle limit drawings :
Circle limit 1
Circle limit 2
Circle limit 3
Circle limit 4
Here is what M.C. Escher wrote to his son Arthur in 1960 ( speaking about Circle limit 3 ) :
" Ik heb mij rot gewerkt om eindelijk die litho af te maken en vervolgens , de tanden op elkaar , vier dagen lang nog eens negen mooie afdrukken van die hoogst bewerkelijke cirkellimiet - in - kleuren gemaakt .
Elke druk bestaat uit een serie van twintig maal afdrukken : vijf planken , elke plank vier keer .
Dit alles met het werkwaardige gevoel dat dit werkstuk een mijlpaal in mijn ontwikkeling betekent en dat er nooit iemand zal zijn , behalve ikzelf , die dat zal inzien . "
( " I worked terribly hard to finally finish that litho , and then with gritted teeth , spent another four days making beautiful prints of that extremely complex circle limit in colors .
Each print is a series of twenty printings : five pieces , and each piece four times .
All this with the remarkable feeling that this work is a milestone in my development , and that nobody , except myself , will ever realize this . " )
( From : De magie van M.C. Escher .
Taschen Uitgeverij , Keulen 2003 )
He was wrong when he said that nobody would realize the importance of these works , but he was certainly right in saying that the creation of such drawings by hand is extremely difficult and tiresome , much more so than plane ( Euclidian ) tilings .
M.C. Escher made over a hundred such tilings , and something that he most probably never knew is that some of them ( not all ) can be transformed to hyperbolic , " circle limit " , tilings with the help of a computer .
The images below were created starting from relatively low resolution images of original Escher prints , and are therefore not perfect .
In some cases the lines where the basic tile was cut can clearly be seen .
Where this is the case , it is due in part to the quality of the original image file , and in part to some inaccuracy both on my part and on M.C. Escher 's part .
It is an open question how M.C. Escher 's work would have been influenced had computers been available in his lifetime .

2010 Kia Soul
If you are looking for a car with adequate cargo room and great entry - exit facilities , then this is quite the right choice for you .
There is great dexterity and maneuvering ease coming with the Kia Soul .
But the car could also pose some problems with its quietness and acceleration qualities .
This is a subcompact car from Korean automaker .
It works on a front - wheel drive and has a 4 - wagon door .
It is slightly bigger in size compared to the Kia Rio .
It has 4 level trims that come in layers of Soul , Soul , Soul ! and Soul sport .
The base model is empowered by a 122 hp with 1.6 liter 4 - cylinder engine .
This works on a 5 speed manual as well that is full of safe and keen features .
It has got power windows , locks , standard modes of security and is an essential part of fuel economy facility .
The Bluetooth phone system lets you use the voice integration dial up through the recognition facility .
The audio system is also great for giving you clarity .
The interior lights are really interesting with speakers and the 4 - speed automatic option is quite old fashioned .
There is not an option for navigation here .
The drive may be a bit unimpressive to some but then the 2010 Kia Soul Exclaim has a lot to offer on the practical front .
There cool exterior and spacious interior are good enough places to start with its appreciation .
The stereo system is also something to be reckoned with which would be a pleasure for anyone .

The iPod port is quite at the base but this works its charm like magic .
This will also remind you of the previous Genesis coupe model or even some Hyundai models .
The monochrome screen has excellent radio buttons as well as a space for your CD player to be tucked in .
The menu on the iPod list can be easily interacted with and played over sorting the different genres on the select item .
The interface has always been working with a push button with even the dial browse to be worked with the music .
The auxiliary input for the iPod base is also applicable for any audio source .
The USB port can also track down the MP3 tracks with just a push of the thumb drive .
This player can be tracked with MP3 songs as well .
There is also the provision for satellite radio as well as the rounding of audio sources .
Though some might be disappointed with only the rear seat speakers producing the great sound but then the pulse modes and other assorted ways of control can increase the intensity of the music playing .
Kia also has a great sound control system that makes it one of the most essential items in the whole technological range .
I have practiced civil trial law for 30 years , primarily in the areas of catastrophic personal injury and death cases with an emphasis on transportation and consumer products liability and premises liability .
I have practiced before state and federal courts in 30 states and in the District of Columbia .
In the course of my career , I have become experienced in all facets of case evaluation and investigation and trial preparation and practice .
My work in complex injury and death cases has also given me a great deal of multi-disciplinary experience in the fields of insurance , engineering , physics , failure analysis , accident reconstruction , fire science , premises security , food safety , economics , psychology , medicine , epidemiology , life care planning , and rehabilitation among others .
I am now looking forward to transitioning my career from full time trial practice into areas where I can effectively share my substantial body of trial experience and knowledge to help other lawyers and their clients bring their cases to successful resolution , through mediation / arbitration expert witness services and liability prevention counseling .
Oldest map in western Europe found engraved on 14,000 - year - old chunk of rock
We all rely on maps , be they the sat nav in your car or a traditional A - Z , and archaeologists have found our ancient ancestors were no different .
They have unearthed what they believe to be the oldest map in Western Europe , in a Spanish cave steeped in legend .
The complex etchings were engraved on a hand - sized rock 13,660 years ago , probably by Magdalenian hunter - gatherers .
The Journal of Human Evolution has released pictures of what Spanish scientists say is a map etched in stone dating back some 13,660 years
A team led by Pilar Utrilla from the University of Zaragoza in Spain , discovered the rock in 1994 but it has taken them 15 years to disentangle the mess of etched lines .
They appear to show a prominent peak nearby as well as rivers , ponds and scrubland .
There are also recognisable sketches of animals including reindeer , a stag and some ibex .
' All of these engravings could be a sketch or a simple map of the area around the cave .
It could represent the plan for a coming hunt or perhaps a narrative story of one that had already happened , ' they wrote in the Journal of Human Evolution .
They discovered the sandstone rock in the cave of Abauntz Lamizulo , which was traditionally thought to be the home of the ' lamias ' or mythological bird - footed nymphs .
It would have been a strategic position for ancient hunters , as it dominates the canyon beneath , where animals would have grazed in the valley .
' The engraving seems to reproduce the meandering course of a river crossing the upper part of side A of the block , joined by two tributaries near two mountains , ' they wrote .
' One of these is identical to the mountain that can be seen from the cave ( San Gregorio ) , with herds of ibex depicted on its hillsides , on both sides of the gorge in front of which the cave of Abauntz is strategically located . '
The complex carvings were found on a small rock just a few inches across , and it took scientists 15 years to unravel the complex lines ( see below )
The team speculated that circles represented flat zones which flooded with water .
The study has excited prehistoric archaeologists such as Lawrence Straus from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque .
' This is a pretty spectacular find , ' he told the New Scientist .
' It may give us a glimpse into the ways in which people navigated and explained their territories . '
The slab was etched at a time of great activity in the Navarre region of Spain .
Humans were pushing northwards and having to co-operate and perhaps divide up land , following the ice age just 3,000 years before .
This would give maps great importance .
' They had to live by their wits and what the landscape provided , ' Strauss said .
However , other experts disagree with the map interpretation .
Jill Cook , head of the prehistory division at the British Museum said it was a ' brave ' theory but it was unlikely hunters would need maps during this period .
' Multiple lines positioned over animal figures is not unusual in slabs of this period , ' she told the New Scientist .
' We have n't traditionally considered them to be maps .
Their intimacy and knowledge of the landscape , including the location of individual trees and plants , would be such that maps would be less vital to them . '
Only one older map has been found in Europe in Pavlov in the Czech Republic .
This 25,000 - year - old rock depicts a mountain , river and valleys from the region .
It was not until 600 BC that the first known city map was drawn of Babylon on clay .
It was found in Sippar , southern Iraq .

We have n't made nearly the progress we like to think
Iran is only a microcosm .
Whatever happens now within that particular troubled country , the underlying problems and divisions will remain genuinely global .
Revolution , despotism , war , and terrorism are always generic issues in world politics .
In the end , they will therefore need to be understood and confronted at a broadly international level .
" The blood - dimmed tide is loosed , " observed the Irish poet William Butler Yeats , and " everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned . "
Today 's dramatic Iranian instability is more a specific symptom of general civilizational fragility than an isolated disease .
Beneath the surface , all world politics readily reveals a distinctly common disorder .
This is the incapacity of human beings to find both meaning and identity as individuals , within themselves .
Iran is only a microcosm
From the beginning , all world affairs have been driven by some form or other of " tribal " conflict , by incessant struggles between groups .
Without a clear and persisting sense of an outsider , of an enemy , of an " other , " most people feel lost in the world .
Drawing self - worth from our membership in the state or the faith or the race -- from what Freud had insightfully called the " primal horde " -- we humans still cannot satisfy the most minimal requirements of interpersonal coexistence .
Every sham may have a patina .
Our very obvious progress in the technical and scientific realms still has no counterpart in basic human relations .
Yes , we can manufacture jet aircraft and send astronauts into space and even communicate by Twitter , but before we are allowed to board commercial airline flights we must first take off our shoes .
The point of such removal is not to enhance our comfort , but simply to ensure that we wo n't blow up the plane .
Iran is only a microcosm .
We humans want to be upbeat about the whole world .
We are turned off by anyone who speaks candidly about life 's day - to - day vagaries or its manifestly absent ecstasies .
Whenever a friend or colleague is asked , " How are you ? " the answer must always be the same : " I 'm great . "
In fact , there remain great pain and loneliness throughout the world .
Further , in certain matters , nothing important ever really changes .
Indeed , in the truly critical issues of mega- survival , we humans may now be living far more precariously than ever before .
Iran is only a microcosm .
The veneer of human civilization is still razor thin .
However conversant with statistics and science , entire nations can still glance smugly over mountains of fresh corpses , and announce without apology that " progress " is underway and that " life is good . "
Everywhere , it seems , all of our assorted mass societies greedily suck out the very marrow of human wisdom , reverence , and compassion in a deeply misguided dash to " power . "
Hope exists , to be sure , but it must now sing softly , in an undertone .
The " blood - dimmed tide " creates a deafening noise , but it is still possible to listen for transient sounds of grace and harmony .
We must all quickly learn to pay very close attention to our most intimate human feelings of empathy , anxiety , restlessness , and desperation .
These feelings are always determinative , and always universal .
Life on earth must ultimately be about the individual
In essence , the time for " modernization , " " globalization , " " artificial intelligence , " and " new information methodologies " is over .
To survive together , all must first learn to rediscover an authentic human life that is detached from meaningless and corrosive distinctions ( " us " and " them " ) , banal conformance , shallow optimism , and contrived happiness .
Only in this vital expression of an awakened human spirit may we finally learn that agony is more important than astronomy , that cries of despair are more serious than the disembodied powers of technology , and that our tears have a much greater significance than robotic smiles .
" The man who laughs , " commented the poet Bertolt Brecht , " has simply not yet heard the horrible news . "
Iran is only a microcosm .
The true instabilities of life on earth can never be undone by improving global economics , by building larger missiles , by fashioning new international treaties , by spreading democracy , or even by periodic revolutions .
We interrelated humans -- all of us -- still lack a tolerable future not because we have been too slow to learn , but because we have stubbornly failed to learn what is truly important .
Louis René Beres is professor of international law at Purdue University .
Born in Switzerland at the end of World War II , he is the author of many books and articles dealing with world politics , law , literature , and philosophy .
Iran Elections
Missing Our Moment in Iran

Iran Election Tweets & Twitters
In a Revolution
by Mary Kate Cary
It was a battle to show who could best harness the only real news source on the ground -- the new social media -- to report fast , accurate , and insightful information .
Cable and network news lost both the battle and the war .
Two of the journalists who won were Andrew Sullivan and Nico Pitney .
Sullivan and Pitney looked at the gold mine of information sitting on the new social media platforms and , with two staffers , jumped in .
Sullivan and staff cut and pasted the most interesting , useful , and profound tweets into a document he called " Live - Tweeting the Revolution , " updated every few minutes .
Iranian Protests a Direct Challenge to Khamenei
by Anna Mulrine
" Flexing muscle on the streets after the election is not right , " warned Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , in the days before the bloodshed .
" If they do n't stop , the consequences of the chaos would be their responsibility . "
Those consequences included casualties that resulted from the worst upheaval in Tehran in 30 years , as well as mass arrests last week , with more than 600 protesters jailed ...

This way , you can easily access your data through your Google account .
Backup Photos to the Cloud
If you happen to be using Android 2.2 or higher , you can easily backup all your photos and videos thanks to Google ’s Instant Upload service .
All photos and videos will automatically upload to a private folder on your Google + profile .
Step 1 : Enable Autobackup on Google +
Go to Google + > Settings > Camera & Photos .
Click on Enable Autobackup and move the slider on the upper right hand corner to ON .
Step 2 : Manage Autobackup Settings
In the Autobackup menu , you can choose how you want your device to backup your photos .
You can choose
While charging only and , if you have n’t backed up your data yet , you can choose to back everything up immediately .
Backup to Your Computer
If you want to make sure that the most important items on your device are doubly protected ( like pictures and videos ) you can always backup this data to your PC as well as the Cloud .
You can move over all items saved on your SD card to your computer .
Step 1 : Connect Your Device to Your Computer
Connect your Android device to your computer with a USB cord and it will then show up on your computer as an external drive .

Step 2 : Navigate to Appropriate Folder
Go to your device hard drive from your computer and find the appropriate folder .
You can browse the different folders and find the items that you want .
Step 3 : Move Files to Your Computer Hard Drive
Once you have found the files that you want to save , simply drag and drop them to your hard drive .
This will make a copy of them to your computer .
Backup to SD Card
Many Android devices come with an internal SD card or an expandable microSD slot .
Images and videos are automatically stored on this device , but you can move over select apps and contacts over to the SD card .
Export Contacts to SD card
Although Google will automatically save all of your contacts to the cloud if you choose to backup all of your data , you might have peace of mind saving the contacts to your SD card as well .
It ’s a simple process and only takes a couple seconds .
Step 1 : Go to your contacts menu
Find your contacts app and then go to menu .

There are plenty of ways to backup your data and they all only take a couple minutes of your time .
The next time you drop your Android device without bricking it , be sure that you have all of your data backed up just in case the next time you are n’t so lucky .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The discovery of immune system particles that attack the AIDS virus may finally open a way to make a vaccine that could protect people against the deadly and incurable infection , U.S. researchers said on Thursday .
The first new HIV antibodies to have been identified in more than 10 years , PG9 and PG16 , are seen in an image released by The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , California .
REUTERS / Handout
They used new technology to troll through the blood of 1,800 people infected with the AIDS virus and identified two immune system compounds called antibodies that could neutralize the virus .
And they found a new part of the virus that the antibodies attack , offering a new way to design a vaccine , they reported in the journal Science .
“ So now we may have a better chance of designing a vaccine that will elicit such broadly neutralizing antibodies , which we think are key to successful vaccine development , ” said Dennis Burton of The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , California , who led the study .
“ The findings themselves are an exciting advance toward the goal of an effective AIDS vaccine because now we ’ve got a new , potentially better target on HIV to focus our efforts for vaccine design , ” added Wayne Koff of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative , or IAVI , which sponsored the study .
Since the AIDS pandemic started in the early 1980s , more than 25 million people globally have died from the virus .
The World Health Organization estimates that 33 million are currently infected .
There is no cure , although a cocktail of drugs can help keep the virus under control .
Efforts to make a vaccine have failed almost completely .
MUTABLE VIRUS
Part of this is because the virus mutates so much that any one person is infected with millions of different versions , each one appearing different to the immune system .
In addition , the virus infects the very immune cells that are supposed to help protect the body .
And if even one virus gets past the immune defense , it appears to set up a lifelong infection .
No drug has been able to eradicate it .
IAVI director Dr. Seth Berkley said the findings will not lead directly to a vaccine , but show that there are new and better ways to design one .
He said 10 percent of the patients whose blood was screened had a strong antibody response to the virus .
“ We have people with even more potent serum out there .
We will probably see more , ” he said in a telephone interview .
It may also be possible to use such antibodies as therapy themselves -- such as the gamma globulin used for hepatitis virus .
But the eventual goal , Berkley said , is a vaccine that produces antibodies that could stop the virus from ever infecting a person in the first place .
“ We have n’t been able to do that because we have n’t been able to find the right kind of response , ” Berkley said .
Most vaccines elicit an antibody response , priming the body to make antibodies that will recognize and attack an invader such as a bacteria or virus .
The two antibodies , called PG9 and PG16 , are the first new HIV antibodies to have been identified in more than 10 years .
They target a region of the spike the virus uses to infect cells , the researchers wrote .
A team at South San Francisco - based Monogram Biosciences Inc screened the blood for the ability to neutralize HIV .
Theraclone Sciences used its technology to identify the antibodies involved .
North Carolina - based Laboratory Corp of America Holdings acquired Monogram in July .

GUY CHOKES OUT HIS OPPONENT WITH RARE NAKED CHOKE IN STREET FIGHT , THEN STAYS AT THE SCENE TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS OPPONENT IS OK .
Going by the findings of a new research , published in the most recent issue of the journal Pediatrics , there has been a noteworthy rise in the number of children with autism - while the 13 - year back figures showed that one in 2,500 children had autism , the 2009 figures revealed a rather disquieting situation of one in 91 children being autistic .
Commenting the figures pertaining to autistic children , the Hope Academy founders , Susan Sachs and Lisa Lane , remarked " We 've seen a dramatic increase in children coming to us for services .
Five years ago , the waiting list was 20 children .
It 's about 85 or 90 now . "
According to experts , people suffering from Autistic Disorder , which is also referred to as Classic Autism , exhibit considerable delays in learning verbal and non-verbal language .
Such individuals show notable shortfalls in terms of social skills and mostly display unusual behaviors , like repetitive actions .
Referring to the staggering increase in the number of autistic children , Kathi Lacy , associate director of policy for the state Department of Disabilities and Special Needs , said that not only has the awareness about autism increased over the years , but there has also been an expansion of the sphere pertaining to " what counts as autism . "
Citing the example of Asperger 's Syndrome , Lacy said that such disorders also fall in the autism category , thereby accounting for some part of the increase in the autism numbers .
Net Neutrality Gets Boost From Key Congressman
Efforts to prevent network operators from blocking or slowing Internet traffic got a boost Thursday morning from Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee , who said he would co-sign a bill that would codify net neutrality .
During a subcommitee oversight hearing on the Federal Communications Commission , Waxman said :
" Industry will benefit from clarity , consistency , and predictability with regard to Net neutrality , " Waxman said at the hearing .
" I think that the time is right to formally establish , through legislation if required , the rules of the road with respect to Net neutrality . "
Waxman said he would sign onto a bill cosponsored by Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D - Mass . ) and Anna G. Eshoo ( D - Calif. ) that would prevent telecom and cable operators from blocking , slowing or charging more for certain traffic to run on their networks .
Public interest groups blasted off press releases minutes after his remarks hailing Waxman for his supportive comments during the otherwise tame hearing .
Still , telecom and cable industry watchers say any action on net neutrality would likely come in the form of new rules from the Federal Communications Commission .
There has been talk of an additional rule to its four principles on how network operators can manage their networks .
With a wireless competition review underway , industry insiders are also speculating whether the FCC may introduce new net neutrality rules for the wireless industry .

Advertisement A tsunami triggered by a strong quake in the South Pacific has killed more than 100 people in several islands .
At least 77 people were reported dead in Samoa , more than 25 in American Samoa and at least six in Tonga .
Residents and tourists fled to higher ground as whole villages were destroyed .
Boats were swept inland and cars and people out to sea .
The 8.3 - magnitude quake struck at 1748 GMT on Tuesday , generating 15 ft ( 4.5 m ) waves in some areas of the islands .
The Samoa islands comprise two separate entities - the nation of Samoa and American Samoa , a US territory .
The total population is about 250,000 .
A general tsunami warning was issued for the wider South Pacific region but was cancelled a few hours later .
Each and every family is going to be affected by someone who 's lost their life

On air when tsunami hit In pictures : Pacific tsunami Tsunami alerts warn islanders Samoa 's vulnerable islands Separately on Wednesday a 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck a different fault line off the Indonesian island of Sumatra , killing at least 75 people .
The prime minister of Samoa , Tuila 'epe Sailele Malielegaoi , said the latest death toll there was 77 , including four overseas visitors , with 150 more people being treated in hospital .
He said he was shocked at the devastation .
" So much has gone .
So many people are gone , " he told Australia 's AAP news agency .
He said there had been extensive damage but that hospitals were coping well and that he was considering aid offers from New Zealand and Australia .
" Had it happened in darkness , there could have been more disaster in terms of the number of those who died or are missing , " he said .
US President Barack Obama has declared a major disaster in American Samoa , enabling federal funding to be made available to help victims .
He pledged a " swift and aggressive " government response .
False alarm American Samoa Governor Togiola Tulafono said the effects of the tsunami would touch everyone .

" I do n't think anybody is going to be spared in this disaster , " he said .
Eni Faleomavaega , who represents American Samoa in the US Congress , said the waves had " literally wiped out all the low - lying areas in the Samoan islands " .
He said the tsunami had struck too quickly for a full evacuation .
Samoa 's Deputy Prime Minister Misa Telefoni told AAP that the ocean had receded , heralding the oncoming tsunami , " within five minutes " of the quake .
" With the location and the intensity ...
I do n't know if anything better could have been done . "
Officials at the Samoa Meteorology Division said many of those who died were killed by a second wave after they went to gather fish that had been washed up after the first .
There 's not a building standing ...
There will be people in a great lot of need around here
Graeme Ansell , eyewitness
UK toddler feared dead Animated guide : Tsunamis Sirens reportedly blared out across the Samoan capital , Apia , again late on Tuesday but the warning was thought to be a false alarm .
Dr Lemalu Fiu , at a hospital in Apia , said the number of casualties was expected to rise as people arrived from coastal areas bringing reports .
Mr Telefoni said there were fears the major tourism areas on the west side of Upolu island - the eastern of the two main Samoan islands - had been badly hit .
" We 've had a pretty grim picture painted of all that coast , " he said .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd confirmed the death of two Australians - a six - year - old girl and a 50 - year - old woman .
Samoan officials say it could take a week before the full extent of the damage is known .
Homes gone A government official in Tonga said at least six people had been killed there and four more were missing .
High waves damaged property and swept cars out to sea But New Zealand 's acting Prime Minister Bill English said Tongan officials had told him a " considerable number of people " had been swept out to sea .
Mr English added : " Over the next 12 hours the picture could look worse rather than better . "
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre ( PTWC ) said the quake struck at a depth of 33 km ( 20 miles ) , some 190 km ( 120 miles ) from Apia .
Radio New Zealand quoted Samoan residents as saying that villages were inundated and homes and cars swept away .
Graeme Ansell , a New Zealander near Apia , told the radio station the beach village of Sau Sau Beach Fale had been " wiped out " .
" There 's not a building standing .
We 've all clambered up hills , and one of our party has a broken leg .
There will be people in a great lot of need around here , " he said .
Witnesses have reported scenes of destruction .
" It 's horrible ...
The village is gone and my once beautiful beachfront villa has now been submerged in water , " Josh Nayangu told the BBC after fleeing the area on a small fishing boat with his wife and son .

The French Football Federation has allocated just 10 % of the tickets for the second leg of the upcoming World Cup play - off to Irish fans .
A total of 8,000 tickets will be sold through the FAI for the match at the 80,000 - seater Stade de France .
The FFF has also decided that the 72,000 tickets available to French fans will be sold through retail outlets and not over the Internet .
The policy would appear to be an attempt to prevent the situation that arose during the World Cup qualifiers in 2004 , when 30,000 Irish fans managed to get tickets for the game against France in Paris .
The Irish fans drowned out the home support during the game , which ended in a 0 - 0 draw .

The six had hung banners with pro-democracy slogans
A court in Vietnam has sentenced six democracy activists to up to six years in prison for " spreading propaganda " against the government .
The six men are the latest to be tried in a clampdown that has seen dozens investigated or arrested for alleged anti-government activities .
Earlier this week , three people were sentenced to three to four years in jail for propaganda against the state .
Other well - known dissidents , including lawyer Le Cong Dinh , await trial .
The two - day trial of Nguyen Xuan Nghia , Nguyen Van Tinh , Nguyen Kim Nhan , Nguyen Van Tuc , Ngo Quynh and Nguyen Manh Son took place in the northern port city of Haiphong amid tight security .
They were accused of hanging political banners , distributing leaflets and disseminating anti-government materials via the internet .
Their banners bore pro-democracy slogans and were hung in August last year over a bridge on the Hanoi - Haiphong highway .
All of them were arrested in September 2008 .
' Reactionary sources '
The men were also accused of being associated with Bloc 8406 , a pro-democracy network inside Vietnam .
The prosecutors said their actions were " harmful to national security " .
Vietnam 's Communist Party recently celebrated its 64th year in power
Their sentences ranged from two to six years in prison .
Writer Nguyen Xuan Nghia , 60 , considered the leader of the group , received the harshest sentence : six years in prison plus four years of house arrest .
He was accused of receiving money from " reactionary sources overseas " to " organise anti-government activities " .
Only his wife , Nguyen Thi Nga , was allowed inside the courtroom to witness the trial .
She told BBC she was " outraged " by the verdict .
" This is cruel and totally ridiculous .
My husband is an innocent man and he only wrote the truth , " she said .
Families of the accused said they would appeal against the sentences .
Observers say Vietnam is tightening up security ahead of the next Communist Party congress , to be held in early 2011 .
At last count , the bills I racked up for two years of heavy - duty medical care ( hospitalization , surgery , nursing , drugs ) came to $ 2 million .
If it were n’t for Medicare , my life would only have been saved at the cost of bankrupting my family .
As it turned out , Medicare , with a reasonably priced supplementary insurance policy , has paid all the costs except for a modest co-pay for pharmaceuticals .
What a relief that I did n’t have to worry about the financial side of my illness or fear that my coverage would max out or that my deductibles would be overwhelming .
I ’m sure the healthcare providers involved in my case would have liked Medicare to pay them more ; the system cuts back on some bills severely -- and in some cases , I think , unfairly .
( Those who save our lives ought to be paid more than mediocre basketball players . )
But I never heard a gripe from anybody along the way .
I ’m sure they knew that without Medicare they ’d be collecting practically nothing from me .
Either that or I ’d have to perish without paying anyone a cent .
That was the situation before Medicare was established in 1965 .
No insurance company would sell a policy to anyone over 65 .
Seniors simply were n’t part of the healthcare marketplace .

Liberal defenders of President Obama ’s campaign for healthcare reform have tried to allay the fear that the “ public option ” is a scary government “ takeover ” of the health insurance industry by citing Medicare as a benign example of a government - funded and administered program .
One might have hoped that was common knowledge , but apparently even among those on Medicare , there are many who have no idea who ’s paying for their healthcare .
Do they think there is a company called Medicare Inc. that has bestowed affordable healthcare on them as an act of charity ?
Angry seniors rail against the government , but they cling to their Medicare with no fear that it will hire “ death panels ” to kill them off .
Even when it is called to their attention that Medicare is a socialistic program , that fact fails to tar it as a nefarious liberal plot .
So why has it not occurred to the champions of reform that instead of telling people that the public option is “ like Medicare , ” we might simply let the public option be Medicare ?
That would reduce all the complexities to one clear - cut public - option solution : Amend Medicare so that it will be available to everyone regardless of age .

Since 1951 , the self - employed have been able to buy into Social Security ; currently about 9 million of them are in the system .
Why not remove the age restriction on Medicare and let everybody buy in who wants to buy in ?
Medicare provides a very elusive target for right - wing vilification or for those who seek to make reform look so complex that we must wait an additional 20 years to change the system .
It is a time - tested program that people know and trust .
It has an exemplary track record for low - overhead administration .
Medicare is already the most successful cost - control program we have , and it can be made more effective still .
( There are estimates that fraud in the system costs over $ 60 billion a year -- a serious but fixable flaw that accounts for enough money to keep the system solvent . )
Above all , it ’s here .
Its administrative procedures and personnel are in place .
Unlike health co-ops -- which remain a mystery to most of us -- Medicare needs only to be expanded , which has to be cheaper than starting from square one .
Neither the president nor Congress has done a good job of defining a public option .
How exactly will it be financed ?
What will it cost ?
What coverage will it offer ?
Who will run it ?
With Medicare , we already have answers to these questions .
If you ’re under 65 and want the Medicare option , you would have to pay a designated premium , which would have to be high enough to cover the costs of the expanded coverage .
But it is bound to be lower than any private plan .
( Seniors would still be covered , without paying a premium , as they are now . )
Advertisement
Those who join up would find that , unlike the convoluted policies that private insurance companies offer , Medicare literature clearly states what it does and does n’t pay for -- and what you pay ( if anything ) beyond what the program covers .
In my experience , a phone call to Medicare produces reliable and courteous information .
Or for you novices , you might simply ask your parents or grandparents what the deal is .
Medicare excludes no one for prior conditions ; it is portable and stays with you for a lifetime .
Worried seniors may actually like seeing Medicare get bigger and take in more money .
That would produce a more durable program that ’s better able to bargain with providers and pharmaceutical companies .
Even Republicans and Blue Dog Democrats may find it more acceptable to vote for an enlarged Medicare than for another public option .
And as a bone to the insurance industry , those covered by expanded Medicare , like those covered by classic Medicare , could buy private supplementary insurance plans to pay for whatever remains uncovered .
As for the uninsured who cannot afford even reasonable premiums , this is a problem with every reform proposal .
Obama has identified several convincing ways in which subsidies for the truly needy could be provided .
Besides , if we are going to have any reform at all , Congress will have to come up with some combination of savings and revenues to pay for a comprehensive program .
Despite noisy opposition and malicious misinformation , a majority of the public still wants healthcare reform , but legislation running to 1,000 erudite pages looks formidable .
Why not start with something as familiar and popular as the program that paid for your mother ’s hip replacement or your grandfather ’s bypass surgery ?
It is easier to promote something tested and trusted than something strange and new .
It is easier to enlarge a proven , existing program than to start from scratch .
It is easier to win people over to something simple than to wade through endless complexities about how a new system will work .
“ Medicare for Everybody ” is practically self - explanatory -- and very nearly bulletproof .
( CNN ) --
A high - ranking al Qaeda leader has called on China 's minority Uyghurs to prepare for a holy war against the Chinese government .
Security has been increased recently on the streets of Urumqi , Xinjiang 's capital .
" There is no way for salvation and to lift this oppression and tyranny unless you ... seriously prepare for jihad in the name of God and carry your weapons against the ruthless brutal invader thugs , " Abu Yahia Al - Libi said Wednesday in a video on an Islamist Web site .
He delivered his message in Arabic .
The Uyghurs are Muslims in western China 's Xinjiang province .
Some Islamists refer to the region as East Turkistan .
Al - Libi 's proclamation was in reaction to the violence that has recently shaken Urumqi , Xinjiang 's capital .
There , long - simmering resentment between minority Uyghurs and majority Han Chinese erupted into riots and left more than 200 people dead in July .
The following month , a series of stabbings -- with syringes used as weapons -- added to the unrest .
" What we saw and heard in the recent events in Turkistan was not accidental and did n't happen overnight .
This is an intifada ( an uprising ) and a usual response to the decades of oppression , the organized cleansing and the systematic repression until the people had enough , " Al - Libi said .
" This was not the first uprising that the oppressed Muslim people carried out , because they keep grieving and struggling to preserve their identity against the aggressors . "
Chinese officials could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday .
Al - Libi regularly produces video messages and has , in the past , called on Pakistanis and Somalis to resist their " apostate " governments .
He is considered one of al Qaeda 's top strategists and one of its most vocal leaders in its propaganda campaign
In his latest message , Al - Libi called on Muslims worldwide to support the Uyghurs .
And he vowed that China will suffer the same fate that the former Soviet Union did when it invaded Afghanistan in the 1980s -- only to be thwarted by Islamist fighters .
" To you , the state of atheism and obstinacy :
You are coming to an end and you will face the same fate of the Russian bear of disintegration and division , " he said .
" You will encounter the same defeat when your nation will fight in its own backyard the humble minority of Muslims who are stronger in faith . "
In July , a leader of an al Qaeda - linked group also denounced Chinese treatment of Uyghurs and threatened revenge .
The leader of the Turkistan Islamic Party , in a video on Islamic Web sites , blamed the Chinese for " genocide . "
The speaker urged Uyghurs to " kill the Chinese communists where you find them , take them and besiege them and ambush them wherever you can . "
The U.S. State Department said the group has taken credit for violence in the past .

Contributing Writer , [ GAS ]
Since we last left our heroes back in July , several new browser versions have been released : Chrome 3 , Opera 10 , Lunascape 5.1.5 , and incremental updates to Firefox , Safari , and even Internet Explorer 8 .
So it ’s time for us to revisit our benchmarks .
Dromaeo benchmark
The Dromaeo test suite measures JavaScript performance in computing a variety of algorithms , many of which are common in web applications .
I ran the recommended suite on Google Chrome 3.1.195.21 , Mozilla Firefox 3.5.3 , Internet Explorer 8.0.6001.18813 , Apple Safari 4.0 ( 531.9.1 ) , Opera 10.00 , and Lunascape 5.1.5 ( testing each of its three rendering engines ) .
The test machine is an Intel Centrino Duo 2 Ghz with 2GB of RAM running Windows Vista – not top of the line , but pretty typical .
First the raw data .
The winner in each test is colored green , and any runner - up that is within 10 % of the winner is colored yellow .
As usual , not all tests could be run on Internet Explorer ( or Lunascape with the Trident Engine ) due to JavaScript errors – thus , I can provide no permalink to those results on dromaeo.com .
Next , a new visualization .
Since the individual tests are not comparable in terms of run time , I ’ve plotted the results in terms of percentage of the best score , so you can more easily compare the performances in each category .
Legend :
As you can see , Chrome 3 has regained dominant performance in many categories – winning in 24 of the 49 tests ( up from 14 with version 2 ) .
Safari wins in 13 of the tests .
The new version of Lunascape holds its own by winning 4 of the tests when using WebKit , and 7 when using Gecko ( stealing every win from Firefox ) .
Opera 10 takes one important test ( DOM Traversal ) away from Safari , winning a category for the first time ever .
Opera 10 is now faster than Internet Explorer in all but three tests , though it still lags far behind the other browsers in most categories .
Internet Explorer is , well , it ’s Internet Explorer – what do you expect ?
Peacekeeper Benchmark
The Peacekeeper benchmark , which also tests rendering speed , gave the following results :
I was unable to run the Lunascape : Trident test on the same system , apparently because I could n’t figure out how to clear the correct cookie .
In Peacekeeper ’s overall score , Safari edges out Chrome overall .
Drilling down to details , it appears that Safari ’s main strength lies in data manipulation , while Chrome wins easily on complex graphics .
Which one better serves the future of web apps ?
It ’s interesting that Lunascape with the WebKit engine scored so much lower on this test than either Chrome or Safari , when it ran comparably to both of them in most of the Dromaeo tests .
Acid3 test
Standards compatibility has always been bothersome for Internet Explorer , as the lack of results from some of the Dromaeo tests above still shows .
But there ’s another test specifically designed to gauge compatibility with web standards : the Acid3 test , which can be run here .
These were my results for each of the above - named browsers :
Chrome : 100 %
Firefox : 93 %
Internet Explorer : 20 % , and “ LINKTEST FAILED ”
Safari : 100 %
Opera : 100 %
Lunascape WebKit : 100 % , but “ LINKTEST FAILED ”
Lunascape Gecko : 93 %
Lunascape Trident : 13 % , and “ LINKTEST FAILED ”
It looks like WebKit ( Chrome , Safari ) and Opera have these standards nailed .
Gecko ( Firefox ) still needs work , and Trident ( Internet Explorer ) does n’t seem to be trying very hard .
Conclusions
Of course , there ’s a lot I did n’t test : load time for the browser , page load speed , and memory footprint all come to mind .
What do these results tell you about your choice of browser ?
Personally , I ’m still quite happy with Chrome – but it ’s good to see healthy competition in this space .
Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) raised more than $ 60,000 the day after his “ die quickly ” comments on the House floor , including contributions from several members of Democratic leadership and Rep. Bart Gordon ( D - Tenn . ) .
There was only one full day until the end of the quarter , Sept. 30 , to raise money after Grayson ’s comments Sept. 29 , but plenty of lawmakers and political action committees got in on the action .
While most members who gave were leaders or chairmen , Gordon ’s name stands out as a member who gave to the liberal firebrand and faces a potentially tough challenge next year in a conservative - leaning district .
Others who gave to Grayson on the 30th include House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn ( D - S.C. ) , as well as chairmen including Reps.
Jim Oberstar ( D - Minn. ) and Collin Peterson ( D - Minn . ) .
Disney 's political action committee ( Grayson represents the Orlando area ) and AFLAC 's PAC were also among the donors .
The notables who contributed to Grayson the day after his “ die quickly ” comment , according to his third - quarter report , were :
- Rep. Dave Reichert ’s ( R - Wash . ) two - time Democratic opponent , Darcy Burner .
-AFLAC ’s political action committee
-AFSCME
- Rep. Xavier Becerra ( D - Calif . )
- Rep. Bart Gordon ( D - Tenn . )
- Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D - Md. )
- Disney ’s PAC
- Rep. Jim Clyburn ( D - S.C. )
- Rep. Jim Oberstar ( D - Minn . )
- Rep. Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. )
- Rep. Jerrold Nadler ’s ( D - N.Y. ) PAC
- Rep. Joseph Crowley ’s ( D - N.Y . ) PAC
- Rep. John Larson ( D - Conn . )
- Rep. Collin Peterson ( D - Minn . )
- SEIU ’s PAC
- Rep. Bill Pascrell ’s ( D - N.J. ) PAC
- Rep. George Miller ’s ( D - Calif . ) PAC
- United Food and Commercial Workers

Add ProxyCommand to your SSH config file :
You may or may not have a configuration file for SSH already .
It should be located in $ HOME /. ssh / config and is a simple text file .
Create one if it does not exist and add lines such as these to it :
Host * ProxyCommand corkscrew _http-proxy.example.com_
8080 %h %p
… replacing _http-proxy.example.com_ with the name or address of your http proxy and possibly replacing 8080 with the port on which the proxy listens , which may be 80 or even some other port .
The %h and %p will be replaced automatically by SSH with the actual destination host and port .
Darren Sutherland won a Middleweight bronze medal in Beijing A medal - winning Irish Olympic boxer has been found dead by his manager at his flat in Bromley , south London .
Darren Sutherland , 27 , who won a bronze medal at the 2008 Games in Beijing , was discovered on Monday by Frank Maloney .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed the death of Sutherland , who was found hanged , was not being treated as suspicious .
Irish Sports Minister Martin Cullen said : " Ireland has lost a sportsman of wonderful ability . "
He added : " The tremendous effort and determination of this young man brought immense pride to Ireland in Beijing in 2008 when he joined a very select group of men who have won an Olympic medal for Ireland .
He was an excellent fighter and he was a gentleman outside the ring as well
James DeGale
" It takes work , effort , desire and dedication to be a champion - qualities Darren had in abundance . "
Mr Cullen said Sutherland had grabbed the challenge of turning pro with great enthusiasm .
" Ireland has lost a sportsman of wonderful ability , a clever and popular man with a future of real potential , " he said .
" His early death deprives us of a magnificent talent . "
Sutherland had trained with Brendan Ingle in Sheffield while in his teens but gave up the sport .
ANALYSIS Austin O'Callaghan , BBC Northern Ireland sports reporter
Any professional fighter will tell you that being a pro can be a lonely existence at times .
When you 're an amateur you 're always travelling with a team and surrounded by people .
Darren was such a positive , warm guy - the life and soul of the party .
He just attracted people to him and always seemed to have a positive outlook on life , which makes this news all the more tragic . "
He returned to the ring in 2004 while studying sports science at Dublin City University .
After his success in Beijing , the fighter turned professional and joined the Maloney camp , winning his first fight in Dublin last December by knockout .
Britain 's Olympic middleweight champion James DeGale , who beat Sutherland in Beijing , spoke of his shock at the Irishman 's death .
" It is very , very sad news - I just can't believe it , " he said .
" It is a tragedy .
First and foremost , my heart goes out to his family .
I just could not believe it ; my heart went to the floor when I heard .
" He was a big part of my Olympic medal journey .
I just do not know what to say except he was a brilliant fighter , in fact an excellent fighter .
He was a gentleman outside the ring as well .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" He had an Olympic bronze medal , and his whole life to look forward to .
He had a great future and my heart goes out to everyone who knew him . "
Phenomenal talent Former world champion Barry McGuigan : " It is an absolute tragedy .
I would describe Darren as a phenomenal talent .
" I believe he would have become a world champion in the professional ranks one day . "
In a statement , Mr Maloney said Sutherland 's death was very sad and unexpected and a tragedy for Ireland and the world of boxing .
" At this sad time my thoughts are with Darren 's family , " he said .

New data and images from NASA ?s new moon orbiter ?
the firstin more than a decade ?
have revealed tentative signs of lunar water ice , thespace agency announced Thursday .
The powerful LunarReconnaissance Orbiter , or LRO , has successfully completed its testing andcalibration phase and entered its mapping orbit of the moon .
The spacecraft ' sinstruments have also made measurements of space radiation in the lunarenvironment and have found more widespread possible signatures of water on themoon .
" The LRO mission already has begun to give us new datathat will lead to a vastly improved atlas of the lunar south pole and advanceour capability for human exploration and scientific benefit , " said RichardVondrak , LRO project scientist at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
The first results from LRO 's Lunar Exploration NeutronDetector , or LEND , indicate that permanently shadowed and nearby regions mayharbor water ice and hydrogen .
LEND relies on a decrease in neutron radiationfrom the lunar surface to indicate the presence of water or hydrogen .
One big finding so far from LEND is that " the hydrogenis not confined to permanently shadowed craters , " Vondrak said .
Teammembers want more observations to confirm these findings and determine how significantthey are and how to interpret them .
" The power of LRO is that we 're not just sending oneinstrument , like LEND , to look for hydrogen , we 're characterizing fully " the lunar south pole , Vondrak said .
Jump on science
The spacecraft , launched towardthe moon on June 18 , is in good shape and set to begin its scientificmission in earnest , mission managers reported .
" The LRO instruments , spacecraft , and ground systemscontinue to operate essentially flawlessly , " said Craig Tooley , LROproject manager at Goddard .
Mission scientists were able to get a jump on some of thescience objectives during the commissioning phase of the instrument and get someresults that mission officials emphasize are preliminary .
" But some of them are really intriguing too , " saidMichael Wargo , chief lunar scientist at the Exploration Systems MissionDirectorate , NASA Headquarters in Washington , D.C .
The powerful $ 540 million orbiter , which is about the size of a Mini Cooper car , is on a one - year mission to seekout potential landing sites for future astronauts , as well as build new maps ofthe moon 's surface , temperature extremes and radiation environment .
It will alsohunt for water ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the moon 's southpole .
A source of water ice on the moon would be a boon to any future moonbases because it could be melted for water and hydrogen for fuel could beextracted from it .
First results
In addition to the initial LEND results , data from LRO 'sLunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter , or LOLA , used to map elevation indicates thatexploring the moon ? s south pole will be challenging because the terrain is veryrough .
Some of the crater slopes that LOLA has measured are relatively steepand would be difficult to drive a truck or car over , let alone a moon rover , said David Smith , LOLA principal investigator at Goddard .
That roughness is probably a result of the lack ofatmosphere and absence of erosion from wind or water , Smith said .
LOLA hasalready mapped a good portion of the lunar south pole , he added .
LRO 's other instruments also are providing data to help mapthe moon 's terrain and resources .
The probe ?s
Diviner instrument for mapping temperaturerevealed large , frigid expanses in the permanently shadowed craters are aboutminus 400 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 240 Celsius ) , " which is extremely coldand is much colder than the temperature needed to trap a volatile , such aswater , " Vondrak said .
In fact , these permanently shadowed regions " are perhaps the coldest part of the solar system , " he added .
The team will monitor seasonal changes in the temperatureover the course of the mission .
Currently , the lunar south pole is heading intosummer .
The moon up close
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera is providinghigh - resolution images of permanently shadowed regions while lightingconditions change as the moon 's south pole enters lunar summer .
" By the end of this mission , we will fully characterizeand get he best possible information we can on the existence of hydrogen " on or below the lunar surface , Vondrak said .
But , " if you really want to find out what 's below thesurface , you have to touch the surface , " Vondrak said , which is where LRO ' scompanion mission , the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite , comes in
LCROSS will impact the moon 's south pole on Oct. 9 togenerate debris that can be analyzed for signs of water .
LCROSS ' target crater , called Cabeus A , was announced by NASA last week .
Meanwhile , LRO 's Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects ofRadiation instrument is exploring the lunar radiation environment and itspotential effects on humans during record high , " worst - case " cosmicray intensities accompanying the extreme solar minimum conditions of this solarcycle .
LRO has sent back several batches of images , taken by LROC , before this newest set , including a region known as Mare Nubium ( or Sea of Clouds ) , the Apollo11 landing site , and the tracks from a difficult Apollo spacewalk .
A supposed shot of Leica 's M9 — expected to be announced 9/9/09 — complete with specs , was found on this Flickr page that 's now locked , and it looks way interesting : a full - frame 18 - megapixel CCD sensor .
Oh , and what 's this , the Leica X1 ?

The X1 looks just as intriguing , actually , taking a different tack with a 12 - megapixel CMOS APS -C sized sensor and funky grip handle .
Neither of the pages look like obvious fakes to us , though the specs , which sound damn impressive , are obviously more up in the air authenticity - wise .
Still , we 'll know for sure come Wednesday , which we 're a little more excited for right now .

And they are starting to have a real impact .
Paul ’s libertarian - leaning presidential bid , while notable for its novelty and the amount of money he raised , was never given a chance .
By contrast , his son Rand Paul Randal ( Rand ) Howard PaulRon Paul hospitalized in Texas The Hill 's Morning Report - Sponsored by Facebook - Trump previews SCOTUS nominee as ' totally brilliant ' Rand Paul says he can't judge ' guilt or innocence ' in Breonna Taylor case MORE and adviser Peter Schiff are starting to be seen and felt in two of the biggest Senate races in the country .
Rand Paul has already raised nearly $ 770,000 and is on pace to report a quarterly total of about $ 1 million for the GOP primary to replace Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - Ky . ) .
In addition , a SurveyUSA poll late last month showed him within striking distance of the establishment favorite , Secretary of State Trey Grayson , trailing 37 - 26 .

Schiff , meanwhile , is approaching the $ 1 million mark before he is even an officially announced candidate in the race against Sen.
Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) .
Both keep running tabs of their fundraising online , which is highly unusual for a federal candidate .
And that ’s not the only thing that sets them apart .
Schiff and Paul are harnessing the energy that propelled Ron Paul to more than $ 35 million raised in the presidential race and hoping it translates better to a smaller - scale , but still high - profile , Senate race .
Ron Paul did n’t win any states , but his acolytes say focusing on one state could pay dividends .
“ I could n’t do this without his presidential election , ” said Rand Paul , an eye surgeon from Bowling Green , Ky .
“ This is the second wave that comes off of that .
And it is different and easier for us because the perception from the beginning is that it ’s basically just about a dead - even race for us .
” That might not quite be the case .
There are still plenty of doubters that the Ron Paul movement can win a statewide race , including some who have worked with the candidates .
But the campaigns are aiming for a little more pragmatism and a more traditional campaign style in hopes that they can go places the presidential campaign could n’t .
Neither is a favorite at this point , but both are raising money at a faster clip than anyone else in their respective primary fields , and circumstances could lead to crowded primaries that could give either a glimmer of hope .
Rand Paul has been much more active in getting his name out — as evidenced by the poll numbers — while Schiff plans to do this in the near future .
But even though Schiff is getting a later start on the ground , he is running in a crowded and competitive primary field where anything could feasibly happen .
His brother , Andrew Schiff , said 25 or 30 percent of the vote could win the GOP primary to face Dodd .
Also running are former Rep. Rob Simmons , former Ambassador to Ireland Tom Foley and state Sen. Sam Caligiuri .
Andrew Schiff also said that the environment could actually be better for a Ron Paul - like candidate in 2010 .
He said the economic downturn helps a man who , as an investment adviser , made a name for himself by predicting such trouble .
“ When Ron Paul was running , the economic crash was still theoretical , ” Andrew Schiff said .
“ Now it ’s not a theoretical ; it ’s an actual .
That ’s something in our favor .
” But whatever is going on with the campaign ’s coffers or the environment , plenty of questions remain about how competent a candidate Peter Schiff — or Rand Paul — will be .
Chris Healy , the chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party , said the jury ’s out and that Schiff has plenty of work to do getting known .
“ He has no political footprint at all in Connecticut ; he has n’t voted , contributed or participated in anything political in our state , ” Healy said .
“ He has written books and appeared on television and has a business of which we know little .
” Another source was n’t so charitable .
The source , who is close to Schiff ’s campaign but disgruntled , said the inmates are running the asylum and that both Schiff and Paul are “ too untraditional to have a chance .
”
“ They refuse to run traditional races , meaning that they will rely on volunteers to conduct critically important campaign operations — much like the Ron Paul campaign did in 2008 , ” the source said .
“ Every campaign needs volunteers , but unfortunately for Schiff and Paul , their volunteers scare the crap out of traditional Republicans .
” It ’s clear that both are running as outsiders , and they fit the description .
Kentucky Senate candidate Grayson will be the beneficiary of a fundraiser at National Republican Senatorial Committee ( NRSC ) headquarters this month , with more than half of the GOP Senate caucus in attendance .
In the Connecticut race , Simmons is a former lawmaker , and Foley was a big - time fundraiser for former President Bush .
Ron Paul said his movement needs to win some races in order for it to be seen as a mainstream alternative to GOP leadership .
“ We ’ve got to continue the growth in the number of people involved and get more people elected , ” Ron Paul said .
“ In many ways , things are falling in place for us , if we do our job right . ”
We often allude to the industry - funded attacks against climate change science , and the dubious cast of characters involved , here at RealClimate .
In recent years , for example , we ’ve commented on disinformation efforts by industry front groups such as the “ Competitive Enterprise Institute , the Cato Institute , the Fraser Institute , and a personal favorite , The Heartland Institute , and by industry - friendly institutions such as the Wall Street Journal editorial board , and other media outlets that assist in the manufacture and distribution of climate change disinformation .
When it comes to the climate change disinformation campaign , we have chosen to focus on the intellectually bankrupt nature of the scientific arguments , rather than the political motivations and the sometimes intriguing money trail .
We leave it to others , including organizations such as SourceWatch.org , the sleuths at DeSmogBlog , authors such as Ross Gelbspan ( author of The Heat is On , and The Boiling Point ) , and edited works such as Rescuing Science from Politics to deal with such issues .
One problem with books on this topic is that they quickly grow out of date .
Just over the past few years , there have been many significant events in the ‘ climate wars ’ as we have reported on this site .
Fortunately , there is a book out now by our friends at DeSmogBlog ( co- founder James Hoggan , and regular contributor Richard Littlemore ) entitled Climate Cover Up : The Crusade to Deny Global Warming that discusses the details of the contrarian attacks on climate science up through the present , and in painstaking detail .
They have done their research , and have fully documented their findings , summarized by the publisher thusly :
Talk of global warming is nearly inescapable these days — but there are some who believe the concept of climate change is an elaborate hoax .
Despite the input of the world ’s leading climate scientists , the urgings of politicians , and the outcry of many grassroots activists , many Americans continue to ignore the warning signs of severe climate shifts .
How did this happen ?
Climate Cover - up seeks to answer this question , describing the pollsters and public faces who have crafted careful language to refute the findings of environmental scientists .
Exploring the PR techniques , phony “ think tanks , ” and funding used to pervert scientific fact , this book serves as a wake - up call to those who still wish to deny the inconvenient truth .
There are interesting new details about the Revelle / Singer / Lancaster affair and other tidbits that were new to me , and will likely to be new to others who been following the history of climate change contrarianism .
Ross Gelbspan who has set the standard for investigative reporting
when it comes to the climate change denial campaign , had this to say about the book :
absolutely superb - one of the best dissections of the climate information war I
have ever seen .
This is one terrific piece of work !
There is an important story behind the climate change denial effort that goes well beyond the scientific issues at hand .
Its not our mission at RealClimate to tell that story , but there are others who are doing it , and doing it well .
Hoggan and Littlemore are clearly among them .
Read this book , and equally important , make sure that others who need to do as well .

Take the hospital system run by the Department of Veterans Affairs , the largest integrated health system in the United States .
It is fully government run , much more “ socialized medicine ” than is Canadian health care with its private doctors and hospitals .
And the system for veterans is by all accounts one of the best - performing and most cost - effective elements in the American medical establishment .
A study by the Rand Corporation concluded that compared with a national sample , Americans treated in veterans hospitals “ received consistently better care across the board , including screening , diagnosis , treatment and follow - up . ”
The difference was particularly large in preventive medicine : veterans were nearly 50 percent more likely to receive recommended care than Americans as a whole .
“ If other health care providers followed the V.A. ’s lead , it would be a major step toward improving the quality of care across the U.S. health care system , ” Rand reported .
As for the other big government - run health care system in the United States , Medicare spends perhaps one - sixth as much on administration as private health insurers , although the comparison is imperfect and controversial .
But the biggest weakness of private industry is not inefficiency but unfairness .
The business model of private insurance has become , in part , to collect premiums from healthy people and reject those likely to get sick  or , if they start out healthy and then get sick , to find a way to cancel their coverage .
A reader wrote in this week to tell me about a colleague of hers who had health insurance through her company .
The woman received a cancer diagnosis a few weeks ago , and she now faces chemotherapy co-payments that she cannot afford .
Worse , because she is now unable to work and has to focus on treatment , she has been shifted to short - term disability for 90 days  and after that , she will lose her employer health insurance .

Bien connu des internautes pour ses explications juridiques , le blogueur Maitre Eolas , avocat au barreau de Paris , revient dans sa dernière note sur l'affaire Polanski .
En tant qu'avocat , quelle est votre position sur l'affaire Polanski ?
Personne ne conteste le génie de Roman Polanski mais la loi est la même pour les artistes et les citoyens , il ne peut pas y avoir deux poids deux mesures .
Il faut surtout penser à l'aspect social de la justice : pourquoi mes clients accepteraient d'assumer la responsabilité de leurs actes si une certaine catégorie de population ne subit pas le même traitement ?
Ses soutiens ont - ils tort d'invoquer la prescription ?
Absolument car cet argument est juridiquement faux .
La prescription suppose une inaction .
Tout nouvel acte fait repartir le délai à zéro .
Or la justice californienne n'a jamais lâché l'affaire .
Preuve en est , le mandat d'arrêt international émis en 2005 .
Et Polanski savait que l'affaire était encore en cours puisqu'il paie des avocats pour faire des recours et qu'il avoue lui même faire attention aux pays où il met les pieds .
C'est d'ailleurs pour cette raison qu'il n'est même pas allé chercher son Oscar pour Le Pianiste en 2003 à Los Angeles .
Bref , Roman Polanski a reconnu les faits et cherche à échapper à la justice depuis trente ans .
Que reprochez - vous aux artistes qui le soutiennent ?
On attaque un des leurs , les artistes le défendent : c'est du corporatisme .
À l'inverse , lors des débats sur Hadopi , certains artistes réclamaient une sévérité impitoyable contre les téléchargeurs , quitte à bafouer un droit fondamental .
Cela creuse le divorce entre les artistes et l'opinion publique .
Je suis également en colère car ceux qui s'insurgent contre cette arrestation invoquent de mauvais arguments , ils ont tort juridiquement et moralement .
Par exemple , lorsque le réalisateur Costa - Gavras affirme que la victime " avait 13 ans mais en paraissait 25 " , il enfonce Polanski plutôt qu'il ne le défend .
Vous taclez également le ministre de la culture Frédéric Mitterrand ?
C'est sa réaction qui m'a poussé à monter au créneau .
Lorsqu'il parle d'une " certaine Amérique qui fait peur ( ...) qui vient de nous présenter son visage " , c'est un énorme cliché .
Sur cinq chefs d'accusation , la justice américaine n'en a gardé qu'un seul après un arrangement et une indemnisation de la victime .
Ce n'est pas de l'acharnement , au contraire la justice américaine est attachée à l'égalité et ne regarde pas la qualité de l'accusé .
J'ai l'impression que cela gêne Frédéric Mitterrand que les artistes ne soient pas au - dessus des lois tant ils sont bénéfiques à la société .
La pétition de la SACD , signée par de nombreux artistes , parle d'un " traquenard policier " et critique le fait qu'il ait été arrêté par surprise alors qu'il s'apprêtait à recevoir un prix .
C'est un peu le principe d'une arrestation que d'être effectuée par surprise , sinon , elle échoue ...
D'autres estiment qu'il ne pouvait pas s'en douter puisqu'il se rendait régulièrement en Suisse , dans sa maison à Gstaad .
Cela n'a rien à voir car cette fois il venait recevoir un prix dans un festival , sa venue était annoncée dans tous les journaux .
Et apparemment , la police lit le journal .

A four - year - old Turkish boy has walked away from a seemingly fatal car accident unscathed , and unfazed .
Muhammet Dirlik was minding his own business on a kerb next to some steps in his home town when he was hit by an out - of - control car .
Tim Allman reports .
The hanging death of a Kentucky census worker is likely to raise tensions among counters in the 2010 census , who have already been the focus of emotionally charged online rhetoric this year because they use GPS .
Internet conspiracy theories have grown in recent months over the fact that census workers are now equipped with GPS - enabled handheld computers that let them collect the geolocation of street addresses as they perform pre-census canvassing .
It 's an improvement on the paper maps the census has historically used for the same purpose .
" The exact geographic location of each housing unit is critical to ensure that when we publish the census results for the entire country , broken down by various geographic areas ranging from states , counties and cities , to census blocks , we accurately represent the data for the area in question , " the Census Bureau explains on its website .
But that explanation does n't wash with everyone .
A post on the widely read Infowars.com in June warned : " I will tell you plainly , the NWO [ New World Order ] controlled American military wants these GPS markers so they can launch Predator Drone missile attacks , the aptly named HELLFIRE missile I might add , against a long list of undesirables here in CONUS , continental United States . "
Other commentators have posited less lethal theories .
The American Daily Review warned in April that the Census Bureau is " shooting GPS coordinates of your doorway " in possible preparation for a secret Obama plan to cede some of America 's sovereignty to the United Nations .
" If the government decided to rely on foreign troops , perhaps United Nations personnel , most of which may not understand the street signs , much less know the lay of the land , they could use GPS devices to direct them to your front door , " the site explained .
And RightSoup.com suggests that the government , " and ACORN , " wants the coordinates for Americans ' front doors as " a jackboot convenience . "
The conspiracy theories have struck a chord with a certain type of American , and posts like these have collected comments from people vowing not to allow workers anywhere near their houses .
A few comments have taken an ominous tone .
" Only a fool would allow the New World Order to come up and take GPS readings at your front door , " wrote a commenter to another Infowars.com post .
" There is nothing good to come from Big Brother 's constant meddling into our lives !
Beware , and carry a big stick … preferably .308 Winchester full metal jacket . "
The FBI is reportedly investigating the death of 51 - year - old Bill Sparkman , who was found hanged on Sept. 12 with the word " fed " written on his chest .
The Census Bureau has suspended field operations in the Kentucky county where Sparkman was found , The Huffington Post reports .
Then there was the wonky miscommunication that started it all .
In May 2008 , a friend e-mailed Ms. Yates a photo of a sheet cake that looked like a prop from “ The Office . ”
It was not .
Amid marzipan flowers , the cursive inscription was a profound reminder of the perils of ordering supermarket cakes by phone .
It read :
Best Wishes Suzanne
Under Neat that
We will Miss you
One giant LOL and several Google image searches later , Ms. Yates was in the business of chronicling pro baking train wrecks .
“ People had been posting pictures of ugly cakes for years , so I just started collecting them , ” she said .
What began as an amusing distraction from her job as a faux finisher for the specialty painting company she runs with her husband , John , in Orlando , Fla. , has snowballed into a genuine Internet phenomenon  or at least a serious time waster .

By last fall , around 100,000 visitors a day were gawking at Cake Wrecks .
More than a million people subscribe to Ms. Yates ’s Cake Wrecks updates on Twitter .
“ Everyone in the baking business follows Cake Wrecks almost daily , if only to make sure our cakes are n’t ending up on there , ” said Mary Alice Yeskey , who works at Charm City Cakes in Baltimore and appears on the Food Network show “ Ace of Cakes . ”
David Lebovitz , a former pastry chef at Chez Panisse who now writes about desserts from Paris , is also a fan .
“ As someone on the professional side , you can see how these disasters happen , which only makes them funnier , ” he said by telephone .
“ You take an order , leave it to one of your assistants to handle , and walk in the next morning and say , ‘ Um , O.K . I think we have a problem . ’ ”
Fortunately for Ms. Yates , an enormous number of those problems go unnoticed .
She said she receives 50 to 60 Cake Wrecks submissions a day via e-mail , and usually posts between one and five photos each weekday morning .
She posts only professionally made cakes ( “ It ’s too easy and mean to go after your Aunt Sally ’s cake wreck , ” she said ) and nothing excessively gory or obscene .
African elephants , the Egyptian sphinx , Batman , Spiderman , the incredible Hulk and also other super heroes , movie and TV show characters are just some of many giant sculptures transforming a seaside resort .
The most amazing part about this is that the sculptures are made entirely out of sand .
Atheist and secularist web sites and posts by secularists on various discussion forums are attributing the following spurious quote to Thomas Jefferson : " I have recently been examining all the known superstitions of the world , and do not find in our particular superstition [ Christianity ] one redeeming feature .
They are all alike , founded upon fables and mythologies " ( Letter to Dr. Woods ) .
The source for this quote is chapter 2 of John E. Remsburg 's book " Six Historic Americans : Paine , Jefferson , Washington , Franklin , Lincoln , and Grant The Fathers And Saviors Of Our Republic , Freethinkers " published in 1906 .
No such letter is currently known to exist .
If a Thomas Jefferson letter to Dr. Woods turns up in the future then , and only then , can we declare the quote to be genuine .
Some web sites attribute this same quote , with an extra sentence or two added , to a Thomas Jefferson letter to William Short .
Jefferson wrote multiple letters to Mr. Short , but a search of the Thomas Jefferson Digital Archive , as well as various other online collections of transcribed Jefferson letters , finds no such quote .
Neither the Dr. Woods nor the William Short citations provide a date .
This is odd because Jefferson 's letters usually begin with a date .
Unless someone identifies such a letter with that quote it must be deemed a probably bogus citation for a highly dubious quote .
Please do not use this quote and please let people know that this alleged quote is unverified and should not be used .

Annie Leibovitz clearly hated what a lifetime - achievement award implied about her — that the best days of her 40 - year career were behind her .
“ Photography is not something you retire from , ” the 59 - year - old Leibovitz said from the stage , accepting the honor from the International Center of Photography last May at Pier 60 .
She was turned out in a simple black dress and glasses , her long straight hair a little unruly , as usual .
Photographers , she said , “ live to a very old age ” and “ work until the end . ”
She noted that Lartigue lived to be 92 , Steichen 93 , and Cartier - Bresson 94 .
“ Irving Penn is going to be 92 next month , and he ’s still working . ”
Then her tone turned rueful .
“ Seriously , though , this really is a big deal , ” she said , hoisting her Infinity Award statuette , her voice quavering to the point where it seemed she might cry .
“ It means so much to me , you know , especially right now .
It ’s , it ’s a very sweet award to get right now .
I ’m having some tough times right now , so … ”
The 700 friends and colleagues who had come to share the evening with her knew about the “ tough times . ”
Two vendors had sued her for more than $ 700,000 in unpaid bills , and in February , the New York Times ran a front - page story reporting that in order to secure a loan , Leibovitz had essentially pawned the copyrights to her entire catalogue of photographs .
Even those who had known she was in trouble were shocked by the extent of it .
Leibovitz was responsible for some of the world ’s most iconic magazine covers — a naked John Lennon with Yoko Ono for Rolling Stone , Demi Moore , naked and pregnant , for Vanity Fair .
She had moved from celebrity portraiture to fashion photography to edgier , more artistic pictures ; some considered her the heir to Richard Avedon or Helmut Newton .
Despite being a compulsive perfectionist whose shoots cost a fortune to produce , Leibovitz was very much in demand .
People spoke of a fabled “ contract for life ” from Condé Nast , thought to bring her as much as $ 5 million annually .
( The estimate did n’t seem far - fetched ; a decade ago , the Times reported that Condé Nast chairman Si Newhouse had instructed Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter not to “ nickel and dime ” Leibovitz over the issue of an extra quarter - million dollars in her contract . )
She was said to earn a day rate of $ 250,000 just to set foot in a studio for an advertising job for clients like Louis Vuitton .
Over the years , Leibovitz had bought and sold a small fortune in real estate — a penthouse in Chelsea with a photo studio nearby , a sprawling townhouse in Greenwich Village , a compound in Rhinebeck once owned by the Astor family , and a Paris pied - à - terre overlooking the Seine .
Virtually anyone ( the Queen of England , for instance ) would agree to be photographed by her , and she had a longtime relationship with the celebrated writer and intellectual Susan Sontag .
Lately , however , Leibovitz ’s life had taken a decidedly dark turn .
Her reference to “ tough times ” was significantly understated .
In the past five years , Sontag and both of Leibovitz ’s parents have died .
Her debts now total a staggering $ 24 million , consolidated with one lender with whom she is engaged in a lawsuit and due in September .
If she ca n’t meet that deadline , she may lose her homes and the rights to her life ’s body of work .
Friends say Leibovitz has begun to think of herself less as a celebrity artist leading a charmed life and more as a single mother of three fighting to keep a roof over her head and food on her family ’s table .
It is n’t surprising , then , that she bristled at a lifetime - achievement award .
The fear of no longer working is terrifying to her .
She has to work .
What remains mystifying is the simple question on everyone ’s mind that night :
How on earth could something like this have happened to Annie Leibovitz ?
Leibovitz was born in 1949 , in Waterbury , Connecticut .
Her father , Sam , joined the Air Force after an unsuccessful stint in the fashion business .
Her mother , Marilyn , was a dancer who had once performed with Martha Graham .
Right after Leibovitz graduated from high school , the family moved to the Philippines .
Sam wanted his 17 - year - old daughter to stay close by and attend the University of the Philippines .
Anna
Lou , the name her family still uses to address her , had other ideas .
The six - foot - tall girl , seemingly composed of all knees , elbows , and glasses , packed off for the Bay Area , where her sister Susan lived .
In 1967 , Leibovitz enrolled in the San Francisco Art Institute as a painting major , hoping to eventually teach art .
Instead , she fell in love with photography , and in 1970 a boyfriend persuaded her to submit pictures she ’d taken for a class — police in riot gear , Allen Ginsberg at a peace rally — to Rolling Stone , then just three years old .
It took only three years after that for Jann Wenner to install her on the masthead as “ chief photographer ” alongside the likes of Hunter S. Thompson .
* In “ How Could This Happen to Annie Leibovitz , ” by Andrew Goldman ( August 24 ) , Goldman made the following statement with regard to a loan agreement that Leibovitz entered into with a company called Art Capital : “ Under the terms of the agreement , says a person familiar with the loan , Art Capital could be entitled to up to 22.5 percent of all the proceeds from the sale of any of Leibovitz ’s work — even for two years after she ’s paid off the loan .
And that percentage could increase to close to 50 percent if she were to default . ”
New York Magazine has since learned that those numbers were erroneous .
The actual commission rates on the sale of the collateral underlying the loan are 10 percent on Leibovitz ’s real estate and 15 percent on the sale of her work .
In the event Leibovitz defaults on the loan a default commission of 25 percent , and after costs as low as 14 percent , would be realized .
New York regrets the error .

In keeping with the times , Leibovitz ’s early work focused on politics and rock and roll — Nixon ’s resignation , Sly Stone .
By the late seventies , she had begun to display a lighter , more comic style , like painting the Blues Brothers ’ faces blue and posing Bette Midler , star of The Rose , atop a bed of roses .
Later , at Vanity Fair and Vogue , she became known for idealized , heroic portraiture .
Leibovitz has an uncanny ability “ to make boring white men who have desk jobs look epic , ” says Graydon Carter .
“ She shot a photo of me where I looked like I was James Dean or something , ” says Quentin Tarantino of his 1994 portrait .
“ And I ’m a guy who does n’t look like James Dean . ”
“ These pictures are how I will look in heaven , ” author Brett Leveridge wrote of a book - jacket photo that Leibovitz shot .
Unlike her hero , Avedon , Leibovitz seems unwilling to shoot an unflattering portrait .
“ Annie does not share the ruthless nature of editors and writers , ” Leibovitz ’s friend the book editor Sharon Delano says .
“ Her enterprise is essentially good - natured . ”
From her earliest days at Rolling Stone , Leibovitz demonstrated a near - crippling fear of not coming back with the shot .
Lloyd Ziff , a former Rolling Stone designer , remembers Leibovitz being sent out to get a simple image of the world ’s oldest Coke bottle kept in some little museum .
“ She took 300 to 500 Polaroids of it , ” he says .
“ I do n’t care who you are or what levels of energy or patience you have , ” says Carter , “ Annie will wear you out .
She ’ll beat you .
Because she ’ll have more patience than you do .
And she will eventually get her shot . ”
Arnold Schwarzenegger still jokes about flying through a blizzard in a helicopter , then nearly freezing to death for the 1997 Vanity Fair cover image of him on skis on a mountain top in Sun Valley , Idaho .
Leibovitz once described her portraiture method as “ get ’em somewhere where they ’re bored shitless and there ’s nothing to do except take pictures . ”
From there , she would work her subjects to the point of exhaustion , a state that could lead to revealing moments of vulnerability .
For a 1981 Rolling Stone shoot , William Hurt sat in his parents ’ house in New Jersey one afternoon .
At seven o’clock the next morning , Leibovitz was still shooting the actor , who by now was wearing only a pair of briefs .
Getting her subjects to disrobe became such a familiar gambit that by the time Leibovitz moved to Vanity Fair , she vowed to “ shake this reputation as the girl who gets people to undress . ”
That never happened , of course .
Some of her most talked - about shots at Vanity Fair were the naked - and - pregnant 1991 Demi Moore cover , the 2006 Hollywood Issue cover with Tom Ford hovering lasciviously over the nude Keira Knightley and Scarlett Johansson , and the 2008 shot of 15 - year - old Miley Cyrus covered only in a sheet .
Photographers are typically paid a fee for their work , plus expenses .
The client , whether it ’s a magazine , advertiser , or individual , stipulates an expense budget that the photographer must operate within .
From the start , Leibovitz ’s perfectionism led her to pay little or no attention to budget restrictions , and she spent money recklessly , losing cameras , accruing parking tickets , and even abandoning rental cars .
In the early Rolling Stone days , Leibovitz was a sort of little sister to the magazine ’s staff , smoking , drinking , and hot - tubbing alongside Wenner , Thompson , and the others .
In 1975 , against Wenner ’s advice , Leibovitz accepted a two - month gig as the Rolling Stones ’ official photographer for their Tour of the Americas .
Everyone drank and got high on a Stones tour , of course , but when Leibovitz returned to San Francisco , her appetite for cocaine had become more than merely recreational .
Robert Draper ’s Rolling Stone Magazine : The Uncensored History paints Leibovitz as a full - fledged drug addict , who twice overdosed .
She may have even hocked some of her cameras to pay for drugs , he writes .
Leibovitz left Rolling Stone for Vanity Fair in 1983 .
Her reputation for dubious money management apparently traveled with her .
“ Getting her accounts at rental houses and film labs was a struggle , ” says Andrew Eccles , now a highly regarded photographer who worked as Leibovitz ’s assistant from 1983 to 1986 .
“ I had to get people to believe me when I said it was n’t the old days anymore .
People would actually get paid for their equipment . ”
Because of her credit issues , Leibovitz was forced to deal almost exclusively in cash .
In 1987 , American Express offered her a plum ad campaign .
Ironically , Leibovitz ’s application for a card had been denied many times .
After the ad agency found out she ’d lost an envelope containing several thousand dollars in a phone booth during their shoot , strings were finally pulled to get her a card .

When Tina Brown became the editor of Vanity Fair in 1984 , Leibovitz was one of its marquee attractions .
She shot everyone — Nicole Kidman , Uma Thurman , the Bush Cabinet — and her projects became bigger and increasingly expensive to produce .
When she decided to photograph Whoopi Goldberg in a bathtub full of milk , she could now dispatch a staff to buy and warm dozens of gallons of milk .
Her bloated work expenses were a chronic concern .
Anthony Accardi , Leibovitz ’s onetime printer , recalls that jobs were often rushed , like the time he had to show up to a lab at 3 a .m. to pick up film of Bill Clinton and have work prints ready by 7 a.m. , a job so hurried that he billed Condé Nast three times his regular rate .
Accardi was stunned by the number of work prints Leibovitz would order , and apparently so was Condé Nast .
After Accardi printed 300 oversize work prints of a Roseanne Barr shoot and billed Vanity Fair some $ 15,000 , he received a letter from Graydon Carter himself , informing him that after this job , he ’d be paid for no more than 50 such prints .
“ Like I was going to tell Annie that ? ” Accardi says with a laugh .
“ She would ’ve boxed my ears . ”
Eccles says Leibovitz could be downright tyrannical .
“ I once narrowly escaped being hit by a pair of shoes , ” he says .
“ To this day , I ’ve never been as nervous photographing a subject as I have assisting her .
And that includes the several times I ’ve been sent to the White House . ”
Leibovitz , Eccles says , once slammed her fists on a table , swearing she was going to kill him after a lighting test had n’t gone well .
“ Go ahead , hit me , ” Eccles said .
He was by then so accustomed to the behavior , he says , that he did n’t flinch .
“ You ’re not afraid of me , ” Leibovitz lamented , skulking off .
“ It ’s not fun anymore . ”
After her outbursts , Eccles says , Leibovitz would almost always call and apologize .
Still , he left on good terms .
“ I adore Annie , ” he says .
“ I ’ll go to the mat for her as the greatest photographer there ever was in any genre . ”
“ She wanted her life to be like a magazine spread , nothing out of place , everything perfect . ”
Starting in 1993 , Leibovitz also began doing regular fashion shoots for Vogue .
Her already elaborate productions eventually became virtually indistinguishable in scale from film sets .
One of the most over - the - top undertakings was the multi-page 2005 Wizard of Oz couture portfolio in which Jeff Koons was featured decked out as a winged monkey flying through the air with Keira Knightley as Dorothy .
Leibovitz had always lived in modest apartments on the Upper West Side , but in the nineties she began buying and renovating expensive properties downtown .
In 1994 , she bought the Chelsea penthouse in London Terrace , and spent considerably more on a gut renovation ( extravagant renovations became something of an obsession ) .
In 1996 , she acquired the Rhinebeck estate and converted it into a sprawling country home .
In 1999 , for $ 2.1 million , she purchased a 14,000 - square - foot auto shop on West 26th Street , a five - minute walk from her Chelsea apartment , and built it into a state - of - the - art photo studio .
Leibovitz was sober now — her family had coaxed her into rehab in the early eighties .
But the familiar compulsive nature persisted .
Eccles remembers many mornings of walking into a hotel restaurant and seeing Leibovitz stewing because she was n’t convinced that she ’d yet come upon the ideal setup for a shot .
“ She could never quite relax , because she was afraid that there was an even better idea , ” Eccles says .
“ The anxiousness about whether a photograph was going to be good enough was hard to be around .
It seemed like a difficult way to live . ”
In 2007 , Leibovitz agreed to take Tina Brown ’s portrait for her Princess Diana biography .
“ I thought she would just take a snap at my home , ” Brown says .
Leibovitz insisted that the shoot be on the beach near Brown ’s summer home in Quogue , even though it was March and freezing .
Leibovitz showed up in a van with a stylist and assistant .
A second car stuffed full of clothes soon arrived .
A wind machine would eventually be engaged .
This was all on Leibovitz ’s dime ; she refused to charge Brown a cent .
Unsatisfied with the day ’s work , Leibovitz suggested that they try again the next day .
“ We ’re through ! ” Brown told her , appreciative but worn out .
“ She ’s a massive perfectionist , ” Brown says , “ and absolutely does n’t care about the impact on her own bottom line . ”
Annie Leibovitz and Susan Sontag were introduced in the late eighties by their mutual friend Sharon Delano , then an editor at Vanity Fair .
Soon , Leibovitz and Sontag were a couple .
Sontag was sixteen years older , and while she had had female lovers , neither woman identified herself as a lesbian .
Still , they were romantically involved .
“ Call us lovers , ” Leibovitz once said .
“ I like ‘ lovers . ’
You know , ‘ lovers ’ sounds romantic … I just had a problem with ‘ partner ’ or ‘ companion . ’
It just sounds like two little old ladies . ”
However they characterized the relationship , they were an unlikely pair .
Leibovitz was n’t apologetic about the fact that she barely read , while Sontag housed 15,000 books in her apartment .
“ I do n’t think anybody would describe Annie as intellectual , ” says Sontag ’s only sibling , Judith Cohen , who feels warmly toward Leibovitz .

There was an obvious symbiosis to the relationship .
Sontag , whose 1977 monograph
On Photography is required reading for most photography majors , gave Leibovitz , who believed the label of “ celebrity photographer ” was demeaning , a new kind of credibility .
“ It ’s as if Tom Cruise started going out with Akira Kurosowa , ” a respected portrait photographer told me .
Leibovitz , meanwhile , offered Sontag tangible benefits .
Despite her well - maintained image as an intellectual , Sontag enjoyed being around movie stars and sometimes dropped by Leibovitz ’s studio for high - wattage shoots .
Sontag also enjoyed sharing Leibovitz ’s high - priced life .
Because they each had a top - floor apartment in Chelsea ’s redbrick London Terrace — with terraces across from one another — Leibovitz ’s housekeeper , Sookhee , would clean Sontag ’s place , too , and Leibovitz ’s personal chef would bring meals to Sontag .
Sontag once called Paris “ the alternative capital of my imagination ” ; Leibovitz bought an apartment for the couple to use overlooking the Seine .
The famously opinionated Sontag encouraged Leibovitz to make her work more personal and artistic .
There was a student - teacher quality to their relationship , with all the attendant power dynamics .
“ The fact that she was even interested in me or my work was just so flattering to me , ” Leibovitz once said .
“ Even if she criticized it . ” Sontag advised Leibovitz to find a home at the prestigious Edwynn Houk Gallery , convincing her of the importance of sharing representation with the estates of Brassaï and Dorothea Lange .
Sontag ’s input was n’t welcomed by everyone .
In the mid-nineties , Leibovitz altered her style of shooting cover images to appeal more to Sontag ’s taste than that of her boss .
“ Her pictures became very dark and brooding and painterly , ” Carter says of the years he calls Leibovitz ’s Blue Period .
“ The portraits were spectacular , but in order to sell between 400,000 and 700,000 copies on the newsstand , you need a cover that ’s either funny or iconic . ”
In 2001 , at 51 , Leibovitz gave birth to a daughter , Sarah .
Even though Sontag would be present for the birth and doted on Sarah , she was n’t in favor of the idea of Leibovitz ’s having a child .
“ I think she wanted me to herself , ” Leibovitz has said .
The distance between the couple grew wider when Leibovitz hired a rigid British baby nurse whom Sontag despised and came to call “ the nanny from hell . ”
Dan Kellum worked as Leibovitz ’s assistant in 2002 .
Despite the ample help Leibovitz had , Kellum says he felt sorry for her because she was emotionally alone .
“ There was no one in Annie ’s life that could say to her , ‘ Relax , the baby ’s going to be fine , ’ ” he says .
Leibovitz ’s obsessiveness was reflected in her mothering , Kellum says .
When Sarah started eating solid food , a rigorous journaling policy was instituted , in which every bite and bowel movement was to be committed to an unlined black notebook purchased from the Swedish stationer Ordning & Reda .
Kellum regularly ordered replacement books from Stockholm so that the journaling could easily continue from one book to another .
Once , when an order got lost in customs , Leibovitz insisted on having two notebooks sent from Stockholm via a special type of courier service called “ quicking . ”
It was essentially like buying a seat for a parcel on the next plane .
The shipping cost alone came to $ 800 .
( Leibovitz also had twin daughters , Samuelle and Susan , born via surrogate and named after her father and Sontag , in 2005 . )
Sontag had had recurring bouts of cancer over the years , and in the spring of 2004 , she learned that the disease had returned .
Despite the distance between them , and the fact that Leibovitz was also attending to her own father , Sam , who was being treated for terminal lung cancer in Florida at the time , Leibovitz spared no effort in helping Sontag .
She secured a friend ’s private plane to transport Sontag to Seattle for a bone - marrow transplant , arranged for friends and family to be with her around the clock , and chartered another private plane to fly her back to New York ’s Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center .
Three days after Christmas in 2004 , Sontag passed away .
When the state of Leibovitz ’s finances later became public , outlets like Salon trumpeted the “ gay tax ” theory , the idea that Leibovitz ’s finances had been depleted by the taxes she ’d had to pay on her inheritance from Sontag .
That was n’t true .
With the exception of four items of only sentimental value , the bulk of Sontag ’s estate went to David Rieff , Sontag ’s only child .
Leibovitz ’s relationship with Sontag was not mentioned in Sontag ’s New York Times obituary , and Leibovitz did not speak at Sontag ’s memorial service .
In 2006 , Leibovitz mounted a retrospective of her previous fifteen years of work at the Brooklyn Museum .
Along with the well - known magazine photographs , she included the private , more artistic work Sontag had encouraged , including shots of Sontag , unrecognizably bloated and visibly in pain in her hospital bed in Seattle , and one of Sontag ’s body laid out in her favorite dress in a back room of the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel .
The New York Times critic Roberta Smith dubbed the portraits “ professional but pedestrian . ”
“ It is hard not to feel that Sontag functioned a bit like Ms. Leibovitz ’s own personal celebrity , ” Smith wrote , “ enabling her to share a fame that she found more authentic than her own . ”
Last year , Rieff published Swimming in a Sea of Death , a memoir of his mother ’s battle with cancer .
He mentions Leibovitz ’s name exactly twice in the book , once to describe her pictures of his dead and dying mother as “ carnival images of celebrity death . ”
Judith Cohen does n’t hide the fact that she agrees about little with Rieff .
She also says that perhaps if her sister had lived , Leibovitz might not have found herself in such a financial predicament .
“ Susan was really prudent about a lot of things , ” Cohen says .
“ She was not a big spender .
And I think she did advise against certain things Annie did , like Greenwich Village . ”
Leibovitz purchased the two adjacent Greek Revival–style townhouses on 11th Street near Greenwich Street in 2002 and immediately began converting them into a single residence .
Initially , she intended to keep the renovations simple .
At one point , she aimed to limit the budget to about $ 500,000 , not that great a sum considering that the buildings contained more than 8,500 square feet of space .
She made token efforts to keep expenses down , Kellum says ; she once scolded him for bringing Starbucks iced cappuccinos to a construction meeting .
But as time went on , she continued to add expensive design elements , like having a sub - basement in which she could stand , rather than the original five - feet - high crawl space .
The budget grew accordingly .
On Friday , October 11 , 2002 , Kellum was busy coordinating Sarah ’s first birthday party , scheduled for the next day in Rhinebeck .
The plans included a petting zoo and performances by hipster kiddie singer Dan Zanes and country singer Rosanne Cash , who was being flown in to sing Sarah ’s favorite lullaby .
Leibovitz was upset because the forecast called for rain ; she did n’t want 300 mud-caked guests traipsing through the buildings .
Early that afternoon , Kellum had answered his phone to hear the panicked voice of Mark Zeff , the Greenwich Village project ’s designer .
Something had happened at the construction site .
For days , a crew had been digging below the townhouses to build the sub - basement .
The ground beneath the buildings had actually been underwater until 1820 , when landfill turned what had been the Hudson River into buildable land west of Hudson Street .
In the midst of the excavation , the wall Leibovitz ’s building shared with the little trapezoidal building at 311 West 11th Street groaned and sank several inches .
The wall separated from the floors , leaving a gaping hole .
Fire trucks encircled the scene , and Con Ed workers raced to locate and repair a burst gas line .
Insurance covered much of the damage , but the young family next door , whose home was immediately condemned , sued Leibovitz .
Under a settlement the parties reached in 2003 , Leibovitz would have to purchase their home for $ 1.87 million .
In late 2006 , she secured almost $ 7.25 million in mortgages from Rhinebeck Properties LLC , whose address is at Condé Nast ’s 4 Times Square headquarters .
As large as that sum was , Leibovitz , by all appearances , should have been able to cover it .
But that was n’t the case .
For one , Leibovitz was n’t earning as much as people thought .
The $ 5 million annual salary from Condé Nast ?
“ That ’s probably considerably high , ” says Carter , who adds that he does n’t know the exact sum because her contract is negotiated with Condé Nast , not Vanity Fair .
A person close to Leibovitz insists that her oft - mentioned “ contract for life ” is pure fiction .
In fact , a copy of Leibovitz ’s contract that came to light in a recent lawsuit indicates that she is being paid $ 2 million per year , and only through 2011 .
The rumored $ 250,000 day rate to do an advertising job also appears to have been greatly exaggerated .
“ It ’s not half that , ” says a source with direct knowledge of Leibovitz ’s finances .
Leibovitz was never particularly interested in side gigs either .
Despite a $ 100,000 price tag for commissioned portraits ( a business that kept Andy Warhol rich in middle age ) , there was always demand , says her former and recently rehired gallerist James Danziger .
Still , the hurdles involved tended to scare off potential clients .
Leibovitz might not take the job at all , if she did it could take years to schedule , and she had been known to cancel at the last minute to do a late - breaking Condé Nast assignment .
In 1990 , gallery owner Mary Boone paid Leibovitz $ 197,000 to take five portraits of artists she represented to promote her gallery .
For various reasons , Leibovitz shot only four portraits but promised Boone she ’d make good by taking a portrait of Boone ’s then - 5 - year - old son , Max .
In 2003 , thirteen years and several postponements after Leibovitz took the assignment , Boone sued Leibovitz .
A judge dismissed the suit , owing to a six - year statute of limitations .
Neither did Leibovitz behave as if the money to be earned in the fine - art market was worth the effort .
Edwynn Houk , her gallerist until last year , had no trouble selling her images .
Leibovitz , however , could never get around to signing the prints .
A buyer might have paid in full but still not get his picture for two years .
“ Nothing seems easier to me , ” Houk says of the stack of photos perpetually collecting dust in her studio .
“ It ’s a mystery why it took so long . ”
It was a complaint Houk was unable to register with Leibovitz directly because of her habit of postponing their scheduled calls .
“ Our record was sixteen months , ” he says with a sigh .
Says a onetime business associate , “ I think there was an element of satisfaction , thinking that everyone would just understand she was too busy meeting Tom Cruise here or Oprah there . ”
Leibovitz had also built a life that had become extraordinarily expensive to maintain .
It was n’t just the mortgages on the homes .
It was the Range Rover , the trips to Paris , the chef and housekeeper , the handyman , the personal yoga instructor , the terrace gardener , and the live - in nanny .
There was only one man Leibovitz deemed qualified to work on anything involving air - conditioning or ductwork at either residence , and he lived in Vermont .
“ She wanted her life to be like a magazine spread , ” Kellum says .
“ Everything beautiful , nothing out of place .
She wanted everything to be perfect . ”
Leibovitz was also famously generous with her family .
“ If I was in a bookstore with my sister , I would be afraid to even look at a book , ” says Leibovitz ’s younger sister Paula .
“ If I even looked at it , she ’d turn around and buy it for me . ”
When Marilyn Leibovitz was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2007 , Leibovitz rented her a house on the ocean so she ’d be able to hear the same surf she heard as a child summering on the Jersey shore .
It ’s impossible to account for all of Leibovitz ’s line - item expenses , but as surprising as it may be to outsiders , she was clearly spending beyond her means .
One close associate of Leibovitz ’s theorizes that she identified too much with her subjects .
“ Photographers are n’t professional athletes , recording artists , or supermodels , ” the source says .
“ Compared to 99 percent of the world , she makes a vast fortune .
The problem occurs when a person becomes so famous that they start feeling that they ’re more in line financially with Oprah or Madonna . ”
In 2004 , still in need of money to help pay for the $ 1.87 million purchase of the damaged Greenwich Village house , Leibovitz took out a bridge loan , a short - term , typically high - interest financial instrument .
The loan was intended to tide her over until she could sell her other properties .
Later that year , she sold the 26th Street studio for almost $ 11.4 million ; in 2005 , she sold the London Terrace penthouse .
Those sales must have generated millions in profit , but they still did n’t get her out of the red .
Leibovitz , like so many Americans during the boom years , had been taking out additional mortgages , heaping loan upon loan .
Before selling her photo studio , she ’d borrowed an additional $ 3.5 million against it , above the original $ 2.1 million mortgage .
The initial mortgage on the Rhinebeck property was about $ 1.8 million .
Eventually , she had some $ 11 million mortgaged against it .
She ’d bought the Greenwich Village property with a $ 1.2 million loan , and three years later tacked on an addition $ 2.2 million mortgage .
By last year , the total value of the mortgages she was carrying came to about $ 15 million .
Assuming she had a 5 percent 30 - year fixed - rate mortgage on that amount , her annual outlay just to service the debt on those loans would have come to almost $ 1 million .
Leibovitz also had tax problems .
Because of income taxes the IRS said Leibovitz had failed to pay , the agency attached liens on her properties totaling $ 1.9 million in 2005 and 2006 .
Dutchess County records show that she had also neglected to pay more than $ 92,000 in 2005 property taxes for the Rhinebeck place .
By the end of 2006 , Leibovitz needed money desperately and was probably unable to tap additional funds from traditional lenders .
Her only alternative was to find someone willing to lend her more .
Late that year , she secured two mortgages totaling almost $ 7.25 million from an entity called Rhinebeck Properties LLC , which had its address at Condé Nast ’s 4 Times Square headquarters .
Rumors had long circulated that Condé Nast offered its top executives low - interest loans , and at the time , the company was still flush — the following September ’s 754 - page issue of Vogue threatened to cripple mail carriers everywhere .
The cover featured a Leibovitz picture of Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette in a towering wig .
Leibovitz was probably too consumed to see any irony in the fact that she and a slew of assistants — as well as the documentary film crew following her — had traveled all the way to Versailles , the site of Marie Antoinette ’s last stand , to get their shot .
Leibovitz ’s financial - management team had long consisted of her agent , Jimmy Moffat , co-founder of the elite photo - representation agency Art +
Commerce , and her accountant , Rick Kantor .
Kantor declined to comment for this story , but Moffat says he and Kantor did all they could to discourage Leibovitz ’s rampant spending .
“ Did I or Rick or even Annie herself say all the time , ‘ We ’ve got to downsize ’ ?
Sure , ” he says .
The Greenwich Village townhouse , he points out , was supposed to be a form of scaling back .
The plan was to unload the London Terrace place and the 26th Street studio and buy one property in which she could both live and work .
“ Through ill planning or bad luck , it did n’t work out the way she wanted it to , ” Moffat says .
( Kantor declined to comment . )
In 2007 , Leibovitz decided to shake up her financial management .
Kantor was dispatched and replaced by a man named Kenneth Starr ( no relation to the prosecutor ) , who was something of a celebrity accountant , having managed money for Wesley Snipes , in his pre-tax - protesting days , and Sylvester Stallone .
In 2008 , with Leibovitz still seeking additional ways to borrow money , Starr told her about a company called Art Capital , founded by a New York entrepreneur named Ian Peck and co-owned by a man named Baird Ryan .
The son of a successful art dealer and a wealthy developer , Peck had run a Madison Avenue gallery called Ian Peck Fine Paintings , then during the dot - com boom he established a short - lived website called FineArtLease.com , which sought to lease rather than sell expensive paintings to corporate clients .
Formed in 1999 , Art Capital would eventually loan money for a short period of time — a year and a half or less , usually — often at a relatively high interest rate , using art and antiques as collateral .
For those who have most of their assets in art , particularly gallery owners and art dealers , this constituted a potentially valuable service , since banks are typically reluctant to loan against fine art and antiques because market valuations vary so wildly .
Art Capital , however , was willing to make loans of up to 50 percent of the value of the collateral , and since valuations were often done in - house , the loans could be turned around quickly , often within days .
Leibovitz , meanwhile , had fresh money problems .
Vendors whom she had n’t been able to pay began calling in the debts .
Zeff Design , the firm doing the Greenwich Village renovation , which had been sending Leibovitz bills for $ 51,000 for five years , finally sued her in 2008 .
Traditionally Leibovitz would submit claims to Condé Nast or an advertising client to cover her expenses .
The client would then reimburse her , and she would pay her vendors .
Now , it appeared , those payments were n’t making it out the door .
Brent Langton , a lighting specialist , sued Leibovitz , claiming his company was owed more than $ 221,000 for rentals in 2006 and 2007 .
An agency representing Nicoletta Santoro , a clothing stylist , also sued , saying it was owed over $ 385,000 .
According to a person familiar with the situation , after Leibovitz failed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars she owed Box Studios , an elite postproduction company , they insisted on billing Condé Nast directly .
“ You ’re not afraid of me , ” she said .
“ It ’s not fun anymore . ”
In June 2007 , Leibovitz arranged a meeting with Edwynn Houk and announced she wanted him to start selling her prints aggressively .
Houk had been selling her portraits of musicians like Iggy Pop and Johnny Cash for between $ 4,500 and $ 5,500 each , but Leibovitz needed to make much more than those prices could generate .
Together they decided to create a Master Set — 200 of her most iconic images , printed in a massive 40 - inch - by - 60 - inch format , limited to only seven prints each , and sold at $ 25,000 per print .
The total value of the set would come to $ 35 million .
About a year later , after premiering the first Master Set prints at Paris Photo , Houk got a call from one of Leibovitz ’s assistants informing him that , after a decade of working together , she was dropping him as her gallerist .
In mid-September 2008 , the auction house Phillips de Pury & Company proudly announced that it now represented Leibovitz , and its first order of business would be to premiere 24 images of the Master Set in its London gallery on October 23 .
The price of each print was now set at $ 33,000 .
When Leibovitz signed on with Phillips de Pury , Phillips management was unaware of a critical fact — one that it first learned about from a February 24 front - page story in the New York Times .
Headlined THAT OLD MASTER ?
IT ’S DOWN AT THE PAWNSHOP , the story reported that Leibovitz had taken two loans from Art Capital totaling $ 15.5 million ( the actual figure turned out to be even higher — $ 24 million ) .
In the same month in which Leibovitz had allowed Phillips de Pury to announce the partnership , it turns out , she had pawned at least some of the rights to her work as loan collateral .
In an agreement reached several months later , Art Capital appears to have become the only entity authorized to sell her photos .
( Leibovitz has since left Phillips de Pury and returned to James Danziger ; presumably Leibovitz and Danziger believe they still have or can regain the sales rights . )
The Art Capital loan effectively consolidated all of Leibovitz ’s major outstanding obligations , including her mortgages .
The interest rate is unknown , but the term is just one year .
That means Leibovitz has to come up with $ 24 million , plus interest , by this September .
Under the terms of the agreement , Art Capital could be entitled to up to 10 percent on the sale of Leibovitz ’s real estate and 15 percent on the sale of her work .
In the event Leibovitz defaults on the loan , a default commission of 25 percent , and after costs as low as 14 percent , would be realized . *
Goldman Sachs , which helped finance the loan , now seems to be distancing itself from Art Capital and reaching out to Leibovitz .
“ We are deeply troubled by recent developments concerning Annie Leibovitz and Art Capital , ” says Goldman spokeswoman Andrea Raphael .
“ Goldman Sachs owns a portion of the loan underwritten by an affiliate of Art Capital to Annie Leibovitz , but we have no involvement in the current sales - agreement dispute between Art Capital and Ms. Leibovitz .
We have proposed to Art Capital that we terminate the current loan agreement with their affiliate so that we can work directly with Ms. Leibovitz to help her resolve her financing needs . ”
Leibovitz has told people that she did n’t understand the ramifications of the agreement she signed .
She did not show the contract to any member of her family or even her agent before she signed it , nor did she hire her own attorney to review the document .
Instead she relied on an attorney whom Starr provided .
“ Trust me , ” says her sister Paula .
“ She thought it was a pure loan .
That New York Times article was as much news to her as it was to anybody else . ”
“ Ms. Leibovitz and a small army of her lawyers and financial advisers understood the terms of the deal , ” insists Montieth Illingworth , a spokesman for Art Capital .
“ It was discussed explicitly with her numerous times over several months .
Ms. Leibovitz signed her name five times to different documents in the transaction .
To say otherwise is not credible . ”
“ Annie is working to resolve the situation , so it would be inappropriate to comment , ” says Leibovitz ’s spokesman Matthew Hiltzik .
Art Capital has treated borrowers aggressively in the past .
In 2003 , the company loaned $ 1.5 million to a wealthy young widow named Melanie Gill — who had inherited a large collection of museum - quality furniture — so she could buy a hotel and spa in New Orleans .
After Gill missed one interest payment , Art Capital consigned her antiques to Christie ’s and foreclosed on and sold her apartment .
The chances of Leibovitz ’s getting out from under the pile of debt now looming over her seem slim .
At one point in time , Si Newhouse may have stepped forward to bail her out , but with Condé Nast suffering badly in the current economic climate , along with everyone else , it ’s hard to imagine that he would cover more than a portion of Leibovitz ’s debt .
One potential white knight , however , has emerged : Getty Images , the world ’s leading stock - photo agency .
For years , Getty had pursued Leibovitz unsuccessfully .
In January , Art Capital reached out to the agency to gauge its interest in purchasing the rights to Leibovitz ’s photo archive , which Art Capital now claimed to have the right to sell .
Art Capital believed the work was worth $ 50 million or so .
Getty offered $ 15 million .
The deal went nowhere .
On March 19 , Getty announced that it had entered into a business agreement with Leibovitz .
The deal , struck with Orchard Represents , Getty ’s advertising representation arm , called for Leibovitz to shoot eight photography assignments for $ 1.1 million .
Following the March press release from Getty , representatives from Art Capital began calling Leibovitz repeatedly to schedule a time when they could come over to the Greenwich Village townhouse to inspect her belongings and bring a real - estate agent who would be listing the place .
Leibovitz felt harassed by the calls .
Among other things , Leibovitz was not under the impression that she was going to have to sell her apartment .
In April , Art Capital sued Getty for breach of contract and fraud .
In essence , they argued that Getty had improperly used its dealings with Art Capital to strike its deal with Leibovitz .
Three months later , Art Capital filed suit against Leibovitz , charging that she had willfully ignored the terms of the loan by not allowing Art Capital into her house .
Getty has moved for the case to be dismissed ; a judge recently agreed to dismiss some of the charges , but not others .
Both cases are still pending .
Whatever happens , Leibovitz ’s life will obviously never be the same .
Paula Leibovitz thinks it ’s time for her sister to start over .
“ As a person from California , I ’ve been trying to get her to move out here , ” she says .
“ I keep telling her , everyone ’s really nice in California . ”
