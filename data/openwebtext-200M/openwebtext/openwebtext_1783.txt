While it may be in questionable taste to celebrate at this time of national disaster , with Iraq falling to pieces and the security of the United States compromised as never before , one ca n’t help but savor this delicious moment as the neoconservatives fall from their formerly dizzying heights .
Here ‘s Matthew Parris , in the London Times , sounding the call to gloat :
“ Hark  can you hear it ?
Borne on the wind , can you hear the sounds of construction  of hammers hammering and woodsaws sawing ?
And do you detect a note of panic ?
I do .
The good ship Neocon is going down .
She has struck the Iraqi rocks , the engine room is awash , and on the deck in anxious pursuit of something to float them away is a curious assembly . ”
The “ good ” ship Neocon is a pirate vessel , one that brazenly hoists the Jolly Roger and takes no prisoners : it patrols the sea - lanes in search of victims and , when it finds them , pounces without mercy or hesitation .
Up until now , it has evaded all attempts to corner and sink it , and its success is due , in no small part , to its many allies and well - wishers onshore .
Yet for those of us who see this crew as a prime candidate for sinking , the neocons ’ comeuppance on account of the collapse of the Iraq campaign is hardly enough .
Their disgrace , properly conceived , has barely begun .
After all , instead of taking responsibility and owning up to their authorship of the Great Iraq Disaster , they are taking refuge behind all sorts of rationalizations : we did n’t have enough troops , our strategy is n’t aggressive and destructive enough , the war is being lost in the hearts and minds of the American people and not on the battlefields of Iraq , the invasion was launched while the moon was in Pisces  the neocons are nothing if not inventive when engaged in the process of covering their asses .
Parris dispatches this narrative of “ a revolution betrayed ” with a few thrusts of his polemical ice pick :
“ The former hawks of press and politics now scramble for the status of visionaries let down by functionaries .
This is a lifeboat that will not float .
Let these visionaries understand that occupation is always brutal and usually resisted ; that occupying armies are always tactless , sometimes abusive , and usually boneheaded ; that in the argument between hands - on and hands - off you ’re damned if you do and damned if you do n’t ; and that the first , original , and central cause of the Iraq fiasco was not the bad manners of this or that poor , half - educated squaddie from Missouri , nor the finer points of this or that State Department doctrine of neocolonial administration .
“ The reason for failure was not the post - invasion strategy .
It was the strategy of invasion .
Blame the vision , not the execution . ”
Hear !
Hear !
Yet I have to wonder : is there really anyone who believes that occupations are n’t brutal ?
We have at least some evidence that they knew it and gloried in it .
The Ledeen Doctrine has its adherents .
But this alone does n’t adequately answer the question of why  if it was n’t those “ weapons of mass destruction , ” or Saddam ’s fabled “ links ” to al - Qaeda , or even the prospect of a drone attack on Passaic , New Jersey , as the president once implied , then what was it ?
Why did we ignore the best advice of our generals and the lessons of history to embark on a crusade that could n’t ever have been anything other than futile ?
Amid widespread bafflement , there are few plausible theories .
As Grover Norquist described the neocons ’ Iraq project :
“ Some people think we did it just to prove we could do it , like people who go running with weights on their ankles . ”
There is something to this : the Iraq war as an ideological exercise .
What better way to demonstrate the neoconservative concept of “ benevolent world hegemony ” than to invade , conquer , and occupy a country that had never attacked us and represented no threat to our territory or legitimate interests , just because we could ?
Still , it seems the warmongers would have paid rather more attention to the potential consequences , all of which were predicted well in advance by the war ’s critics , instead of acting with such reckless abandon .
You did n’t need to be an expert on the region to realize that a postwar Shia - dominated Iraq would soon be absorbed in large part by Iran , or that it would become a battlefield of sectarian feuding likely to culminate in full - scale civil war .
Nor can you convince me that the neocons really believed their own crude , Pollyanna - ish propaganda , which predicted that we’d be greeted with showers of rose petals rather than a hail of bullets .
As Parris notes , occupations are “ usually resisted , ” and you do n’t have to be a Clausewitz to realize the truth of that .
Donald Rumsfeld ’s “ bitter - enders ” and the portrait of the insurgency as a movement in its “ last throes ” were fictions believed least of all by their inventors .
Even today , the more brain - dead among our officials and pro-war pundits aver that we ’re “ making progress ” in Iraq , and that the war is still winnable .
Yet nobody believes this , and one thing is becoming increasingly clear : there was never any rational reason to think it would turn out otherwise .
It ’s funny , but in trying to understand how and why we got ourselves into this mess , I ca n’t help but recall the slogan of the “ 9/11 truth ” movement , which claims that the biggest terrorist attack in our history was “ an inside job . ”
I wo n’t go into my views on the nature and origins of this phenomenon except to provide this link , but I have to say that their “ inside job ” phraseology fits the “ Why are we in Iraq ? ” conundrum to a tee .
What Gen. William E. Odom calls the “ biggest military disaster in United States history ” was indeed an inside job , one carried out at the highest levels of American policymaking in spite of the alarm bells that were going off in the national security and intelligence apparatus .
It was a good job of breaking and entering , a burglary of world - historic significance , in which American foreign policy was hijacked .
In effect , a political coup took place right under our noses .
As Bob Woodward put it in Plan of Attack :
“ Powell felt Cheney and his allies  his chief aide , I. Lewis ‘ Scooter ’ Libby , Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas J. Feith and what Powell called Feith ’s ‘ Gestapo ’ office  had established what amounted to a separate government . ”
9/11 gave the neocons their golden opportunity to seize the reins of power , and they ran with it .
Their doctrine of “ transforming ” the Middle East , a Trotskyism - turned - inside - out that envisioned a “ global democratic revolution ” sparked by the “ liberation ” of Iraq , was a remedy that had finally found a problem .
Yet it is hard to imagine , now , that these ideological daydreams were sincere .
Elections in postwar Iraq were , at most , an afterthought : the idea was to install Iranian agent and neocon hero Ahmed Chalabi as the head of the new regime , and when that did n’t pan out the Americans ruled by means of a viceroy , first Jay Garner and then Paul Bremer , with a consultative council of anti-Saddam parties .
The idea was to hold faux “ elections ” according to what was deemed the “ caucus system . ”
This meant , in essence , that each province would select representatives from among the Americans ’ hand - picked local quislings , who would then elevate Washington ’s preordained choice to head up a government no more independent than Ukraine was during the Soviet era .
If the Ayatollah Sistani , the spiritual leader of Iraq ’s majority Shi’ites , had n’t called his followers out into the streets , those much - touted national elections would never have been held .
This horrific war was never about “ democracy , ” in spite of the best efforts of the neocons ’ kept theoreticians to convince us of the sincerity behind the effort .
Get behind the pretty phrases and the talk of school - building and look at what has actually occurred : the smashing up of the Iraqi nation into a pile of ethnic and religious splinters .
Warring factions fight over the rubble , and the entire region is being dragged into the burgeoning conflict  with U.S. soldiers , some 140,000 of them , smack dab in the middle of it all , sitting ducks for marauders of every persuasion .
The potential dimensions of the Iraq disaster were not altogether unknowable before the launching of the war , and my own view is that that they were known and utterly disregarded .
Ideology induces a kind of blindness , and this is an ailment neoconservatives are especially prone to ; it goes with the characteristic arrogance and undue self - regard that invariably colors their actions .
However , there ’s more to neoconservatism than a callous disregard for facts and a persistence that borders on mania .
The complete disregard for American interests  which can be measured in the rising U.S. casualty rate and the worldwide diplomatic and political “ blowback ” emanating from the decision to invade  goes beyond mere recklessness .
It ’s not as if they made an honest mistake : American interests did not enter into the calculations of key policymakers .
Other interests were paramount in the decision to go to war , and since we ’re talking about the neoconservatives , Israel was surely a major factor , if not the determining factor , pushing us into Iraq .
Israel ’s exemplary character and its key role as a U.S. ally are central canons of the neoconservative foreign policy prescription , and always have been .
This is only tangentially and coincidentally linked to religion : the Sparta of the Middle East embodies all the martial spirit and sense of “ national greatness ” that the neocons would love to see instilled right here in America .
Unconditional support for Israel has always been at the heart of the neocons ’
Middle Eastern strategy , and they have n’t made any bones about it .
One ca n’t help remembering this when we look at what has actually occurred in the region since the American invasion and note the winners and losers .
The biggest losers , of course , are the people of Iraq : 650,000 dead , by some estimates .
Iran , it ’s true , has extended its influence into Iraq , but at the price of a huge American force within a few days ’ march of Tehran .
Every regime in the region , including Egypt and much of North Africa , is feeling tremors of instability radiating outward from the smoking ruins of Iraq .
Geopolitically , there is but one winner in all this : Israel .
By now many are familiar with the “ Clean Break ” document authored by key U.S. policymakers for an Israeli prime minister .
It describes a scenario in which Iraq undergoes “ regime change ” and triggers a fundamental change in the region that spreads to Syria , Lebanon , and Iran .
These policymakers  neocons all  came to work for the Bush II administration and carried their agenda to Washington with them .
It used to be forbidden to say this , except for Michael Kinsley or Pat Buchanan  who were ignored and smeared , respectively .
However , as Philip Weiss , author of the indispensable “ Mondo Weiss ” in the New York Observer , trenchantly notes :
“ The times are changing .
Jimmy Carter ’s book is coming out , Leon Wieseltier and the New Republic spend half of Marty Peretz ’s hard - earned ink fighting Tony Judt .
Walt and Mearsheimer are doing a book for FSG .
George Soros and the Israel Policy Forum are starting a lobby to counter AIPAC , or maybe to be to the left of the Israeli government , in this country .
Perestroika . ”
The perestroika analogy is not exact : remember that the Soviets initiated perestroika , with Gorbachev pushing reform from above , while the partisans of what Mearsheimer and Walt call “ the Lobby ” are being dragged , kicking and screaming , to the realization that they can no longer dictate the terms of the debate by smearing their opponents as bigots .
Nor will their rather heavy - handed attempts to control the terms of the discussion over U.S. policy toward Israel be any longer tolerated , as this letter signed by a number of prominent intellectuals makes all too clear .
There ’s a lot they ca n’t get away with anymore , and it goes beyond the Judt - Mearsheimer - Walt controversy .
The AIPAC spy scandal  in which the top official at AIPAC , former pro-Israel spark plug Steve Rosen , and foreign policy analyst Keith Weissman were indicted for violating the Espionage Act  is the signal that the tide is turning against the Lobby .
If AIPAC survives the trial of Rosen and Weissman , I ’d be very surprised .
Perhaps the shell of the organization will still exist , once it ’s forced to register as an agent of a foreign power , but it will have nowhere near its former effectiveness  which is perhaps why a new , more “ liberal ” version is reportedly in the works .
In spite of crude attempts to mask what amounted to spying for Israel in the pure white raiment of “ free speech , ” it seems clear from the facts presented in the indictment [ . pdf ] and what has been reported in the media that the team of Rosen and Weissman routinely met with government officials and sought to extract classified information from them , which they then transmitted to Israeli government officials , some of them associated with Israel ’s Washington embassy .
They were observed doing this on several occasions : their phone conversations were recorded , and they were followed by federal law enforcement officials as part of a long - standing investigation  dating years back  into Israel ’s covert activities in the U.S .
As I wrote in a piece for The American Conservative , the AIPAC case is the dorsal fin of something much larger lurking just below the surface .
This was indicated by hints of Israeli involvement in the faux “ intelligence ” that was funneled to the White House , Congress , and the American people by the secretive Office of Special Plans in the Pentagon .
According to former Pentagon analyst Karen Kwiatkowski , Israelis enjoyed rights of unrestricted access and did n’t bother to go through the process of signing in at high - level Pentagon meetings with U.S. officials .
It would n’t be the first time a foreign country undertook a successful propaganda effort to get us involved in an overseas war , as William Boyd recently pointed out in the Guardian .
Israel ’s amen corner in the U.S. , the neoconservatives who have taken over the GOP , and their allies in the supine Democratic Party  just as beholden to the Lobby  pushed hard for the invasion .
The Lobby ’s influence on Congress and the executive played a key role in taking us down the road to war , and we are n’t just talking about AIPAC ’s aboveground component .
What the AIPAC spy case shows is that Israel ’s American sock puppets also play a key role in gathering information , including classified information , as well as exercising their First Amendment rights by disseminating their opinions .
The Rosen - Weissman spy team is not an isolated case ; the FBI likely would n’t be investigating just two individuals over a span of several years .
Now we learn that none other than Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Calif. ) , a Democratic hawk who is the highest - ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee , is under investigation as part of the AIPAC spy probe .
One of her aides has already been suspended by the head of the House committee for reportedly leaking the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq to the New York Times just in time for the election .
However , the question raised by the Harman - AIPAC story is , who else did her office leak classified information to , and for what purpose ?
The second part of that question is at least partially answered by the Time magazine story on the Harman investigation : with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi looking to replace Harman on the committee , the hawkish Democrat undertook a campaign that enlisted AIPAC and such pro-Israel heavyweights as Haim Saban , who weighed in with a phone call urging Harman ’s retention .
It is n’t clear from the Time story exactly what the FBI ’s interest in all this is : on the surface , it seems like an ordinary lobbying effort .
Yet if AIPAC is seen as an instrument of Israel ’s covert activities in the U.S. , including gathering classified information , then it is n’t hard to imagine under what circumstances someone in Harman ’s office managed to persuade AIPAC to go to bat for the congresswoman .
A simple trade : classified intelligence for political support .
AIPAC ’s defenders have alleged that the prosecution of Rosen and Weissman amounts to “ persecution , ” that the two were just exercising their First Amendment rights .
Oh , they say , “ everybody does it ”  and therefore passing classified U.S. government memos around as if they were baseball cards ought not be prosecuted .
With the revelations of the Harman investigation , what “ everyone ” is doing , with AIPAC ’s assistance , is beginning to crystallize .
And it is n’t pretty .
If “ everybody ” does it , then “ everybody ” deserves a stiff jail term .
The Lobby is n’t just in the business of peddling a glorified , largely fictional portrait of Israel as America ’s valiant little “ democratic ” ally , which deserves unconditional support as it tyrannizes its Palestinian helots and rampages through Lebanon and occupied Palestine .
It is clearly also performing another service for the state of Israel , namely espionage .
Before the AIPAC investigation is through , it could cut a wide swath through the world of Washington politics , ensnaring members of both parties and exposing the true extent of Israel ’s fifth column in America .
I have to add that this new revelation , like the initial exposure of the AIPAC investigation , looks to me like a preemptive leak , a “ controlled burn , ” undertaken to obstruct the investigation and give the guilty some opportunity to cover their tracks .
These guys are professionals , and they ’re resisting exposure every inch of the way .
However , it looks to me like we have n’t heard the last of the Harman - AIPAC - espionage connection , and there ’s lots more to come .
South Korea has especially high attainment levels in education
It blames France and Germany which are criticised for mediocre education systems and their inherent class bias .
China and India , on the other hand , are starting to deliver " high skills at low costs and at an ever increasing pace " .
South Korea and Finland are highlighted as positive examples where investment in education has taken priority .
The report 's author , Andreas Schleicher from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , says the solution is clear for countries falling behind , like France and Germany - investment in education and skills .
There is no way for Europe to stop these rapidly developing countries from producing wave after wave of highly skilled graduates
Andreas Schleicher
" Education and skills will be key for Europe to achieve its ambitious goals , " he says .
" In short , if Europe wants to retain its competitive edge at the top of the global - value - added chain , the education system must be made more flexible , more effective and more easily accessible to a wider range of people . "
He adds that France and Germany , " which make up 35 % of the European Union 's 11.6 trillion euro economy , are no longer among the world 's leaders in developing knowledge and skills " .
Mr Schleicher praises the " miracle " of South Korea - a country which in the 1960s had a lower national income than Mexico and South American countries and sat near the bottom of the 30 OECD countries in terms of educational qualifications .
Demand
Today , 97 % of South Korea 's 25 to 34 - year - olds have high school education - the highest rate among the main industrialised countries .
He says South Korea was transformed by its positive response to a demand for education .
" When demand for education began to outpace supply , students were not sent home , " he said .
" Instead , class size and schooling hours were extended . "
Parents also invested in private tuition for their children .
" The incentives driving these reforms forward was a plethora of merit - based learning opportunities where progress depended on what children were able to do , not where they came from . "
Mr Schleicher says this differs from France , Germany and Italy , where class distinction is a cause for concern .
" Europeans from difficult socio- economic backgrounds do n't receive the same educational opportunities as children from rich and middle - class families , " the study said .
" In many countries , the data suggest that European schools reinforce existing socio-economic inequities . "
Class barrier
In Germany , for example , children in white - collar families are four times more likely to go on to higher education .
He says educators in Europe are also reluctant to change their ways , despite research .
" Education in Europe continues as a cottage industry , with practitioners working in isolation and building their practice on folk wisdom about what works , " he says .
His recommendations to help turn Europe around include :
2A/C
Psychotomimetic ( a word I am very sad to see does not have a wikipedia entry )
Hallucinogen ( ditto )
Entheogen
Psychedelic
When discussing psychoactive substances , terminology can be an occasionally touchy subject .
To pull an example out of a hat , although it is useful to describe a class of drugs by their effect -- such as the class of ' stimulants '-- it lacks utility in other settings .
For instance , if we 're sitting down and having a conversation about stimulants , it can make a huge difference which chemical class we 're talking about : are we talking about xanthine alkaloids , such as caffeine theophylline , or ( my personal favorite ) theobromine ?
Or are we talking about a phenethylamine such as amphetamine ?
Perhaps we wish to limit ourselves to abused stimulants , or to the class of stimulants that act on dopamine transporters : but then we still have to distinguish between the amphetamine - like drugs , which releases DA by opening the transporter , and cocaine , which simply blocks the transporter and thus inhibits DA reuptake .
Hopefully , you can see how this might make our conversation confusing were we to fail to be quite specific in our statements .
However , to the best of my knowledge , there 's no ongoing controversy to classification of stimulants ( feel free to correct me if I 'm wrong ) .
But theresome disagreement over another group , one which seems as though it should be fairly easy to identify .
So , a simple question for the audience : what do psilocybin LSD , and mescaline all have in common ?
If you answered that they are chemically similar , you 'd be wrong .
Psilocybin and LSD are both indole alkaloids , whereas peyote is another phenethylamine .
The difference between them is clear , hopefully even to the untrained eye : LSDPsilocybinMescalineFortunately , these drugs all have a common pharmacological target which is believed to be responsible for their common effect : they are all agonists of the 5HTsubtype of serotonin receptors .
This target is common to most drugs with a similar effect .
So we have a class of drugs whose primary effects are decently described in both popular and scientific literature -- albeit with an absence of precise characterization of long - term and secondary effects -- with a common pharmacological target .
So when we want to bring them up in polite conversation , how do we refer to them ?
One obvious answer would be to call them " serotonergic agonists of the 2A/ C receptor subtype , " or something similar .
This has many drawbacks , just to name a few : I can't expect anyone who is n't a neuroscientist to remember that for more than five minutes .
Of course , it could still be usable in the scientific literature : but believe it or not , even scientists generally prefer to have non-clunky , non-confusing terminology to refer to things by when possible .
So that 's right out , at least for our general purposes .
Now , this debate 's been going on for something like fifty years , and we have four main terms that still get tossed around ( each of which seems to still be used right now by at least a few people ) :
A true psychotomimetic drug would be one which causes a state mimicking psychosis or schizophrenia in an individual .
This was one of the first terms applied to LSD when it first appeared , as it was thought that LSD was in fact bringing on a psychosis - like state in the subject .
For a short time , researchers attempted to use it as a chemical model until it became apparent that something entirely different was going on .
These days , very few people would argue that this term is useful to describe the class of drugs we 're talking about ; but certainly there are still some out there Hallucinogen is , at this point , the most commonly used term .
But there is a dissatisfaction with it , which seems -- at least , to me -- to have been growing over the years .
The problem is that it , too , seems to be an inaccurate description of the effect of these drugs based on a poor understanding of the effects .
Despite the archetype of acidheads tripping out and staring at the pretty colors or interacting with things that are n't there , only a small percentage of users seems to actually report hallucinations .
Although many do report some form of altered perception , it is far from universal and generally limited to distortions of actually present objects -- and the user can generally recognize both what the object really is and that their senses are altering it .
A hallucination , on the other hand , is ideally something which literally is n't there .
As such , many have suggested that the term is better used to refer to tropane alkaloids such as atropine or scopolamine , which can induce visions that seem to be unrelated to one 's actual surroundings .
As such , those drugs are often referred to as the " true hallucinogens " to distinguish them from the more common and broader use of the term .
Another reason why it might be useful to limit the term is demonstrated by this page on eMedicine , the second site to come up after a google search for " hallucinogen " ; here , the category is applied so broadly that it might be more simply referred to as " all non -opiate illegal drugs .
"
Entheogen is a term that was coined in the late 70s specifically to counter the use of hallucinogen -- disliked because of its negative connotations with insanity -- and psychedelic ( which we 'll cover next ) -- disliked because of its association with 1960s drug culture .
It translates roughly as " causing the god within . "
Honestly ?
As the term 's use is currently advocated , it 's awful .
If reeks of having been developed as an attempt to improve PR for recreational use of a class of drugs ( even if that was n't the intent ) .
The problem is it 's a use - based term : any drug someone wishes to take for religious purposes can be viably deemed an entheogen .
The problem , of course , is that there are an endless variety of human religious practices : ultimately , in one context or another any drug could be an entheogen .
Attend a UDV ceremony , and consume the classic entheogen ayahuasca .
Then go over to your local reservation -- and depending on where you are , you may be able to sample the entheogen peyote or the entheogen tobacco .
Perhaps you feel like starting a new religion dedicated to the Roman gods Pan & Bacchus ?
If so , then at your bacchanalia you may wish to promote use of your group 's own entheogen , Viagra .
I hope you can see the dilemma : the term seems to be quite useful in an anthropological or archaeological context , but has little use when trying to refer to a class of drugs based on their pharmacological properties .
And finally , we have the last entry : psychedelic .
Although the term is still much less frequently used in the literature than hallucinogen ( for instance , I just did a PubMed search and got a single result for " psychedelic LSD 2006 " vs. 56 for " hallucinogen LSD 2006 " ) , I 've seen a number of people - - both in and out of the scientific arena -- advocating for its use .
Consider , for instance , the existence of MAPS : the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies .
The Heffter Research Institute also refers to the drugs they study as psychedelics .
The only problem with the term that critics usually point to is its negative associations with 1960's & 1970 's - era drug culture .
To my mind , this is n't a very good argument .
Psychedelic also has the advantage of being the most useful description of the state evoked by these drugs : " mind - manifesting .
" I admit that this debate is in certain respects almost entirely political .
Nonetheless , the terms one chooses to use do have a certain power to them , especially the power to guide how the public thinks about them .
In that respect , all of these terms have major drawbacks : but nonetheless , research into many of them is starting to pick up some serious momentum .
So the scientific community may either be ultimately forced to recover one of these terms in the public eye , or come up with yet another term to describe them -- and hope that it 's both accurate and that it does n't immediately become associated with drug culture .
The e-mail , which Wal - Mart spokesman Dan Fogleman said was genuine , said Wal - Mart had to act as a global organization in a world with many different practices .
" The colors associated with Christmas red and white are actually a representation of the aminita mascera ( sic ) mushroom .
Santa is also borrowed from the Caucuses ( sic ) , mistletoe from the Celts , yule log from the Goths , the time from the Visigoth and the tree from the worship of Baal .
It is a wide wide world , " said the e-mail , from a customer service worker identified only as Kirby .
Fogleman said Thursday that Kirby no longer worked for the company .
[ emphasis added ]
Kirby may have gotten some of the details wrong ( for example , I 'm almost certain Santa Claus is German ) , but the basic message that the American Christmas celebration has been influenced by many other cultures is absolutely correct .
One of my favorite history books ( and I read a lot of them ) is Stephen Nissenbaum 's The Battle for Christmas .
It outlines the story of many invented Christmas traditions that we still practice today .
Bottom line : Kirby told the truth and Wal - Mart caved in to the religious right by firing him for it .
I think it 's hilarious that the leader of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights is demanding more concessions :
" We want a ) an apology for insulting Christians by effectively banning Christmas and b ) a withdrawal of its insane statement regarding the origins of Christmas and c ) a revision on its website , " Catholic League President Bill Donohue said on the group 's Web site .
In an interview , Donohue dismissed Wal - Mart 's statement that it was respecting multiple beliefs as " corporate arrogance . "
" If Wal - Mart , which is the family - friendly institution , gets away with this , then all the other department stores will just fall into line , " he told The Associated Press on Thursday .
Wal - Mart is getting exactly what it deserves from this direction .
Continually cater to the whims of the religious right and they will think they own you in no time .
But what about the left ?
I smell an educational moment here .
This could be the historical version of the argument over Intelligent Design .
I want to see Kirby and Stephen Nissenbaum on CNN explaining to Christian conservatives everywhere their own history .
Let 's see them try to deny the evidence when they have to confront irrefutable historical facts .

Had Vowed To Fight On , Even If Indicted ; Now Says He 's Quitting For The Good Of His Family
Flip - Flopper ?? ...
In the meantime , with DeLay and Ney gone , Tom Feeney is the only remaining congressman to have accompanied Jack Abramoff to Scotland !

According to ABC News and AP : Bob Ney Wo n't Seek Re-Election
COLUMBUS , Ohio Aug 7 , 2006 ( AP ) — U.S. Rep. Bob Ney , dogged by an influence peddling probe in Washington , will not seek re-election , state Sen.
Joy Padgett said early Monday .
AP writer Joe Danborn has some other details , including :
The six - term congressman from Heath in central Ohio had insisted he would not resign even if indicted over his dealings with now - convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
In his first primary test in a decade , Ney won 68 percent of the vote May 2 against a little - known opponent .
However , he faced a tough challenge in November from Democrat Zack Space , who had made the Justice Department 's investigation into Ney a focus of his campaign .
The Pittsburgh Tribune Review has more , including some quotes from an exclusive interview with Ney : Ney drops out of fall race
Ney has not been charged with a crime , and he insists he did nothing wrong .
But his former chief of staff , Neil Volz , who left to join Abramoff 's team , pleaded guilty in May to conspiring to use gifts and trips to influence Ney 's official activities .
Volz said he and other Abramoff associates provided Ney and members of his staff with free or reduced - price trips to England , Scotland and the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe , Ariz .
Who went on that trip to Scotland ?
Let 's see ...
There 's Tom Delay ... oops !
He 's not in Congress anymore , is he ?
Then there 's Bob Ney ... and oops !
Soon he wo n't be in Congress anymore either .
Soon , the only one of the three who will still be in Congress is Tom Feeney .
And we have to wonder how long that will last ...
According to U.S. Department of Justice court filings ,
Ney in return met with the secretary of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development on behalf of an Abramoff client , helped another obtain a Congressional Gold Medal , assisted another 's attempt to obtain a visa and provided other assistance .
Nothing wrong !
Nope !
There 's nothing wrong with any of this !!
Psst !
Hey buddy --- you wanna buy a Congressional Gold Medal ?
Nothing wrong !
Nope !
Nothing wrong here !
Trust me : Nobody 's doing anything wrong !
Just keep walking , just keep walking ...
In May , the House Ethics Committee announced it was investigating Ney and Rep. William Jefferson , D - Louisiana , another lawmaker with Abramoff ties .
Abramoff is serving a 70 - month prison sentence after pleading guilty in January to federal fraud and corruption charges related to the 2000 purchase of the SunCruz Casinos gambling fleet .
Ney is widely acknowledged as being " Representative No. 1 " in court documents that detail spending by Abramoff , including a golfing trip to Scotland , a trip to the Super Bowl and campaign contributions .
Ney , who called Abramoff " dishonest and duplicitous , " said he was misled by the lobbyist and his business partners .
What ?
Abramoff " dishonest and duplicitous " ?
Is there no honor among these thieves ?
Color me shocked !!
Ney was vague about his future plans .
" I have some options in the nongovernment sector , " he said .
I 'm sure he does .
Bob Ney 's credentials --- including his selecton by CREW as one of top 13 Most Corrupt Members of Congress --- will serve him well in the private sector .
Regular BRAD BLOG readers will remember that we have been covering this story for a long time now .
For more background on today 's news , start here .

So Bill Clinton , rather than just breaking the law as Bush did ( then again , perhaps this is why Bush broke the law - he knew from history that the Republicans controlling the congress would oppose his efforts to expand wiretapping ) , decided to go to the Republican congress in 1996 and ask them for increased authority to do more eavesdropping in order to stop the terrorists - stop September 11 .
Senior Republican Senator Orrin Hatch , one of the GOP 's top picks for the Supreme Court and a GOP committee chair , objected .
The Republicans stopped President Clinton from getting all the tools he needed to stop the next September 11 - well , no , actually they opposed giving President Clinton all the tools he needed to stop the actual September 11 .
Clinton could SAVE several billions instead of spending a meagerly $ 100 million by curbing U.S. terrorism with its predictable response from others .
How ?
Stop what we 're doing around the world .
It 's dangerous to formulate national security and foreign policies under conditions of hysteria and election - year politics .
More important than protecting the commercial circus in Atlanta , or even airliners , is the need to protect the Constitution and citizen 's rights from abridgement .
Every time there is a crisis , real or imagined , those Americans who yearn for more powerful central government , or those who long to impose their moral views on others - demand curtailment of rights .
This week , it 's FBI wiretaps without court orders , joining NSA monitoring of all international calls and faxes ; and demands that alleged ' terrorist ' information be banned from the Internet .
But as the Clinton administration plunges ahead with its anti-terrorist crusade , it is worth recalling one lesson that the rest of us have learned .
You do not beat terrorists by aping their vicious tactics and riding roughshod over civil liberties to establish a police state .
You beat terrorism , or contain it , by upholding the rule of law and democratic decencies - by being the good guys .
The moment we become the bad guys , then the bad guys have won .
( To read the rest , click " Permalink " below )
Oh , yeah , the plan : the best - kept " secret " of our overly - governmentalized age is that terrorism almost invariably _reactionary_ ; simply stop doing things -- things you should n't be doing anyway -- that cause terrorists to attack you and the attacks will stop .
Terrorism is the price that governments -- and their hostage subjects -- pay for exercising illegitimate power .
Despite pundits whose ignorance is exceeded only by their presumption ( _Wall Street Journal_ 's Paul Gigot leaps immediately to mind ) 20th century history demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that no further expansion of that power will do anything but make make the problem worse .
Behind virtually every terrorist attack we 've ever seen or suffered , it 's relatively easy to discover vicious and repeated acts of aggression against innocent individuals by the state .
Preceeding the highly - publicized excesses of the Irish Republican Army , for example , we find 850 years of violent occupation by an exceptionally brutal foreign power that 's managed to con the world into believing that it 's civilized .
Half a hundred years of Middle Eastern terror arise directly from the fact that , instead of coming to America -- the appropriate refuge for " huddled masses yearning to breathe free " -- either before or after World War II , European Jews decided to take somebody else 's landaway , and treat their victims the same way they themselves were treated by the Nazis .
I truly believed that the politicians drafting the legislation that : continues to chip away at our rights were motivated by humanitarian : reasons , it might be easier to forgive their misguided efforts ; : however , I do n't think they 're all as stupid as some of their : legislation would make them appear to be , so I am forced to question : their real motives .
And they never seem to miss a chance to ride a : public tragedy to advance their cause .
The Reno letter objects to " terrorists " being given rights .
But that assumes guilt .
The whole idea of our constitutional system is that people should have a fair chance to answer charges before they are convicted .
Does Janet Reno think we should ignore the Fourth and Fifth and Sixth Amendments because they protect " criminals " ?
Does Bill Clinton ?
Even before the terrorism bill , with its habeas corpus and numerous other repressive provisions , the Administration had shown a cavalier disregard for civil liberties .
The administration has asked for authority to prevent terrorist groups from raising money in the United States , the right to deport immediately foreigners who support terrorist activities , high - tech surveillance and other tools for law enforcement officials , and the right to mark chemically the explosive materials terrorists use to build bombs , enabling them to be traced .
But Republicans in Congress opposed Clinton 's bill because they feared it would give too much power to law enforcement and government .
Politicians sacrificing the Bill of Rights on the media- reelection alter need to understand there is a cost to treason against this nation and its Constitution , and that the down - payment will come due with this Fall 's election .
We covered the " terrorism bill " in the Security column of our 11 Sep. 1995 issue .
In our view , it remains a bill designed mainly to assist the government in terrorizing its own citizens through increased and unconstitutional prohibitions on their freedoms .
It does nothing to impede terrorism , and all such actions -- blowing up people and buildings -- are already crimes punishable under state and local laws .
As we have repeatedly stated , terrorism is an outgrowth of foreign policy .
The efforts of elected officials to trade " terrorism prevention " for the increased government power is as old as history .
Benjamin Franklin said it well : " Those who would forfeit essential liberty for temporary safety , deserve neither liberty or safety . "
The Anti-Terrorist bill is a hysterical over - reaction which has the potential to destroy the United States .
First , the definition of " terrorist " could include almost anyone or any organization .
Those individuals could be denied the right to free speech , the right to gather , the right to legal counsel , the right to face their accusers , the right to a fair trial and the right to personal property - WITHOUT COURT ACTION .
Simply put , the officer becomes judge , jury and executioner .
Federal powers under the Clinton Anti-Terrorist act would allow for loose rules of engagement ( ie ... shoot on sight ) and submission of evidence gathered illegally ( ie ... wire taps and break ins ) .
Federal law enforcement would have the power to search and seize any property or information without warrant .
In addition , the bill will also authorize the use of U.S. military forces against U.S. civilians , including air support , tanks , and armed troops .
The House Freshman rejected the Terrorist act and rightly so .
They recognized the danger of a President with unlimited power .
Anti-terrorist hysteria has become the excuse for governmental attempts to circumvent online freedom of expression , guaranteed by constitutions , laws , and the UN Declaration of Human Rights .
Continuing with our potpourri of 1996 conservative opinion on terror :
As you probably know , ABC plans to commemorate 9/11 with a lying " docudrama " designed to portray Bill Clinton as soft on terrorism .
As a small counter to this assault on history , Raw Story reminds its readers of this AmericaBlog entry
This foray into recent history prompted me to fire up Google Groups in order to see what Clinton 's conservative opponents were saying about terrorism ten years ago .
Below , you will find a hastily - compiled selection of excerpts .
Some of these comments were written directly for usenet , others are quotes from web sites or printed sources .
In order to convey an impressionistic sense of how conservatives thought at that time , I 've decided to forego names and dates ; if you want full context , fire up Google for yourself .
All the quotes appeared somewhere on usenet during 1996 .
Those of you old enough to recall those days will testify that these sentiments were widely shared in conservative circles .
As you read , ask yourself if you can imagine any of our modern death - to - Islam types saying such things about Bush or the current world situation :
Every four years it 's the same .
The hand of God , the sending off , the miskick that finds only our net - the fluke that shatters the dream .
Each World Cup some freakish incident dashes England 's hopes with such predictable regularity that the only truly surprising thing is the surprise itself .
Rather than resign ourselves to the fact that our national team is good , but not that good , we delve into the detail of each particular defeat as though it alone holds the key to us winning the trophy in four years ' time .
Both logically and statistically there is only so long that we can continue to describe a regular occurrence as anomalous and still be taken seriously .
To treat the consistent as aberrant not only defies common sense but prevents any intelligent assessment of the nature and scale of the problem at hand .
So it is with the slew of alleged atrocities committed by the US military in Iraq .
Many have produced their own investigation , occasionally their own sanction , and inevitably their own version of shock and bore among the American public .
Amazement that American soldiers could be involved in such despicable actions is soon followed by a lack of interest in the consequences .
Last week the US military charged eight marines with kidnapping and murdering a disabled Iraqi civilian in Hamdania on April 26 .
According to the charges , they dragged Hashim Ibrahim Awad , otherwise known as " Hashim the lame " because of the metal plate in his leg , from his home and bound his feet and hands .
Locals say the marines then shot him four times in the face .
According to prosecutors they put an AK47 and a shovel next to his body to make it look as though he had been digging a hole to plant a roadside bomb .
This is not to be confused with the alleged execution of 11 Iraqi civilians , including four children , near the city of Balad .
Or the investigation into the murder of three Iraqis held in custody in Salahaddin province , north of Baghdad .
Or the two soldiers charged in connection with the murder of an unarmed man near Ramadi who then placed an AK47 next to his body .
Which , in turn , should not be mistaken for the atrocities at Haditha , where marines killed 24 civilians - including 10 women and children and an old man in a wheelchair .
Let us leave aside for the moment that these are just a few of the atrocities reported in Iraq , that there have almost certainly been atrocities that have n't come to light and that untold thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed by US forces in conditions considered insufficiently atrocious to be worthy of investigation .
To treat even these few incidents as isolated chapters is to miss the broader , enduring narrative .
For these are not the unfathomable offshoots of this war but the entirely foreseeable corollaries of it .
This is what occupation is ; this is what occupation does .
There is nothing specifically American about it .
Any nation that occupies another by force will meet resistance .
For that resistance to be effective , it must have deep roots in local communities where opposition to the occupation is widespread .
Unable to distinguish between insurgent and civilian , occupiers will regard all civilians as potential insurgents and all territory as enemy territory .
" Saying who 's a civilian or a ' muj ' [ mujahideen ] in Iraq , you really can't , " one marine under investigation told the New York Times recently .
" This town did not want us there at all . "
Under these circumstances , dead women , children and disabled people are the price you pay for being invaded .
Take Haditha .
It lies deep in the Sunni - dominated Anbar province , where several US troops have been killed by insurgents .
On November 19 a 13 - man squad of marines were about two miles from their base when a roadside bomb exploded , killing one soldier and seriously injuring two others .
Civilian survivors say the marines then went on the rampage , killing five unarmed men in a car and bursting into houses and shooting people at close range as they tried to protect their children or prayed for their lives .
The death certificates describe well - aimed shots to the head and chest : a massacre by any definition of the word .
" I think they were just blinded by hate ... and they just lost control , " said James Crossan , one of the injured marines , referring to his colleagues .
The US squad leader now under investigation describes things differently .
He says that after the bombing he saw young men jump out of a white car and run away .
So he shot them , understanding that the rules of engagement allowed him to shoot men of military age running away from the site of a bombing .
Then , believing they were under fire from nearby houses , he says , they broke into a house .
One threw a grenade into a room where they heard voices while another sprayed the room with gunfire .
This is called " prepping the room " .
They murdered seven civilians , including a four - year - old boy .
They claim they then saw a back door open and , believing they were in " hot pursuit " of a gunman , broke into a second house and prepped another room , killing eight civilians , including two women and five children aged from three to 14 .
The imperialist " wears a mask " , wrote George Orwell , " and his face grows to fit it " .
Bear in mind that this is the marines ' account , according to their lawyers - in other words , the account they feel puts them in the best possible light .
Let 's assume they were telling the truth .
Given everything we know about the treatment of Iraqi prisoners by the US , what military - aged Iraqi male in his right mind would not run from a battalion of American soldiers after a bomb has gone off ?
How does blindly spraying a room of civilians with gunfire square with winning hearts and minds ?
After Haditha was exposed , the US military pledged to provide its troops with a course on " core warrior values " to ensure they were aware of battlefield ethics .
But the problem is not just that these marines did not play it by the book - the book itself is the problem .
These atrocities are not contrary to the ethics of this particular occupation but the natural and inevitable consequence of it .
In response to news of Haditha , George Bush said : " If , in fact , laws were broken , there will be punishment ...
The challenge for us is to make sure the actions of a few do not tarnish the good work of the many . "
International law was broken but there will be no punishment .
The few who are responsible remain in the White House while the many who are embroiled in the conflict are brutalised or murdered , or both .
" You 've got to do whatever it takes to get home , " said one marine .
" If it takes clearing by fire where there 's civilians , that 's it . "
There is , of course , another option .
Just go home .
If the wanton murder of civilians is what it takes to complete your mission , there is clearly something wrong with the mission .
You can only talk about a few bad apples for so long before you need to take a serious look at the barrel .

User delight and the guy - from - the - train phenomenon
One way to delight users is with the guy - in - the - unexpected - context phenomenon .
You know the story : you take the same train to work every day .
One Saturday afternoon you 're in a cafe when you spot a familiar face at the next table .
" Hey , it 's the guy from the train ! " you think , with a smile .
Then the guy from the train notices you , and his eyes light up .
You start a lively conversation moving from weather to espresso to geopolitical forces .
You exchange URLs .
The thing is , you took the train with this guy for the last 18 months and never gave him a moment 's thought ... until you saw him at the cafe .
That 's the power of unexpected context .
Even if you do n't talk to the guy , seeing him in a completely different context is enough to make your brain light up .
A feeling of delight .
And it's that feeling of delight we ( and our users ) love .
[ Disclaimer : common sense and logic apply .
Say you 're at a bluegrass concert and see the last person you 'd expect : your ex-boyfriend , clearly on a hot date .
This is the same ex who told you he'd start taking hostages if a banjo was involved .
Not all out - of - context surprises are delightful . ]
The unexpected context can be a Big Deal , like an airline letting you make a change to your flight without slapping a huge change fee on you and -- much weirder -- giving you a refund credit if your new fare is less than your original flight .
You expect this kind of treatment from Nordstrom's .
But in the context of an airline ?
[ See JetBlue change rules ]
Any company with way over the top customer service ( for that domain ) is giving its users an unexpected , delightful surprise .
Something to remember .
Something to talk about .
But even the subtle out - of - context surprise can trigger some neurons and brain chemistry .
A reference to one movie slipped into the dialogue of ... another movie .
An easter egg hidden in a ... logo ( like the FedEx one ) .
A bud vase in a ... car .
It 's not about the thing -- it 's about the context in which that thing is expressed .
Some examples , big and small :
Context :
Wine bottle label
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise :
The label is a cartoon ... by Hugh from GapingVoid
Context : Geek Conference
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise : Delivered on a cruise ship and turns out to be less expensive than attending a similar conference held at a hotel .
[ See Geek Cruises , which I recommend ]
Context : A Microsoft guy giving a conference presentation
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise : He 's a Really Nice Guy !
With kids even !
Tony Chor was a highlight for many of us at Webstock , myself included , who were n't expecting someone quite so fun , down - to - earth , approachable , and , well , cute .
Then again every employee of Microsoft I 've actually talked to seems to be a Really Nice Person .
Context : A technical business presentation
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise :
It 's informative and entertaining
[ If you have a chance to catch Damian Conway or Joel Spolsky give a presentation , do n't miss it ! ]
Context : Geek / Tech discussion board
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise :
The people are friendly .
No question is too dumb , no answer too lame .
[ See Javaranch , where a simple ( but heavily enforced ) " Be Nice " policy is responsible for the success of this programming community with more than a half - million unique visitors each MONTH .
You read that right . ]
Context : Sales - tracking software purchase , direct from the publisher
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise :
Not only do they get the software to you the next day -- after you plead that it 's a birthday gift -- but the first time the birthday guy launches it , a Happy Birthday song is programmed in the start - up screen !
[ True story - - developer Gregg Sanderson went way beyond expectations first by getting it out within , like , minutes after I called ... but he also managed to ( unrequested ) modify the start - up screen resource of his Market Master sales support software .
And when a magazine a few months later did a write - up on the software and wanted a quote from a customer ... who do you think Gregg had them call ?
A person ( me ) who still raves about the experience almost 15 years later ! ]
Context : Car dealer
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise : Fresh - baked cookies brought to your door a week after buying a new car .
[ That happened to my father , after buying a new Honda .
When some random guy walked up the steps with cookies , the last thing my father expected was a " How 's the car and thank you very much and here 's some cookies to show our appreciation " thing .
In the US , Girl Scouts , not car dealers , bring cookies . ]
Context : Rock concert -- successful indie band
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise :
The lead singer calls out the names of long - time regulars from the fan message board who said they were going to be there .
That happened to my daughter at a Travis show in Denver .
Context : Travel Trailer
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise :
The interior could be in the museum of modern art .
( Or at least an IKEA store ... )
That 's what Airstream did when they got the award - winning modern designer / architect Christopher Deam to design a line of CCD Airstreams .
This wildly - successful approach has Airstream singlehandedly enlarging the travel trailer market by orders of magnitude .
Where one typically associates ( accurately , as the demographic data shows ) RVs and travel trailers with , well , retired grandparents ... the average CCD buyer is around half the age of the traditional trailer / RV purchaser .
Celebrity Airstream owners include Tom Hanks , Andy Garcia , Tim Burton , Sean Penn , and Matthew McConaughey , who travelled in one more than 8,000 miles to promote a movie .
[ Apparently others share my Airstream lust , including Peter Davidson 's Alumnium Obsession ( which mentions the latest special edition model , a surf - inspired partnership with QuickSilver ) .
FYI , I really like Peter 's blog .
And I try , every day , to not be jealous of Web Standards Mistress Dori Smith , whose frickin ' office is this 1957 Airstream . ]
Context : Geek Conference , pre-show tutorial
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise :
The only charge is a donation to charity .
[ That 's what the Rails guys did with their Rails Guidebook .
While I 'm here , you are considering the European Rails Conference , are you not ?
Context :
Off - the - shelf software packaging
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise :
There 's a special edition t- shirt inside the box , which has a special slot just for the shirt .
That 's what a now - extinct multimedia authoring tool named mTropolis ( an appbought and killed by Quark ) did .
The surprise of opening the box ( back in the days when software came in those hard cases ) and finding a slot for the discs , a slot for the manual , and -- what 's this ??!-- a slot with a t - shirt was such a treat .
Those t- shirts became very special to those of us who had them .
Context : Company that creates Business Presentations
Delightful Out - of - Context Surprise :
Their website includes a main menu choice for " Staff Tattoos "
Way past edgy Missing Link is the opposite of what you 'd ever expect from a company that does , well , PowerPoint .
If you can call it that .
Their ' tude - rich slogan is , " Do n't hire us because we 're fun and interesting .
Hire us because you 're not . "
I love these guys for not " selling out " even the tiniest bit , by acting more " corporate professional " .
They even swear .
On their blog .
Right there in front of God and prospective clients and everyone .
And finally , back to that bud vase .
Such a simple thing .
But something special for those passionate New Beetle owners , including the ones who figured out how to mod it to light up .
A few tips for out - of - context user delights : :
1 ) Take an attribute that 's normal and expected in one domain , and use it where it would not be expected .
( Example : VW bud vase , Stormhoek wine label , t- shirt in the mTropolis box )
2 ) Take an attribute in your domain that 's expected , and do the opposite .
( Example : the Missing Link business presentation guys , and how they 've turned the " professionalism " attribute on its head . )
Bonus points if that opposite thing is also something that lets users off the hook ( i.e. reduces guilt ) .
Example : the apartment building with the " Dogs Required " sign .
3 ) Do something completely out of character .
( Example : the Bryan Texas water quality report )
4 ) Combine two things that nobody would think to combine .
( Example : GeekCruises , the Installation Skateboard Shoe + Art Gallery )
5 ) Blow a stereotype
6 ) Add " meaning " where it 's not usually expected
( Example : Webstock conference .
Think about the name , and the slogan " Code for Freedom " .
If I had n't been there and spent so much time with the organizers / visionaries , I would have assumed it was just a marketing ploy .
It was n't .
They meant it .
Many attendees and speakers left that conference with not just renewed but new motivation and energy for improving user experiences in a way that really does help the world .
Nobody who saw Darren Fittler 's accessibility presentation , for example , walked away unchanged . )
7 ) Care about detail in the smallest of ways , and without using it as a marketing tool !
( Example : the HP calculators who 've had tactile feedback forever .
They did n't have to do it . )
8 ) " Sex it up " by adding beauty and / or sex appeal where it 's not expected .
Your ideas ?
[ And wow -- I 'm still sifting through the amazing and wonderful comments y'all left on my " what makes a popular blog post , and Dan 's two posts .
What a treat for me to come back to , after being completely off - the - grid for almost two weeks . ]

When you are doing all this , just do it !
Not because you have to .

Nice right but the knifes have his name , business adress and phone number which looks like a marketing material not a gift .

About JetBlue :
They are pretty amazing .
Not only are their fares lower than their competitors ' , their customer service is better .
If you call them , you get to talk to a real human who speaks real English and is nice and helpful .
Not only do n't you expect that from an airline , you certainly do n't expect it from a * low - cost * airline .
I am also happy that they * do n't* give you any " food " of a quality somewhere in the range from ' inedible ' to ' disgusting ' .
Do people really , honestly think that airline food is " free ' ?
Anyway , sorry for ranting .
I just wanted to say that JetBlue is an airline that I almost like .
I have nothing to with them , other than being a happy customer .

Welcome back , Kathy !
I 'm not sure if you read the " Bud Vase Features " post I wrote on Signal vs.
Noise last year , but it talks about the same example -- I think it 's a great one .
Your others are awesome as well .
Volkswagen totally nailed it with that feature ( but not , I think , since ) .
It seems like today 's equivalent is the Scion .
Tony Stubblebine just mentioned to me that the average buyer spends $ 4,000 on customization of the Scion (! maybe I heard the set qualifier incorrectly , but the number is right , apparently ) .
Zoinks .
Glad to have you ( and your posts ) back .

In a similar vein , SmallDog.com includes small plastic dogs with every order .
It 's not a big deal , but you bet that I keep them on the shelf above my desk , and they remind me that SmallDog is an option when I 'm buying stuff online .
( And glad you like the Airstream , but I 'm jealous of enough things about you in return ! )
Posted by : Dori | Jun 7 , 2006 10:14:54 PM
Marc ,
You 're right that I did say that the average Scion buyer puts $ 4000 into customization , but the closest I can come to real data is this Springwise post saying that they average $ 1200 in customization at the dealer ( 3 x the average ) .
Clearly they 're doing something right .
The two things that I struck me as out of context is that Scion 's are sold on a fixed price ( which is totally out of context for a car dealership ) and that there 's a massive amount of head room despite being one of the smaller cars on the market .

Oh how good it is to have you " home " !
Your passion is infectious and I sooo relate to this post - I have this thing about customer service .
I remember when it used to be called " going the extra mile " .
That dates me !
It 's so cool when the extra mile is uncalled for and totally left field .
I enjoyed the examples you give .
It 's just a pity that with your South African wine you did n't get the chance to sample a South African popcorn snack called Jumpin ' Jacks .
These guys have a wacky little shpiel on their packaging about the ingredients and their business philosophy that makes you want to go and work for them .
Never before had I enjoyed reading the back of a packet quite so much .

Speaking of Joel Spolsky , I stumbled across a book by him recently titled " The Best Software Writing I " .
This is a collection of essays , about software and the software industry , by articulate developers who write well .
Most are available on the web ; this brings them together in one place .
I have trouble putting it down .
Lots of opinions - many of them keynote speeches - leap about from coding styles to group management .
The mix itself adds to the attraction .
My favourite ( so far ) - " A group is its own worst enemy " which looks at the evolution of social software , such as blogs .
Must put book away and get to work ........

When you say ' Blow a stereotype ' what exactly do you mean ?
Maybe I 'm being dumb , or maybe I 'm having trouble getting my mind out of the gutter - either way I think I 'm missing something there .
Wonderful and inspirational post , though !

Hi Kathy ,
What a fantastic post to come back with , and good to see mTropolis getting a shout .
Now there was a product to get passionate about .
The finest piece of software I 've ever used ( t - shirt or no ) .

Veering off topic : we passed a silver motorhome the other day .
Not that common in the UK .
I do n't know if it was an Airstream , but I thought it was georgous .
I thought I was strange to think that , but I know I 'm not alone .

Wow .
One of the best posts I 've read in some time .
Long live the spirit of unboxing .

I ordered a pair of shoes from Zappos.com a few months ago .
I placed the order at 11:00 PM and paid for 1 - day shipping .
They were delivered to my house at 9:00 AM the next day !
It never even occurred to me that they would be shipped before the next business day .
New shoes in less than 12 hours ... it does n't get any better than that !

Thank you everyone yet again for so many great comments and for the welcome back !
( I 'm leaving again tomorrow , but this one is a much shorter trip to California , and I should have wifi ) .
Mahmoud :
Yes , yes !
If you delight your users , you wo n't NEED to give them something that constantly reminds them of your phone number ( and you 're right , that would probably just make things worse than if you 'd not given them the gift at all ) .
Johannes : you 've known me way too long and too well for that ; )
Besides , you KNOW who answers the email around here ...
Henry : Good for CD
Baby inspiring you to make that comment , and thanks for not spoiling the surprise : )
Side note : my latest post ( the one after this one ) includes a link to something Derek said .
CDBaby rocks .
Marc : I had n't read that one , thanks .
My next door neighbor got a Scion recently .
We had never spoken before ( other than the usual apologies about our respective dogs ' behavior ) , but when I saw the Scion I just casually mentioned it ( while taking out the trash ) , and OH MAN -- the guy launched into a 45 - minute tour .
It was not boring , though -- he was so excited and seriously into it with all the little special customized things .
And he's out there washing and polishing it and buffing it way too often .
Dori : that 's too cute : )
Karyn :
Hey , it dates me too then -- because even if I do n't say it I still * think * " going the extra mile " ; ) Jumpin Jacks ?
Where do I get those ?
Bren : I can relate .
I 'm just glad that his * talks * are n't more than an hour , because I could also listen to him all day .
Luddite Geek :
Thanks for the frisbee / flag example -- what a great way to launch something ...
Joel :
The PBJ in the luxury hotel is now at the very TOP of my list for best examples of this .
You painted an evocative picture ... rich oriental rugs , vast collection of antiques , and yet I can smell the peanut butter and imagine the jelly dripping onto the 600 - thread count egyptian cotton duvet ... ; )
Matt :
Your mind is definitely in the gutter .
( or perhaps mine was , subconsciously OF COURSE ) .
Replace " blow " with " break " ?
Nick : Someone who remembers mTropolis !
Oh , that makes me happy .
We should all have banded together and revolted ( or bought the company or something ) .
The only thing I liked as much as mTropolis was the equally - fated ScriptX multimedia language from that joint venture between Apple and IBM .
Just way too ahead of its time ( or rather way too ahead of processing power ) .
Paul :
If it was silver and gorgeous , and with a retro feel , it was most definitely an Airstream .
Ryan : I did n't even know there WAS such a term as " unboxing " ( except in the Java 5.0 new language features ) .
I even found the " unboxing " website .
I wish I 'd taken photos of my whole experience .
I swear sometimes I want to order new Apple products JUST for the Unboxing .
If my daughter ever " accidentally " opens a UPS box with Apple on the label , and performs the Unboxing without me , she 's grounded for a year .
Steph : thanks for the real - life confirmation .
I 've been trying to peek in the windows of New Beetles whenever I see one in a parking lot .
Unfortunately there are only three kinds of vehicles in Boulder , CO : Pickup , SUV , Subaru .
There 's some kind of law , I think ...
slugabed : 12 hours from order to delivery ?
That 's got to be some kind of record !
Cheers and thanks everyone .

I think that most humor works like this too -- you think you know where it 's going , and then surprise !
You were n't expecting that .
There 's some interesting research about the impact of surprise on the midbrain and dopamine levels ( Reed Montague , Wolfram Schultz ) that supports the idea that people are built to have a positive reaction to pleasant surprises .

Firefly ,
the anti-Trek
All of the disturbing characteristics of the Star Trek shows , the militarism , collectivism , anti-capitalism , and atheism , are notably missing from the excellent but shortlived series Firefly .
Firefly only aired on the Fox network for three months at the end of 2002 .
Fourteen episodes were filmed , including the two hour pilot .
Three of the episodes were never aired , and the others were shown out of sequence , even though they contained elements from previous episodes .
This must have been particularly confusing as the show was trying to find an audience .
The pilot , which introduced all the characters , was shown last , after the series had been cancelled .
Despite the cancellation , the shows had found an audience , which rallied in defense of the series .
Although it was too late for Fox , the creator of the show , Joss Whedon , used the enthusiasm of the fans to persuade Universal to continue the series as a movie , Serenity , which was released in 2005 .
The movie did n't have the greatest box office , but together with the series it lives , of course , on video , where sales have continued to be strong , better than some recent pretigious movies .
Hopefully , the continued support of old fans , and the acquisition of new fans , like myself , will allow the story to return to some medium in some form -- just like Star Trek .
Unlike the starship Enterprise , a powerful warship of the United Federation of Planets , the ship Serenity is a small , private " Firefly " class transport with no weapons -- except the hand weapons of the crew .
The captain and first officer , Malcolm ( Nathan Fillion ) and Zoe ( Gina Torres , the statuesque , sexually smoking , and real life wife of Laurence Fishborne , " Morpheus " of The Matrix ) , are veterans of the attempt to prevent the vast Alliance of planets from taking over their own worlds .
They were fighting with the " Independents , " the " Brown Coats , " and the ship is named after the battle of Serenity Valley , where the Independents all but lost the war against the Alliance .
Now , Malcolm , Zoe , and the rest of crew eek out a living with small shipping jobs , smuggling , and theft under the unwelcome eye of Alliance cruisers and " fed " policemen .
In the pilot , they also take aboard two fugitives from the law , a brother and sister , Simon ( Sean Maher ) and River ( Summer Glau ) .
Simon is a physican who rescued River from an Alliance " academy " where sinister police - state men with " hands of blue " were modifying her brain to turn her into a psychic and a " Manchurian candidate " - like assassin .
This initially left her in a state of psychosis , from which she gradually emerges and becomes aware of her psychic abilities and powers of combat -- in the movie she all but becomes Buffy the Vampire Slayer ( Whedon 's previous TV series ) .
None of this makes the Alliance look very good .
Whedon wants to make it clear , however , that he does n't think of the Alliance as evil ( although the men with " hands of blue " are evil enough for the Third Reich , and the Alliance soldiers wear German - looking helmets , while the helmets of Independants look like WWII American ones ) , but rather as something perhaps too big for its own good , or the good of its citizens .
Indeed , while the Alliance countenances slavery and indentured servitude , Serenity and the crew are as often saved by the inefficiency , indifference , or corruption of the authorities as by any official benevolence or justice .
This in itself is all a rebuke to the statist complacency of Star Trek .
In the pilot , Serenity takes on , not only Simon and River , but the Shepherd , i.e. Minister , Book ( played by the kind and noble Ron Glass , perhaps best remembered from the Barney Miller TV series -- who unfortunately passed away in 2016 ) .
Although the Shepherd expresses his religious views in , usually , a low key way , and the details given of his beliefs are spare , he does have an actual Bible , and once he even seems to make a reference to Jesus , as a carpenter .
In the movie , the word " Christian " is even uttered -- though most viewers may not have noticed that the words " Jesus " ( ) and " Buddha " ( , literally " Buddha Founder " ) have both been spoken in Chinese during the shows .
This is startling stuff in comparison to Star Trek .
Captain Malcolm himself has lost his faith , but the Shepherd seems to the working on that .
As the shows went along , it began to look as though the Shepherd himself had a military , police , or intelligence background .
Unfortunately , one of the decisions made in the movie was to have him be killed , before we had learned all his secrets .
He was such a good character , this is disappointing , but it is always possible that , if the story is continued in some form , his history could emerge anyway .
That was pretty standard stuff on The X - Files .
There is frequent use of Chinese in the series , although actual Chinese actors were only , so far , in the background ; and the cast members struggle with Chinese pronunciation .
The name Serenity is written in Chinese characters on the ship as , though the Chinese pronunciation is never used .
This is the version of the word in the new " simplified " characters .
An older form in traditional characters would look like , while even more traditional characters would look like .
Joss Whedon evidently likes the idea that future human culture features both English and Chinese as the universal languages -- though in Firefly we also see some evidence of other languages and other cultures surviving as well .
Much of the appeal of Firefly is the ensemble cast .
Besides Malcolm , Zoe , Simon , River , and Shepherd , we also have the engineer Kaylee ( Jewel Staite ) , whose own sweetness embodies the persona of Serenity herself as a home for the crew , Jayne ( Adam Baldwin ) , whom Malcolm has picked up as a bit of mercenary muscle , but who is n't always faithful to his crewmates , Wash ( Alan Tudyk , recently seen as " Steve the Pirate " in Dodgeball , a True Underdog Story , but who also did the motion capture performance for the robot Sonny in I , Robot ) , the pilot and unlikely husband of Zoe , and finally Inara ( the lovely Morena Baccarin ) .
Again , the decision was made to have Wash be killed in the movie , which is a grave loss if the story is to continue .
Inara is actually a courtesan , a " registered Companion , " who is n't really a crew member , but who rents one of Serenity 's small shuttles to use as her detachable place of business .
This seems very un - Trek - like also .
Even in the pilot , it is already obvious that Malcolm and Inara have fallen in love with each other , but neither one is quite up to admitting it , and their feelings are often expressed in apparently hostile banter .
This a familiar approach in many TV series and movies -- although we also notice that under stress the two of them sometimes function as a couple , with Inara as the voice of Mal 's conscience .
It is not a relationship that is likely to be soon resolved , should the story continue , since Malcolm is already uncomfortable with Inara 's profession , and she would be unlikely to continue it were they to actually become involved with each other .
We get some hints that Inara has some secrets in her own background .
At the end of the TV shows , Inara and Malcolm have problems enough that Inara leaves Serenity .
By the end of the movie , however , she returns , but matters are not otherwise resolved .
On the other hand , the unrequited love category is kept in bounds when Simon and Kaylee , after some false starts , have become lovers at the end of the movie .
Yes , there is actual money -- the familiar science fiction " credits " -- in Firefly , and bank accounts .
There also seems to be hard commodity coinage , in platinum , for the gold bugs out there .
The hard money seems to go with the Wild West feel of the newly settled " outer planets . "
The very best thing about Firefly , in comparison to Star Trek , is probably that it does n't try for the slightest bit of Utopianism .
It does not assume that a single galactic government would be best , as it does not assume that present religion and capitalist economics are undesirable .
This is refreshing , to say the least , but it is also done very well .
The science in Firefly consists of some basic science fiction conceits that generally do not need to be , and are not , explained .
Serenity has an artificial gravity that Kaylee references once ( in " The Message " ) and that we only see turned off once , at the beginning of the pilot , when Mal , Zoe , and Jayne float into the airlock and we see the gravity turn on .
Otherwise , the artificial gravity still seems to be working even when the ship has lost all power , as in " Out of Gas . "
Nobody gets " beamed " up here , and while there are energy weapons , these seem to be familiar lasers rather than " phasers . "
The food is often tasteless synthetic stuff , not everyone 's favorite right out of the replicator .
What it takes a while to gather is the scale of the universe in which Firefly is set .
Despite references to the " ' verse " and the galaxy , all the action takes place in one solar system -- and not that of the Earth .
This is not completely clarified until the beginning of the movie , where it is stated explicitly .
Otherwise it must be inferred , given that there is no " warp drive " or any other reference to faster - than - light travel .
And space is pretty crowded in Firefly .
Twice , in the pilot and in " Bushwacked , " Serenity is caught in the act at a derelict ship by an Alliance cruiser .
This would seem unlikely even in interplanetary space , and certainly impossible in interstellar .
Similarly , in " Safe " we discover that an Alliance cruiser is only a few hours away .
Nevertheless , Joss Whedon has not paid sufficient attention to how solar systems work .
Characters often speak of the " quadrant , " a term that is really only meaningful in galactic terms .
In a solar system , planets move , and at different rates .
The relationship of the planets to each other thus changes constantly , and a trip that might at one time might take a few days under high power might otherwise take weeks or months ( all depending on the energy budget of space ships like Serenity , about which we are only vaguely informed ) .
The geometry of space , where it is even shown , usually does n't make much sense .
Thus , in the movie , the Reavers , in a tight mass , block the route to the planet Miranda , even though there would be countless ways , in a very large sky , to just go around them .
With " dozens " of planets and " hundreds " of moons , the implication is that this new solar system is much larger than that of " Earth that was . "
With a " blue sun , " i.e. a brighter star , the solar system could be effectively larger , and we certainly have no sense that the " outer " planets are colder or darker than the " central " ones .
Whether there can be solar systems with so many terrestrial bodies , in comparison to what we are familiar with , is an open question .
A fair number of extra -solar planets have now been identified , but the overall makeup , or frequency , of other solar systems is still a mystery .
An unfortunate notion in the series is that space is dark .
We do not see strong sunlight in the ship unless Serenity is visiting a planet ( both in the shows and in the movie ) .
However , it should be readily obvious on reflection that planets do not generate sunlight .
Stars do .
And the " blue sun " is going to be shining on Serenity whether the ship is near a planet or in deep ( interplanetary ) space .
Interstellar space will be dark , but this is not the domain of Firefly .
Another problem with the science of Firefly is communication .
We have no hint of " subspace " communication here , and in interplanetary space there would be no need for that .
However , the velocity of light does impose some limits on communication even within a solar system .
At almost any extra-planetary distance there will be delays of seconds in transmission ( it is a light second from the Earth to the Moon ) , and more commonly of minutes or hours .
This would make real time dialogue from Serenity to system planets awkward to impossible .
We get no hint of this .
On the other hand , we do n't get much in the way of real time dialogue anyway .
Malcolm talks to Patience on Whitefall in the pilot , and Malcolm talks to Inara at her " training house " in the movie .
There should at least be short delays , if not long ones , in reponses in both cases .
Allowing for them , of course , would be bad , for wasting time , both on television and in movies .
So perhaps it should be chalked up to poetic license .
The " science " in the " fiction " of Firefly is not very daring and is not intended to be .
More so even than in Star Wars , where George Lucas made a point of it , the science tends to be invisible , and we get nothing of the deadly exposition that used to be the bane of science fiction -- and sometimes still is .
Instead , as in the best of Star Wars and in the Alien movies , the universe is presented as one lived in and familiar , even if things do n't get explained that perhaps should .
In Firefly , there is even a bit of joke about this .
In " Objects in Space , " when Mal suggests that River reads minds , Wash says that this " sounds like science fiction . "
Zoe responds , " Dear , we live in a space ship . "
In March 2011 the Science Channel is beginning to run the Firefly TV shows .
Since the release of the movie , the Firefly story has apparently been dropped , and Joss Whedon went on to do another science fiction TV series , The Doll House , which was n't as good as Firefly but ironically lasted two whole seasons .
Go figure .
In retrospect , the deaths of Book and Wash in the movie probably meant that the story could not or should not have been continued .
What is usually the most attractive thing about any show or movie to an audience are the characters .
And given the ensemble cast of Firefly , and the family - like dynamic of the crew of Serenity , it is a particularly grave blow that characters are lost .
I suspect that the bloom of the series Heroes on NBC , which at first was a kind of popular sensation , was rapidly lost because the series made a habit of killing off characters , sometimes rapidly .
When an audience has made an emotional connection and investment in particular people , there is a kind of feeling of betrayal when they are just expended to make some plot point .
Whedon had something in mind when he killed off Book and Wash .
It was not done lightly or gratuitously .
We see the point by recalling an early line in the movie .
Zoe tells one of the temporary hostages during the heist that starts the story , " A hero is someone who gets other people killed . "
Then we see that Mal , indeed , becomes a hero .
He is a real hero , saving the day and striking a blow against the Alliance , with the full and enthusiastic participation of the crew , but there is a cost .
The cost is that Mal gets Wash killed , as previously he has , inadvertently , gotten Book killed .
Although Zoe loses her own husband , she is made of the same warrior stuff as Mal , so she can endure .
In lesser hands , all this might be used to draw some cheap anti-war moral from the story .
Whedon does n't do that .
The war , such as it is , is a good war .
Whedon 's point is that there is a price even for a good war , and the price is not trivial .
Such a point is rather like what we see in the Mahâbhârata , where the good guys are the good guys , they are supposed to win , and they do ; but there is a considerable , indeed a terrible , cost to the whole business .
Things cannot be restored to what they were ante bellum .
The same can be said about Firefly itself .
By killing Book and Wash , Joss Whedon also paid a price , and the price is the ensemble situation that people grew to know and love in the series .
If Serenity were to continue on its voyage , things would necessarily be different .
No one will be there to play with Wash 's toy dinosaurs .
Indeed , new cast members would certainly need to be brought in , and how that would work out is subject to all the uncertainties of any series or movie .
The Firefly that we knew for its brief and marvelous life could not be the same .
The cast of Firefly has gone on to sometimes noteworthy , or at least noticeable , careers .
Summer Glau has appeared in further science fiction shows , thereby earning a guest spot on The Big Bang Theory .
Morena Baccarin has come in for major acting nominations on the dramatic series Homeland .
Alan Tudyk and Adam Baldwin have had steady work , although Tudyk's has mostly been in comedy ( e.g. Suburgatory ) , without the dramatic range found in Firefly .
Perhaps the most conspicuous has been Nathan Fillion , in the long - running television series Castle , playing the title character , mystery novelist Richard Castle .
A small industry has grown up spotting Firefly references in Castle .
On one Halloween themed show , Fillion turns up in the full costume of Malcolm Reynolds .
Castle 's daughter asks what he supposed to be .
He answers a " space cowboy , " to which the daughter retorts , " There are no cows in space . "
Of course , we know from Firefly that there will indeed be cows in space -- making a mess in the cargo hold .
Then there was an episode that began at a Comic - Con - like convention , with Castle signing books , but a murder occurs at an exhibit for a short - lived but fan - favorite science fiction show -- not unlike Firefly .
Castle avows that he did n't like the series , even though he did like things such as " that series by Joss Whedon . "
He even used the expression " shiny " in the show .
Another episode guest - starred Adam Baldwin -- with a character rather like what Jayne would be like as a policeman .
Whedon has filled in some gaps in the Firefly story in other media .
One comic book explained why the men in the blue gloves do not occur in the movie .
They were killed , and rather than replaced by similar agents , we get the special " operative " of the movie .
The mysterious backstory of Book is addressed in another comic book .
Book became a deep cover agent of the Independents in the military of the Alliance .
He rose to the rank of general and then deliberately sabotaged a battle , resulting in a major victory for the Independents .
The Alliance never suspected that he was a spy .
They just thought he was incompetent , and cashiered him .
He was not happy with the experience either , which is why he turned to religion .
But he still had enough status with the Alliance that they were willing to treat the gunshot wound he suffered in one Firefly episode .
But he frequently impressed people , including Malcolm , as knowing a lot more about war and government than a Shepherd ordinarily would .
Further comic books and spin - off stories by others have followed .
If Wheaton had not killed off Shepherd Book in the movie , fate stepped in to foreclose further chapters in his story .
The winning and sympathetic Ron Glass passed away in November 2016 , aged 71 .
It feels like untimely loss .
And it is a shame we never got to see Ron do his own backstory .

The Dutch Parliament has already voted in favour of a proposed ban
The Dutch parliament has already voted in favour of a proposal to ban the burqa outside the home , and some in the government have thrown their weight behind it .
There are only about 50 women in all of the Netherlands who do cover up entirely - but soon they could be breaking the law .
Dutch MP Geert Wilders is the man who first suggested the idea of a ban .
" It 's a medieval symbol , a symbol against women , " he says .
" We do n't want women to be ashamed to show who they are .
Even if you have decided yourself to do that , you should not do it in Holland , because we want you to be integrated , assimilated into Dutch society .
If people cannot see who you are , or see one inch of your body or your face , I believe this is not the way to integrate into our society . "
' Identifiable '
I interviewed Mr Wilders inside parliament after several security checks .
Two tough bodyguards stood close by throughout .
This country , once the epitome of easy - going liberalism , is edgier , less tolerant these days .
Theo Van Gogh was a well - known critic of fundamentalist Islam
Van Gogh was murdered two years ago for making the film about women and Islam called " Submission " .
It starts with a shot of a woman 's face covered by a burqa .
Slowly the camera shows that , from the neck downwards , she 's naked but for a thin veil .
Mr Wilders has explicitly linked his wish for a burqa ban with terrorism .
" We have problems with a growing minority of Muslims who tend to have sympathy with the Islamo - fascistic concept of radical Islam , " says Mr Wilders .
" That 's also a reason why everybody should be identifiable when they walk on the street or go to a pub or go into a restaurant or whatsoever . "
' Freedom of choice '
Famala Aslam is a Muslim lawyer who has represented women who have stopped wearing the burqa while training as child - care assistants .
She would not cover her face herself , but does wear a traditional dress and headscarf from eastern Turkey .
She showed me how that can be adapted .
Banning or isolating a certain group of the population is just asking for problems
Famala Aslam , Muslim lawyer
I asked her what she would say to people who would say : " If you want to fit into the West , live here , wear a business suit ; wear jeans - do n't wear what you 're wearing .
Do n't wear a niqab . "
Ms Aslam says she believes that the freedom of choice and the freedom of religion is something that people need to fight for .
In the city of Maaseik , in Belgium - which lies a few hundred yards from the Dutch border - a ban on wearing the niqab is already in place .
Mayor Jan Creemers said he brought it forward because old people were afraid and children cried when women started appearing in long black robes with their faces covered .
Belgium ban
Women can now be fined 150 euros ( £ 102 ) if they are found to be wearing the niqab .
" There were six ladies who wore the niqab .
I think two or three weeks after the council passed this law , five have dropped it , " says Mr Creemers .
" One lady is still wearing it but the last step in the procedure will be that she must go to jail . "
The husband of the woman who defies the ban is being held in connection with the Madrid bombings .
But the police here are not too happy with the ban .
They say it has made relations with the Moroccan community worse and gives young people a reason to resent society .
Ms Aslam says if the ban becomes law in the Netherlands , some women will adopt the veil as a political statement .
" A lot of women are not fully feeling like Muslims , " she says .
" But because of the public opinion , they are feeling like : ' I have to be a Muslim ' .
And banning or isolating a certain group of the population is just asking for problems . "
The Dutch government will soon decide whether to ban the burqa .
Perhaps it will not become illegal in this marketplace or in the street .
But they are likely to ban it in public places like stations , airports and cinemas - something many Muslims will regard as provocation in a Europe increasingly uncertain of its own identity .
WASHINGTON , Nov. 13 — As Israeli bombs fell on Lebanon for a second week last July , the Rev. John Hagee of San Antonio arrived in Washington with 3,500 evangelicals for the first annual conference of his newly founded organization , Christians United For Israel .
At a dinner addressed by the Israeli ambassador , a handful of Republican senators and the chairman of the Republican Party , Mr. Hagee read greetings from President Bush and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel and dispatched the crowd with a message for their representatives in Congress .
Tell them “ to let Israel do their job ” of destroying the Lebanese militia , Hezbollah , Mr. Hagee said .
He called the conflict “ a battle between good and evil ” and said support for Israel was “ God ’s foreign policy . ”
The next day he took the same message to the White House .
Many conservative Christians say they believe that the president ’s support for Israel fulfills a biblical injunction to protect the Jewish state , which some of them think will play a pivotal role in the second coming .
Many on the left , in turn , fear that such theology may influence decisions the administration makes toward Israel and the Middle East .
Perhaps the strangest thing about the 2006 “ Twilight Zone ” convention was the lack of strange occurrences .
T - shirts were selling for $ 25 , and the only time an organizer turned down the volume on the show ’s familiar theme song was to make special announcements , like the one that the holder of ticket No. 410035 had won the first door prize .
But the less - than - supernatural particulars masked the nervous excitement yesterday at a Hilton hotel in less - than - supernatural Hasbrouck Heights , N.J .
The first “ Twilight Zone ” convention on the East Coast was not so much for casual admirers , but for true fanatics .
Mike Belveduto , 22 , of Scranton , Pa. , was there , a bracelet - style tattoo across his left forearm with the clock , the eyeball and other objects that float across the screen in the show ’s opening montage .
“ One day this whole arm will be all ‘ Twilight Zone , ’ ” he said .
“ I just do n’t have the money yet . ”
Dr. Jeff Menkes , 59 , was there , too , driving in from his home in Connecticut ( that was his green Corvette convertible in the parking lot , the one with the “ TWLT ZN ” license plate ) .
ヨーロッパだと開発者の多くは学生（＝無収入）なので、
どの程度の意味があるかは謎ですけど、 あったらいいですねえ。 この記事はUS向けですが、 フランスとか日本でもこういう動きがあっていいと思います。
オープンソースに寄与した人は税制上の優遇措置（控除）が受けられるようにしようという話。
前にも似たようなのを見た気もしますが。
とある学生と話していて感じたこと。 彼はC、C++、Java等の経験しか今までありませんでした。 最近 Pythonをかじり始めましたが、 彼は 「 Pythonはスクリプト言語だから遅い」と主張しました。 私は猛然と否を唱えました。
そもそもどっかの誰かが主張していることを自分で確認しないで信じている時点でアレなんですけど、
あまりに見方が単純過ぎるというのが私の観点。
私の主張を要約すると、
コンパイラは所詮線形にしか高速化しない（ベクトル化してくれるとか、そういうのは置いといて）。
いくら言語の平均的実効速度が高速でも、アルゴリズムが間抜けだと、スクリプト言語で賢く書いた方が速い（これは簡単に証明できる）。
概してコンパイラ言語（特にC）は機能が貧弱なので、まともなプログラムの規模になると、非常に開発効率が悪い。
開発効率は実行効率に間接的に影響を及ぼす。プログラムを改善するスピードが異なるならば、当然開発効率の優れた言語の方が速いプログラムを生み出しやすい。
現実問題、この世界の移り変わりは非常に速いのだから、開発時間がそもそも短い。
よって、開発効率の良いスクリプト言語の方がコンパイラ言語より実行速度においても優れている可能性は決して無視できない。
理論的に速いからといって、現実にも速いとは限らないんですよね。
書きにくい言語できれいなプログラムは簡単にはできないですから。
まあ、それは別にしても 、Pythonには pypy なんて試みもありますし、 将来本当にスクリプト言語の方が決定的に速いという状況が生まれる可能性も否定できないと考えています。
追記： shiroさんのコメント について。 おっしゃることは全くその通りです。 議論した相手が相手だったので、 言葉の定義は適当です。 ここでは一般的 に 「 そういう言語だと捉えられているもの」ぐらいに考えていただいた方が良いです。
もう少し厳密にするならば、動的言語、静的言語といった呼称の方が似合っているかもしれません。
境界の曖昧さは私は以前から認識しています（というか、境界の明確な言葉の定義の方が稀じゃないかな）。 実際Cで書いたからといって、 全てコンパイル時に決定されるわけではありませんし。
単純なプログラムでさえ今日では動的リンクなど、インタープリタ的動作が介在しますし、
結局多くのインタープリタはCで書かれています。
JavaやPythonのようにJITをサポートしている言語もあれば、 CommonLispやHaskellのように両対応している言語も存在します。
結局はどこまで動的にやるのかという問題でしょう。
psycoやpypyのように、とりあえずインタープリットしていって、
（やる価値のありそうなところを）実行時情報に基づいて複数バージョンをコンパイルしていくというアプローチは面白いと感じています。 ただ、GCCなんかは最近プロファイルによる最適化や関数を跨いだ最適化なんかをサポートしているので、
コンパイルに膨大な時間を費しても文句を言われない言語の方がより強力な最適化を施しやすく、
そう簡単には勝てないだろうなと思います。
まあ、いずれにしても 「開発効率こそが重要である（場面も多々ある）」という私の主張には影響しないんですけどね。
Let 's say you were n't supposed to be building a nuclear bomb , but you went ahead and did it anyway .
You 'd want to test it somewhere without getting caught , somewhere as remote and isolated as exists on the planet .
You 'd want to be as far away as possible from any people , from any continent , from any fishing ground , from any air corridor or shipping lane or cruise ship itinerary .
You 'd want a place like Bouvet Island .
Midway between the bottom of Africa and the Princess Astrid Coast of Antarctica , it 's arguably the most solitary piece of real estate on earth , a lonely pimple jutting out of the gray , heaving seas of the South Atlantic .
You could journey to the most remote inhabited spot on earth , Tristan da Cunha , and you 'd still have another 1,000 miles to go to reach Bouvet Island .
Ninety - three percent of it is covered in glacial ice , the rest in penguin guano .
It 's an overseas possession of Norway , under the weary supervision of that nation 's Polar Department of the Ministry of Justice and Police .
Other than dispatching a small and reluctant crew every decade or so to service an automated weather station , Oslo pretty much ignores its forlorn outpost .
It would be the perfect spot to explode your nuclear bomb .
Which apparently is what someone did on Sept. 22 , 1979 .
Someone -- possibly South Africa or Israel , possibly Taiwan -- set off a 2 - to 3 - kiloton nuclear bomb in the waters off Bouvet Island .
It might have gone unnoticed , but the telltale double flash was spotted by the unblinking eye of an American spy satellite , and the radiation was detected by Australian scientists in Antarctica .
The official position of the U.S. State Department is that it never happened , but most scientists believe this is a political cover-up .
The fact that news of this probably has never reached you attests to what an impossibly distant and godforsaken place Bouvet Island is .
Only a few dozen humans have ever left their footprints on it , and it's a safe bet most of them would happily have passed on the honor .
But there is a small and obsessive group of people scheming , plotting , cajoling and ultimately trying to buy their way there .
They are known as country collectors , and they spend their lifetimes journeying to the farthest and most obscure reaches of the globe , from Abkhazia to Umm Al Qaiwain , filling their passports with rare and exotic stamps .
Bouvet Island is to them what Everest is to peak baggers , what the British Guiana 1c magenta is to philatelists , what the Apple Tree Girl 141X is to collectors of Hummel figurines .
Only a tiny handful of country collectors -- precisely eight by one estimate , " not quite 20 " by another -- have ever managed to cross Bouvet off their lists .
The most recent is a 40 - year - old dot - com millionaire from San Francisco , Charles Veley , and he believes this , along with all his other peregrinations , qualifies him as the most well - traveled person in the history of the world .
Veley has certainly seen more of the globe -- far , far more -- than Captain Cook , Magellan or Marco Polo .
He has been to Meghalaya , to Mizoram , to Molukkas , methodically crossing each place off his long list .
He has been to the Kermadec Islands , to Kingman Reef , to Kwazulu - Natal , filling six passports with obscure stamps and visas .
He has been to Lampedusa , to Lord Howe Island , to Limpopo , missing his daughter 's first steps and first birthday party .
He has been to Ras Al Khaimah , to Rotuma , to Rio Muni , spending a million and a half of his own dollars on airplane tickets , freighter passages and sailboat charters .
Tatarstan , Chuuk , the Daito Islands , Chuvashia :
If you can name it -- and , especially , if you can't -- Veley has probably been there .
He has , by his own count , set foot in 518 different countries , territories and islands , which he believes puts him far ahead of any other country collector .
And while most of his rivals have filled their passports over a lifetime of travel -- many are in their 70s and 80s -- Veley has done it all in just five years .
" If you want to have a complete world view you have to go everywhere , " he says .
" Five hundred countries is better than 400 .
Every place you learn something new . "
Relaxing in the Pacific Heights home he shares with his wife , Kimberly , and their 2 - year - old daughter , Catherine , he has just unpacked his bag after a swing through 16 of Russia 's 21 autonomous provinces .
" If I had another week I could have gotten the rest , " he says .
" But I promised Kimberly I 'd be home . "
Dressed in a Christmas Island T - shirt and warmup pants , Veley is boyish and enthusiastic -- which is quite remarkable , considering that he has got more miles on him than a 1962 Volvo .
Veley 's house has none of the tchochkes you typically see in a traveler 's home : no carved African masks , no Balinese puppets , no Tibetan prayer wheels , no wall map porcupined with colored pins .
" I 'm not much of a souvenir guy , " he says .
" I 've been traveling nearly full time , and that 's a lot of stuff to lug around with you . "
His claim of being the world 's most traveled person seems pretty unassailable -- except that there 's another guy in the Bay Area who asserts that he , not Veley , is the world 's most traveled person .
Jeff Shea , 50 , owns a manufacturing company in Richmond and has not only visited all but three places on the most commonly used world list , but has also reached the summit of the highest mountain on every continent , including Everest .
He has walked across Transylvania , sailed across the Pacific Ocean and spent 39 days floating down a river in Papua New Guinea on a raft held together by jungle vines .
" Charles is a nice guy , but his claim is bogus , " Shea says .
" I 've seen a lot more of the world than he has , hands down .
I am the world 's most traveled person . "
Responds Veley : " Jeff is a very nice guy , and he 's done some really interesting things .
But he has n't been to as many places as I have . "
Nobody is disputing anyone else 's travel claims .
The argument is over how you define the rules of the game : how you decide what a separate " place " is , and how you define what a " visit " is .
But one thing seems clear : the gloves are coming off in what up to now had been the rather genteel world of country collecting .
If there is such thing as a wanderlust gene , it must be recessive .
Neither of Veley 's parents liked to travel .
But almost from birth he was overcome by the urge to roam .
Not long after he took his first wobbly steps , his parents would find the kitchen door of their Brooklyn home open and their young son gone .
He 'd toddle several blocks before a neighbor brought him home .
When he was 6 he'd wander out to the garage , climb into the family Land Rover , prop open the Rand McNally North American Road Atlas on the seat next to him and undertake imaginary road trips out to California and back , his hands on the steering wheel , his feet a long way from reaching the pedals .
Veley started young for a serious country collector , and he started with advantages his competitors can only envy :
He 's got all the time in the world , and he 's rich .
In 1999 , at the height of the dot - com boom , the high - tech company he and three friends started , MicroStrategy , Inc. , went public .
Overnight , Veley was a millionaire many , many times over .
He was just 35 .
Burned out on 100 - hour workweeks , he took a sabbatical and set off on a year - long honeymoon abroad with Kimberly .
They lived in Paris for three months and Munich for another three , and then struck off for Fiji , New Zealand , Bali , Bhutan , India , Australia and Egypt .
Having too much fun to go home , they re-upped for another year on the road .
Somewhere over the Sea of Japan , while flipping through an in - flight magazine , Veley came across an article about the Los Angeles - based Travelers ' Century Club , an exclusive society for people who 've visited at least 100 countries .
" I thought we were really elite travelers because we 'd been to 65 , " he says .
" But this fired my competitive juices . "
The couple held nonstop tickets from Osaka to Hong Kong , but Veley discovered they could change the routing and fly via Okinawa and Taiwan , which were both on the TCC list of countries .
He switched their tickets and they spent all of four hours in each place -- but it was enough to cross them off the list .
A country collector was born .
It took him only a couple of months to reach no .
100 ( Jersey Island ) .
He hit no .
200 the following year ( Sikkim ) , and no .
300 less than a year after that ( Chad ) .
Collecting countries became Veley 's full - time job .
The most he has spent on a single trip is $ 25,000 , but that turned out to be a bargain .
He flew to the South Pole , where he could stand in one spot and touch six " countries " at the same time : the Argentine , Australian , British , Chilean , French , New Zealand and Norwegian Antarctic claims , which all meet at the South Pole like slices of a pie .
Kimberly accompanied him for the first couple of years -- she now has more than 200 countries under her belt -- but dropped out when Catherine was born in 2003 .
A second child , a son , is due in October .
Even though Veley is 54 countries short of completing his own list , he 's about to call it quits now .
" I did as much as I could , and now I 'm done .
At some point you have to declare victory and move on . "
Now Veley is working hard to raise his profile and get himself widely recognized as the world 's most traveled person -- his Web site proclaims him " the # 1 ranked traveler on earth " -- and this clearly rankles some of his competitors .
John Clouse , an 80 - year - old practicing attorney from Evansville , Indiana , was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world 's ultimate traveler for a decade .
It cost him , among other things , six marriages , and he does n't like the idea of giving up his title .
" It 's a competitive sport now , " he says .
" Charles gets off the plane , bops around and gets back on .
I do n't mean to sound mean - spirited -- he 's been very kind to me -- but he wants me to surrender my sword . "
So is Veley the world 's most traveled person or not ?
It all comes down to whether you consider an ice - covered rock in the middle of the South Atlantic a country .
Or whether the Cook Islands are one island group or two .
Or whether Mustang is a unique and distinct place , rather than just another region of Nepal .
Deciding what is and what is n't a separate " country " can keep collectors arguing halfway to Bashkortostan .
There are generally accepted to be 193 sovereign nations in the world -- the 191 members of the United Nations , plus Taiwan and the Vatican .
But consider , for example , Tahiti :
It is fully a part of France , yet most would say it is a separate place .
If you 've been to Tahiti you have n't really been to France , and vice versa .
Once you start down this road it just becomes a matter of how finely you want to parse things .
For the purpose of collecting you start with those 193 sovereign nations and begin adding their overseas possessions , colonies , territories , autonomous regions , protectorates , trusteeships , enclaves , mandates , geographically separate island groups and all the world 's other " discrete geographical , ethnological or political entities . "
To keep the nomenclature simple , many collectors call each of these places a " country . "
No one can agree on the total .
The Travelers ' Century Club has 315 " countries " on its list .
The American Radio Relay League , a group that competes to make radio contact with the most places , counts 335 .
Veley lists 572 on his Web site , www.mosttraveledman.com, which he 's hoping to establish as the final arbiter .
Shea is preparing to unveil his own list , based on International Standards Organization definitions , that stretches to 3,996 different places .
It 's safe to say that Veley 's list includes a lot of places he 's been and Shea has n't , and vice versa .
Deciding what constitutes a " visit " is also contentious .
Under the TCC rules , if your flight from Cape Town to Heathrow makes a brief refueling stop at Entebbe , you can cross Uganda off your list .
Veley is championing more vigorous standards :
You have to get your passport stamped , or , if that 's not possible , come back with firm proof : a photo , an airline ticket or a credit card receipt .
This has forced him to venture into Iraq twice .
The first time he walked out to the middle of a bridge over the Tigris River on the border between Turkey and Iraq and simultaneously pantomimed " Do n't shoot ! " and " I just want to dab my foot over the line . "
He 's since flown into Baghdad to get his passport stamped .
But is this really what most people would consider travel ?
Veley 's astounding harvest of 518 countries in five years works out to an average of 3.5 days per country .
Factor in travel time and the occasional stop back in San Francisco , and there is n't a whole lot of time to get to know these places .
" It 's nothing more than stepping off an airplane and getting right back on , " says Shea .
" In my book , that 's not travel .
The only people who might be impressed by something like this is people who have n't traveled much . "
Responds Veley : " Who 's to say how long is long enough ?
If you stay in a place for a week , they 'll tell you you really need three weeks to get to know it .
If you stay three weeks they 'll say you need to spend the whole season .
You can never win that game . "
" It 's all about bragging rights , " says Klaus Billep , chairman of the Travelers ' Century Club .
Get any two hard - core travelers together , and you 'll witness a not - so - subtle game of one - upmanship : " Well , sure , everyone treks to Everest base camp , " one will say .
" I trekked to K2 base camp .
It 's a lot harder .
Hardly anyone does it , you know . "
Announce that you climbed the Great Pyramid to watch the sunrise , and the next guy will say he did it , too -- with a blind Egyptian soothsayer .
Trot out your tale of coming face to face with a grizzly bear in Alaska 's Gates of the Arctic National Park , and someone else will trump you with a yarn about being stalked by a polar bear .
The eyes of nontravelers quickly glaze over when these stories start flying , which is why extreme travelers tend to associate with like - minded people in clubs like the TCC .
Today it has 1,900 frightfully well - traveled members around the world and chapters in eight U.S. cities , including San Francisco .
When they are n't trotting the globe , they meet for regular luncheons to swap travel tales and exchange tips on getting to the Ryukyu Islands or Srpska .
Sometimes they pool resources to charter a boat to some far - flung island group or accompany one another on the tedious border crossing between Burkino Faso and Togo .
Up until recently the competition , such as it is , has been low - key and gentlemanly .
Even Veley and Shea once teamed up on an expedition to the British Indian Ocean Territory .
" It 's a friendly group , and we help each other out whenever we can , " says Bill Altaffer , 62 , a retired history teacher and ski instructor from Mammoth who 's been to 470 " countries . "
" We all want to see as much of the world as we can .
I can't look through a magazine and see a picture of an interesting place and not want to go there .
Just hearing the word ' Timbuktu ' makes me want to go . "
There 's a fuzzy line between methodically ticking countries off your list and full - on obsession .
Dromomania , the obsessive urge to travel , is a recognized psychological affliction listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders .
Sufferers of what 's also called " the vagabond neurosis " will " spend beyond their means , sacrifice jobs , lovers and security in their lust for new experiences . "
" They become involved in the minutia of travel , buying the tickets , packing their bags and planning where to go , " Dr. Joan Lakin - Marantz , a New York psychotherapist , told the Toronto Globe and Mail .
" It 's distraction against the pain of loneliness . "
Early in the 20th century , according to the newspaper , a group of French psychologists and psychiatrists took note of Jesus ' frequent wanderings from Nazareth and concluded that he probably suffered from dromomania .
To a person , country collectors deny they 're afflicted with any sort of mental disorder .
" It 's just a collectors ' mentality , " Veley says .
" When I was collecting baseball cards , I just had to have the whole set .
But I was never the kind of kid to just go out and buy the set .
I 'd buy individual packs , trade with my friends and flip cards until I finally had them all .
It was the challenge .
The journey is always more important than the destination . "
So is Veley the most traveled man in the history of the world or not ?
" It 's very much up in the air , " says Clouse , the past record - holder .
" I do n't think he is . "
Nor is Shea willing to concede .
His travel resume is awfully impressive :
Not only did he climb Everest , he did it by a harder route than most summiteers use .
He traveled overland from Bangladesh to Egypt -- through Iran and Iraq , among other places -- and spent five months knocking around Africa .
Along the way he 's contracted two strains of malaria , been jailed in Jordan and watched a man die by falling into molten lava in Hawaii .
His daughter , Lani , is in the Guinness Book as the youngest ever to visit all seven continents : two years , 307 days .
Shea has ticked off 317 countries on the TCC list and 1,246 of the places on his own 3,996 - place list .
This list , he says , is based on provinces rather than countries , and is a better measuring stick for extreme travelers .
With the other lists , " you could spend an hour at the airport in Beijing and say you 've been to China , " he says .
But under Shea 's system , you 'd have to visit each of China 's 23 provinces , five autonomous regions , four centrally administrative municipalities and two special administrative regions .
" Charles ' list has a lot of rocks out in the middle of nowhere in the ocean , " he says .
" I 'm more interested in the living space of the human race . "
It was n't until Veley publicly anointed himself as the world 's most traveled person that things became strained between the two .
" It 's declaring yourself the champion by your own criteria , " Shea says , " when no one else is playing that game . "
Shea says he did more than just tag a country and cross it off his list .
" I tried to get out and see the place , to go overland if possible .
A list is just a list .
It has nothing to do with how in - depth you see a place . "
Veley retorts that Shea has a number of touch - and - go visits on his resume ( which Shea does n't deny . )
And , for the record , Veley can hold his own when hard - core travelers start swapping yarns .
There 's the time he spent a couple of days on Pitcairn Island , bunking with the great - great - great grandson of HMS Bounty mutineer Christian Fletcher .
" He 's got a whole closet full of country and western CDs , " Veley says .
" Everyone on Pitcairn is crazy for country and western .
The only station their radio could pick up was out of Sacramento , and it was all country and western . "
Then there 's the time he had to spend the night in no -man 's land between Russia and Georgia , temporarily a man without a country .
And the time he got hopelessly lost in Kabul and spent hours riding around the city in a taxi , steering around bomb craters while searching in vain for his guesthouse .
He 's had Kalashnikovs pointed at him in West Africa by teenagers liquored up on banana beer and had to bribe his way into Chechnya , and back out .
His voyage to Bouvet Island and back turned into a 71 - day epic that included two weeks stuck in pack ice .
But one place has so far remained frustratingly out of Veley 's reach , and Shea 's , too .
It has proven to be far more elusive than Mpumalanga or the Tokelau Islands : It 's the Guinness Book of World Records .
Guinness listed the record for " World 's Most Traveled Person " until 2001 -- Clouse held it -- but finally threw up its hands and dropped it from the book .
No one could agree on a standard , says spokesman Sam Knights .
" The difficulty , " he wrote in an e-mail , " is that no single list is any more valid than any other , and inevitably each proposed list suits a particular proposer . "
Choosing one person 's list , he says , would put his rivals at a big disadvantage .
" This probably sounds like an overreaction , but there is a core of around four or five people who seem to do little else but travel , and each is extremely competitive and determined . "
Last year Veley got Guinness to agree to give him the record if the Travelers ' Century Club would validate the claim , but after initially agreeing to do so the club thought better of it and backed out .
" It 's on an honor system , " says Billep , the club 's chairman .
" It 's so hard to prove .
So we decided to stay out of it . "
For the record , though , Billep says Veley is " absolutely the most widely traveled man in history . "
Shea and Clouse would disagree .
But , then again , Veley 's been to Bouvet Island and they have n't .

A Novel Strategy for Asteroid Deflection
With the recent knowledge that half of all near - Earth asteroids are binaries , the stakes go up in the race to develop technologies to prevent potential impacts .
But is the best solution what Centauri Dreams has always advocated , to intercept the approaching object as far from Earth as possible and alter its trajectory ?
A new paper suggests an alternative strategy : why not capture a nearby asteroid and put it into an Earth - bound orbit to use as a shield ?
Such an asteroid could then be moved as needed to absorb the impact of any collision that would otherwise hit the Earth .
The work of Didier Massonnet and Benoît Meyssignac ( Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales , France ) , the paper argues that an asteroid between 20 and 40 meters in diameter , which the two nickname ‘ David ’s stone , ’ could destroy a much larger incoming object under proper targeting conditions .
The problem becomes finding the right asteroid .
From the paper :
We …have a detection challenge : we seek an asteroid small enough to be manoeuvred “ easily ” — i.e. within a 10 - year time frame and with a typical ΔV which we set at 50 m / s — while large enough to ensure the destruction or the deviation of Goliath .
David must be energetically close to the Earth , which means that its initial semi major axis is close to one astronomical unit and its eccentricity as well as its inclination are small .
David may be too small to be easily detected by optical means , in addition of being often in the angular vicinity of the Sun .
The best way to detect efﬁciently such an asteroid might be by radar survey .
How to capture such an object ?
The authors point out that in terms of thrust , a large mass with a low ejection velocity is as efficient as a low mass with a large ejection velocity .
Their solution is a robotic catapault that collects samples from the asteroid and throws them into space .
The propellant becomes the material of the asteroid itself , with solar arrays generating power for the operation .
Ingeniously , the paper suggests a ‘ hopping ’ catapault device that could compensate for the slow rotation of the asteroid while maintaining the average torque delivered to the asteroid close to zero .

Is this a scenario we can prevent ?
The art of asteroid manipulation near the Earth may hold the answer .
Credit : NASA .
And they offer up a good candidate for the David ’s stone in the asteroid 2000SG344 , whose passage near the Earth in 2029 offers a relatively straightforward capture scenario .
On station orbiting either the L1 or L2 Sun-Earth Lagrangian points , the asteroid would protect Earth from incoming material with a reaction time of about eight months .
Significant here is that Massonnet and Meyssignac ’s method would be the only solution to a short - notice threat such as a cometary nucleus .
Another benefit is that with the installation of proper equipment , a nearby asteroid could be exploited to produce propellants for manned exploratory missions .
Producing fuel like liquid oxygen in such a location would dramatically alter the lifting requirements for long - range flights and could be practical even factoring in travel requirements to retrieve the fuel :
This oxygen could then be loaded into the tanks of a planetary mission which would ﬁrst reach an EET [ Earth - escape trajectory ] toward this Lagrangian gas station and then come back close to the Earth , still on an EET , in the proper position for its ﬁnal acceleration to a planetary trajectory .
If a chemical propulsion is used for the exploration of Mars , up to 80 % of the mass of the mission could be liquid oxygen , thus offering a similar gain in heavy lifting requirements .
The 240 - day or so detour to the asteroid does not necessarily apply to the exploration crew which could join the spacecraft when it grazes Earth again on its way back .
If necessary , a different crew could manage the reﬁll and enter the earth atmosphere directly on the way back from the asteroid .
The cost in ΔV would virtually be zero .

Alien hunters today pounded the SETI ( Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence )
Institute here with e-mails and phone calls , following claims made this weekend that the organization has covered up the detection of signals from space .
Allegations of a SETI cover up were made last night on the fringe - friendly Coast to Coast radio show hosted by Art Bell .
During the broadcast , professional SETI watcher Steven Greer , the CEO of Space Energy Access Systems , claimed that insiders told him that SETI discovered a high concentration of signals from space , and that another organization stepped in to block those signals .
SETI , however , maintains that it has not seen any signals of note .
According to Greer , the space communications have caused a major stir at SETI , which hunts for intelligent life in outer space .
" They have had numerous extraterrestrial signals , " Greer said , during the radio broadcast .
" They were apparently searching in a spectrum or in an area . . . where they hit the mother lode .
The signals were so numerous that they began to have their systems externally jammed by some sort of human agency that did not want them to continue receiving those signals . "
And where did Greer get this fantastic information ?
Apparently , from a well - known source within SETI .
" This person , if I were to say who he is , almost every one your listeners would probably know the name , " Greer said .
Bell 's Coast to Coast show is famed for dealing with matters that many would consider far from reality .
The radio host has enjoyed a phenomenal career discussing ghosts , UFOs and things that go berserk in the night with an eclectic set of guests .
But it 's worth noting that Bell , who only hosts the show on the weekends now , and regular host George Noory often break stories such as the Dubai ports deal well before the national media .
That 's not the case this time around , according to SETI .
" There 's been nothing like that at all , " said a spokesman , who described Greer , as " the bane of SETI 's existence . "
Greer runs a SETI rival , if you will , called CSETI and often claims that SETI is withholding evidence of alien life from the public .
His comments triggered a torrent of e-mails and phone calls to hit SETI today , according to the SETI spokesman .
In this particular instance , the fine people at SETI seem a bit more tethered to the reality spectrum .
Greer , after all , relied almost exclusively on hearsay in his discussion with Art Bell .
In addition , Greer claimed that members of SETI were in on some type of conspiracy to keep alien life secret while at the same time being attacked by a third party trying to block alien signals from SETI .
That 's an awful lot of maneuvering - most of which makes little sense .
That said , technophiles should enjoy guessing who Greer 's secret source might be .
Back in the day , SETI had serious backing from one of HP 's early employees - Bernard Oliver .
Over the years , the organization has received funds from such Silicon Valley institutions as NASA Ames , HP , Sun Microsystems , and the Gordon and Betty Moore foundation .
Microsoft co-founder and space buff Paul Allen is also a major SETI backer .
Sun 's CTO Greg Papadopoulos is the current Chairman of SETI .
Could aliens be responsible for Sun 's recent sales spike ?

R6RS Status Report
Kent Dybvig , Will Clinger , Matthew Flatt , Mike Sperber , and Anton van Straaten
June 21 , 2006
1. Overview
This status report describes the current state of the R6RS standardization effort .
It covers principles we have outlined to guide the effort , decisions we have made to date , our work in progress , and the process by which we intend to complete the Revised6 Report on Scheme .

adding a void object to replace the " unspecified value " ( as " unspecified " rather than " void " ; Sections 4.4 and 4.5 )
let - values or other multiple - value binding construct (s ) ( both let - values and let *- values ; Section 4.5 )
Section 8 now lists Sperber and Clinger as the editors in charge of byte vectors .
3. Guiding Principles
To help guide the standardization effort , the editors have adopted a set of principles , presented below .
They are , like R6RS itself , a work in progress and still subject to change .
Like R5RS Scheme , R6RS Scheme should :
derive its power from simplicity , a small number of generally useful core syntactic forms and procedures , and no unnecessary restrictions on how they are composed ;
allow programs to define new procedures and new hygienic syntactic forms ;
support the traditional s-expression representation of program source code as data ;
make procedure calls powerful enough to express any form of sequential control , and allow programs to perform non-local control operations without the use of global program transformations ;
allow interesting , purely functional programs to run indefinitely without terminating or running out of memory on finite - memory machines ;
allow educators to use the language to teach programming effectively , at various levels and with a variety of pedagogical approaches ; and
allow researchers to use the language to explore the design , implementation , and semantics of programming languages .
In addition , R6RS Scheme should :
allow programmers to create and distribute substantial programs and libraries , e.g. , SRFI implementations , that run without modification in a variety of Scheme implementations ;
support procedural , syntactic , and data abstraction more fully by allowing programs to define hygiene - bending and hygiene - breaking syntactic abstractions and new unique datatypes along with procedures and hygienic macros in any scope ;
allow programmers to rely on a level of automatic run-time type and bounds checking sufficient to ensure type safety while also providing a standard way to declare whether such checks are desired ; and
allow implementations to generate efficient code , without requiring programmers to use implementation - specific operators or declarations .
In general , R6RS should include building blocks that allow a wide variety of libraries to be written , include commonly used user - level features to enhance portability and readability of library and application code , and exclude features that are less commonly used and easily implemented in separate libraries .
R6RS Scheme should also be backward compatible with programs written in R5RS Scheme to the extent possible without compromising the above principles and future viability of the language .
With respect to future viability , we operate under the assumption that many more Scheme programs will be written in the future than exist in the present , so the future programs are those with which we must be most concerned .
4. Decisions
This section outlines the decisions made to date .
4.1 . Language structure
The R6RS language consists of a core language and a set of additional libraries .
The exact composition of the core language is expected to fluctuate as other features of R6RS are finalized .
Some examples of the kind of libraries which R6RS might specify are as follows :
arithmetic - fixnum : Procedures specific to fixnums ( see Section 7.4 )
arithmetic - flonum : Procedures specific to flonums ( see Section 7.4 )
records - procedural :
The procedural API to the record mechanism ( see Section 7.2 )
records - reflection :
The reflection procedures for the record mechanism ( see Section 7.2 )
hash - tables : Hash tables ( see Section 4.6 )
promises : delay and force
and eval :
The eval procedure , along with necessary support procedures .
procedure , along with necessary support procedures .
r5rs : R5RS compatibility
4.2 . Programs
R6RS programs exist only in the form of libraries and scripts .
A library consists of a single top - level library form .
Libraries may import variable and keyword bindings from other libraries ( standard or user - defined ) and may export variable and keyword bindings .
A script consists of a standard script header and a single top - level library .
All definitions and expressions must appear within a library form ; R6RS has no notion of a top - level definition or expression .
The eval procedure will likely , however , allow the evaluation of an expression ( but not a definition ) within the scope of a specified set of library bindings .
4.3 . Features eliminated
The following features of R5RS have been eliminated .
transcript - on and transcript - off
and interaction - environment
top - level definitions and expressions ( see Section 4.2 )
The following features of R5RS are deprecated but will be available in an R5RS compatibility library :
scheme - report - environment
null - environment
quotient , remainder , modulo ( see SRFI 77 for replacements )
4.4 . Changes
The following syntactic and semantic changes have been made to existing features .
Syntax is case sensitive .
Internal defines now follow letrec* semantics .
semantics .
There is now a single unique end - of - file object .
Continuations created by begin must accept any number of values .
( This was optional in R 5 RS . )
must accept any number of values .
( This was optional in R RS . )
Any character or boolean must be followed by a delimiter .
The new syntax #!r6rs is treated as a declaration that a source library or script contains only r6rs - compatible lexical constructs .
It is otherwise treated as a comment by the reader .
is treated as a declaration that a source library or script contains only r6rs - compatible lexical constructs .
It is otherwise treated as a comment by the reader .
An implementation may or may not signal an error when it sees #!
symbol , for any symbol symbol that is not r6rs .
Implementations are encouraged to use specific #!
- prefixed symbols as flags that subsequent input contains extensions to the standard lexical syntax .
, for any symbol that is not .
Implementations are encouraged to use specific - prefixed symbols as flags that subsequent input contains extensions to the standard lexical syntax .
All other lexical errors must be signaled , effectively ruling out any implementation - dependent extensions unless identified by a #!

Expressions that would have evaluated to some " unspecified value " in R 5 RS evaluate to a new unique ( in the sense of eq ? ) " unspecified " value .
RS evaluate to a new unique ( in the sense of ) " unspecified " value .
Character and string comparison routines are now n-ary .
( This was optional in R 5 RS . )
RS . )
The in and out thunks of a dynamic - wind are considered " outside " of the dynamic - wind ; that is , escaping from either does not cause the out thunk to be invoked , and jumping back in does not cause the in thunk to be invoked .
and thunks of a are considered " outside " of the ; that is , escaping from either does not cause the thunk to be invoked , and jumping back in does not cause the thunk to be invoked .
Most standard procedures are required to raise an exception with a specific condition ( in the default " safe " mode ) when given invalid inputs , except in certain specific cases where the answer can be determined in spite of the invalid input and the additional work involved may be extraordinary .
For example , map must raise an exception if its first argument is not a procedure or if its other arguments are not ( proper ) lists of the same length .
On the other hand , ( memq x ls ) must raise an exception if and only if , before it finds a tail of ls whose car is eq ? to x , it encounters a non-list tail or cycle in ls .
must raise an exception if its first argument is not a procedure or if its other arguments are not ( proper ) lists of the same length .
On the other hand , must raise an exception if and only if , before it finds a tail of whose car is eq ? to , it encounters a non-list tail or cycle in .
When given a value x that can be represented as a datum , write must print x as a datum for which read would produce a value that is equivalent ( in the sense of equal ? ) to x ( read / write invariance ) .
When given a value x that cannot be represented as a datum , the behavior of write is unspecified .
that can be represented as a datum , must print as a datum for which would produce a value that is equivalent ( in the sense of equal ? ) to ( read / write invariance ) .
When given a value that cannot be represented as a datum , the behavior of is unspecified .
Every symbol , string , and character that can be created via standard operators has at least one standard representation as a datum .
In most implementations , this will also be true of numbers .
The equal ?
predicate now terminates for all inputs , following the semantics of equiv ? in SRFI 85 .
4.5 . Features added
The following features have been added :
letrec* ( letrec with left - to - right evaluation order )
( with left - to - right evaluation order ) block comments bracketed by #| and |#
and expression comments prefixed by # ;
matched square brackets ( " [ " and " ] " ) ; equivalent to matched parentheses for list data and list - structured forms
" and " " ) ; equivalent to matched parentheses for list data and list - structured forms symbols of the form -> subsequent * are now allowed
* are now allowed eof - object constructor to obtain the end - of - file object
constructor to obtain the end - of - file object unspecified procedure that returns the unspecified value
procedure that returns the unspecified value let - values and let *- values multiple - value binding forms
and multiple - value binding forms ( define var ) syntax : abbreviation for ( define var ( unspecified ) )
syntax : abbreviation for when and unless syntax
and syntax case - lambda syntax
syntax call / cc as a second name for call - with - current - continuation
as a second name for new list - processing procedures ( mostly inspired by SRFI 1 ) : exists , forall , fold - left , fold - right , filter , partition , iota , find , remq , remv , remove , memp , remp , and assp ( the latter three accept a predicate and a list )
, , , , , , , , , , , , , and ( the latter three accept a predicate and a list ) Unicode support
4.6 . Features to be added
The following features will be added , but the details have yet to be fully worked out .
top - level libraries
exception handling
safe ( default ) and unsafe modes
syntax - case macros
macros hash tables ( as a library )
byte-vector datatype and operations
scripts
fixnum - and flonum - specific arithmetic
support for infinities and NaNs
4.7 . Reaffirmations
The following features of R5RS are reaffirmed for R6RS .
support for multiple values
unspecified evaluation order for applications , let bindings , and letrec bindings
bindings , and bindings set-car ! and set-cdr ! ( but see Section 5 )
and ( but see Section 5 ) read - char and peek - char return the eof object
and return the eof object ( begin ) is still an invalid expression
is still an invalid expression case still uses memv
still uses one - armed if remains in the language
remains in the language append copies all but last argument , even if last argument is ()
copies all but last argument , even if last argument is ( ) is still an invalid expression
is still an invalid expression the contents of ( make - string n ) and ( make - vector n ) remain unspecified ( in particular , the elements of ( make - vector n ) are not initialized to the new " unspecified " value
4.8 . Beyond R6RS
The following features are definitely not under consideration for R6RS .
We encourage anyone interested in seeing any of these features in R7RS to make concrete proposals via the SRFI process .
processes
network programming
object - oriented programming
box datatype
formatted output
graph printing ( printed representation for shared structure and cycles )
rec form , ( rec id e ) => ( letrec ( [ id e ] ) id )
form , vector - length prefix : # n (
gensyms / uids
external syntax for the eof object , e.g. , #!eof
external syntax for the unspecified value , e.g. , #!unspecified
SRFI 0 cond - expand
homogeneous numeric vectors
weak pointers
support for regular expressions
5. Mutability of pairs
Although set -car ! and set -cdr !
were previously reaffirmed ( Section 4.7 ) , the editors have decided to reconsider whether pairs should be immutable in R6RS .
Members of the Scheme community wishing to weigh in on the issue should contact one of the editors .
Making pairs immutable would simplify argument error checks for some list - processing operations , simplify the list ?
predicate , allow apply not to copy the input list when invoking a procedure with a dot interface , and allow program improvers to perform deforestation , i.e. , to eliminate some of the intermediate lists allocated when nested mapping , reversing , appending and similar operations are used .
User - defined record types can be used in place of pairs whenever a mutable data structure is required .
On the other hand , making pairs immutable is an incompatible change that would break some existing programs , and mutable pairs are natural building blocks for various abstractions , like queues and streams .
A more radical change is to require that the second argument to cons be a list , i.e. , the empty list or a pair .
This would make list ?
constant time and further simplify argument error checks for some list - processing operations .
Pairs would become useful only as building blocks for lists , and records ( or vectors ) would have to be used for most other purposes for which pairs are currently used .
6. Reference implementations
The editors will publish , along with the revised report proper , nonnormative , portable ( with implementation - dependent hooks as necessary ) , and reasonably efficient reference implementations of the major subsystems of R6RS , including the library , record , Unicode , arithmetic , exceptions , I/O , and macro subsystems .
The editors may publish reference implementations of selected additional features as well .
7. Work in Progress
Most of the standardization effort is currently focused on several subsystems .
Sections 7.1-7.8 list for each subsystem any informal requirements the editors have identified , the current status , and open questions .
In several cases , a subsystem is up for discussion as a SRFI in order to give the editors a chance to inform the community of the ongoing work and obtain valuable feedback from the community .
The final mechanism adopted for R6RS may , however , differ in minor or significant ways from the published SRFI .
A list of other items up for consideration is given in Section 7.9 .
These have not received as much attention to date , usually because they involve less complex or far - reaching changes or are considered to be of lower priority .
7.1 . Libraries
Informal requirements : support distribution of portable libraries , support identification of library location , namespace management , export / import of macros , permit separate but dependent analysis and compilation , support generation of efficient compiled code , ability to define new libraries .
Support for libraries is under community discussion via SRFI 83 ( R6RS Library Syntax ) .
Two big issues have arisen : the need to clarify phases , e.g. , for compile - time modules that import at compile - time , and how library names are written ( coding as strings is controversial ) .
Still up in the air are the extent to which the syntax of import and export forms is tied down , what built - in libraries besides r6rs there might be , and how to support subsetting and supersetting of libraries .
7.2 . Records
Informal requirements : disjoint types , syntactic interface , mutable fields .
Support for records will be based on SRFI 76 ( R6RS Records ) , which has now been withdrawn as planned after revisions based in part on community input .
While the SRFI did not fully specify the generativity of ordinary record definitions , we have decided that they should be " run-time " generative unless declared nongenerative .
We have also eliminated the restriction that the parent of a nongenerative record be a nongenerative record , and we decided to keep the " sealed " feature .
Additionally , we have decided to allow an implementation to treat any or all of its built - in types as records , i.e. , record ?
may or may not return true for an object of a built - in type .
7.3 . Unicode
Informal requirements : provision for Unicode characters and character syntax , Unicode strings and string syntax ; Unicode character I/O ; integer -> char and char -> integer are inverse operations and support Unicode - specific text encodings ; write / read invariance for every datum , including symbols .
Support for Unicode will be based on SRFI 75 ( R6RS Unicode data ) , which has now been withdrawn as planned after revisions based in part on community input .
See http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-75/mail-archive/msg00309.html for a discussion of probable differences between the withdrawn SRFI and R6RS .
7.4 . Arithmetic
Informal requirements : support for IEEE zeros , infinities , and NaNs , clean up behavior of eqv? wrt numbers , fix certain arithmetic operations , transparency .
Changes for R6RS arithmetic , including support for fixnum - specific , flonum - specific , and bitwise operators and IEEE arithmetic , are under community discussion via SRFI 77 ( Preliminary Proposal for R6RS Arithmetic ) , which has recently been revised based in part on community input .
7.5 . Exceptions
Informal requirements : clarify the meaning of " is an error , " view exception handling as a means of communication between parts of the program .
The editors have decided to adopt SRFI 34 ( Exception Handling for Programs ) as the basis for the R6RS exception - handling system and SRFI 35 ( Conditions ) as the basis for the R6RS condition system .
Informal requirements : read - byte and write - byte , ports that support binary I/O , byte - vector datatype , block read / write operations .
The editors have decided to adopt SRFI 79 ( Primitive I/O ) and SRFI 81 ( Port I/O ) as the basis for the R6RS I /O system .
The byte - vector datatype requirement is addressed by the binary block datatype ( Section 7.8 ) .
7.7 . Macros
Informal requirements : specify expansion semantics , specify interaction with modules , allow procedural transformers , hygiene - breaking operations , maintain support for syntax - rules .
The editors have decided to adopt syntax - case as currently implemented in Chez Scheme and MzScheme , with various differences to be worked out by Dybvig and Flatt .
Also , the underscore identifier ( " _ " ) will no longer be a pattern variable but instead a special identifier that matches any input , and underscore will be allowed in place of the keyword naming a macro in a syntax - rules pattern .
SRFI 93 ( R6RS Syntax - Case Macros ) has recently been submitted .
7.8 . Binary block datatype
The editors have decided to adopt SRFI 74 ( Octet - Addressed Binary Blocks ) as the basis for byte- vector functionality in R6RS , with the name bytes replaces the name blob .
In contrast with the SRFI , the contents of ( make - bytes n ) is unspecified and an optional fill argument has been added , as with make - string and make - vector .
7.9 .
Other possible changes
The following possible features and changes have been discussed without resolution .
improving the semantics of eqv? and equal ?
and support for file operations
support system operations
support for enumerations
changes to eval to reflect the existence of libraries and other R6RS changes
8. Completion Process
We intend to deliver a draft R6RS to the Steering Committee by September 1 , 2006 .
An initial internal ( editors only ) draft of R6RS has been created and reflects most of the decisions the editors have made to date .
This draft will be updated as work wraps up on the major subsystems and other issues .
For each of the subsystems , the core / library split , and the safe / unsafe mode mechanism and semantics , we have assigned a single editor to be responsible for ensuring progress .
We have also assigned one or more additional editors to help .
These assignments are shown below .
subsystem primary editor additional editors libraries Flatt Dybvig records Sperber Dybvig , van Straaten arithmetic Clinger Sperber Unicode Flatt Clinger macros Dybvig Flatt exceptions Sperber Clinger I/O Sperber van Straaten byte vectors Sperber Clinger core / library split van Straaten Dybvig hash tables van Straaten Clinger safe / unsafe mode Clinger Sperber
At this point , our discussions will be limited mostly to the major subsystems and the other possible features and changes described in Section 7.9 .
New issues may also be considered if this can be done without jeopardizing our goal to submit a draft R6RS to the steering committee by the target deadline .
Responsibility for making sure that the editors complete their work and communicate effectively lies with the chair ( Dybvig ) and responsibility for completing the R6RS draft lies with the project editor ( Sperber ) .

I have contacted Orbitz and let them know they will recieve no service from me , friends , family , or peers . �
Thanks for the entertainment over the years .

Sent to Orbitz :
Just letting you know that because you ripped off Maddox , I will NEVER use your service .
- Mike , Sarasota , FL
I wo n't use orbitz any more either .
I booked a flight for my husband and I to fly from Cincinnati to Boston for a friends wedding .
A few days before the flight I got check and make sure no flights have been changed and corirm plans and that is when I noticed they booked both tickets under my name !
I was pissed off !!
Orbitz refused to do anything and basically said too bad .
I had to use my frequent flyer miles to get my husband another ticket .
I then proceeded to find the CEOs of Orbitz telephone number using the wonder of the internet .
I called every day and left a message and had my friends do the same for me .
Eventually my money was refunded .
I guess someone getting paid big sacks of money with dollar signs on it decided that giving my my $ 150 back was better than dealing with my bitching every day into his voice mail .
Melissa
Hey maddox ,
I read your new article about orbitz .
I 'm pretty surprised you did n't mention orbitz ' involvement with spyware companies ( I believe comet cursor but possibly others . )
They 're a pretty sleezy company all around it seems , so I 'm not too surprised they 'd pull shit like they did to you .
They 're not getting any of my money that 's for sure .
Jordan
I have n't written to you before , so I hope the first impression I make is good enough for a response .
My father is a businessman who travels about 3 times a week to many different cities across the nation , and he has used orbitz almost every time he travels .
I am proud to say through my encouragement , and him seeing that not only he can be screwed by such a fraudulent company , Orbitz will not be used by him , or his company as far as he sees fit .
I know theres a 90 % chance you do n't give a shit , but just to let you know there are people out there who still like to see some civilian justice thrown down .

I do n't know how else to forward this message , seeing as your site is irreparably impossible to navigate - but I wanted to inform the proper officers in your company that the customer service is - although not experienced by me directly - seriously flawed .
Upon reading an article written by maddox ( http://www.thebestpageintheuniverse.com) , an associate in the company which I work for , I pledge to never conduct business with your company , and will reccomend that my peers do the same .
I hope you will read his article , seeing as your company has decided it proper to ignore his correspondence , and award him the refund he rightfully deserves .
Thank you , have a nice day .
- Jon M .
We too got ripped off .
After sending the information on when we'd like the flight at Orbitz , we got a new screen showing us what our tickets looked like .
And what do you know ?
IT HAD THE WRONG DATES IN A DIFFERENT MONTH .
No question on us putting the dates in correctly -- there was two of us filling it out .
... So we called .
And they told us we have a faulty browser or something is wrong with our internet .
Right .
Definitely our Internet Explorer is faulty , and we are definitely the only people who use it .
Or is it our internet service provider who is to blame ?
Yup , you guessed it : no refund .
-TB
Orbitz fucked me over too :
I booked well in advance tickets from Rochester , NY to San Diego , CA . � 400 whatever dollars who gives a fuck .�
A few days before the flight I check the Orbitz site to get my eticket code and come to find out ...
MY TICKET HAS BEEN CANCELED .
Why ?�
The connection time was under 40 minutes .
Pretty stupid of me right ?�
WRONG .
I typed in Rochester , NY I typed in San Diego , and then the �days ... and then Orbitz GAVE ME those flights with the under 40 minute connection time .�
THEY TOLD ME to make those flights and did n't let me know that I needed a�longer connection time .�
Not when I purchased the tickets , and not even by email to let me know there was a problem .
So I had to purchase the tickets all over again , but since it was two days before the flight it cost three times as much .
A call to customer support gave me the same bullshit you went through . �
The stupid broad actually had the nerve to tell me , " You need to be your own travel agent . " �
I swear to fucking God if I have n't seen Orbitz listed under a million different " online travel agents " directories .
I will never book with Orbitz again and applaud your efforts to bring down that sham of a company .

After reading about one of your previous customer 's unpleasant experiences with your company , and your refusal to compensate for his troubles , my friends and I decided that we did not want to take the risk of �having an experience as troublesome and unenjoyable as his .
After hearing about your unwillingness to rectify the situation to the customer 's satisfaction , we 've decided to go with another company .
I am writing this letter to let you know , that in not willing to pacify one customer 's complaints to his liking , your company has lost the business of 5 customers who regularly travel , and several other potential customers .

Ive been reading your site for a while and never felt compelled to email you until this day .
As a semi - frequent air traveller your article about Orbitz really hit hard with me .
I sent them an email telling them how I came across your story and how I would never do business with them and encourage others to do the same .
I hope your crusade against asshole customer service and misleading advertising strikes them as hard as i think it will .

I completly agree with you about orbitz ... those assholes need to treat their customers a little better ... i have also lost money with them and got completly screwed .. and just like you i got nothing in return .
I hope your site helps out those of us who got completely fucked from them !!!
I 'm planning a trip to LA ( from NY ) in May for the E3 event .
Not only will Orbitz be losing my business , but they will also be losing the business of everyone that 's going with me .
They 've lost thousands of dollars from you to me to my direct friends alone .
I sent them a nice E - mail to wrap things up .
- ngamer
Maddox ,
Upon reading your new post regarding Orbitz , I decided to email them to inform them that not only will I never do business with them in my entire life , I will make sure that everybody I know does not even consider Orbitz as an option to plan any future travel .
Even though I have never used Orbitz before , they are forever out of the question as an option in my mind .
On that note , NEVER underestimate how many people will support you on these kinds of things .
You 're still a dick though .
- Brett
Sent to Orbitz :
Please forward this on to anyone left at your company who cares about the customer .
I 've decided to stop using Orbitz altogether after reading about how you sold someone an impossible itinerary and then refused to provide them with a refund .
I simply can't take a chance that you 'd do that with me .
- Jeff
After reading your most recent article I decided I would send orbitz an email .�
Well , I will just inform you of their responses .�
I wrote them this :
I am just informing you that I and many others will never use Orbitz again and the $ 144 dollars you screwed this guy out of will not go unmentioned . �
You have lost thousands of dollars of business .�
He has a big crowd . �
Summary : you fucked with the wrong person .
Here 's a link to his site and the page that he describes his problem with you .�
By the way , at any given time his site has 120 + people visiting it .

They responded with this :
Zahar said Hamas wanted to protect the Palestinian people
Up to 40 rockets had been fired at Israel , weeks after its military withdrew from the territory .
In response to the rockets , Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes .
Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make " unrestricted " strikes , its military launched new missile attacks overnight .
Palestinian witnesses reported attacks across the strip early on Monday :
Helicopters fired two missiles into Gaza City , knocking out power in eastern districts
Missiles slammed into Khan Younis in the south , damaging a building reportedly used by militants from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine faction
A missile landed in an open field near the southern border town of Rafah
A missile hit an area near a road in the north of the strip used by militant rocket squads , the Israeli military said ; one woman was said to have been injured by shrapnel .
Ceasefire
Announcing the end to rocket attacks , the Hamas leader in Gaza , Mahmoud Zahar , said the organisation was committed to a ceasefire which militants declared earlier this year .
Israel vowed to wage a sustained campaign against militants
Mr Zahar said that in stopping attacks on Israel , Hamas wanted to protect the Palestinian people from what he called Zionist oppression .
Palestinian leaders and Egyptian mediators had been pressing Hamas to stop .
The BBC's Alan Johnston says Hamas is in danger of being blamed by Palestinians for drawing Israel back into Gaza just two weeks after a withdrawal welcomed with huge relief by the local population .
On Sunday , an Israeli air strike killed two Islamic Jihad militants , including a commander , Mohammed Khalil .
They were the latest fatalities in a long weekend of violence , just a fortnight after Israeli troops withdrew from the Gaza Strip after 38 years .
Palestinian militants launched rockets at Israeli territory around the town of Sderot , injuring five people .
They were responding to the shooting of three Islamic Jihad militants in the West Bank and a blast which killed 15 at a rally in Gaza - an explosion blamed on Israel by Hamas but disowned by the Israelis .
The rocket attacks , in turn , brought a wave of Israeli air strikes .
Leadership woes
Mr Sharon told his cabinet Israel would conduct a " continued action , whose aim is to hurt the terrorists and not to let up " .
Both the Palestinian and the Israeli leaders are facing challenges to their leadership .
The Palestinian parliament plans to hold a vote of no-confidence in Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei and his cabinet , although this has now been postponed for a week .
Mr Sharon also faces a party leadership challenge .
His Likud party 's central committee is due to vote on Monday whether to back his rival and former prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu .
Mr Netanyahu opposed Mr Sharon 's decision to pull settlers out of Gaza , saying it would encourage Islamic militants to attack Israel .
Whatever we think of Israel 's assault on Lebanon , all of us seem to agree about one fact : that it was a response , however disproportionate , to an unprovoked attack by Hizbullah .
I repeated this " fact " in my last column , when I wrote that " Hizbullah fired the first shots " .
This being so , the Israeli government 's supporters ask peaceniks like me , what would you have done ?
It 's an important question .
But its premise , I have now discovered , is flawed .
Since Israel 's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May 2000 , there have been hundreds of violations of the " blue line " between the two countries .
The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon ( Unifil ) reports that Israeli aircraft crossed the line " on an almost daily basis " between 2001 and 2003 , and " persistently " until 2006 .
These incursions " caused great concern to the civilian population , particularly low - altitude flights that break the sound barrier over populated areas " .
On some occasions , Hizbullah tried to shoot them down with anti-aircraft guns .
In October 2000 , the Israel Defence Forces shot at unarmed Palestinian demonstrators on the border , killing three and wounding 20 .
In response , Hizbullah crossed the line and kidnapped three Israeli soldiers .
On several occasions , Hizbullah fired missiles and mortar rounds at IDF positions , and the IDF responded with heavy artillery and sometimes aerial bombardment .
Incidents like this killed three Israelis and three Lebanese in 2003 ; one Israeli soldier and two Hizbullah fighters in 2005 ; and two Lebanese people and three Israeli soldiers in February 2006 .
Rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel several times in 2004 , 2005 and 2006 , on some occasions by Hizbullah .
But , the UN records , " none of the incidents resulted in a military escalation " .
On May 26 this year , two officials of Islamic Jihad - Nidal and Mahmoud Majzoub - were killed by a car bomb in the Lebanese city of Sidon .
This was widely assumed in Lebanon and Israel to be the work of Mossad , the Israeli intelligence agency .
In June , a man named Mahmoud Rafeh confessed to the killings and admitted that he had been working for Mossad since 1994 .
Militants in southern Lebanon responded , on the day of the bombing , by launching eight rockets into Israel .
One soldier was lightly wounded .
There was a major bust - up on the border , during which one member of Hizbullah was killed and several wounded , and one Israeli soldier wounded .
But while the border region " remained tense and volatile " , Unifil says it was " generally quiet " until July 12 .
There has been a heated debate on the internet about whether the two Israeli soldiers kidnapped by Hizbullah that day were captured in Israel or in Lebanon , but it now seems pretty clear that they were seized in Israel .
This is what the UN says , and even Hizbullah seems to have forgotten that they were supposed to have been found sneaking around the outskirts of the Lebanese village of Aita al - Shaab .
Now it simply states that " the Islamic resistance captured two Israeli soldiers at the border with occupied Palestine " .
Three other Israeli soldiers were killed by the militants .
There is also some dispute about when , on July 12 , Hizbullah first fired its rockets ; but Unifil makes it clear that the firing took place at the same time as the raid - 9 am .
Its purpose seems to have been to create a diversion .
No one was hit .
But there is no serious debate about why the two soldiers were captured : Hizbullah was seeking to exchange them for the 15 prisoners of war taken by the Israelis during the occupation of Lebanon and ( in breach of article 118 of the third Geneva convention ) never released .
It seems clear that if Israel had handed over the prisoners , it would - without the spillage of any more blood - have retrieved its men and reduced the likelihood of further kidnappings .
But the Israeli government refused to negotiate .
Instead - well , we all know what happened instead .
Almost 1,000 Lebanese and 33 Israeli civilians have been killed so far , and a million Lebanese displaced from their homes .
On July 12 , in other words , Hizbullah fired the first shots .
But that act of aggression was simply one instance in a long sequence of small incursions and attacks over the past six years by both sides .
So why was the Israeli response so different from all that preceded it ?
The answer is that it was not a reaction to the events of that day .
The assault had been planned for months .
The San Francisco Chronicle reports that " more than a year ago , a senior Israeli army officer began giving PowerPoint presentations , on an off - the - record basis , to US and other diplomats , journalists and thinktanks , setting out the plan for the current operation in revealing detail " .
The attack , he said , would last for three weeks .
It would begin with bombing and culminate in a ground invasion .
Gerald Steinberg , professor of political science at Bar - Ilan University , told the paper that " of all of Israel 's wars since 1948 , this was the one for which Israel was most prepared ...
By 2004 , the military campaign scheduled to last about three weeks that we 're seeing now had already been blocked out and , in the last year or two , it 's been simulated and rehearsed across the board " .
A " senior Israeli official " told the Washington Post that the raid by Hizbullah provided Israel with a " unique moment " for wiping out the organisation .
The New Statesman 's editor , John Kampfner , says he was told by more than one official source that the US government knew in advance of Israel 's intention to take military action in Lebanon .
The Bush administration told the British government .
Israel 's assault , then , was premeditated : it was simply waiting for an appropriate excuse .
It was also unnecessary .
It is true that Hizbullah had been building up munitions close to the border , as its current rocket attacks show .
But so had Israel .
Just as Israel could assert that it was seeking to deter incursions by Hizbullah , Hizbullah could claim - also with justification - that it was trying to deter incursions by Israel .
The Lebanese army is certainly incapable of doing so .
Yes , Hizbullah should have been pulled back from the Israeli border by the Lebanese government and disarmed .
Yes , the raid and the rocket attack on July 12 were unjustified , stupid and provocative , like just about everything that has taken place around the border for the past six years .
But the suggestion that Hizbullah could launch an invasion of Israel or that it constitutes an existential threat to the state is preposterous .
Since the occupation ended , all its acts of war have been minor ones , and nearly all of them reactive .
So it is not hard to answer the question of what we would have done .
First , stop recruiting enemies , by withdrawing from the occupied territories in Palestine and Syria .
Second , stop provoking the armed groups in Lebanon with violations of the blue line - in particular the persistent flights across the border .
Third , release the prisoners of war who remain unlawfully incarcerated in Israel .
Fourth , continue to defend the border , while maintaining the diplomatic pressure on Lebanon to disarm Hizbullah ( as anyone can see , this would be much more feasible if the occupations were to end ) .
Here then is my challenge to the supporters of the Israeli government : do you dare to contend that this programme would have caused more death and destruction than the current adventure has done ?

The unknown acacia species is now half a metre tall
Scientists from the Millennium Seed Bank , operated by the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew , have induced seeds from three species to germinate .
They had been brought to Britain from South Africa by a Dutch merchant in 1803 , and were found in a notebook stored in the National Archives .
Given this history , the team said it was surprised by their success .
" They had been kept under pretty poor conditions , " said Matt Daws , a seed ecologist with the Millennium Seed Bank , which is located at Wakehurst Place in West Sussex .
" They 'd been in a ship for a year , certainly for months , coming back from the Cape ; then they 'd been kept in the Tower of London for a number of years .
Only in the last 10 years have they been in controlled conditions .
" So I did n't expect any of them to germinate , " he told the BBC News website , " and the three that did really are tough seeds . "
No record
We did n't have many options - it was a shot in the dark as to whether we'd be able to get things to work
Matt Daws
The Liparia did particularly well , with 16 out of the 25 seeds progressing into plants .
The acacia was a different proposition .
" We only had two seeds to work with , and one of them turned out to have been eaten inside by an insect , " recalled Dr Daws .
" What that means is we did n't have many options - it was a shot in the dark as to whether we'd be able to get things to work . "
The Cape region is regularly visited by fire , which is a signal to germinate .
So scientists mimicked the effects of fire by chipping off the hard coats of some seeds , and bubbling smoke over others .
Even with this detailed preparation , 29 of the 32 species represented declined to germinate .
These are not the oldest seeds ever tempted into life .
Four years ago scientists in the US germinated lotus seeds which had been carbon - dated as 500 years old ; more recently , an Israeli team claimed to have grown a date palm from a 2,000 year old seed .
The seeds remained undetected in Jan Teerlink 's notebook
They were originally taken on board the Prussian ship Henriette by Jan Teerlink , a merchant bringing silk and tea from Java and China , as the ship stopped off at the Cape of Good Hope on its way back to Europe .
On the way back the Henriette was captured by the British navy ; and Teerlink 's possessions , including his notebook , passed to the High Court of Admiralty , and then to the Tower .
Why he carried the seeds and why he put them between the pages of his notebook are unknown .
When the plants are older , the Kew scientists plan to make genetic and genomic analyses , and compare the old plants with modern - day equivalents , perhaps showing how Cape species have changed and adapted over the last two centuries .

" At work , " he said , " the single guys say our insurance is good .
Well , it 's good for them , because they do n't have kids , or do n't get sick .
When you have a kid who 's chronically sick , it 's totally different . "
On his long days , Mr. Dorsett usually skips lunch rather than spend $ 6 or $ 7 at a fast food restaurant .
He wishes he could take the family to the Grand Canyon , or afford a house where the girls could have their own bedrooms .
But when asked about his sacrifices , he said the luxury he missed most was time , not money .
" Zach and I had no relationship until two years ago , " he said .
" Dakota hardly ever talked to me .
I was putting in 80 , 90 hours a week , not having a relationship with my children . "
While Mr. Dorsett works , Mrs. Dorsett juggles child care with the seemingly endless wrangling with insurance companies and , until the bankruptcy filing , with creditors .
Managing a Medical Mystery
On an August morning at home , Mrs. Dorsett prepared a lunch of corn dogs and macaroni and cheese while Zachery got ready for soccer camp .
By all appearances , he is a healthy - looking boy with a somber disposition .
Though he has missed as many as 42 days in a school year because of illness , he has friends and keeps up with his classes , his mother said .
His worst problem at school , she said , is pushing himself too hard .
Until earlier this year , no one knew what was wrong with him .
His immune disorder , known as common variable immune deficiency , can be detected through a simple blood test , but as Mrs. Dorsett took him from doctor to doctor , usually with small problems that would not go away , the doctors looked elsewhere .
Some treated only the immediate symptoms ; others made Mrs. Dorsett feel she was overtreating her child .
" I felt there was something wrong , " she said .
" But you can't walk into a doctor 's office and say you think you know what it is because you saw it online .
They 're the ones with the prescription pads , and I did n't want to make them mad . "
As the family went from one doctor to the next , without a diagnosis of the root problem , the insurance company often questioned the expenses .
Why did Zachery need four doctor visits or five rounds of antibiotics for an ailment that most children shook off in a couple of days ?
Mrs. Dorsett spent days on the phone , often in voice - mail loops , and often long - distance , pleading her case .
What of Mr. Summers 's other claim , that such sex differences are innate ?
We know that culture plays a role in the divergence of the sexes , but so does biology .
For example , on the first day of life , male and female newborns pay attention to different things .
On average , at 24 hours old , more male infants will look at a mechanical mobile suspended above them , whereas more female infants will look at a human face .
It has also been found that the amount of prenatal testosterone , which is produced by the fetus and measurable in the amniotic fluid in which the baby is bathed in the womb , predicts how sociable a child will be .
The higher the level of prenatal testosterone , the less eye contact the child will make as a toddler , and the slower the child will develop language .
That is connected to the role of fetal testosterone in influencing brain development .
Males obviously produce far more prenatal testosterone than females do , but levels vary considerably even across members of the same sex .
In fact , it may not be your sex per se that determines what kind of brain you have , but your prenatal hormone levels .
From there it's a short leap to the intriguing idea that a male can have a typically female brain ( if his testosterone levels are low ) , while a female can have a typically male brain ( if her testosterone levels are high ) .
That notion fits with the evidence that girls born with congenital adrenal hyperplasia , who for genetic reasons produce too much testosterone , are more likely to exhibit " tomboy " behavior than girls with more ordinary hormone levels .
What does all this have to do with autism ?
According to what I have called the " extreme male brain " theory of autism , people with autism simply match an extreme of the male profile , with a particularly intense drive to systemize and an unusually low drive to empathize .
When adults with Asperger 's syndrome ( a subgroup on the autistic spectrum ) took the same questionnaires we gave to non-autistic adults , they exhibited extreme Type S brains .
Psychological tests reveal a similar pattern .
And this analysis makes sense .
It helps explain the social disability in autism , because empathy difficulties make it harder to make and maintain relationships with others .
It also explains the " islets of ability " that people with autism display in subjects like math or music or drawing -- all skills that benefit from systemizing .
People with autism often develop obsessions , which may be nothing other than very intense systemizing at work .
The child might become obsessed with electrical switches ( an electrical system ) , or train timetables ( a temporal system ) , or spinning objects ( a physical system ) , or the names of deep - sea fish ( a natural , taxonomic system ) .
The child with severe autism , who may have additional learning difficulties and little language ability , might express his obsessions by bouncing constantly on a trampoline or spinning around and around , because motion is highly lawful and predictable .
Some children with severe autism line objects up for hours on end .
What used to be dismissed by clinicians as " purposeless , repetitive behavior " may actually be a sign of a mind that is highly tuned to systemize .
One needs to be extremely careful in advancing a cause for autism , because this field is rife with theories that have collapsed under empirical scrutiny .
Nonetheless , my hypothesis is that autism is the genetic result of " assortative mating " between parents who are both strong systemizers .
Assortative mating is the term we use when like is attracted to like , and there are four significant reasons to believe it is happening here .
08:08 pm - So I nearly got killed today ...
Version 1.5 , with a few more pix
My neighbor accidentally put a .44 Magnum round though my wall .
It missed my head by I 'd say about three inches .
It started in his bathroom , went through the mirror , went through the closet on the other side , blew through that closet door , traveled across his hallway , blew through our common wall , ricocheted upward off my computer desk , and lodged in the doorframe .
To the people who have claimed this is a hoax :
1 ) So I can attract more hits to a non-revenue blog ?
Yeah , ok .
2 ) For free advertising for my mythical paysite ?
3 ) I destroyed a mirror , a wall , a desk , and a doorframe on purpose so I could what , exactly ?
4 ) I 'm an attention whore .
Yep , that 's why about 75 % of my LJ entries are Friends Only and I keep my Friends List pretty small .
5 ) I pretty have tried every character class , race , gender and have played both Horde & Alliance .
I have a level 60 Warrior as my prime , but I 've been testing a few others .
That 's what I was doing when the incident happened .
6 ) Ballistics " experts " who claim I do n't know what I 'm talking about and claim I do n't know shit about weapons .
Let me put it this way .
I 'm certified to drive an M3A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle , and to operate its 25 mm Bushmaster chaingun and TOW missile launcher .
It also explains why I " just happen " to have the certain something in the last picture .
Pix :
So I was playing World of Warcraft .
I 'm right handed .
You can pretty much figure out where I was sitting .
Bonus :
Free new computer desk .
Where the round finally stopped .
It hit the desk and ricocheted upwards , which is how it ended up at the top of the doorframe .
My neighbor 's bathroom , where the shot originated .
Check out the mirror .
Something tells me he just forfeited his security deposit .
Note the twin .50 AE Desert Eagles , M - 16 magazine , loose ammo , and .357 Magnum laying around like toys .
Nice .
The .44 Magnum he nearly killed me with is out of sight .
Close - up of the mirror .
Yes , this was obviously made with a power drill as part of my elaborate hoax .
</rolleyes >
His wall .
IIRC , this is the wall he shares with me .
I 'm not sure what caused the second hole .
I 'm guessing part of the destroyed closet door .
He also owns an M - 4 carbine , a Bushmaster , about half a dozen Glocks from 10 mm on down , a .44 Automag , a Heckler & Koch MP5 , and he said he has a Barrett.50 cal sniper rifle and a .454 Casull on order .
Me , wearing drywall shrapnel .
The actual round .
It 's pancaked pretty good * .
Sorry it 's blurry , I was trying to take the picture one - handed .
* I can hear it now ... OMG TEH BULLIT IS TOOO SMALL TO BE A MAHGNUM !!11 FAKE !!1 HOAX !!111
* UPDATE *
1 ) I 've become a minor internet celebrity .
2 ) It is now safe to play Warcraft again :
The .NET framework provides two random number generators .
The first is System .
Random .
But is it really random ?
Pseudo - random numbers are chosen with equal probability from a finite set of numbers .
The chosen numbers are not completely random because a definite mathematical algorithm is used to select them , but they are sufficiently random for practical purposes .
The current implementation of the Random class is based on Donald E. Knuth 's subtractive random number generator algorithm , from The Art of Computer Programming , volume 2 : Seminumerical Algorithms .
These cannot be random numbers because they 're produced by a computer algorithm ; computers are physically incapable of randomness .
But perhaps sufficiently random for practical purposes is enough .
The second method is System .
Security .
Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator .
It 's more than an algorithm .
It also incorporates the following environmental factors in its calculations :
The current process ID
The current thread ID
The tick count since boot time
The current time
Various high precision CPU performance counters
An MD4 hash of the user 's environment ( username , computer name , search path , etc )
Good cryptography requires high quality random data .
In fact , a perfect set of encrypted data is indistinguishable from random data .
I wondered what randomness looks like .
So I wrote the following program , which compares the two random number methods available in the .NET framework .
In blue , System .
Random , and in red , System .
Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator .
const int maxlen = 3000 ; Random r = new Random ( ) ; RandomNumberGenerator rng = RandomNumberGenerator .Create ( ) ; Byte[ ] b = new Byte [ 4 ] ; using ( StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter ( " random.csv " ) ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < maxlen ; i++ ) { sw. Write ( r. Next ( ) ) ; sw. Write ( " , " ) ; rng .
GetBytes ( b ) ; sw.WriteLine ( Math.Abs( BitConverter .ToInt32(b , 0 ) ) ) ; } }
3,000 random numbers
10,000 random numbers
30,000 random numbers
I have no idea how to test for true randomness .
The math is far beyond me .
But I do n't see any obvious patterns in the resulting data .
It 's utterly random noise to my eye .
Although both of these methods produce reasonable randomness , they 're ultimately still pseudo - random number generators .
Computers are great number crunchers , but they 're lousy random number generators .
To have any hope of producing truly random data , you must reach outside the computer and sample the analog world .
For example , WASTE samples user mouse movements to generate randomness :
But even something as seemingly random as user input can be predictable ; not all environmental sources are suitably random :
True random numbers are typically generated by sampling and processing a source of entropy outside the computer .
A source of entropy can be very simple , like the little variations in somebody 's mouse movements or in the amount of time between keystrokes .
In practice , however , it can be tricky to use user input as a source of entropy .
Keystrokes , for example , are often buffered by the computer 's operating system , meaning that several keystrokes are collected before they are sent to the program waiting for them .
To the program , it will seem as though the keys were pressed almost simultaneously .
A better source of entropy is a radioactive source .
The points in time at which a radioactive source decays are completely unpredictable , and can be sampled and fed into a computer , avoiding any buffering mechanisms in the operating system .
In fact , this is what the HotBits people at Fourmilab in Switzerland are doing .
Another source of entropy could be atmospheric noise from a radio , like that used here at random.org , or even just background noise from an office or laboratory .
The lavarand people at Silicon Graphics have been clever enough to use lava lamps to generate random numbers , so their entropy source not only gives them entropy , it also looks good !
The latest random number generator to come online is EntropyPool which gathers random bits from a variety of sources including HotBits and random.org , but also from web page hits received by the EntropyPool 's web server .
Carl Ellision has an excellent summary of many popular environmental sources of randomness and their strengths and weaknesses .
But environmental sources have their limits , too -- unlike pseudo - random algorithms , they have to be harvested over time .
Not all environmental sources can provide enough random data for a server under heavy load , for example .
And some encryption methods require more random data than others ; one particularly secure algorithm requires one bit of random data for each bit of encrypted data .
Computers may be lousy random number generators , but we 've still come a long way :
As recently as 100 years ago , people who needed random numbers for scientific work still tossed coins , rolled dice , dealt cards , picked numbers out of hats , or browsed census records for lists of digits .
In 1927 , statistician L.H.C.
Tippett published a table of 41,600 random numbers obtained by taking the middle digits from area measurements of English churches .
In 1955 , the Rand Corporation published A Million Random Numbers With 100,000 Normal Deviates , a massive tome filled with tables of random numbers .
To remove slight biases discovered in the course of testing , the million digits were further randomized by adding all pairs and retaining only the last digit .
The Rand book became a standard reference , still used today in low - level applications such as picking precincts to poll .
The world is random .
Computers are n't .
Randomness is really , really hard for computers .
It 's important to understand the ramifications of this big divide between the analog and digital world , otherwise you 're likely to make the same rookie mistakes Netscape did .
Lying back , exhaling : usually the last thing a person does before leaving this world .
Only in this case it is the world that is leaving me .
A few minutes ago I smoked a pipe of Salvia divinorum , a powerful hallucinogenic herb that I bought openly and legally from a shop near my home .
Of the £ 25 I handed over , more than £ 4 will find its way into government coffers in the form of sales tax .
And salvia was just one of dozens of powerful but entirely legal psychoactive substances that I could have chosen .
All that was far from my mind as the salvia took me on a consciousness - expanding journey unlike any other I have ever experienced .
My body felt disconnected from “ me ” and objects and people appeared cartoonish , surreal and marvellous .
Then , as suddenly as it had began , it was over .
The visions vanished and I was back in my bedroom .
I spoke to my “ sitter ” – the friend who was watching over me , as recommended on the packaging – but my mouth was awkward and clumsy .
When I attempted to stand my coordination was off .
Within a couple of minutes , however , I was fine and clear - headed , though dripping with sweat .
The whole experience had lasted less than 5 minutes .
My salvia trip was part of a journey into the world of “ legal highs ” , a new generation of powerful mind - altering substances that are growing in popularity across the world ( see Table ) .
Accurate figures are hard to come by , as these substances are rarely monitored by drug - enforcement agencies .
But the proliferation of online and high - street retailers suggest they are an increasingly …

THERE has never been anything quite like information technology before , but there have certainly been other complex technologies that needed simplifying .
Joe Corn , a history professor at Stanford University , believes that the first example of a complex consumer technology was clocks , which arrived in the 1820s .
Clocks were sold with user manuals , which featured entries such as “ How to erect and regulate your device ” .
When sewing machines appeared in the 1840s , they came with 40 - page manuals full of detailed instructions .
Discouragingly , it took two generations until a trade publication was able to declare in the 1880s that “ every woman now knows how to use one . ”
At about the same time , the increase in technological complexity gathered pace .
With electricity came new appliances , such as the phonograph , invented in 1877 by Thomas Alva Edison .
According to Mr Norman , the computer - design guru , despite Mr Edison 's genius for engineering he was a marketing moron , and his first phonograph was all but unusable ( in fact , initially he had no particular uses in mind for it ) .
For decades , Mr Edison fiddled with his technology , always going for the most impressive engineering solution .
For instance , he chose cylinders over discs as the recording medium .
It took a generation and the entry of a new rival , Emile Berliner , to prepare the phonograph for the mass market by making it easier to use ( introducing discs instead of cylinders ) and giving it a purpose ( playing music ) .
Mr Edison 's companies foundered whereas Mr Berliner 's thrived , and phonographs became ubiquitous , first as “ gramophones ” or “ Victrolas ” , the name of Mr Berliner 's model , and ultimately as “ record players ” .
Another complex technology , with an even bigger impact , was the car .
The first cars , in the early 1900s , were “ mostly a burden and a challenge ” , says Mr Corn .
Driving one required skill in lubricating various moving parts , sending oil manually to the transmission , adjusting the spark plug , setting the choke , opening the throttle , wielding the crank and knowing what to do when the car broke down , which it invariably did .
People at the time hired chauffeurs , says Mr Corn , mostly because they needed to have a mechanic at hand to fix the car , just as firms today need IT staff and households need teenagers to sort out their computers .
By the 1930s , however , the car had become more user - friendly and ready for the mass market .
Two things in particular had made this possible .
The first was the rise , spread and eventual ubiquity of a support infrastructure for cars .
This included a network of decent roads and motorways , and of petrol stations and garages for repair .
The second was the makers ' increasing skill at hiding the technology from drivers .
Ford proved particularly good at this .
Ironically , it meant that cars got hugely more complex on the inside , because most of the tasks that had previously been carried out by drivers now had to be done automatically .
This presented drivers with a radically simplified surface , or “ interface ” in today 's jargon , so that all they had to do was turn the ignition key , put their foot on the accelerator , brake , steer and change gear — and after 1940 , when automatic transmissions were introduced , even gear - shifting became optional .
Another instructive technology is electricity .
In its early days , those firms and households that could afford it had their own generators .
Keeping these going soon became a full - time job .
In the early 20th century , writes Nick Carr , the author of a book entitled “ Does IT Matter ? ” , most companies had a senior management position called “ vice - president of electricity ” , a rough equivalent of today 's “ chief information officer ” ( CIO ) and “ chief technology officer ” ( CTO ) .
Within a generation , however , the generators and vice - presidents disappeared as electricity became available through the grid , leaving users to deal only with the simplest of interfaces , the power socket .
Out with the nerds
The evolution of these technologies holds some lessons for the IT industry today .
The first observation , according to Mr Norman , “ is that in the early days of any technological revolution the engineers are in charge , and their customers are the early adopters .
But the mass market is the late adopters .
This is why Thomas Alva Edison , an engineering genius , failed miserably in business . ”
Similarly , in IT today , says Mr Papadopoulos of Sun Microsystems , “ the biggest problem is that most of the people who create these artefacts are nerds .
I want to see more artists create these things . ”
The geekiness that predominates in the early stages of any new technology leads to a nasty affliction that Paul Saffo , a technology visionary at California 's Institute for the Future , calls “ featuritis ” .
For example , Microsoft in a recent survey found that most consumers use only 10 % of the features on offer in Microsoft Word .
In other words , some 90 % of this software is clutter that obscures the few features people actually want .
This violates a crucial principle of design .
As Soetsu Yanagi wrote in “ The Unknown Craftsman ” , his classic 1972 book on folk art , “ man is most free when his tools are proportionate to his needs . ”
The most immediate problem with IT today , as with other technologies at comparable stages , says Mr Saffo , is that “ our gadgets are so disproportionate ” .
A second lesson from history , however , is that a brute cull of features would be futile .
As technologies , the sewing machine , the phonograph , the car and the electricity grid have only ever grown more complex over time .
Today 's cars , in fact , are mobile computers , containing dozens of microchips and sensors and other electronic sub-systems that Henry Ford would not recognise .
Electricity grids today are as complex as they are invisible in everyday life .
Consumers notice them only when things go wrong , as they did spectacularly during last year 's power cuts in north - eastern America and Canada .
“ You have to push all the complexity to the back end in order to make the front end very simple , ” says Marc Benioff , the boss of Salesforce.com , a software firm that will be examined in a later article in this survey .
This migration of complexity , says Mr Benioff , echoes the process of civilisation .
Thus , every house initially has its own well and later its own generator .
Civilisation turns houses into “ nodes ” on a public network that householders draw on .
But the “ interface ” — the water tap , the toilet flush , the power switch — has to be “ incredibly simple ” .
All the management of complexity now takes place within the network , so that consumers no longer even know when their electricity or water company upgrades its technology .
Thus , from the user 's point of view , says Mr Benioff , “ technology goes through a gradual disappearance process . ”
From the point of view of the vendors , the opposite is true .
“ Our experience is that for every mouse click we take out of the user experience , 20 things have to happen in our software behind the scenes , ” says Brad Treat , the chief executive of SightSpeed , a company that wants to make video phone calls as easy for consumers as e-mailing .
The same applies to corporate datacentres .
“ So do n't expect some catharsis in eliminating layers of software , ” says Mr Papadopoulos .
“ The way we get rid of complexity is by creating new layers of abstraction and sedimenting what is below . ”
This will take different forms for firms and for consumers .
First , consider the firms .

It seems that here in Romania — the home of Vlad Dracula — our hospitals are running out of blood .
The number of people volunteering to donate blood has declined steadily in recent years .
Health - care professionals fear that joining the European Union will bring crisis - level blood shortages .
Why ?
European regulations forbid any kind of remuneration for this service .
In Romania , people who want to give blood receive a food ticket of approximately $ 11 and two days off from work .
It 's not much but at least it 's something , and even this meager compensation has forestalled disaster .
According to the Charter of the fundamental rights of the European Union , giving blood should be a completely altruistic affair , untainted by base material considerations .
Chapter I of the Charter on " Dignity " includes a section on the " Right to the integrity of the person . "
Here is how your " dignity " is to be protected :
" In the fields of medicine and biology the following must be respected in particular : the prohibition on making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain . "
This means that in order to protect your dignity , the EU stands ready to tell you just what you can and cannot do with yourself .
With no more legal basis for even the most minimal payment , we may be heading toward a very serious blood shortage .
Now , you may or may not agree with the altruistic vision of blood donation — I might feel uneasy about accepting any money in cases such as this one .
But that is my choice .
What is alarming is that with this piece of legislation the state assumes control over our bodies , dictating how are we allowed to use them , and for what .
Furthermore , we have here an excellent example of a shortage created by a government that ignores the law of supply and demand .
Let 's take the economic issue first , and then I 'll return to the moral question in a bit .
By forbidding any kind of payment for blood , the government pushes down the price of blood to zero .
As a consequence , all those who are in a position to provide it , unless they are driven by idealistic motives , will stay away from the collection centers .
It is as simple as that .
You really do n't need a PhD in economics to figure out that much — unless your job is to legislate .
The only way to bring back the people to the collection centers is by providing the necessary incentives .
The choice to give blood is no different from other choices .
It is based on selecting on the margin from a range of possible options , with the cost of that option being the next most highly ranked alternative .
We need reasons to move a particular option among our rankings into the number one spot , displacing the alternative uses of our time and energies .
Remuneration can accomplish that task by compensating us for our costs and providing an objective reward for performing certain services .
In short , the best solution would be to eliminate any law that prevents the formation of a free market for blood .
The right incentives will be found on the free market and no government will be able to guess what those are , without paying either too much or too little .
The Romanian government had previously decided what your blood should cost and how you will be paid ( out of taxpayer money , of course ) .
A free market , in contrast , will provide for both patients and donors what they need : the patient gets the blood , while the donor may get money , or time off in purgatory , according to his or her expectation .
For many poor people , who do n't really have much to live on , this could only be a blessing , just as it may be a blessing for the taxpayer , who foots the bill of the government handouts to them .
The main objection to a free market for blood is that this would commodify the human body .
The view is that there are many things on which you should not put a price because that will , supposedly , degrade them .
Yet , putting a price on something does not degrade that thing , unless you have something against commerce as such .
The price does not express the intrinsic value of anything .
It simply signals the quantity of money — which serves only as a proxy for future purchases of goods and services — that you are ready to give up in order to acquire it , correlated with the quantity of money that a seller is ready to accept .
Money does not express value .
It is only a tool for facilitating exchange .
For example , it is autumn now , and just outside the window near me there are leafs that are turning yellow and red .
Can you express the intrinsic value of that beauty in money ?
Of course not .
You can only evaluate the willingness of somebody to sacrifice some material possession in order to be able to see this miracle .
That is what it is to put a price on something , and nothing more .
Putting a price on body parts does not degrade them ; it is simply a way to introduce those body parts into the flux of exchanges that is the market .
We see no problem in charging for health care services .
That does n't " commodify " human well - being .
People charge money for food without degrading the eating process .
We pay for symphony and opera tickets , but the music does not thereby experience degradation .
Why should the introduction of money somehow morally compromise the life - saving service of blood giving ?
Also , by creating a free market for blood ( actually , letting the market rise spontaneously , because you cannot " create " a market ) a price mechanism puts it in the service of those in need .
A market has a natural tendency to diversify , so you will have in time blood of different qualities sold at different prices , to suit every need .
This would , obviously , drive downwards the price of blood in general , for the benefit of those less well off .
There is a serious moral issue involved here , and it has to do with property rights .
Because this piece of legislation infringes the most basic of all rights : self - ownership .
The only reason you have any rights is because you have the freedom and responsibility to dispose of yourself , mind and body .
Freedom of association ( the basis of society ) , freedom of expression , and all the rest are meaningless unless they stem from self - ownership .
If your rights are merely a social convention , than the same social convention that gave them to you may very well take them back .
If government regulates what you can put into your body and what you may give away and under what conditions , it also has the power to regulate what you put into your mind and what your mind produces .
Finally , there is the utilitarian consideration .
Without a market for blood , people will die .
Do we really want to sacrifice more lives in service to the god of socialist economic management ?
There do n’t seem to be any good crystalizations of the reams of data on the Internet , and the one thats do exist are on crazily SEO ’d sites and I always feel a little dirty visiting them , so I thought I ’d write this up .
The most important thing for succeeding with AdWords is that you need to install analytics software .
Let me repeat that : you will have no clue whether your ( potentially very expensive )
AdWords campaign is actually making money unless you install analytics software .
I really love Google Analytics because of its tight integration with AdWords , but if you want to use somebody else , hey , whatever floats your boat .
And you need to enable conversion tracking for at least your trial downloads and ideally for your completed purchases .
The easiest way to do this is scatter your site with download links that all go to a central page ( mine is thanks_for_downloading.htm ) which has the tracking Javascript on it and a meta - refresh to the executable , plus a “ if you do n’t see your download starting within 5 seconds click here ” .
One thing I do is make sure all my links use text like “ You should download our free trial to … ” so that everyone who clicks on the link knows that they are committing to a download .
The reason behind this is that if they click on a link saying “ Free Trial ” or something , see the download begin , and immediately hit cancel you ’ll never know and you ’ll think that person was a successful conversion .
OK , got your Analytics set up ?
Alright , here we go :
1 ) Eyes on the prize .
The prize is conversions , to your trial and eventually to being satisfied customers who have paid you money .
You ’ll be buried in numbers — click - through rate ( CTR ) , cost per click ( CPC ) , number of clicks , number of impressions , conversion rate ( CR ) , cost per conversion ( aka cost per action , CPA ) , blah blah yackety smackety , and you can slice this data a million ways .
There are only two numbers you care about : CR and CPA .
Everything else is noise — potentially meaningful noise when you ’re optimizing your ad , but otherwise its just noise .
The only thing that will get you money is to get people to download your trial and decide to take the plunge .
If it costs you $ 30 per trial download and you sell a $ 24.95 product , congratulations , you should a ) get serious about optimizing your ads or b ) cancel AdWords today .
2 ) Opt out of the Google Content Network .
You can find this option in campaign settings .
There is one simple reason for this : these sites fail to deliver customers who convert , which hurts CR and ups CPA .
Or , in plain English , you pay them money and get nothing in return , so do n’t pay them money !
If you mistakenly leave them on for a week , like I did , you ’ll very quickly figure out why : the vast majority of clicks are from “ Made for AdSense ” ( MFA ) pages , which are generally scrapes of content which exists elsewhere on the Internet , and more than a little bit shady .
I assume that most of these folks are either site owners , bots , or users who are clueless enough that they land on a MFA page and take it to be valuable information ( when they almost never are ) .
None of these folks convert .
3 ) Segment , segment , segment .
You can make multiple ad groups within a single campaign .
Make use of this feature .
An Ad Group should be thematically coherent : for example , one of my Ad Groups is based around the theme “ You ’re searching for something to make bingo cards , I provide something to make bingo cards ” .
Another is “ You ’re searching for information about Dolch sight words , I provide a resource to teach Dolch sight words ” .
If you ’re smart your software solves one or several pains — pitch your ads on a per-pain basis .
Why do this when you could save time by throwing everything in a single ad group ?
Because if you segment , your CTRs and CRs will be higher , since you ’re showing the most relevant ad text to the searcher .
3 ) Watch that CTR , but not toooo closely .
The best guess is that the average CTR is about 2 % .
If you ’re at 1 % , you ’re still OK .
If you ’re at significantly above 2 % , you ’re * probably * OK ( but see below ) .
But if you ’re below 1 % , you ’re going to start costing yourself money soon .
The reason is you have a Quality Score , which is essentially a witches brew of factors that Google uses to determine whether they display your ad or not at a particular price .
If your QS is low , Google will keep bumping up your minimum bid to be displayed .
That costs you money , so you want to keep your QS nice and high , and one easy and transparent way to do so is keeping your CTR healthy .
4 ) Writing ad copy .
God darn it Jim I ’m an engineer , not a marketer .
Here ’s everything I know : include a call to action ( “ Download our free trial today . ” works decently for me ) , make sure you use keywords from the search in the ad copy if possible , and speak directly to the pain .
You can try out many ads at once —
Google will automagically pick the one with the highest CTR for you .
Thats Good For Google , since high CTRs mean they make money , but its not necessarily Good For You .
You want ads with a high CR , because those are the ones that make * you* money .
This means you should periodically check how your CR is doing and pull ads that are n’t making you money .
5 ) The importance of landing pages .
You ’ve got five seconds to overwhelm someone ’s inborn defenses against spending time / money on your product .
Make the use of them .
Do n’t be the silly advertiser who just directs everyone to the main page — have an optimized landing page for each ad group ( or segment even beyond that — for each keyword , for each ad variation , whatever you can afford on your time budget ) .
This means pages which speak to the pains which you solve .
You want an example ?
Compare www.bingocardcreator.com, which is a generic pitch of my software to my main niche ( teachers ) , to my landing page for sight words .
Anyone landing on that page was looking for resources to teach sight words and clicked on an advertisement promising some variation of “ I will save you time and money playing sight words bingo ” .
I greet them in a personal manner , immediately tell them download the free trial ( something like 30 % of the clickers do so immediately ) , and then go about pitching the activity ( talking about the pain , basically ) and providing them lots of reasons to believe that I ’m the best possible solution to the pain .
6 ) You probably do n’t want to let Google budget for you .
Well , in one sense you do — you ’ll establish a maximum you want to pay per month and Google will cap your expenditures at or near that maximum .
This is good .
What you do n’t want is for Google to “ spend up ” to your maximum , which is what they will do by default if you let them budget for you .
Lets pretend I have a budget of $ 30 for 30 days ( I do ) .
See , what happens under that setting is that they will adjust your bid timed to reach exactly $ 30 in 30 days …
But if you only spend $ 5 in your first 10 days , then they ’ll adjust your budget to hit the $ 25 target in 20 days … and they do this by bidding up your maximum cost per click .
Supposing your click volume is not yet high enough , they ’ll raise it again and again and again .
You ’re almost guaranteed to make your monthly limit .
Great for Google , but there is a point at which you ’re not making money ( where your CPA * your conversion for demos to purchases exceeds your net profit per sale ) .
You ’re better off manually limiting your expenditure .
7 ) There is likely more traffic than you can afford to service .
For a small advertiser , you are probably not able to absorb a click from everyone who wants to click on an ad in that day .
So , reduce your maximum bid .
It does n’t matter if you ’re in 1st position , 2nd position , 3rd position , or 17th position if you ’re still maxing out your budget every day — I have n’t seen any difference in conversion rates based on where the ad is on the page ( there is obviously a difference in CTR but , oh well , CTR only makes Google money ) .
8 ) You only want qualified buyers to click your ads .
Here ’s an issue for my business : I sell a program to make bingo cards which is targetted at teachers .
I ’ll accept orders from people who are not teachers , but I know if you ’re not a teacher or a parent you ’re highly unlikely to want to buy my product .
So if you ’re looking for something to print bingo cards for the game on Tuesday night I ’m happy to show you my website for free ( organic search ) but not happy to pay a nickle to pitch my site to you .
Yet I routinely end up paying $ .15 to pitch to this person , because one of my campaigns is overly broad .
You do n’t want overly broad campaigns .
There are three ways to target your niche more precisely :
Exclusion words .
I pay for someone searching “ make custom bingo cards ” , with broad matching ( it will hit “ make custom reading bingo cards ” , for example ) .
However , I can specify exclusion words , which means if they search for foo they do n’t get one of my ads regardless of how many of my keywords they hit .
Consider carefully whether you really want to pay for anyone searching for “ free keyword keyword keyword ” .
Currently , my conversion from people searching for free stuff is pretty nice ( its actually higher than folks who did n’t specify if they were searching for free stuff or not ) .
Similarly , if your keywords are ambiguous , exclude words which would resolve the ambiguity against you .
For example , if you ’re selling gardening software to people searching for “ potter ” ( I do n’t know why you would do this , but play along ) , you ’d want to exclude Harry Hermione Ron magic Hogwarts etc etc .
Note that excluding words does not appear to decrease the amount of money you have to pay ( I ’m not totally positive about this ) , so you ’re probably better off not paying for Potter in any event .
Speaking your customers language .
In general , especially if other software exists in your niche , the two to three word description of what your software does will be expensive .
On the other hand , natural variations such as “ How do I < solve my pain > ” are likely to be very , very cheap .
Listing off a couple dozen variations of that natural search query gets you lots of very qualified traffic for very cheap .
Make your ad text clear as to what they get for clicking .
Suppose you could come up with some ad text with an obscenely high CTR by slightly stretching the truth as to what was behind the link .
This is NOT a good idea .
Remember , CTR is money for Google , not for you .
Ideally , you ’d want ad text that turned off 100 % of people who would not convert while still capturing 100 % of people who would .
You ’ll not likely be able to do that , but you can audition various ad texts to see what gets the lower CPA .

Here ’s the results : variation # 1 has a high CTR ( 6 % ) and a high CR ( 20 %ish ) , but the CPA is poor compared to targetting teachers specifically ( roughly quadruple what I pay elsewhere ) .
The reason is that I pay a lot of money to pitch to folks who were n’t interested in teaching .
Variation # 2 , on the other hand , has a lower CTR ( 4.5 % ) but a higher CR ( unstable since I ’ve only had it up for two days , but I ’m estimating it will settle in the 40 % region ) .
Doing the math , thats roughly 50 % extra downloads for the same amount of money ( or , equivalently , 1/3rd off my CPA ) .
Variation # 3 just sucks as an ad ( sub - 1 % CTR , no significant conversions ) and it will be killed right after I get done with this post .
You can see why it sucks , too : its not pitching anything at the pain people are searching for .

Archaeologists in Ukraine have unearthed the remains of an ancient pyramidal structure that pre-dates those in Egypt by at least 300 years .
The stone foundations of the structure , which probably resembled Aztec and Mayan ziggurats in South America , were discovered near the eastern city of Lugansk .
It is thought they were laid about five millennia ago during the early Bronze Age by animists who worshipped a sun god .
The " pyramid " is in fact a complex of temples and sacrificial altars topping a sculpted hillside with steps on its sides .
Viktor Klochko , head of the excavation , said the discovery was of international significance .
" This is the first monument of its age and kind found in eastern Europe , " he told the Guardian .
" It changes our whole conception of the social structure and the level of development of the cattle breeders and farmers who were the direct ancestors of most European peoples . "
There are about 100 pyramids in Egypt , and the remains of Mesopotamian pyramids are preserved in Iraq and Iran .
Ziggurats are also found in Mexico , and the Nubians built pyramids as burial sites for monarchs in the Nile valley .
But pyramid structures are rare in Europe .
One of the few is a Roman - era pyramid near Nice , France , that may have been built by legionnaires involved in an Egyptian cult .
Although graves have been found at the Lugansk site , archaeologists think it was used for sacrifice by burning , rather than as a burial ground .
" People lived in the surrounding valleys and climbed up it to carry out their ceremonies , " said Mr Klochko .
" They had a pagan cult that bowed down to the sun , as did the ancestors of the Slavs . "
Remains of sacrifice victims , ashes and ceramics have been found at the site , but no jewellery or treasure .
The complex , which covered three - quarters of a square mile and was around 60 metres ( 192 ft ) high , was probably used for 2,000 years .
" What surprised me most is the scale of this enormous complex , " Stanislav Mogilny , a student working on the excavation , told Russian television .
It 's just incredible - a titanic feat . "

Part of what we 're seeing is the increased greenhouse effect ; I 'd bet the mortgage on it
Mark Serreze , NSIDC
They say that this month sees the lowest extent of ice cover for more than a century .
The Arctic climate varies naturally , but the researchers conclude that human - induced global warming is at least partially responsible .
They warn the shrinkage could lead to even faster melting in coming years .
" September 2005 will set a new record minimum in the amount of Arctic sea ice cover , " said Mark Serreze , of the National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) , Boulder , Colorado .
" It 's the least sea ice we 've seen in the satellite record , and continues a pattern of extreme low extents of sea ice which we 've now seen for the last four years , " he told BBC News .
September lows
September is the month when the Arctic ice usually reaches a minimum .
The new data shows that on 19 September , the area covered by ice fell to 5.35 million sq km ( 2.01 million sq miles ) , the lowest recorded since 1978 , when satellite records became available ; it is now 20 % less than the 1978 - 2000 average .
ARCTIC SEA ICE EXTENT - SEPTEMBER TREND , 1978-2005
The straight line tracks a more than 8 % decline per decade
An NSIDC analysis of historical records also suggests that ice cover is less this year than during the low periods of the 1930s and 40s .
Mark Serreze believes that the findings are evidence of climate change induced by human activities .
" It 's still a controversial issue , and there 's always going to be some uncertainty because the climate system does have a lot of natural variability , especially in the Arctic , " he said .
" But I think the evidence is growing very , very strong that part of what we 're seeing now is the increased greenhouse effect .
If you asked me , I 'd bet the mortgage that that 's just what 's happening . "
Confusing movement
One of the limitations of these records is that they measure only the area of ice , rather than the volume .
" One other factor could be movements of sea ice , " said Liz Morris , of the British Antarctic Survey , currently working at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge , UK .
" If it all piles up in one place , you might have the same total amount of ice , " she told the BBC News website , " and there is some evidence that ice is piling up along the north Canadian coast , driven by changes in the pattern of winds and perhaps ocean currents . "
Most data on sea ice thickness comes from records of military submarines , which regularly explored passages under the Arctic ice cap during the Cold War years .
Professor Morris is involved in a new European satellite , Cryosat , which should be able to give definitive measurements of ice thickness as well as extent ; its launch is scheduled for 8 October .
But she also believes that the NSIDC data suggests an impact from the human - enhanced greenhouse effect .
" All data goes through cycles , and so you have to be careful , " she said , " but it 's also true to say that we would n't expect to have four years in a row of shrinkage .
" That , combined with rising temperatures in the Arctic , suggests a human impact ; and I would also bet my mortgage on it , because if you change the radiation absorption process of the atmosphere ( through increased production of greenhouse gases ) so there is more heating of the lower atmosphere , sooner or later you are going to melt ice . "
Arctic warming fast
Though there are significant variations across the region , on average the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet , according to a major report released last year .
If the current trend can be ascribed in part to human - induced climate change , Mark Serreze sees major reasons for concern .
" What we 're seeing is a process in which we start to lose ice cover during the summer , " he said , " so areas which formerly had ice are now open water , which is dark .
" These dark areas absorb a lot of the Sun 's energy , much more than the ice ; and what happens then is that the oceans start to warm up , and it becomes very difficult for ice to form during the following autumn and winter .
" It looks like this is exactly what we 're seeing - a positive feedback effect , a ' tipping - point ' . "
The idea behind tipping - points is that at some stage the rate of global warming would accelerate , as rising temperatures break down natural restraints or trigger environmental changes which release further amounts of greenhouse gases .
Possible tipping - points include
the disappearance of sea ice leading to greater absorption of solar radiation
a switch from forests being net absorbers of carbon dioxide to net producers
melting permafrost , releasing trapped methane
This study is the latest to indicate that such positive feedback mechanisms may be in operation , though definitive proof of their influence on the Earth 's climatic future remains elusive .
It would surprise some people to learn that Mr. Gallo had blond curls and a button nose as a boy .
Then , one day — as suddenly as an event in a fable or a dream — he experienced his first “ sex thoughts ” and his nose grew large and his hair turned dark .
And now he is a director famous for having persuaded Chloé Sevigny to be filmed performing on him an act whose name one is discouraged from printing here .
“ People think I look scary and mean , and maybe I am scary and mean , ” Mr. Gallo said .
“ But I always wished I had classic nerdy WASP looks . ”
He always wished , Mr. Gallo added , improbably , that he looked like George Will .
And Mischa Barton always wanted to be Meryl Streep , or at least as much like Meryl Streep as Lindsay Lohan got to be in “ Prairie Home Companion , ” or anyway like someone with a little more industry heft than the slightly - too - pretty girl who portrays Marissa Cooper on the hit show “ The O.C. , ” or did until her character was killed off in the usual mysterious automobile “ accident ” last May .
And that , one presumes , is why she seemed to be everywhere , always , throughout Fashion Week , as ubiquitous and ethereally beautiful as the Holy Ghost , although easier to capture on film .
And this may be the time to say to all those people who cruelly deride young actresses as relentlessly driven strobe - addicted publicity hounds that being one is hard work .
Fashion shows are little more than job boards for actors .

As a nation we spend millions on detox products , especially in the new year following post - Christmas guilt .
But scientists are now saying detox remedies are a waste of money and a glass of water and an early night is far more beneficial .
Do you think detox remedies are effective ?
Tell us in reader comments below
Tracey Brown , director of the charity Sense About Science , said they were advising the public not to buy into the detox myth .
" The body detoxifies itself .
The body is rehydrated with ordinary tap water and is refreshed with a good night 's sleep , " she said .
Mrs Brown condemned products such as detox tablets and detox socks saying they sowed confusion about how nutrition and chemistry actually work .
She said her groups advice followed a number of leading scientists into the role of detox solutions .
' Detox nonsense '
Dr John Emsley , chemical scientist and popular science writer , said : " Our bodies are very good at eliminating all the nasties that we might ingest over the festive season .
" There is a popular notion that we can speed up the elimination process by drinking fancy bottled water or sipping herbal teas , but this is just nonsense .
" In fact , many of the detox diets and supplements really are n't that good for you , nor have they been properly tested . "
Professor Martin Wiseman , visiting professor of human nutrition , University of Southampton , added : " The detox fad - is an example of the capacity of people to believe in and pay for magic despite the lack of any sound evidence .
" This is a trend that should worry us all . "
After reading Why Apple Will Change TV and the supporting Five Ways Why Apple Will Change TV , you might be left wondering why Microsoft wo n't simply beat Apple to the punch in delivering the future of the television .
Here 's the secret answers that expose a series of myths concerning Microsoft ’s ability to own new markets , why its monopoly position wo n't be of any help , and why the company 's consumer retail strategies are n't working .
It 's a story you 'll only read here in Roughly Drafted Magazine , and a story many people do n't want you to hear .
The PC Power of Windows
To the casual observer , Apple certainly seems like a minor player in the PC industry , particularly when compared to Microsoft .
The company only has a tiny fraction of the entire PC market share ; Gartner assigned Apple a 2.2 % share of worldwide PC sales , and 4.8 % share of the entire US PC market .
That figure is based solely on hardware sales .
In reality , every PC is a combination of two essential components : hardware and operating system software .
By only counting hardware sales , the actual use of Linux , BSD , and Mac OS X are unfairly marginalized when simple market share numbers are presented without any context .
The article Market Share Myth : Nailed !
split PC sales into the component markets of hardware and operating system software .
It therefore assigned Microsoft credit for the software half of all of the Windows PCs sold .
It ’s not about sales , its about significance .
This brought grief to adherents of the Apple Market Share Myth because considering hardware and software separately gives Apple full credit for selling both , and divides the market share of other hardware makers in half , because , quite obviously , they are each only producing half of the significance of the Windows PC product .
Play Along or Else
What about Linux ?
No significant number of name brand PCs are sold without Windows , largely because PC makers have signed contracts with Microsoft that assign them points which reduce their volume licensing costs .
They earn points by following certain rules Microsoft gives them , including :
• conspicuously repeating the cult - like phrase " recommends Windows XP Professional " in all marketing ; • never advertising PCs sold without an operating system , or with an alternative OS installed ; • applying Windows stickers to all PCs sold , and using a keyboard with a prominent Windows key .
So for example , while Dell does offer certain machines with Linux , it carefully avoids any actual mention of this , and certainly does not advertise the fact .
If Dell did , it would have to pay more for each OEM copy of Windows it shipped , which would be a prohibitively expensive experiment for the company .
These rules exist to keep Linux from from gaining market traction .
Stabs at Preserving the Monopoly
Along similar lines , it should also come as no surprise why Microsoft is attempting to replace open standards with proprietary ones ; it 's the only way the company can maintain its monopoly of the PC desktop .
If Microsoft were to open up and license away its Windows APIs , the company would quickly cease to matter .
If Microsoft embraced open standards such as OpenGL , rather than its own proprietary DirectX , its stranglehold of PC Gaming would similarly evaporate .
It 's not hard to understand why Microsoft also wants to replace every other open standard in computing , from PDF , JPEG , AAC and MP3 , into one that is tied to Windows : Metro / XPS , Windows Media Photo , and Windows Media Audio .
This makes it particularly comical when Windows advocates demand that Apple broadly license its iTunes FairPlay system , and try to portray Microsoft as an underdog in the DRM game .
The defeat of a huge monopoly does not instantly make it an underdog .
Microsoft merely wants to replace FairPlay with its own DRM , which only offers consumers less choice and more restrictions .
Consumers , given a choice , rejected WMA products in the market .
Does every tech company that has earned a majority of sales within a limited product category need to be divested of its business model in order to deliver its success to Microsoft , the monopolist empire which has suffocated all competition in the entire PC industry for well over a decade ?
The Power of Monopoly
Interestingly , while Microsoft 's monopoly power dominates the PC industry , it did n't achieve that position in the same manner as Apple found success with the iPod .
This is very important to understanding why Microsoft can't compete with iTunes .
It has everything to do with choice .
More than 80 % of Microsoft 's revenues for Windows come from corporate volume licensing and OEM copies of Windows bundled with new PCs .
That means the company does n't have to compete to sell a product at retail .
Instead , it simply makes sure that all PCs sold incorporate its software product , leaving as little room possible for any competition .
Preventing competition and choice is essential to maintaining a monopoly .
This effectively turns Windows into a necessary utility for Information Technology managers .
In effect , the majority of the tech world needs Windows in order to run normally , just as industry needs water and electricity .
Unplugged from Windows , corporate IT would be in serious trouble and would face enormous costs in building alternative systems .
Moving to Linux requires massive expenses in training and retooling .
Microsoft is happy to point out in its extensive reports just how expensive any move away from Windows actually costs , with some exaggerations , of course .
Alternative Power Sources
The army of volunteers supporting GNU / Linux contribute real value to the platform , equivalent to many millions of dollars of development and support .
Their efforts have progressively challenged Microsoft 's position , and should not be underestimated .
In essence , the development of Linux is like a company building its own solar power plant in order to disconnect itself from a municipal power monopoly .
The power might be free , but the effort required to build and maintain an independent system is very expensive .
It would be prohibitively expensive for most companies to build their own power stations .
Similarly , in today 's PC climate , the only way to challenge the Windows monopoly is to rally Open Source to build an alternative system , mostly as unpaid volunteers .
That 's not an example of competition within a functional market ; it has more in common with a revolution to overthrow a tyrant !
Retail Competition vs Monopoly Maintenance
If the Windows Monopoly works so well to enrich Microsoft , why did n't the company 's collection of WMA partners result in a new WMA monopoly that functioned just as profitably as its Windows PC monopoly ?
Clearly that 's what Microsoft intended .
Instead , they were severely beaten in the marketplace by Apple 's rival iPod and iTunes combination .
Understanding why this happened requires an investigation of the differences between the PC and iPod markets .
Imagine if Apple licensed the iPod hardware to other manufacturers , and then charged them all licensing fees .
This would allow consumers to buy a Creative iPod , a Sony iPod , or a Toshiba iPod .
Now imagine a world where playing an MP3 or video file was so complex that the feature could not be easily delivered by rivals .
Now imagine that all commercial entertainment was only available through iTunes .
This would be a monopoly comparable to the PC , where :
• creating a rival operating system is a high risk , decade long task ; • all software is tied to a specific platform ; • significant effort and expense is required to port applications from one platform to another .
Instead , the iPod competes against a variety of products in the market place , from simple and cheap players to more expensive and extensively featured devices .
In this market :
• any player can be designed to play standard audio or video files using off the shelf component chips ; • common MP3 or MPEG files can play back on any platform ; • all commercial entertainment is available on CD and DVD , and can easily be extracted to play back anywhere ; • music purchased by the iTunes Store can be effortlessly burned to CD .
Winning in a Competitive Market
Apple competes in an open marketplace with an integrated retail product that includes the iPod , iTunes , and the iTunes store , just as Microsoft did with WMA stores , Windows Media Player and WMA portable devices , or Sony did with its Network Walkman and Connect web store and software .
Given the equal footing in a competitive market , its interesting to discover that Apple not only entered the market later than Microsoft , Real , Creative and others , but also quickly surpassed Microsoft 's efforts to extend its monopoly into portable media players and online media sales .
Inconceivable !
It is well known how Microsoft previously embraced and extinguished competitors as it entered new markets , most famously with Netscape 's web browser and Sun 's Java platform .
How was it that the scrappy Apple beat Microsoft in online music and movies ?
How was Microsoft 's omnipotent empire defeated , and is there some chance that Microsoft will still have the opportunity to beat Apple at its own game with Zune , the company 's solo effort at developing an iPod killer ?
Understanding Apple 's success involves examining Microsoft 's failures , which the mainstream media seems unwilling to do .
Perhaps they have n't been paying attention , or do n’t understand what ’s happening .

SVN vs CVS Search SVN vs CVS
As it is known , before getting acquainted with SVN , our company had worked with CVS for long enough .
We know CVS from both user and developer points of view .
Approximately at the same level we had got acquainted with SVN , and undoubtedly we have an opinion to share with you concerning the question " what system is better ? " .
It is worth noting , that the work on the creation of the IDE plug - in for SVN had started at numerous user requests .
However , our own motivation had also played a considerable role in starting work with SVN , since publications appeared that SVN is a substitute for CVS , which eliminates all its problems and shortcomings .
Unfortunately , to our point of view , SVN is not a substitute for CVS and all the more it does not eliminate its shortcomings .
Moreover , it even yields to CVS .
Figuratively , CVS and SVN can be compared as C ++ and Java .
Obviously , both CVS and SVN are more powerful than SourceSafe , as well as C ++ and Java are more powerful than Basic .
CVS represents almost all functionalities of a source control system , though not always in a convenient and apparent manner .
SVN , patching and expanding some CVS functionalities , simply does not contain some important functions .
For example , the creation of tags and branches is dubious , and no means are provided to notify others that you are editing a file .
It is similar to what the developers of Java have done : they have decided for you that pointers are not necessary , and there is no need in operator overloading etc .
Thus , as for now SVN cannot be considered a CVS substitute .
It is a different system , similar to CVS .
It has unique functions , which can serve as a reason for its usage .
These functions make it more suitable for some development environments , for example for PowerBuilder .
Below you can find comparative advantages and disadvantages of these systems .
It is assumed that in relation to the remaining items the systems are similar .
On the green background " advantages " of a system in relation to its competitor are presented , and " disadvantages " are presented on the pink ground .
If you are facing the problem of choice , it is recommended to try both systems , paying special attention to the items below .
You may also look to some discussion betwen Subversion developers and Pushok staff .
Note .
This comparison cannot be considered as final , since both systems still developed .
Last update was made for CVS NT 2.5.01 and SVN 1.2 at July 19 2005 .
# Compared item CVS SVN 1 Repository format CVS is based on RCS files of versions control .
Each file connected to CVS is an ordinary file containing some additional information .
It is quite natural that the tree of these files repeats the file tree in the local directory .
Thus , with CVS you should not be anxious about data loss , and you can easily correct RCS files if necessary .
The basis of SVN is a relational database ( BerkleyDB ) either set of binary files ( FS_FS ) .
On one hand , this settles many problems ( for example , concurrent access through the file share ) and enables new functionalities ( for example , transactions at operations performance ) .
However , on the other hand , data storage now is not transparent , or at least is not available for user interference .
That is why the utilities for " curing " and " recovering " of the repository ( database ) are provided .
2 Speed CVS works more slowly .
As a whole , due to some constructive solutions , SVN really works faster than CVS .
It transmits less information through the network and supports more operations for offline mode .
However , there is the reverse of the medal .
Speed increasing is achieved basically at the expense of full backup of all work files on your computer .
3 Tags & Branches ( !!!
IMPORTANT )
To our point of view , these are implemented properly .
The SVN developers assert with pride that they have got rid of 3 measurements by working with tags and branches .
In practice it means that they have substituted both concepts for a capability of copying file (s ) or directories within the repository with saving the history of changes .
That is , both tag creation and branch creation are substituted for copying within the repository .
From the SVN developers ' viewpoint , this is very elegant decision , which simplifies one 's life .
However , we think that there is nothing to be proud of .
As for branches , everything is not so bad , now branches are nothing but separate folders in the repository , which earlier have had some interconnection .
As for tags , everything is much worse .
Now you cannot tag a code , this function is simply missing .
Certainly , to some extent this is compensated by universal numbering of files in SVN , that is , the whole repository gets the version number , but not each separate file .
However , we suppose you will not deny that it is not very convenient to store a four - digit number instead of a symbolic tag .
4 Meta data CVS allows to store of only files and nothing else .
SVN allows to " attach " to a file any number of all possible named attributes .
Excellent functionality , but it is not quite clear what it is necessary for .
5
File types CVS was initially intended for text data storage .
That is why storage of other files ( binary , unicode ) is not trivial and requires special information , as well as adjustments on either server or client sides .
SVN manipulates all the file types and does not require your instructions .
6 Rollback CVS allows to rollback any commit in the repository , even if this may require some time ( each file should be processed independently ) SVN does not allow rollback of commit .
Authors suggest copy good repository state to the end of trunk to overwrite bad commit .
However bad commit itself will remain in repository .
7 Transactions
In CVS the support of transactions by the principle " all or nothing " is completely absent .
For example , when you checkin several files ( transfer them to the server ) , it is possible that the operation will be completed only for some of these files , and will not be completed for the rest ( due to conflicts , for example ) .
As a rule , it is sufficient to correct the situation and to repeat the operation for the remaining files ( not for all files ) .
That is , the files will be checked in in two steps .
No cases of the repository damage due to absence of this functionality were observed .
SVN does support transactions by the principle " all or nothing " .
Probably this is an advantage of the system .
8 Availability Presently CVS is supported everywhere where you might need it .
SVN not yet so widly used , as the result there are places where it support still not implemented .
9 Internal architecture and code .
CVS is very old system .
Initially CVS was written as bunch of scripts around RCS executable .
Later this packaged into single executable .
But internal structure of code is poor and have lots of historical fixes .
Till now there was several attempts to rewrite CVS from scratch , but as it is known without success .
We , personally , tried to extract client code to make better integration between plug - in and CVS , but without success .
Right now we not think that CVS may grows too much in its functionality .
Subversion authors really spent some time on internal SVN architecture .
Still not know how good are some decisions they make .
But one is clear , the code is well expandable , and future improvements are coming .

After reliance on isolationist development using proprietary technologies , and embracing the suffocating tentacles of long term legacy support the third factor of platform crisis involves turning into a lazy dinosaur .
Here ’s how both Apple and Microsoft lost their way in a rapidly changing global climate .
Platform Death Match introduced the difficulty of launching a new platform and the work involved in maintaining one .
This series looks at the historical march of computing platforms , to sort out why winners won and why losers lost .
While the computing environment is always changing , the same basic rules are in effect today , and will shape the future developments between Mac OS X Leopard and Windows Vista .

1990 - 1995 : Platform Crisis : The Lazy Dinosaur
Throughout the early 90s , Apple lacked a clear direction for delivering new technology .
The company was certainly not out of ideas ; it just was n’t focused on turning them into new , marketable products .
Apple was rich , and it was making significant revenues from high margin sales of its Macintosh computers , the only affordable , mainstream graphic workstations available .
In 1990 , Apple was positioned on top of the world , with 9 % of the market for personal computers , a clear lock on many of the most profitable market segments , and increasing sales and market share .
The company rode a huge wave of growth tied to desktop publishing and graphic design , and was preparing for another surge from multimedia development built upon QuickTime .
While finishing work on System 7 , Apple described its vision for the future in Pink , a set of vaporware ideas that planned to deliver all the features offered by NeXTSTEP on the Macintosh .
Apple had signed an agreement with NeXT that pushed its new rival into the high end of the market , buying Apple time to build volume sales .
Apple 's plan for the 90s was to increase market share by offering cheaper machines that could better compete in price against PCs running the new Windows 3.0 .
To offer cheaper Macs , Apple dug into the past and unearthed old technology to resell in the $ 1000 to $ 2000 price range where most consumer PCs were .
High end PCs were the same price as high end Macs , but Windows was so far behind the Mac that four year old Macs were still worthy competitors on the low end .

NEW YORK , United States —
In an ominous move , Iran 's Ministry of Interior has ordered officials throughout the country to step up the surveillance of Iranian Baha 'is focusing in particular on their community activities .
The Ministry has requested provincial officials to complete a detailed questionnaire about the circumstances and activities of local Baha'is , including their " financial status , " " social interactions , " and " association with foreign assemblies , " among other things .
The Ministry 's order came in a letter dated 19 August 2006 and addressed to provincial deputies of the Department of Politics and Security in Offices of the Governors ' General throughout Iran .
The 19 August letter , which was recently obtained by the Baha'i International Community , asks these deputies to order " relevant offices to cautiously and sensitively monitor and supervise " all Baha 'i social activities .
The letter is the latest in a series of threatening documents that outline a secret national effort to identify and monitor Baha 'is in Iran .
" The emergence of this new letter highlights the gravity of the situation facing Iranian Baha'is , " said Bani Dugal , the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations .
" This letter further confirms that Iran 's government has targeted the Baha 'is for covert surveillance , " said Ms. Dugal .
" It also reveals for the first time the type of information the government strives to collect on both individuals and the Baha 'i community as a whole -- information that in most societies would be considered private and highly sensitive .
" The letter also contains elements of misinformation .
For example , the letter asks for information on the ' socio - political activities ' of Baha 'is -- even though it is well known to authorities that Baha 'is are entirely non-political in their activities , inasmuch as the Baha 'i sacred writings stress the importance of non-involvement in politics , as well as non-violence . ( MB1 )
The 19 August letter follows the release earlier this year of a secret 29 October 2005 letter from the Iranian military headquarters to various Revolutionary Guard and police forces instructing them to " identify " and " monitor " Baha 'is around the country .
News of the 29 October letter , first publicized by Asma Jahangir , the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief in March 2006 , stirred alarm among international human rights groups .
Ms. Jahangir herself expressed concern that " the information gained as a result of such monitoring will be used as a basis for the increased persecution of , and discrimination against , members of the Baha'i Faith . "
Another letter , dated 2 May 2006 , showed the degree to which the government has sought to implement such surveillance at the local level .
That letter , from the Trades , Production , and Technical Services Society of Kermanshah to the Iranian Union of Battery Manufacturers , asked the Union to provide a list of members of " the Baha'i sect " in their membership .
Some observers have compared the government 's effort to identify and monitor Baha 'is to the situation facing Jews at the beginning of the Nazi era .
In April , for example , the Anti-Defamation League said the orders issued in the 29 October letter were " reminiscent of the steps taken against Jews in Europe and a dangerous step toward the institution of Nuremberg - type laws . "
Iranian authorities have continued to arrest and detain Baha 'is throughout Iran in recent months , subjecting them to a " revolving door " sequence of imprisonment and release that is apparently designed to harass and oppress the Baha 'i community .
Over the last two years , at least 129 Baha 'is have been arrested , released on bail , and are now awaiting trial throughout the country .
The bail demands have been high , in most cases requiring the Baha 'is to hand over considerable sums of money , deeds to property , business or work licenses .

Cancer vaccine harnesses similarities between embryos and tumours .
Proteins found on stem cells could prompt the body to attack cancer cells .
SPL
Embryonic stem cells , the controversial and versatile cells that seem able to do just about anything , have now expanded their repertoire into cancer prevention .
A vaccine made from these cells shields mice against developing lung cancer under conditions thought to mimic the effects of smoking .
Safety concerns about injecting stem cells into humans mean that regulatory agencies are unlikely to approve human tests of the vaccine , says lead researcher John Eaton at the University of Louisville in Kentucky .
Nevertheless , he thinks the vaccine is worth testing in people at high risk of developing cancer , such as heavy smokers or people with certain genetic mutations .
Other researchers are more cautious .
Cancer vaccines , particularly vaccines made from cells , are notoriously more effective in mice than people , says Jeffrey Weber , an immunotherapist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles .
" The idea is interesting , but the execution may be impossible , " he says .
But both Weber and Eaton agree that the finding could lead to new ways to prevent or treat cancer .
A lot in common
“ We were absolutely shocked . ” John Eaton
University of Louisville , Kentucky
Eaton 's approach was inspired by the similarities between embryos , embryonic stem cells and tumours .
" Embryos and tumours both grow as balls , they derive nutrients from the host , and they both express peculiar proteins - some of them in common , " he says .
These shared proteins made Eaton think that a vaccine prompting an immune response to embryonic stem cells would also trigger an attack against tumours .
He and his colleagues injected mice with stem cells and gave the mice a booster shot ten days later .
The researchers then transplanted lung cancer cells under the animals ' skin — a standard animal model for the disease .
The stem - cell injection protected 20 out of 25 mice from developing tumours , whereas tumours grew in all unvaccinated mice .
" We were absolutely shocked , " Eaton says .
Even more effective was a mixture of stem cells and cells engineered to make a molecule that stimulates the immune system .
None of the mice given this vaccine developed tumours when implanted with cancer cells .
Eight of nine animals given this treatment were also protected from lung cancer induced by chemicals thought to mimic the effects of cigarette smoke .
Eaton is now testing his approach against other types of cancer .
The findings were reported on 8 November at a meeting in Prague on ' Molecular targets and cancer therapeutics ' , sponsored by a consortium of cancer - research organizations from Europe and the United States .
Weird protein
ADVERTISEMENT
Although the mice seemed to suffer no ill effects from the vaccine , Eaton admits that injecting live stem cells into people raises safety issues — such as whether the vaccine would make the body attack its own stem cells .
Eaton 's team is now looking for the molecules on the embryonic stem cells that give the vaccine its tumour - killing power .
That could potentially lead to more effective cancer vaccines with specific components .
The researchers have already discovered one such protein — found mainly in embryos , placentas and tumours .
As yet , Eaton is unwilling to say much about it , except : " It 's weird . "
Looking for such molecules holds more promise than injecting stem cells themselves , says Weber .

After months of refusing to answer questions from MPs or the media , it disclosed that two aircraft known to have been chartered by the CIA landed 14 times at RAF Northholt , west London , and RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire between October 2003 and May 2004 .
One aircraft , a Boeing 737 , was registered N313P , the other , a Gulfstream , was initially registered N379P and later as N8068V .
The flights were disclosed by Adam Ingram , the armed forces minister , in a letter to Sir Menzies Campbell , newly elected leader of the Liberal Democrats .
Last week , the Liberal Democrats threatened to report the minister to the parliamentary ombudsman if he continued to refuse to answer detailed questions about flights suspected of being used for " extraordinary rendition " - the practice of sending detainees to camps where they were at risk of being tortured .
Sir Menzies was among a number of MPs of all parties , including Andrew Tyrie - the Conservative MP for Chichester who has set up a special parliamentary committee to investigate the flights - who have tabled questions about the flights since the Guardian published details of them last September .
In their replies , ministers have said that they either have no record of CIA flights since 1998 , when they received four requests from the Clinton administration , or that records it might once have had had since been destroyed .
In his letter last night , Mr Ingram did not say the aircraft were used by the CIA , but the government has never denied they were .
Mr Ingram also did not describe the purpose of the flights .
He insisted his disclosure was not " at odds with the foreign secretary 's statements on the subject " .
Jack Straw has said that the government is " unaware " of any CIA flights landing in Britain or using UK airspace since 1998 and transporting terrorist suspects .
However , Michael Moore , the Liberal Democrat 's new foreign affairs spokesman , said last night : " Another week , another grudging admission from the government .
There is now a well - established pattern of partial disclosures after repeated denials . "
He added : " These are disturbing revelations .
Were these rendition flights or not ?
Ministers must urgently obtain answers from the US government . "
Liberty , the civil rights group , is supporting an amendment to the civil aviation bill now going through the Lords , tabled by Baroness D'Souza .
It would oblige the government to require any plane using UK airspace to land if it had information that it was being used for purposes of unlawful rendition .

In the past few years there 's been a blossoming of a new style of software methodology - referred to as agile methods .
Alternatively characterized as an antidote to bureaucracy or a license to hack they 've stirred up interest all over the software landscape .
In this essay I explore the reasons for agile methods , focusing not so much on their weight but on their adaptive nature and their people - first orientation .
Probably the most noticeable change to software process thinking in the last few years has been the appearance of the word ' agile ' .
We talk of agile software methods , of how to introduce agility into a development team , or of how to resist the impending storm of agilists determined to change well - established practices .
This new movement grew out of the efforts of various people who dealt with software process in the 1990s , found them wanting , and looked for a new approach to software process .
Most of the ideas were not new , indeed many people believed that much successful software had been built that way for a long time .
There was , however , a view that these ideas had been stifled and not been treated seriously enough , particularly by people interested in software process .
This essay was originally part of this movement .
I originally published it in July 2000 .
I wrote it , like most of my essays , as part of trying to understand the topic .
At that time I 'd used Extreme Programming for several years after I was lucky enough to work with Kent Beck , Ron Jeffries , Don Wells , and above all the rest of the Chrysler C3 team in 1996 .
I had since had conversations and read books from other people who had similar ideas about software process , but had not necessarily wanted to take the same path as Extreme Programming .
So in the essay I wanted to explore what were the similarities and differences between these methodologies .
If you are interested in historic curiosities , you can read the original version of this article .
Other than formatting changes the text is unaltered .
My conclusion then , which I still believe now , is that there were some fundamental principles that united these methodologies , and these principles were a notable contrast from the assumptions of the established methodologies .
This essay has continued to be one of the most popular essays on my website , which means I feel somewhat bidden to keep it up to date .
In its original form the essay both explored these differences in principles and provided a survey of agile methods as I then understood them .
Too much has happened with agile methods since for me to keep up with the survey part , although I do provide some links to continue your explorations .
The differences in principles still remain , and this discussion I 've kept .
From Nothing , to Monumental , to Agile Most software development is a chaotic activity , often characterized by the phrase " code and fix " .
The software is written without much of an underlying plan , and the design of the system is cobbled together from many short term decisions .
This actually works pretty well as the system is small , but as the system grows it becomes increasingly difficult to add new features to the system .
Furthermore bugs become increasingly prevalent and increasingly difficult to fix .
A typical sign of such a system is a long test phase after the system is " feature complete " .
Such a long test phase plays havoc with schedules as testing and debugging is impossible to schedule .
The original movement to try to change this introduced the notion of methodology .
These methodologies impose a disciplined process upon software development with the aim of making software development more predictable and more efficient .
They do this by developing a detailed process with a strong emphasis on planning inspired by other engineering disciplines - which is why I like to refer to them as engineering methodologies ( another widely used term for them is plan - driven methodologies ) .
Engineering methodologies have been around for a long time .
They 've not been noticeable for being terribly successful .
They are even less noted for being popular .
The most frequent criticism of these methodologies is that they are bureaucratic .
There 's so much stuff to do to follow the methodology that the whole pace of development slows down .
Agile methodologies developed as a reaction to these methodologies .
For many people the appeal of these agile methodologies is their reaction to the bureaucracy of the engineering methodologies .
These new methods attempt a useful compromise between no process and too much process , providing just enough process to gain a reasonable payoff .
The result of all of this is that agile methods have some significant changes in emphasis from engineering methods .
The most immediate difference is that they are less document - oriented , usually emphasizing a smaller amount of documentation for a given task .
In many ways they are rather code - oriented : following a route that says that the key part of documentation is source code .
However I do n't think this is the key point about agile methods .
Lack of documentation is a symptom of two much deeper differences :
Agile methods are adaptive rather than predictive .
Engineering methods tend to try to plan out a large part of the software process in great detail for a long span of time , this works well until things change .
So their nature is to resist change .
The agile methods , however , welcome change .
They try to be processes that adapt and thrive on change , even to the point of changing themselves .

Agile methods are people - oriented rather than process - oriented .
The goal of engineering methods is to define a process that will work well whoever happens to be using it .
Agile methods assert that no process will ever make up the skill of the development team , so the role of a process is to support the development team in their work .
In the following sections I 'll explore these differences in more detail , so that you can understand what an adaptive and people - centered process is like , its benefits and drawbacks , and whether it 's something you should use : either as a developer or customer of software .
Predictive versus Adaptive Separation of Design and Construction
The usual inspiration for methodologies is engineering disciplines such as civil or mechanical engineering .
Such disciplines put a lot of emphasis on planning before you build .
Such engineers will work on a series of drawings that precisely indicate what needs to be built and how these things need to be put together .
Many design decisions , such as how to deal with the load on a bridge , are made as the drawings are produced .
The drawings are then handed over to a different group , often a different company , to be built .
It 's assumed that the construction process will follow the drawings .
In practice the constructors will run into some problems , but these are usually small .
Since the drawings specify the pieces and how they need to be put together , they act as the foundation for a detailed construction plan .
Such a plan can figure out the tasks that need to be done and what dependencies exist between these tasks .
This allows for a reasonably predictable schedule and budget for construction .
It also says in detail how the people doing the construction work should do their work .
This allows the construction to be less skilled intellectually , although they are often very skilled manually .
So what we see here are two fundamentally different activities .
Design which is difficult to predict and requires expensive and creative people , and construction which is easier to predict .
Once we have the design , we can plan the construction .
Once we have the plan for the construction , we can then deal with construction in a much more predictable way .
In civil engineering construction is much bigger in both cost and time than design and planning .
So the approach for software engineering methodologies looks like this : we want a predictable schedule that can use people with lower skills .
To do this we must separate design from construction .
Therefore we need to figure out how to do the design for software so that the construction can be straightforward once the planning is done .
So what form does this plan take ?
For many , this is the role of design notations such as the UML .
If we can make all the significant decisions using the UML , we can build a construction plan and then hand these designs off to coders as a construction activity .
But here lies the crucial question .
Can you get a design that is capable of turning the coding into a predictable construction activity ?
And if so , is cost of doing this sufficiently small to make this approach worthwhile ?
All of this brings a few questions to mind .
The first is the matter of how difficult it is to get a UML - like design into a state that it can be handed over to programmers .
The problem with a UML - like design is that it can look very good on paper , yet be seriously flawed when you actually have to program the thing .
The models that civil engineers use are based on many years of practice that are enshrined in engineering codes .
Furthermore the key issues , such as the way forces play in the design , are amenable to mathematical analysis .
The only checking we can do of UML - like diagrams is peer review .
While this is helpful it leads to errors in the design that are often only uncovered during coding and testing .
Even skilled designers , such as I consider myself to be , are often surprised when we turn such a design into software .
Another issue is that of comparative cost .
When you build a bridge , the cost of the design effort is about 10 % of the job , with the rest being construction .
In software the amount of time spent in coding is much , much less .
McConnell suggests that for a large project , only 15 % of the project is code and unit test , an almost perfect reversal of the bridge building ratios .
Even if you lump in all testing as part of construction , then design is still 50 % of the work .
This raises an important question about the nature of design in software compared to its role in other branches of engineering .
These kinds of questions led Jack Reeves to suggest that in fact the source code is a design document and that the construction phase is actually the use of the compiler and linker .
Indeed anything that you can treat as construction can and should be automated .
This thinking leads to some important conclusions :
In software : construction is so cheap as to be free
In software all the effort is design , and thus requires creative and talented people
Creative processes are not easily planned , and so predictability may well be an impossible target .
We should be very wary of the traditional engineering metaphor for building software .
It 's a different kind of activity and requires a different process The Unpredictability of Requirements
There 's a refrain I 've heard on every problem project I 've run into .
The developers come to me and say " the problem with this project is that the requirements are always changing " .
The thing I find surprising about this situation is that anyone is surprised by it .
In building business software requirements changes are the norm , the question is what we do about it .
One route is to treat changing requirements as the result of poor requirements engineering .
The idea behind requirements engineering is to get a fully understood picture of the requirements before you begin building the software , get a customer sign - off to these requirements , and then set up procedures that limit requirements changes after the sign - off .
One problem with this is that just trying to understand the options for requirements is tough .
It 's even tougher because the development organization usually does n't provide cost information on the requirements .
You end up being in the situation where you may have some desire for a sun roof on your car , but the salesman can't tell you if it adds $ 10 to the cost of the car , or $ 10,000 .
Without much idea of the cost , how can you figure out whether you want to pay for that sunroof ?
Estimation is hard for many reasons .
Part of it is that software development is a design activity , and thus hard to plan and cost .
Part of it is that the basic materials keep changing rapidly .
Part of it is that so much depends on which individual people are involved , and individuals are hard to predict and quantify .
Software 's intangible nature also cuts in .
It 's very difficult to see what value a software feature has until you use it for real .
Only when you use an early version of some software do you really begin to understand what features are valuable and what parts are not .
This leads to the ironic point that people expect that requirements should be changeable .
After all software is supposed to be soft .
So not just are requirements changeable , they ought to be changeable .
It takes a lot of energy to get customers of software to fix requirements .
It 's even worse if they 've ever dabbled in software development themselves , because then they " know " that software is easy to change .
But even if you could settle all that and really could get an accurate and stable set of requirements you 're probably still doomed .
In today 's economy the fundamental business forces are changing the value of software features too rapidly .
What might be a good set of requirements now , is not a good set in six months time .
Even if the customers can fix their requirements , the business world is n't going to stop for them .
And many changes in the business world are completely unpredictable : anyone who says otherwise is either lying , or has already made a billion on stock market trading .
Everything else in software development depends on the requirements .
If you can not get stable requirements you can not get a predictable plan .
Is Predictability Impossible ?
In general , no .
There are some software developments where predictability is possible .
Organizations such as NASA 's space shuttle software group are a prime example of where software development can be predictable .
It requires a lot of ceremony , plenty of time , a large team , and stable requirements .
There are projects out there that are space shuttles .
However I do n't think much business software fits into that category .
For this you need a different kind of process .
One of the big dangers is to pretend that you can follow a predictable process when you can't .
People who work on methodology are not very good at identifying boundary conditions : the places where the methodology passes from appropriate to inappropriate .
Most methodologists want their methodologies to be usable by everyone , so they do n't understand nor publicize their boundary conditions .
This leads to people using a methodology in the wrong circumstances , such as using a predictable methodology in a unpredictable situation .
There 's a strong temptation to do that .
Predictability is a very desirable property .
However if you believe you can be predictable when you can't , it leads to situations where people build a plan early on , then do n't properly handle the situation where the plan falls apart .
You see the plan and reality slowly drifting apart .
For a long time you can pretend that the plan is still valid .
But at some point the drift becomes too much and the plan falls apart .
Usually the fall is painful .
So if you are in a situation that is n't predictable you can't use a predictive methodology .
That 's a hard blow .
It means that many of the models for controlling projects , many of the models for the whole customer relationship , just are n't true any more .
The benefits of predictability are so great , it 's difficult to let them go .
Like so many problems the hardest part is simply realizing that the problem exists .
However letting go of predictability does n't mean you have to revert to uncontrollable chaos .
Instead you need a process that can give you control over an unpredictability .
That 's what adaptivity is all about .
Controlling an Unpredictable Process - Iterations
So how do we control ourselves in an unpredictable world ?
The most important , and still difficult part is to know accurately where we are .
We need an honest feedback mechanism which can accurately tell us what the situation is at frequent intervals .
The key to this feedback is iterative development .
This is not a new idea .
Iterative development has been around for a while under many names : incremental , evolutionary , staged , spiral ... lots of names .
The key to iterative development is to frequently produce working versions of the final system that have a subset of the required features .
These working systems are short on functionality , but should otherwise be faithful to the demands of the final system .
They should be fully integrated and as carefully tested as a final delivery .
The point of this is that there is nothing like a tested , integrated system for bringing a forceful dose of reality into any project .
Documents can hide all sorts of flaws .
Untested code can hide plenty of flaws .
But when people actually sit in front of a system and work with it , then flaws become truly apparent : both in terms of bugs and in terms of misunderstood requirements .
Iterative development makes sense in predictable processes as well .
But it is essential in adaptive processes because an adaptive process needs to be able to deal with changes in required features .
This leads to a style of planning where long term plans are very fluid , and the only stable plans are short term plans that are made for a single iteration .
Iterative development gives you a firm foundation in each iteration that you can base your later plans around .
A key question for this is how long an iteration should be .
Different people give different answers .
XP suggests iterations of one or two weeks .
SCRUM suggests a length of a month .
Crystal may stretch further .
The tendency , however , is to make each iteration as short as you can get away with .
This provides more frequent feedback , so you know where you are more often .
The Adaptive Customer
This kind of adaptive process requires a different kind of relationship with a customer than the ones that are often considered , particularly when development is done by a separate firm .
When you hire a separate firm to do software development , most customers would prefer a fixed - price contract .
Tell the developers what they want , ask for bids , accept a bid , and then the onus is on the development organization to build the software .
A fixed price contract requires stable requirements and hence a predictive process .
Adaptive processes and unstable requirements imply you cannot work with the usual notion of fixed - price .
Trying to fit a fixed price model to an adaptive process ends up in a very painful explosion .
The nasty part of this explosion is that the customer gets hurt every bit as much as the software development company .
After all the customer would n't be wanting some software unless their business needed it .
If they do n't get it their business suffers .
So even if they pay the development company nothing , they still lose .
Indeed they lose more than they would pay for the software ( why would they pay for the software if the business value of that software were less ? )
So there 's dangers for both sides in signing the traditional fixed price contract in conditions where a predictive process cannot be used .
This means that the customer has to work differently .
This does n't mean that you can't fix a budget for software up - front .
What it does mean is that you cannot fix time , price and scope .
The usual agile approach is to fix time and price , and to allow the scope to vary in a controlled manner .
In an adaptive process the customer has much finer - grained control over the software development process .
At every iteration they get both to check progress and to alter the direction of the software development .
This leads to much closer relationship with the software developers , a true business partnership .
This level of engagement is not for every customer organization , nor for every software developer ; but it 's essential to make an adaptive process work properly .
All this yields a number of advantages for the customer .
For a start they get much more responsive software development .
A usable , although minimal , system can go into production early on .
The customer can then change its capabilities according to changes in the business , and also from learning from how the system is used in reality .
Every bit as important as this is greater visibility into the true state of the project .
The problem with predictive processes is that project quality is measured by conformance to plan .
This makes it difficult for people to signal when reality and the plan diverge .
The common result is a big slip in the schedule late in the project .
In an agile project there is a constant reworking of the plan with every iteration .
If bad news is lurking it tends to come earlier , when there is still time to do something about it .
Indeed this risk control is a key advantage of iterative development .
Agile methods take this further by keeping the iteration lengths small , but also by seeing these variations in a different way .
Mary Poppendieck summed up this difference in viewpoint best for me with her phrase " A late change in requirements is a competitive advantage " .
I think most people have noticed that it 's very difficult for business people to really understand what they need from software in the beginning .
Often we see that people learn during the process what elements are valuable and which ones are n't .
Often the most valuable features are n't at all obvious until customer have had a chance to play with the software .
Agile methods seek to take advantage of this , encouraging business people to learn about their needs as the system gets built , and to build the system in such a way that changes can be incorporated quickly .
For my keynote at the first XP / Agile conference ( XP 2000 ) I prepared Is Design Dead : an essay that explores the role of design in extreme programming .
All this has an important bearing what constitutes a successful project .
A predictive project is often measured by how well it met its plan .
A project that 's on - time and on - cost is considered to be a success .
This measurement is nonsense to an agile environment .
For agilists the question is business value - did the customer get software that 's more valuable to them than the cost put into it .
A good predictive project will go according to plan , a good agile project will build something different and better than the original plan foresaw .
Putting People First Executing an adaptive process is not easy .
In particular it requires a very effective team of developers .
The team needs to be effective both in the quality of the individuals , and in the way the team blends together .
There 's also an interesting synergy : not just does adaptivity require a strong team , most good developers prefer an adaptive process .
Plug - Compatible Programming Units
One of the aims of traditional methodologies is to develop a process where the people involved are replaceable parts .
With such a process you can treat people as resources who are available in various types .
You have an analyst , some coders , some testers , a manager .
The individuals are n't so important , only the roles are important .
That way if you plan a project it does n't matter which analyst and which testers you get , just that you know how many you have so you know how the number of resources affects your plan .
But this raises a key question : are the people involved in software development replaceable parts ?
One of the key features of agile methods is that they reject this assumption .
Perhaps the most explicit rejection of people as resources is Alistair Cockburn .
In his paper Characterizing People as Non-Linear , First - Order Components in Software Development , he makes the point that predictable processes require components that behave in a predictable way .
However people are not predictable components .
Furthermore his studies of software projects have led him to conclude the people are the most important factor in software development .
In the title , [ of his article ] I refer to people as " components " .
That is how people are treated in the process / methodology design literature .
The mistake in this approach is that " people " are highly variable and non-linear , with unique success and failure modes .
Those factors are first - order , not negligible factors .
Failure of process and methodology designers to account for them contributes to the sorts of unplanned project trajectories we so often see .
-- [ Cockburn non-linear ]
One wonders if not the nature of software development works against us here .
When we 're programming a computer , we control an inherently predictable device .
Since we 're in this business because we are good at doing that , we are ideally suited to messing up when faced with human beings .
Although Cockburn is the most explicit in his people - centric view of software development , the notion of people first is a common theme with many thinkers in software .
The problem , too often , is that methodology has been opposed to the notion of people as the first - order factor in project success .
This creates a strong positive feedback effect .
If you expect all your developers to be plug - compatible programming units , you do n't try to treat them as individuals .
This lowers morale ( and productivity ) .
The good people look for a better place to be , and you end up with what you desire : plug - compatible programming units .
Deciding that people come first is a big decision , one that requires a lot of determination to push through .
The notion of people as resources is deeply ingrained in business thinking , its roots going back to the impact of Frederick Taylor 's Scientific Management approach .
In running a factory , this Taylorist approach may make sense .
But for the highly creative and professional work , which I believe software development to be , this does not hold .
( And in fact modern manufacturing is also moving away from the Taylorist model . )
Programmers are Responsible Professionals
A key part of the Taylorist notion is that the people doing the work are not the people who can best figure out how best to do that work .
In a factory this may be true for several reasons .
Part of this is that many factory workers are not the most intelligent or creative people , in part this is because there is a tension between management and workers in that management makes more money when the workers make less .
Recent history increasingly shows us how untrue this is for software development .
Increasingly bright and capable people are attracted to software development , attracted by both its glitz and by potentially large rewards .
( Both of which tempted me away from electronic engineering . )
Despite the downturn of the early 00's , there is still a great deal of talent and creativity in software development .
( There may well be a generational effect here .
Some anecdotal evidence makes me wonder if more brighter people have ventured into software engineering in the last fifteen years or so .
If so this would be a reason for why there is such a cult of youth in the computer business , like most cults there needs to be a grain of truth in it . )
When you want to hire and retain good people , you have to recognize that they are competent professionals .
As such they are the best people to decide how to conduct their technical work .
The Taylorist notion of a separate planning department that decides how to do things only works if the planners understand how to do the job better than those doing it .
If you have bright , motivated people doing the job then this does not hold .
Managing a People Oriented Process People orientation manifests itself in a number of different ways in agile processes .
It leads to different effects , not all of them are consistent .
One of the key elements is that of accepting the process rather than the imposition of a process .
Often software processes are imposed by management figures .
As such they are often resisted , particularly when the management figures have had a significant amount of time away from active development .
Accepting a process requires commitment , and as such needs the active involvement of all the team .
This ends up with the interesting result that only the developers themselves can choose to follow an adaptive process .
This is particularly true for XP , which requires a lot of discipline to execute .
Crystal considers itself as a less disciplined approach that 's appropriate for a wider audience .
Another point is that the developers must be able to make all technical decisions .
XP gets to the heart of this where in its planning process it states that only developers may make estimates on how much time it will take to do some work .
Such technical leadership is a big shift for many people in management positions .
Such an approach requires a sharing of responsibility where developers and management have an equal place in the leadership of the project .
Notice that I say equal .
Management still plays a role , but recognizes the expertise of developers .
An important reason for this is the rate of change of technology in our industry .
After a few years technical knowledge becomes obsolete .
This half life of technical skills is without parallel in any other industry .
Even technical people have to recognize that entering management means their technical skills will wither rapidly .
Ex-developers need to recognize that their technical skills will rapidly disappear and they need to trust and rely on current developers .
The Difficulty of Measurement
If you have a process where the people who say how work should be done are different from the people who actually do it , the leaders need some way of measuring how effective the doers are .
In Scientific Management there was a strong push to develop objective approaches to measuring the output of people .
This is particularly relevant to software because of the difficulty of applying measurement to software .
Despite our best efforts we are unable to measure the most simple things about software , such as productivity .
Without good measures for these things , any kind of external control is doomed .
Introducing measured management without good measures leads to its own problems .
Robert Austin made an excellent discussion of this .
He points out that when measuring performance you have to get all the important factors under measurement .
Anything that 's missing has the inevitable result that the doers will alter what they do to produce the best measures , even if that clearly reduces the true effectiveness of what they do .
This measurement dysfunction is the Achilles heel of measurement - based management .
Austin 's conclusion is that you have to choose between measurement - based management and delegatory management ( where the doers decide how to do the work ) .
Measurement - based management is best suited to repetitive simple work , with low knowledge requirements and easily measured outputs - exactly the opposite of software development .
The point of all this is that traditional methods have operated under the assumption that measurement - based management is the most efficient way of managing .
The agile community recognizes that the characteristics of software development are such that measurement based management leads to very high levels of measurement dysfunction .
It 's actually more efficient to use a delegatory style of management , which is the kind of approach that is at the center of the agilist viewpoint .
The Role of Business Leadership
But the technical people cannot do the whole process themselves .
They need guidance on the business needs .
This leads to another important aspect of adaptive processes : they need very close contact with business expertise .
This goes beyond most projects ' involvement of the business role .
Agile teams cannot exist with occasional communication .
They need continuous access to business expertise .
Furthermore this access is not something that is handled at a management level , it is something that is present for every developer .
Since developers are capable professionals in their own discipline , they need to be able to work as equals with other professionals in other disciplines .
A large part of this , of course , is due to the nature of adaptive development .
Since the whole premise of adaptive development is that things change quickly , you need constant contact to advise everybody of the changes .
There is nothing more frustrating to a developer than seeing their hard work go to waste .
So it 's important to ensure that there is good quality business expertise that is both available to the developer and is of sufficient quality that the developer can trust them .
The Self - Adaptive Process
So far I 've talked about adaptivity in the context of a project adapting its software frequently to meet the changing requirements of its customers .
However there 's another angle to adaptivity : that of the process changing over time .
A project that begins using an adaptive process wo n't have the same process a year later .
Over time , the team will find what works for them , and alter the process to fit .
The first part of self - adaptivity is regular reviews of the process .
Usually you do these with every iteration .
At the end of each iteration , have a short meeting and ask yourself the following questions ( culled from Norm Kerth )
What did we do well ?
What have we learned ?
What can we do better ?
What puzzles us ?
These questions will lead you to ideas to change the process for the next iteration .
In this way a process that starts off with problems can improve as the project goes on , adapting better to the team that uses it .
If self - adaptivity occurs within a project , it 's even more marked across an organization .
A consequence of self - adaptivity is that you should never expect to find a single corporate methodology .
Instead each team should not just choose their own process , but should also actively tune their process as they proceed with the project .
While both published processes and the experience of other projects can act as an inspiration and a baseline , the developers professional responsibility is to adapt the process to the task at hand .
Flavors of Agile Development
The term ' agile ' refers to a philosophy of software development .
Under this broad umbrella sits many more specific approaches such as Extreme Programming , Scrum , Lean Development , etc .
Each of these more particular approaches has its own ideas , communities and leaders .
Each community is a distinct group of its own but to be correctly called agile it should follow the same broad principles .
Each community also borrows from ideas and techniques from each other .
Many practitioners move between different communities spreading different ideas around - all in all it's a complicated but vibrant ecosystem .
So far I 've given my take on the overall picture of my definition of agile .
Now I want to introduce some of the different agile communities .
I can only give a quick overview here , but I do include references so you can dig further if you like .
Since I 'm about to start giving more references , this is a good point to point out some sources for general information on agile methods .
The web - center is the Agile Alliance a non-profit set up to encourage and research agile software development .
For books I 'd suggest overviews by Alistair Cockburn and Jim Highsmith .
Craig Larman 's book on agile development contains a very useful history of iterative development .
For more of my views on agile methods look at the appropriate sections of my articles and blog .
The following list is by no means complete .
It reflects a personal selection of the flavors of agile that have most interested and influenced me over the last decade or so .
Agile Manifesto
The term ' agile ' got hijacked for this activity in early 2001 when a bunch of people who had been heavily involved in this work got together to exchange ideas and came up with the Manifesto for Agile Software Development .
Prior to this workshop a number of different groups had been developing similar ideas about software development .
Most , but by no means all , of this work had come out of the Object - Oriented software community that had long advocated iterative development approaches .
This essay was originally written in 2000 to try to pull together these various threads .
At that time there was no common name for these approaches , but the moniker ' lightweight ' had grown up around them .
Many of the people involved did n't feel this was a good term as it did n't accurately convey the essence of what these approaches were about .
There had been some talking about broader issues in these approaches in 2000 at a workshop hosted by Kent Beck in Oregon .
Although this workshop was focused on Extreme Programming ( the community that at that time had gained the most attention ) several non XPers had attended .
One the discussions that came up was whether it was better for XP to be a broad or concrete movement .
Kent preferred a more focused cohesive community .
The workshop was organized , if I remember correctly , primarily by Jim Highsmith and Bob Martin .
They contacted people who they felt were active in communities with these similar ideas and got seventeen of them together for the Snowbird workshop .
The initial idea was just to get together and build better understanding of each others ' approaches .
Robert Martin was keen to get some statement , a manifesto that could be used to rally the industry behind these kinds of techniques .
We also decided we wanted to choose a name to act as an umbrella name for the various approaches .
During the course of the workshop we decided to use ' agile ' as the umbrella name , and came up with values part of the manifesto .
The principles section was started at the workshop but mostly developed on a wiki afterwards .
The effort clearly struck a nerve , I think we were all very surprised at the degree of attention and appreciation the manifesto got .
Although the manifesto is hardly a rigorous definition of agile , it does provide a focusing statement that helps concentrate the ideas .
Shortly after we finished the manifesto Jim Highsmith and I wrote an article for SD Magazine that provided some commentary to the manifesto .
Later that year , most of the seventeen who wrote the manifesto got back together again , with quite a few others , at OOPSLA 2001 .
There was a suggestion that the manifesto authors should begin some on - going agile movement , but the authors agreed that they were just the people who happened to turn up for that workshop and produced that manifesto .
There was no way that that group could claim leadership of the whole agile community .
We had helped launch the ship and should let it go for whoever who wanted to sail in her to do so .
So that was the end of the seventeen manifesto authors as an organized body .
One next step that did follow , with the active involvement of many of these authors , was the formation of the agile alliance .
This group is a non-profit group intended to promote and research agile methods .
Amongst other things it sponsors an annual conference in the US .
XP ( Extreme Programming )
During the early popularity of agile methods in the late 1990's , Extreme Programming was the one that got the lion 's share of attention .
In many ways it still does .
The roots of XP lie in the Smalltalk community , and in particular the close collaboration of Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham in the late 1980's .
Both of them refined their practices on numerous projects during the early 90's , extending their ideas of a software development approach that was both adaptive and people - oriented .
Kent continued to develop his ideas during consulting engagements , in particular the Chrysler C3 project , which has since become known as the creation project of extreme programming .
He started using the term ' extreme programming ' around 1997 .
( C3 also marked my initial contact with Extreme Programming and the beginning of my friendship with Kent . )
During the late 1990's word of Extreme Programming spread , initially through descriptions on newsgroups and Ward Cunningham 's wiki , where Kent and Ron Jeffries ( a colleague at C3 ) spent a lot of time explaining and debating the various ideas .
Finally a number of books were published towards the end of the 90's and start of 00's that went into some detail explaining the various aspects of the approach .
Most of these books took Kent Beck 's white book as their foundation .
Kent produced a second edition of the white book in 2004 which was a significant re-articulation of the approach .
XP begins with five values ( Communication , Feedback , Simplicity , Courage , and Respect ) .
It then elaborates these into fourteen principles and again into twenty - four practices .
The idea is that practices are concrete things that a team can do day - to - day , while values are the fundamental knowledge and understanding that underpins the approach .
Values without practices are hard to apply and can be applied in so many ways that it 's hard to know where to start .
Practices without values are rote activities without a purpose .
Both values and practices are needed , but there 's a big gap between them - the principles help bridge that gap .
Many of XP 's practices are old , tried and tested techniques , yet often forgotten by many , including most planned processes .
As well as resurrecting these techniques , XP weaves them into a synergistic whole where each one is reinforced by the others and given purpose by the values .
One of the most striking , as well as initially appealing to me , is its strong emphasis on testing .
While all processes mention testing , most do so with a pretty low emphasis .
However XP puts testing at the foundation of development , with every programmer writing tests as they write their production code .
The tests are integrated into a continuous integration and build process which yields a highly stable platform for future development .
XP 's approach here , often described under the heading of Test Driven Development ( TDD ) has been influential even in places that have n't adopted much else of XP .
There 's a great deal of publications about extreme programming .
One area of confusion , however , is the shift between the first and second edition of the white book .
I said above that the second edition is a ' re - articulation ' of extreme programming , in that the approach is still the same but it is described in a different style .
The first edition ( with four values , twelve practices and some important but mostly - ignored principles ) had a huge influence on the software industry and most descriptions of extreme programming were written based on the first edition 's description .
Keep that in mind as you read material on XP , particularly if it was prepared prior to 2005 .
Indeed most of the common web descriptions of XP are based on the first edition .
The natural starting place to discover more is the second edition of the white book .
This book explains the background and practices of XP in a short ( 160 page ) package .
Kent Beck edited a multi-colored series of books on extreme programming around the turn of the century , if forced to pick one to suggest I 'd go for the purple one , remember that like most material it 's based on the first edition .
There 's a lot of material on the web about XP but most of it is based on the first edition .
One of the few descriptions I know of that takes account of the second edition is a paper on The New XP ( PDF ) by Michele Marchesi who hosted the original XP conferences in Sardinia .
For discussion on XP there is a yahoo mailing list .
My involvement in the early days and friendships within the XP community mean that I have a distinct familiarity , fondness and bias towards XP .
I think its influence owes to marrying the principles of agile development with a solid set of techniques for actually carrying them out .
Much of the early writings on agile neglected the latter , raising questions about whether the agile ideas were really possible .
XP provided the tools by which the hopes of agility could be realized .
Scrum Scrum also developed in the 80's and 90's primarily with OO development circles as a highly iterative development methodology .
It 's most well known developers were Ken Schwaber , Jeff Sutherland , and Mike Beedle .
Scrum concentrates on the management aspects of software development , dividing development into thirty day iterations ( called ' sprints ' ) and applying closer monitoring and control with daily scrum meetings .
It places much less emphasis on engineering practices and many people combine its project management approach with extreme programming 's engineering practices .
( XP 's management practices are n't really very different . )
Ken Schwaber is one of the most active proponents of Scrum , his website is a good place to start looking for more information and his book is probably the best first reference .
Crystal Alistair Cockburn has long been one of the principal voices in the agile community .
He developed the Crystal family of software development methods as a group of approaches tailored to different size teams .
Crystal is seen as a family because Alistair believes that different approaches are required as teams vary in size and the criticality of errors changes .
Despite their variations all crystal approaches share common features .
All crystal methods have three priorities : safety ( in project outcome ) , efficiency , habitability ( developers can live with crystal ) .
They also share common properties , of which the most important three are : Frequent Delivery , Reflective Improvement , and Close Communication .
The habitability priority is an important part of the crystal mind - set .
Alistair 's quest ( as I see it ) is looking for what is the least amount of process you can do and still succeed with an underlying assumption of low - discipline that is inevitable with humans .
As a result Alistair sees Crystal as requiring less discipline than extreme programming , trading off less efficiency for a greater habitability and reduced chances of failure .
Despite Crystal 's outline , there is n't a comprehensive description of all its manifestations .
The most well described is Crystal Clear , which has a modern book description .
There is also a wiki for further material and discussion of Crystal .
Context Driven Testing
From the beginning it 's been software developers who have been driving the agile community .
However many other people are involved in software development and are affected by this new movement .
One obvious such group is testers , who often live in a world very much contained by waterfall thinking .
With common guidelines that state that the role of testing is to ensure conformance of software to up - front written specifications , the role of testers in an agile world is far from clear .
As it turns out , several people in the testing community have been questioning much of mainstream testing thinking for quite a while .
This has led to a group known as context - driven testing .
The best description of this is the book Lessons Learned in Software Testing .
This community is also very active on the web , take a look at sites hosted by Brian Marick ( one of the authors of the agile manifesto ) , Brett Pettichord , James Bach , and Cem Kaner .
Lean Development
I remember a few years ago giving a talk about agile methods at the Software Development conference and talking to an eager woman about parallels between the agile ideas and lean movement in manufacturing .
Mary Poppendieck ( and husband Tom ) have gone on to be active supporters of the agile community , in particular looking at the overlaps and inspirations between lean production and software development .
The lean movement in manufacturing was pioneered by Taiichi Ohno at Toyota and is often known as the Toyota Production System .
Lean production was an inspiration to many of the early agilists - the Poppendiecks are most notable to describing how these ideas interact .
In general I 'm very wary of these kinds of reasoning by analogy , indeed the engineering separation between design and construction got us into this mess in the first place .
However analogies can lead to good ideas and I think the lean ideas have introduced many useful ideas and tools into the agile movement .
The Poppendiecks ' book and website are the obvious starting points for more information .
( Rational ) Unified Process
Another well - known process to have come out of the object - oriented community is the Rational Unified Process ( sometimes just referred to as the Unified Process ) .
The original idea was that like the UML unified modeling languages the UP could unify software processes .
Since RUP appeared about the same time as the agile methods , there 's a lot of discussion about whether the two are compatible .
RUP is a very large collection of practices and is really a process framework rather than a process .
Rather than give a single process for software development it seeks to provide a common set of practices for teams to choose from for an individual project .
As a result a team 's first step using RUP should be to define their individual process , or as RUP calls it , a development case .
The key common aspects of RUP is that it is Use Case Driven ( development is driven through user - visible features ) , iterative , and architecture centric ( there 's a priority to building a architecture early on that will last the project through ) .
My experience with RUP is that its problem is its infinite variability .
I 've seen descriptions of RUP usage that range from rigid waterfall with ' analysis iterations ' to picture perfect agile .
It 's struck me that the desire of people to market the RUP as the single process led to a result where people can do just about anything and call it RUP - resulting in RUP being a meaningless phrase .
Despite all this there are some very strong people in the RUP community that are very much aligned with agile thinking .
I 've been impressed in all my meeting with Phillippe Kruchten and his book is best starting point for RUP .
Craig Larman has also developed descriptions of working with RUP in an agile style in his popular introductory book on OO design .

It 's easy to understand how Mike Hartnagel got himself into the classic " should I quit after three days ? " dilemma .
Who would have guessed that a single bullet point on the job description -- " utilizing some Excel Interoperability " -- actually described the architecture of the system : a horrid amalgamation of Excel spreadsheets interacting with C# interacting with other spreadsheets .
Who would have thought that all other bullet points -- from " multi- tiered architecture using remoting " to " automated / integrated build process " -- were actually features they 'd like to have at some point in the distant future .
Who ?
A hardened cynic -- that 's who .
And that 's exactly what Mike became after being handed his first programming assignment : create overloads for the following function so that developers do n't need use zeros if they do n't need all of the 600 + parameters ...

I spent seven years of my girlhood heavily veiled - not in a Muslim niqab but in a nun 's habit .
We wore voluminous black robes , large rosaries and crucifixes , and an elaborate headdress : you could see a small slice of my face from the front , but from the side I was entirely shielded from view .
We must have looked very odd indeed , walking dourly through the colourful carnival of London during the swinging 60s , but nobody ever asked us to exchange our habits for more conventional attire .
When my order was founded in the 1840s , not long after Catholic emancipation , people were so enraged to see nuns brazenly wearing their habits in the streets that they pelted them with rotten fruit and horse dung .
Nuns had been banned from Britain since the Reformation ; their return seemed to herald the resurgence of barbarism .
Two hundred and fifty years after the gunpowder plot , Catholicism was still feared as unassimilable , irredeemably alien to the British ethos , fanatically opposed to democracy and freedom , and a fifth column allied to dangerous enemies abroad .
Today the veiled Muslim woman appears to symbolise the perceived Islamic threat , as nuns once epitomised the evils of popery .
She seems a barbaric affront to hard - won values that are essential to our cultural identity : gender equality , freedom , transparency and openness .
But in the Muslim world the veil has also acquired a new symbolism .
If government ministers really want to debate the issue fruitfully , they must become familiar with the bitterly ironic history of veiling during the last hundred years .
Until the late 19th century , veiling was neither a central nor a universal practice in the Islamic world .
The Qur'an does not command all women to cover their heads ; the full hijab was traditionally worn only by aristocratic women , as a mark of status .
In Egypt , under Muhammad Ali's leadership ( 1805 - 48 ) , the lot of women improved dramatically , and many were abandoning the veil and moving more freely in society .
But after the British occupied Egypt in 1882 , the consul general , Lord Cromer , ignored this development .
He argued that veiling was the " fatal obstacle " that prevented Egyptians from participating fully in western civilisation .
Until it was abolished , Egypt would need the benevolent supervision of the colonialists .
But Cromer had cynically exploited feminist ideas to advance the colonial project .
Egyptian women lost many of their new educational and professional opportunities under the British , and Cromer was co-founder in London of the Anti-Women 's Suffrage League .
When Egyptian pundits sycophantically supported Cromer , veiling became a hot issue .
In 1899 Qassim Amin published Tahrir al - Mara - The Liberation of Women - which obsequiously praised the nobility of European culture , arguing that the veil symbolised everything that was wrong with Islam and Egypt .
It was no feminist tract : Egyptian women , according to Amin , were dirty , ignorant and hopelessly inadequate parents .
The book created a furore , and the ensuing debate made the veil a symbol of resistance to colonialism .
The problem was compounded in other parts of the Muslim world by reformers who wanted their countries to look modern , even though most of the population had no real understanding of secular institutions .
When Ataturk secularised Turkey , men and women were forced into European costumes that felt like fancy dress .
In Iran , the shahs ' soldiers used to march through the streets with their bayonets at the ready , tearing off the women 's veils and ripping them to pieces .
In 1935 , Shah Reza Pahlavi ordered the army to shoot at unarmed demonstrators who were protesting against obligatory western dress .
Hundreds of Iranians died that day .
Many women , whose mothers had happily discarded the veil , adopted the hijab in order to dissociate themselves from aggressively secular regimes .
This happened in Egypt under President Anwar Sadat and it continues under Hosni Mubarak .
When the shah banned the chador , during the Iranian revolution , women wore it as a matter of principle - even those who usually wore western clothes .
Today in the US , more and more Muslim women are wearing the hijab to distance themselves from the foreign policy of the Bush administration ; something similar may well be happening in Britain .
In the patriarchal society of Victorian Britain , nuns offended by tacitly proclaiming that they had no need of men .
I found my habit liberating : for seven years I never had to give a thought to my clothes , makeup and hair - all the rubbish that clutters the minds of the most liberated women .
In the same way , Muslim women feel that the veil frees them from the constraints of some uncongenial aspects of western modernity .
They argue that you do not have to look western to be modern .
The veiled woman defies the sexual mores of the west , with its strange compulsion to " reveal all " .
Where western men and women display their expensive clothes and flaunt their finely honed bodies as a mark of privilege , the uniformity of traditional Muslim dress stresses the egalitarian and communal ethos of Islam .
Muslims feel embattled at present , and at such times the bodies of women often symbolise the beleaguered community .
Because of its complex history , Jack Straw and his supporters must realise that many Muslims now suspect such western interventions about the veil as having a hidden agenda .
Instead of improving relations , they usually make matters worse .
Lord Cromer made the originally marginal practice of veiling problematic in the first place .
When women are forbidden to wear the veil , they hasten in ever greater numbers to put it on .
In Victorian Britain , nuns believed that until they could appear in public fully veiled , Catholics would never be accepted in this country .
But Britain got over its visceral dread of popery .
In the late 1960s , shortly before I left my order , we decided to give up the full habit .
This decision expressed , among other things , our new confidence , but had it been forced upon us , our deeply ingrained fears of persecution would have revived .
But Muslims today do not feel similarly empowered .
The unfolding tragedy of the Middle East has convinced some that the west is bent on the destruction of Islam .
The demand that they abandon the veil will exacerbate these fears , and make some women cling more fiercely to the garment that now symbolises their resistance to oppression .

According to documents recently declassified by the U.S. State Department , top U.S. and Taliban officials discussed the potential assassination of Osama bin Laden after the bombings of U.S. embassies in 1998 .
The documents were released on Thursday by the National Security Archive under the Freedom of Information Act .
They show that the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan , Alan Eastham Jr. , met with Wakil Ahmed , a close aide to Taliban leader Mullah Omar , on November 28 1998 at the Taliban embassy in Islamabad .
In that meeting Wakil Ahmed told Eastham Jr. that the Taliban would understand the U.S. desire to have bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan .
He said that one possibility to " resolve " the " bin Laden Situation " would be if the U.S. were to " kill him , or arrange for bin Laden to be assassinated " .
Wakil said the Taliban wanted to resolve the " bin Laden problem " as quickly as possible because a failure to do so would result in American bombing of Afghanistan and the Taliban 's " termination " .

THERE are two approaches to illegal immigration currently being debated in Congress .
One , supported by the House , emphasizes border control and law enforcement , including a wall along the Mexican border and increased border patrols .
The other , which is supported by the Bush administration and has been passed by the Senate , relies on employers to police the workplace .
Both proposals have serious flaws .
As opponents of the House plan have rightly pointed out , walls rarely work ; illegal immigrants will get around them one way or another .
Unless we erect something akin to the Berlin Wall , which would cost billions to build and police , a barrier on the border would be monitored by largely symbolic patrols and easily evaded .
The Senate approach is more realistic but it , too , has problems .
It creates a temporary worker program but requires employers first to attempt to recruit American workers to fill job openings .
It allows for more border fencing , but makes no effort to disguise the basic futility of the enterprise .
Instead , it calls on employers to enforce immigration laws in the workplace , a plan that can only succeed through the creation and distribution of a costly national identification card .
A national ID card raises serious questions about civil liberties , but they are not the sole concern .
The cost estimates for producing and distributing a counterfeit - proof card for the roughly 150 million people currently in the labor force — and the millions more who will seek work in the near future — extend into the billions of dollars .
Employers would have to verify the identity of every American worker , otherwise the program would be as unreliable as the one in place now .
Anyone erroneously denied a card in this bureaucratic labyrinth would be unemployable .
JTBの元取締役CIO ( 最高情報責任者 ) の方が、ITシステム開発が設備への投資であるかのような前提で書いていますが、この前提は間違っていると思います。
ソフトウェアシステムの開発とは、経営行為そのものそのものであり、逆に言えば、江戸時代どころか、ローマの時代から、経営行為とは、ソフトウェアシステムの開発以外のなにものでもありませんでした。
たとえば、新しいビジネスを実現するための、新しい店舗オペレーションや配送システムの開発は、ソフトウェアシステムの開発そのものです。
あたらしいビジネスを立ち上げるために、設計すべきものは、たとえば:
●迅速で高品質な状況対応を可能とする意思決定メカニズムの設計。
●現場で柔軟な対応が出来、かつ、従業員の士気があがるような、責任・権限メカニズムと、それと連動した人事評価・報酬システムの設計。
●現実的に調達可能な人材と、十分な投資効果の見込める従業員教育システムと、それを前提とした効率的で現実的な店舗オペレーションの設計。
●もちろん、その新しい店舗オペレーションを実装するための、現実的な店舗レイアウト設計方針や、流通ネットワークの設計。
これらは、みな、ソフトウェアシステムの開発そのものです。
教育や人材育成とは、人間の脳神経システムのプログラミングです。
従業員のモチベーション設計、従業員規則の作成、顧客がリピートするための動機付け設計、責任・権限・意思決定メカニズムの設計は、社会システムのプログラミングです。
そして、企業のITシステムの開発とは、本質的にこれらと同質の行為なのです。
ITシステムを開発していないのに、できあがった世界最大級のITシステム たとえば、「 ウォルマートのITシステムは、世界で２番目の規模だ。」というジョークがあります。一番目は、ペンタゴンだというオチです。
ウォルマートは、それほどの規模のITシステムを保有しているにもかかわらず、彼らの意識では、開発しているのは、あくまでより効率的で付加価値の高い店舗オペレーションであり究極的には彼らのビジネスそのものです。彼らは、ITシステムを開発しているわけではありません。
つまり、現代の経営においては、店舗オペレーションを設計するとき、客の導線や人材配置や組織メカニズムが一体となった一つのソフトウェアアーキテクチャとして設計するのが当たり前で、店舗オペレーション設計が終わった後に、それに必要なIT設備を開発するという発想そのものが、時代遅れなのです。
コンピュータソフトウェアと脳神経ソフトウェアは等価？
そもそも、ソフトウェアシステムの設計や改良の過程では、どの部分をどの言語で実装し、どのOSのバイナリでどのマシーンで運用するかという部分は、よく入れ替わります。サーバのLinuxで、PHPで実装するはずだった機能を、途中から、やはりWindowsクライアントのJavaScriptにやらせることに変更しよう、という具合にです。
これと同じように、店舗オペレーションというソフトウェアシステムを設計するとき、どの部分を人材教育(脳神経プログラミング)や組織メカニズム(社会システムプログラミング)で実装し、どの部分をJavaで実装するかは、よく入れ替わるのです。脳神経ソフトウェアとコンピュータソフトウェアは、この意味で等価なのです。
実装イメージのない事業設計はただのファンタジーだ
そして、経営者が、あたらしいビジネス戦略を練り上げるとき、そもそも、どんな店舗オペレーションが可能で、どんな店舗オペレーションが実装不可能なのか、実現イメージを頭にもちながら、ビジネス設計をします。
たとえば、あたらしいコンセプトの有機野菜レストランチェーンを立ち上げるとき、はたして、そういう客層に対する、そういうサービスを提供するのに、これだけの人材と、これだけのアルバイトさんだけで、ほんとうに回せるのか？そこまで高品質なコンセプトでやろうとすると、店舗マニュアルが複雑になりすぎないか？そもそも、それを回せる人材は、これだけの期間で調達可能なのか？それだけの鮮度を保ったまま、契約農家から原料を配送可能なのか？有機農業は、天候による影響をどのように受けるリスクがあるのか？
つまり、 「新規事業立ち上げ」という「新規ソフトウェア設計行為」をするとき、プログラミングでいうところの、コーディングイメージをもちながら、設計するのが当たり前なわけです。
なぜなら、あんなこともやりたい、こんなこともやりたい、というビジネスアイデアは、それが実装可能な場合のみ、いいアイデアであり、実装不可能なビジネスアイデアなど、ただのファンタジーであることを、経営者は、骨の髄まで分かっているからです。
言い換えれば、実装可能なソフトウェアと、そうでないソフトウェアの区別のつかない経営者は、無能な経営者です。
実装イメージのないコンピュータソフトウェア企画もただのファンタジー
にもかかわらず、新規事業立ち上げというソフトウェア開発行為において、脳神経ソフトウェアや組織ソフトウェアとして実装されるコードは、実装可能性を精密に吟味しながら設計するのに、コンピュータソフトウェアとして実装される部分だけ、実装可能性を十分に吟味せずに、ビジネス設計するから、プロジェクトが頓挫したり、思ったような効果を上げないのです。
新しいコンセプトのレストランの店舗オペレーションを設計するとき、どのような作業なら、パートのおばさんだけで回せるのか判断のつかない経営者では、ろくな事業企画ができるはずもないのと同じように、どのようなソフトウェア機能なら、システム的ボトルネックが生じずに、かつ、ソフトウェアシステムの保守性が悪くならずに開発可能かどうかの検討がつかない経営者では、ろくな事業企画ができるわけがないのです。
ITシステム開発プロジェクトが頓挫する本当の理由 そして、なぜ、ITシステムの開発が不確定要素が多く、計画通りに行かないかというと、それが、新規事業立ち上げにおける、新しい組織ソフトウェアやオペレーションの開発と本質的に同じだからです。
いままでやったことのない、新しいコンセプトのレストランで、新しい食材調達システムと、あたらしいサービス提供を実現するような、新しい店舗オペレーションを設計するときなんて、不確定要素だらけです。計画通りどころか、始めから、計画通りにいかないことを前提に、プロトタイプを作ってフィージビリティースタディーする工程を入れるなどを計画に盛り込むなんて、よくある話なのです。
にもかかわらず、コンピュータソフトウェアだけ別物だと考え、安易に計画通りに行くことを前提としてしまうから、話がおかしくなるのです。
企業はどのようにITシステムと向き合うべきなのか？ 新規事業を立ち上げるときに、そのための流通システムや店舗オペレーションやノウハウ蓄積の仕組みや人事評価・報酬システムの設計を、外注する会社は、あまりありません。たとえ、それが、どんなにたくさんの専門知識を必要としようと、自分たちで、全部理解し、自分たちで設計するしかありません。
なぜなら、それは、自社の経営行為そのものであり、それを外注にやってもらうのは、経営行為そのものを外注にやってもらうというような、意味不明の行為だからです。
これと同じように、自社の経営行為そのものである組織ソフトウェアと一体化したITシステムは、本質的に、外注できるようなものではなく、自社のビジネスを深く理解した自社のトップエンジニアと経営者が二人三脚で開発するようなものです。
アマゾン やGoogleやウォルマートが、高給を支払って、最上級レベルのエンジニアを自社で直接雇っているように、それぞれの企業が最上級レベルのエンジニアを直接雇うのが当たり前になる時代が、そのうちやってくるのではないでしょうか。
IT とは、経営行為そのものなのですから。

High School Confidential

My Freshman Year : What a Professor Learned by Becoming a Student
by Rebekah Nathan
Penguin , 208 pp. , $ 14.00 ( paper reprint )
Some of our most formative years are spent in schools , odd places whose ostensible goal is adult - directed education but in reality are controlled by student - culture peer groups of which adults have little actual understanding .
Adults run examinations and programs , try to be “ hip ” to teen culture , but ultimately , we must admit , we have little idea what really goes on , making it easy for rumors to run wild .
Jeremy Iversen and Rebekah Nathan decided to see for themselves what school life was really like , by going undercover and experiencing it themselves .
While they went to different places , in different guises , in entirely different situations ( Iversen was a senior in high school , while Nathan was a freshman in college ) , the pictures they draw are startlingly similar : a world where genuine education is absolutely the last thing on everyone ’s mind .
Jeremy Iversen grew up in New York , attended a prestigious boarding school , and went to college at Stanford .
But , he says , life after school did n’t have the same appeal .
So he decided to go back and get the typical high school education he never had .
The result — High School Confidential — is a gripping memoir of what life is actually like for the cool kids in a southern California high school .
The general outlines are perhaps less than shocking to those who have been paying attention .
High school kids routinely have casual sex with each other , for example .
( “ There ’s nothing else to do in this town , ” one student comments , “ except start drama with everybody . ” )
They take drugs — marijuana , cocaine , ecstasy , speed — right under their parents noses .
( In one scene , Travis , the class ’s drug dealer , and Alexis , his sister , are confronted by their father .
“ I ’m going to give you a drug test , ” he warns them .
“ But I ’ve been clean since nursery ! ” Travis replies .
“ Oh , it ’s only your sister I ’m worried about , ” explains the father . )
The kids cheat , not just by copying on tests , but by taking copious steroids and human growth hormone to compete in sports .
( “ I read an article about high school steroid use in Sports Illustrated ” , comments the team coach , as the kids who are using look away .
“ Good thing that ’s not a problem in our school . ” )
Despite living in a very diverse community , many of the kids are full of casual racism and right - wing politics ( white people need to stand up for their heritage , nuke all the Arabs ) , although they ’re far more liberal in practice ( doing drugs with their Middle Eastern friends ) .
When they get mad at each other , they are n’t afraid to take it out in violent brawls .
And when the school throws parties , everybody gets totally hammered .
( There ’s a brilliant scene where some kids throw up on Richard Nixon ’s grave . )
However , the novel is gripping in its details , with more amusing characters and fascinating stories than any television show imitation of high school life .
The teachers are such characters that were this fiction you might accuse them of being overwritten .
School events are so lavish ( a band performs every day at lunch , large coordinated dance - and - light shows are done for spirit rallies ) that they seem like TV exaggerations .
School assignments are so inane ( cut apart this cat ) that you might think the kid telling you this was exaggerating .
But Iversen was there , the dialogue in the book is copied down verbatim , the description of events was taken first - hand .
1
And , indeed , the most shocking components are not the tales of the kids , but of the schools .
Iversen draws a picture of an institution that is not just failing at learning , but antithetical to it .
Thea , the only girl in the book with any academic passion , is routinely discouraged by the actions of both peers and adults .
But no other student even gets that far .
The school ’s student culture makes caring about class unthinkable ; the school ’s classes make learning near - impossible .
But the grandest component of Iversen ’s tale is how he dismantles our previous methods for trying to understand how schools operate .
First , there is Derrick , the school board ’s secret weapon .
Derrick is an articulate and popular student , admired by all , and elected class president .
But it slowly becomes clear that student government , including him , is nothing but the administration ’s pawn .
The regulations are designed to make genuine complaints impossible to bring before the administration , while the administration uses Derrick at every opportunity as a mouthpiece for their lies about what the children really think .
Thus the only student representative most outside adults see is no representative at all .
Then there are the standards regulations , around which the curriculum is supposedly organized .
The state school accreditation team is coming to verify that it is , and the adults worry that they ’re quite likely to fail .
So the principal goes all - out , bribing , threatening , and faking the school into appearing good .
Any kid who ever caused a problem is locked away in a hidden trailer for the duration of the inspector ’s visit , every class is replaced with fake , scripted , standards - compliant material .
Every child puts on fake happy faces under severe duress .
And the school passes with flying colors .
“ I wish every kid in the state could have an education this good ” , insists the lead inspector .
The reality is that between adult and student , there is a vast gulf in mentality .
Iversen ’s genius is that he can get us inside the heads of both sides .
Around the same time , Rebekah Nathan , an anthropology professor at AnyU ( both psuedonyms ) , was sitting in on some classes herself .
She noticed that simply by acting like a student — sitting in class , taking notes , etc. — her fellow students began treating her like one , sharing gossip and trading facts she never got to see as a professor .
Eager to cross that same mental gulf , she decided to spend her sabbatical the following year doing an undercover anthropological study of her own university .
Nathan enrolled as a freshman , lived in a dorm , and took a full load of courses .
Despite looking like a mom , the other students accepted her as their own .
She probably could n’t get involved in the party scene and did n’t try — she stuck to studying the academic and intellectual side of college life — but pretty much everything she says fits with my impressions as a freshman Stanford student around the same time and I can even confirm a couple of her more surprising specific points .
After confining her focus to the intellectual , Nathan discovers that there simply is n’t much there .
Students have their own culture with regard to class , a language known as “ Undergraduate Cynical ” , where actually caring about the material is deeply frowned upon , and the only questions you ’re permitted to ask of a teacher are about the details of grading and assignments :
A good question , I learned , is one that voices a concern shared by other students or that asks for clarifications of upcoming work .
“ Will there be more questions on the test from the text or the lecture ? ” “ Should the paper be double - or single - spaced ? ” [… ] [ … ]
“ What does that mean ? ” is , incredibly , just not the kind of question that an American college student would ask .
This is n’t just show ; students genuinely are n’t engaged in classes .
They do n’t do the required reading , they dash off assignments , they ditch classes , they cheat on tests .
Some go up and talk to the teacher about things , but they do so with ulterior motives in mind .
Signs and talks geared to incoming students explain that one must “ work the teachers ” by talking to them , getting them to recognize you so they will give you hints about tests and go easy on you when you need exceptions .
“ I take the information I need from the professor ” , one highly - successful student tells Nathan , explaining what that consists of : “ how they ’re going to grade you and what they think is important ” .
Everything is seen as part of the game , not worthwhile for its own sake .
But it ’s all too easy to lament this sad state of student affairs , perhaps complain about the laziness of modern students .
But Nathan goes one step further : she shows why it is happening .
For even she , a professor with a Ph.D , finds herself doing the exact same things .
“ We do n’t need to study those things , they wo n’t be on the test ” , she tells her study partner Rob .
It takes Rob , a fellow student , to ask her whether she just cares about learning for its own sake .
The culture of Undergraduate Cynical , you see , is not created by student laziness or a lack of concern for intellectual life .
It ’s created by the necessities of the schedule .
Students simply do n’t have time to care .
They take three to five classes , each with separate sections and lab assignments , each with its own schedule of papers and readings and adults to suck up to .
That alone is enough to drive Rebekah crazy , despite her thinking she had pretty good time management skills juggling all her commitments as a professor .
But on top of that most students go to activities and clubs , work an on- or off - campus job , party in the evenings , and try to maintain relationships .
When you run the math , there just is n’t enough time to care .
So students instead focus on doing what ’s required of them : just scraping by .
Anything that wo n’t impact their grade much is tossed and a desire to learn becomes a desire to pass .
It ’s hard to imagine any sincere desire to learn surviving such a harried schedule .
As soon as you get engrossed or a book or topic , you have to dash off to your next meeting .
Again , this is all something completely invisible to the professors .
They spend their days worrying about tomorrow ’s lecture and are shocked when students do n’t do the same .
But the students have n’t had time : they ’ve had two more classes and who knows how many assignments in the interim .
And , anyway , they only picked this course because it filled a convenient hole in their schedule , they ’re not even sure what it ’s about .
So the students simply do n’t get engrossed , student discussion groups do n’t actually discuss things , but instead each student simply makes up a point of view and shares it so they do n’t get a zero on their in - class participation grade .
There is no “ meeting of the minds ” on any subject ; there are hardly any minds .
Both books , their research being conducted undercover , will no doubt lead some to raise ethical questions .
Jeremy Iversen had to deceive and mislead his fellow students — including creating a fake backstory — in order to experience life with them .
Rebekah Nathan , while not explicitly lying , led students to believe she was just an older woman going back to school , and certainly not one of their professors .
But deception alone is not an ethical violation .
Psychology studies routinely deceive subjects into thinking the experiment is about X , when actually it is about Y. ( I myself have been so deceived . )
The key difference , and in my opinion the only possible ethical lapse on Iversen and Nathan ’s part , is that after the study is over , the psychologists explain what was really going on .
Neither Nathan nor Iversen told their friends afterwards , leaving them only to discover it after the project had gone public .
( By contrast , Barbara Ehrenreich , in Nickeled and Dimed , her study of low - wage work , told her fellow workers at the end that she was working on a book about the experience .
They were “ remarkably blasé ” about it , she found . )
But more generally , important scientific projects like these might have to step on a few ethical toes .
Some of the greatest experiments in psychology — the Milgram experiments on obedience to authority and Zimbardo ’s Stanford Prison Experiment — were easy fodder for armchair ethicists .
But while people may have their feelings ruffled , in all of these experiments there was little lasting hurt to the participants , while the educational consequences of the studies themselves have been immense .
The real ethical question is how we can justify forcing our children into such institutions of anti-intellectualism .
Iversen found that high school students were quite conservative politically , even more so than their parents , and perhaps it ’s not surprising that Bush ’s anti-intellectual charm appeals to kids who daily experience education as a form of torture .
Perhaps students learn something by going through the necessary motions required to get a degree , but I defy anyone to read both of these accounts and continue to insist that schools are teaching kids to be “ critical thinkers ” with a “ life - long love of learning ” .
If anything , the real education is in the opposite .
Instead of critical thinkers , we have kids willing to accept any requirement , no matter how absurd , without question .
“ If you write what you want to that prof , ” explains a successful senior , “ you ’re gonna end up with a bad grade .
Whereas , if you write to them , you win — you can still have your own mindset and say , hell , I know this is n’t the way I feel , but I ’ll give them what they want . ”
But , as experiments in cognitive dissonance have shown us , if one continues saying what one does n’t feel , one begins feeling it before too long .
It ’s easy to see how this is effective training for professionalism , which actually means doing what you ’re told , despite what you believe .
But it ’s hard to see how this system is going to generate students who will buck a trend .
Instead of life - long learners , we have kids who learn that genuine learning is a joke .
“ Education ” becomes that stupid thing in classrooms that you have to do to get a decent job , an entirely mercenary perspective that ’s unhelpfully encouraged by the mercenary pressures of student loans .
If the only education you ’ve ever experienced is doing what ’s necessary to get a good grade , why would you do it when the grades were n’t around ?
Our public high schools were supposed to make every child a good citizen of the democracy .
Our great universities were supposed to show young people our grandest achievements .
One could say that these institutions are failing at their jobs , but it might be more accurate to say that they ’re being all too successful .

Some Reflections on What , if Anything , “ Are We Safer ? ” Might Mean
With the fifth anniversary of 9/11 , a central question repeatedly asked is whether that country has become safer from international terrorism or not .
I have never quite understood precisely what this question means , but let me explore six possibilities .
1 . Is the likelihood that an individual American will be killed by international terrorists higher or lower than before 9/11 ?
This is a tricky concept to deal with because the number of Americans killed within the United States by international terrorists in the five years since 9/11 is the same as the number killed in the five years before : zero .
Although polls continue to show Americans notably concerned that they or members of their families might die at the hands of terrorists , astronomer Alan Harris has calculated that , at present rates and including the disaster of 9/11 in the consideration , the chances any individual resident of the globe will be killed by an international terrorist over the course of an 80 - year lifetime is about 1 in 80,000 , about the same likelihood of being killed over the same interval from the impact on the Earth of an especially ill - directed asteroid or comet .
At present , Americans are vastly more likely to die from bee stings , lightning , or accident - causing deer than by terrorism within the country .
That seems pretty safe .
2. Are Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda types more or less capable of inflicting damage on the United States ?
International terrorists would have to increase their capabilities considerably to change such astoundingly low probabilities .
Even if they were able to pull off “ another 9/11 ″ every three months for the next five years , the chance an individual American would be killed in one of them would still be two one - hundredths of one percent .
Although there is concern that they will become vastly more dangerous by obtaining and setting off nuclear weapons or something like that , they do not seem to have become more capable generally since 9/11 .
The number of Americans who have been killed worldwide by Al Qaeda or Al Qaeda types has increased considerably since 9/11 , but this is almost entirely because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — and the “ are we safer ” question is focused on the dangers to Americans at home , not abroad .
Outside these war arenas , the number of people worldwide ( few of them American ) who have been killed by such terrorists may have gone up a bit since 9/11 , but in five years the number killed in explosions set off by Al Qaeda or Al Qaeda types stands at 900 or so — notably smaller than the number who have drown in bathtubs ( 300 - 400 per year , or over 1,500 ) in the United States alone during the same period .
Moreover , whatever they may be doing overseas , they do n’t seem to be here : a secret FBI report in 2005 reported that after more than three years of intense and well - funded hunting , the agency had been unable to identify a single true Al Qaeda sleeper cell anywhere in the country — rather impressive given the 2002 intelligence estimate that there were up to 5000 people loose in the country who were “ connected ” to Al Qaeda . [ 1 ]
Some attribute this to luck , good protection , the distractions of the war in Iraq , patience in planning additional attacks , or the breaking up of the Afghan training camps , but , as I have argued elsewhere , the evidence could be taken to indicate either that they are n’t trying very hard or that they are far less dedicated , diabolical , and competent than the common image would suggest .
The recent alleged bombing plot in London does n’t so far suggest much in the way of enhanced terrorist capacities ( and , of course , those guys were over there , not over here ) .
The author of the dramatic claim that the plotters were envisioning “ mass murder on an unimaginable scale ” said when pressed that he meant “ on a scale never before witnessed in Britain , ” rather deflating the import of the initial widely - quoted assertion .
And security expert Bruce Schneier has noted that chemists have been debunking the likely effectiveness of the scheme and that the plot was hardly imminent : none of the conspirators had bought airline tickets while some did n’t even have passports .
3 . Are there more people out there who hate the United States ?
Polls around the world strongly suggest the answer to this is a decided “ yes . ”
The post -9/11 events that seem to have inspired this change are the American attack upon ( and , increasingly it seems , debacle in ) Iraq and now the destruction inflicted on Lebanon by U.S. - supported Israel .
However , the United States was far from beloved in the most relevant area , the Middle East , before 9/11 either , and hatred for American Middle East policy is what principally drove the attacks .
It was in the mid-1990s when America ’s UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright was asked on television ’s “ 60 Minutes ” whether she thought the sanctions - induced deaths of perhaps half a million Iraqi children was “ worth it . ”
Without taking issue with the death toll estimate , she replied , “ I think this is a very hard choice , but the price–we think the price is worth it . ” [ 2 ]
Although this remarkable acknowledgement amazingly provoked no comment at the time in the United States , it quickly became famous in the Arab world .
4 . Do the haters see more or less value in striking the United States ?
In his excellent book , The Far Enemy , Fawaz Gerges argues that mainstream Islamists –the vast majority within the Islamist political movement –have given up on the use of force except perhaps against Israel , and that the remaining jihadis who are still willing to apply violence constituted a tiny minority before 9/11 .
But he goes on to note that the vast majority even of this small group primarily focuses on various “ infidel ” Muslim regimes and consider those among them who carry out violence against the “ far enemy ” –mainly Europe and the United States–to be irresponsible and reckless adventurers who endanger the survival of the whole movement .
From this perspective , suggests Gerges , the 9/11 attacks proved to be substantially counterproductive by massively heightening concerns about terrorism around the world .
The key result among jihadis and religious nationalists was a vehement rejection of Al Qaeda ’s strategy and methods , particularly after reactions to the 9/11 attacks and subsequent terrorism in Muslim countries brought suppression of the movement .
Thus a reasonable conclusion is that , while we are less safe in that more people around the world hate the United States ( or least its foreign policy ) than did so before 9/11 ( or , actually , before the U.S. invasion of Iraq ) , we are more safe in that even fewer people than before 9/11 think striking the U.S. directly makes much sense .
5 . Are we more or less vulnerable to attack ?
Compared to what ?
( as Henny Youngman replied when asked , “ How ’s your wife ? ” )
Being invulnerable ?
All societies all the time are “ vulnerable ” to tiny bands of suicidal fanatics in the sense that it is impossible to prevent every terrorist act .
There is no way to make everything completely safe from that any more than every store can be protected against shoplifting or every street can be made permanently free of muggers .
This fundamental condition has hardly altered since 9/11 — and essentially it cannot substantially be altered .
Nor is it new or dependent on modern technology .
As a friend of mine has pointed out , 19 dedicated , suicidal , and lucky terrorists could probably have scuttled the Titanic , drowning all aboard .
After 9/11 Homeland Security officials set out at Congressional urging to tally up a list of potential targets in the United States .
By 2004 , they had enumerated 33,000 , to the apparent dismay of Homeland Security czar Ridge .
Dismay was premature : within a year , the list had been expanded to 80,000 .
Although the list has remained secret–we would n’t want to put ideas into the head of your average diabolical terrorist , after all , as they argue over whether target 52,789 is more or less attractive than target 21,347 .
However , there have been a number of leaks indicating that miniature golf courses have been included on this exquisite exercise in self - parody , as well as Weeki Wachee Springs , a roadside waterpark in Florida notable for its mermaids .
“ Homeland security cannot be had on the cheap , ” proclaims Senator Joseph Lieberman .
The problem is that it can not be had on the expensive either .
It is possible to make any individual target — like the Washington Monument–more secure from terrorism .
But , unless funds are infinite , society can’t defend against every possibility — or even against a large number of them .
To be blunt ( and obvious ) , it is simply not possible to protect every bus , every shop , every factory , every tunnel , every bridge , every road , every mall , every place of assembly , every mile of railroad track .
Some relevant statistics : in the United States there are 87,000 food - processing plants , 500 urban transportation systems , 80,000 dams , 66,000 chemical plants , 590,000 highway bridges , 5,000 airports , 12,800 power plants , 2 million miles of pipelines , and 2 billion miles of cable , not to mention some 13,000 McDonald ’s ( at this writing ) .
Meanwhile , the Post Office handles nearly 200 billion pieces of mail each year .
Nor is it possible to secure every border or have perfect , or for that matter , semi-perfect , port security — a particular vulnerability , among billions , that has attracted the focused attention of many worriers , if not so far of any actual terrorists .
The United States can import over a billion dollars ’ worth of shoes in a single month , notes Schneier–is each shoe box to be inspected ?
Moreover , if one tempting target becomes less vulnerable , your inventive terrorist could simply move on to others .
Thus , if airplanes have become more difficult to hijack and fly into targets ( not so much because of enhanced security measures but because , as demonstrated in the fourth plane on 9/11 , passengers and crew will now fight ) , there are still plenty of trains and buses out there .
If the Washington Monument seems to have become a difficult target after years of expensive renovation , the agile terrorist might be led to cast an eye about for other notable tall , pointy objects — the Seattle Space Needle , for example .
A displacement effect might even increase casualties : the destruction of the Washington Monument might be more embarrassing than that of the Space Needle , but it would probably cost fewer lives .
To simplify things , it might seem to make more sense to come up with a list of things that are n’t prospective targets .
A tree in the middle of a forest might seem a likely prospect for this list .
But what about forest fires ?
Five skilled terrorists , each armed with a match , could set off five of those simultaneously .
They would be aided in their efforts by the park service ’s propensity prominently to publicize which forests at any given moment are the driest and most tinderbox - like .
Maybe in our determined quest to inconvenience terrorists we ’d need to classify that information , hoping that campfire builders as well as smoking backpackers and motorists ( but not your wandering malevolent terrorist ) would have enough sense to be able to tell whether they are venturing through forested areas that are dry or not .
Since international terrorists active in the United States — thus far at least — have eschewed trees to concentrate on buildings in major cities , many think it reasonable to suggest that protective efforts should disproportionately focus on major cities .
Thoughtful and presumably well - paid planners had by 2003 come up with a terrorist hitlist of seven : New York , Washington , Chicago , San Francisco , Seattle , Houston , and Los Angeles .
This exercise in metropolitan chauvinism , however , proved to be notably unpopular in places like , for example , Columbus , Ohio–not to mention Oklahoma City , kept off the list presumably because , although it suffered far more deaths from terrorism than all but two of the cities on the list , it had been the target merely of a domestic terrorist .
Accordingly , the list was quickly expanded to 30 and , by 2005 , to 73 ( including Oklahoma City ) .
It is not at all clear how one can even begin to “ protect ” large ( or even not - so - large ) cities against random acts of terror that can be carried out by a single individual with a bomb in a backpack .
Moreover , it is entirely possible that international terrorists might one day come to realize there is more payoff for them in hitting more ordinary and typical targets because that would scare more people .
Of particular appeal to terrorists , perhaps , would be towns that tend to be synonymous with ordinary America , in part because they have peculiar or amusing names , like Peoria , Illinois , Sheboygan , Wisconsin , Pocatello , Idaho , Azusa , California , or Xenia , Ohio .
After all , if a bomb goes off in one of those , it can go off anywhere .
Actually , although the big-city premise holds thus far for the United States , terrorists overseas , even since 9/11 , have often targeted tourist areas that are not in major cities , particularly hotels , in the case of Egypt , and a nightclub , as in the case of Bali .
Massive efforts to screen communications are also likely to prove to be wasteful exercises .
Some people have characterized the process as trying to find a needle in a haystack by adding more hay .
The effort principally leads to the accumulation of monumental amounts of data , and it creates an impossible number of false positives .
Not only does this effort cost a large amount of money ( no one yet seems to have tallied up how much ) , but it has not led to the detection of many–or maybe even of any–real terrorists in the United States .
Moreover , notes security expert Schneier , gathering massive surveillance banks of such data not only constitutes an invasion of privacy , but the databases themselves become hugely attractive targets for criminals and identity thieves .
The process is also expensive and disruptive .
In what can only be called an act of highest heroism , American Enterprise Institute analyst Veronique de Rugy has actually tried to figure out the budget of the Department of Homeland Security .
She comes up with an extensive list of highly questionable expenditures .
One that might be added stems from the way the Pentagon has extrapolated extravagantly from 9/11 to conclude grandly that “ it is unsafe to have employees in urban office buildings , ” and is in the process of moving tens of thousands of people in its more obscure agencies out of the area with little consideration about how they will manage to get to work on highways that are already congested .
It would seem to make more sense to substantially abandon the quixotic policy of seeking to make everything ( or even a lot of stuff ) safe , and then use the money saved to repair any terrorist damage and to compensate any victims .
6 . Are we more or less likely to commit suicide if attacked ?
In 2003 , while Homeland Security czar Tom Ridge bravely declared that “ America is a country that will not be bent by terror ” or “ broken by fear , ” General Richard Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was ominously suggesting that if terrorists were able to engineer an event that managed to escalate 9/11′s damage by killing 10,000 Americans , they would successfully “ do away with our way of life . ” [ 3 ]
The sudden deaths of that many Americans –although representing less than four thousandths of one percent of the population –would indeed be horrifying and tragic , the greatest one - day disaster the country has suffered since the Civil War .
But the only way terrorist acts could conceivably “ do away with our way of life ” would be if , bent and broken , we did it to ourselves in reaction .
The process would presumably involve repealing the Bill of Rights , boarding up churches , closing down newspapers and media outlets , burning books , abandoning English for ( North ) Korean , and refusing evermore to consume hamburgers .
After predicting with great assurance that there would be terrorist events in connection with the 2004 elections , alarmist Michael Ignatieff of Harvard insists with equal certainty in his book , The Lesser Evil , that “ inexorably , terrorism , like war itself , is moving beyond the conventional to the apocalyptic . ”
Unlike Myers , he goes on patiently to explain how the United States has become more likely to kill itself in response to a terrorist attack .
Although Americans did graciously allow their leaders one fatal mistake in September 2001 , they simply “ will not forgive another one . ”
If there are several large - scale attacks , he confidently predicts , the trust that binds the people to its leadership and to each other will crumble , and the “ cowed populace ” will demand that tyranny be imposed upon it , and quite possibly break itself into a collection of rampaging lynch mobs devoted to killing “ former neighbors ” and “ onetime friends . ”
The solution , he thinks , is to crimp civil liberties now in a desperate effort to prevent the attacks he is so confident will necessarily impel us to commit societal , cultural , economic , and political self - immolation .
I find these dire scenarios implausible .
The United States is unlikely to be toppled by dramatic acts of terrorist destruction , even extreme ones .
As it happens , officials estimated for a while last year that Hurricane Katrina had inflicted 10,000 deaths –the tolerance level set by General Myers .
Although this , of course , was not a terrorist act , there were no indications whatsoever that , while catastrophic for the hurricane victims themselves , the way of life of the rest of the nation would be notably done away with by such a disaster .
It is also easy to imagine scenarios in which 10,000 would have been killed on September 11 – if the planes had hit the World Trade Center later in the day when more people were at work for example–and indeed , early estimates at the time were much higher than 3,000 .
Any death is tragic , but it is hardly likely that a substantially higher loss on 9/11 would have necessarily have triggered societal suicide .
We already absorb a great deal of tragedy and unpleasantness and still manage to survive .
We live with a considerable quantity of crime , and the United States regularly loses 40,000 lives each year in automobile accidents .
Moreover , countries have endured massive , sudden catastrophes without collapsing .
In 1990 and then again in 2003 , Iran suffered earthquakes that nearly instantly killed some 35,000 in each case .
The tsunami that hit Indonesia and elsewhere in 2004 killed several times that many .
But the countries have clearly survived these disasters : they constitute major tragedies , of course , but they hardly proved to be “ existential ” ones .
Thus the country can readily absorb considerable damage if necessary , and it has outlasted far more potent threats in the past .
To suggest otherwise is to express contempt for America ’s capacity to deal with adversity .
However , although the alarmists may exaggerate , a proclivity that is by nature ( and definition ) central to their basic makeup , the subtext of their message should perhaps be taken seriously : ultimately , the enemy , in fact , is us .
Thus far at least , terrorism is a rather rare and , appropriately considered , not generally a terribly destructive phenomenon .
But there is a danger that hysteria over it could become at least somewhat self - fulfilling should extensive further terrorism be visited upon the Home of the Brave .
A key element in a policy toward terrorism , therefore , should be to control , to deal with , or at least productively to worry about the fear and overreaction that terrorism so routinely inspires and that generally constitutes its most damaging effect .

Notes from the curator : August 25 , 2000 - Over 10 new " exhibits " just added !
That makes 60 + exhibits added since July 28 !
I 'm sheepishly pleased to report that the donation backlog is down to 14 months , and I 'm continuing to work through it .
The rest of this message is essentially unchanged from July 28 .
Welcome eTour and Swedish visitors !
I 've noticed a lot of folks visiting via the eTour site and also by following a link on this Swedish site .
I get a lot of e-mail from people suggesting that I add a section for misused apostrophes .
Sorry , folks , but it 's not going to happen .
First of all , the reason I started this site almost four years ago was because I was at once amused and mystified by the peculiar usage of quotation marks .
Misused apostrophes usually are n't that funny ; they 're just annoying .
Even if I wanted to do such a site , I just do n't have the time ( especially since apostrophe misuse is much more widespread , I think , than misused quotation marks ) .
A friend of mine has been thinking of doing a misused apostrophe site , so if he ever does I 'll let you know .
In the meantime , you may want to take a look at The Home For Abused Apostrophes -- not a lot there , but high quality choices .
Now , enough " ranting " -- on to the latest additions ...

I saw this bizzare sign at the watch repair center of a local department store :
Orders ready
in SEVEN " 7 "
-- days .
As if misused quotes were n't bad enough , they had to write the seven twice and add the dash for no apprarent reason !!
A day here , a day there , before you know it a " week " has gone by .

Seen on a van this morning :
Casa Bonita .

But maybe not .

An ad for a Disney movie screening and stage show at the El Capitan Theater in Hollywood mentioned that the show would feature :
the " mighty " Wurlitzer pipe organ
Is it me , or do those quotes around " mighty " serve to unwittingly malign the status and performance of their own vintage organ ?
Thank you , Disney .
Perhaps old Walt himself once described that organ as " mighty " and since then they 've always had to refer to it that way .

I was driving in northern Minnesota when I saw a billboard for a car dealership that claimed it had been around :

At Baylor University , home of the Baylor Bears and one or two Branch Davidians , I found a throw rug that alerted people to the following :
" You 're in " Bear Country
It baffles me to this day .
Is it an obscure form of second person , like the vosotros tense ?
A pun on " urine " perhaps ?
As my degree from Baylor is a guaranteed ticket into heaven , I 'll ask the Big Guy when I get there , and try to report back .
I think you mean " report " back .

The NJ Transit employee cafeteria once featured a hand made sign on an ice machine that read :
Please do n't take large buckets of " ice " from this machine .
Go to the other machine in the back .

Or could it have been shards of " glass " ?
I do n't know , but if I were you I 'd just go straight to the other machine in the back whenever I needed any ice .

A sign at the swimming pool at Reed College in Portland , OR asks you to :

The menu from The Tavern restaurant in Charlottesville , Virginia , informs patrons that :
All pancakes are served with " whipped " butter .
Elsewhere in the menu the substance is identified variously as " whipped butter " or , more confusingly , " whipped " " butter " .

My company sent this email :
Last night we were announced as " The Winner " of the 1999 Champions Program sponsored by the local Women 's Political Caucus .
The award 's purpose is " Honoring Workplaces that Work for Women . " Big thanks go to ABC department director , who did " all the work " and her staff .
True email , all I changed was the name of the department to protect the " innocent . "
I 'm sure some of the more fastidious Gallery visitors were getting ready to e-mail me to point out that quoting " The Winner " and " Honoring Workplaces That Work for Women " is acceptable .
That may be true , but it 's the last sentence that warrants this exhibit 's inclusion here .
I wonder what the director did while the staff was really doing all the work ?

Here 's one that got my stomach churning .
Seen in a local grocery flyer in Charlotte , NC , the bold proclamation :

But not only is the meat not fresh , you 're not even saving big .

There was an art supply store near my house that had a sign on the door that read :

Just about the only saving grace of the onslaught of spam is the frequent misuse of quotation marks found in the messages , although given the choice I 'd gladly forego the junk e-mail since there is no shortage of misused quotation marks in the wild .
Here 's an example from a spam message I received :
" Melissa Stone . "
Master Psychic Reader and Advisor
. . .
Ask about love , wealth , career , fame , or other subjects that interest you .
Melissa Stone " WILL " reveal all !
Let 's see , so her name 's not really Melissa Stone and she can't predict the future .

A brochure for an Estee Lauder self tanning product claims that :
in about an hour , your skin will turn a natural , healthy looking " tan . "
I think the quotes are more for legal reasons than because of a mistake on anyone 's part .
Besides , " a natural , healthy looking ' orange ' " just does n't have the same ring to it .

A hand - lettered sign in the window of The Hofbrau on Telegraph Avenue in Oakland , CA advertises :
" pork " burritos .
I 'm also interested in the idea that a hofbrau can serve Cali - Mex food - maybe they should call it a " hofbrau . "
The least they could do is call them " Schweinefleisch " burritos .

On the cover of the folder in which the schedules are kept at work , one of the managers wrote :

If any of you are not already on the list and would like to be protected from the " flu " this year , please " sign up . "
I could n't help but wonder what the shot was really for , and how to get it .
I 'd be even more nervous if it said the injection would be administered to your " arm . "

We 're not sure what 's really " cookin ' " back there , but we 're always certain to skip the " special sauce " .
Good idea , especially when it comes to those " Ho- Baked Rolls . "

I 'm a programmer researching some issues .
This was in my inbox :
The RMA issue may be explainable but we do need someone to check and " explain " why .
I guess I wo n't have to do any " research " to answer ...
Nope , all you need is a " shovel ! "
IF YOU'RE in the market for a new desktop PC , we suggest that you keep your wallet in your pocket for just a few weeks more .
The reason ?
Intel has just released a new breed of superchip , christened Core 2 Duo , which leaves even the mightiest Pentium processors eating its digital dust .
And despite taking a razor to the wholesale price of the former king of the CPU jungle , the new Core 2 Duo line remains relatively closely priced to the Pentium series while blazing past it in every stopwatch test .
So if you 've got your eye on a new PC , cool your heels and keep saving .
By the middle of next month you 'll be able to buy a Core 2 Duo machine for not much more than today 's Pentium - based desktops .
If money is really tight , you can shop around for a Pentium system for much less than today 's asking price .
Mit einem eindringlichen Appell zur Gewährleistung von Anonymität im Internet ging die Abschlussveranstaltung des staatlich geförderten AN.ON - Forschungsprojekts am Freitagnachmittag im Bundeswirtschaftsministerium in Berlin zu Ende .
" Wir brauchen überwachungsfreie Räume für unsere menschliche Entwicklung " , betonte Andreas Pfitzmann , Informatikprofessor an der TU Dresden , die den Anonymisierungsdienst federführend mit der Uni Regenburg und dem Unabhängigen Landeszentrum für Datenschutz Schleswig - Holstein ( ULD ) entwickelt hat .
Dies gelte auch für das Internet .
Den Cyberspace bezeichnete Pfitzmann nicht nur als Fortsetzung der physischen Realität , sondern auch " unseres Denkens " .
Insofern gehe es im Streit um die spurenlose Fortbewegung im Netz auch darum , " wie viel Gedankenfreiheit im Internet es noch geben soll " .
Vollständig geschützte Freiräume bringen der Gesellschaft dem Informatiker zufolge im Schnitt sogar einen Sicherheitsgewinn , da dort offen auch über Bedrohungen debattiert und kommunikativ nach Lösungen gesucht werden könne .
Doch die Aussichten für entsprechende Dienste sind hierzulande nicht rosig .
Staatsanwaltschaften und Politiker sind laut Pfitzmann momentan dabei , die Betreiber von AN.ON - Servern mit der Vorratsdatenspeicherung und der jüngsten , auch gegen den Anonymisierungsdienst
Tor gerichteten Beschlagnahmungswelle ins Ausland zu jagen .
Der Strafverfolgung würde das alles andere als helfen .
Gleichzeitig erscheinen Anonymisierungsserver auch immer mehr Providern hierzulande als rotes Tuch .
Sie müssten schließlich damit rechnen , " dass diese einkassiert werden " , erläuterte Hannah Seiffert vom Verband der deutschen Internetwirtschaft eco die Zurückhaltung der Branche auch bei eigenen kommerziellen Anonymisierungsangeboten .
Ärger und zusätzliche Kosten wären dabei vorprogrammiert .
Allein " Outsorcing " könne in diesem Fall ein Geschäftsmodell darstellen .
Marit Hansen vom ULD beklagte eine mangelnde Kooperationsbereitschaft der Strafverfolgungsbehörden .
Zum Fall des im eigenen
Hause vor über zwei Monaten beschlagnahmten Server wären über das Aktenzeichen hinaus noch keine Informationen über den Vorgang zu bekommen gewesen .
Die Rechtsunsicherheit sei insgesamt groß und es mangele an eingespielten Regeln bei den Staatsanwaltschaften .
Dies bestätigte Hannes Federrath , Informatikprofessor an der Uni Regensburg .
Dort sei die Polizei mit einem Beschlagnahmeschreiben ohne Datum und Richterunterschrift aufgekreuzt .
Da der Rechenzentrumsleiter aber früher Kriminalpolizeibeamter gewesen sei , habe er den ungültigen Beschluss zurückgewiesen .
Probleme hat auch der Chaos Computer Club ( CCC ) mit dem Weiterbetrieb seines AN.ON - Servers : Sein Provider Strato will diesen aufgrund geänderter Geschäftsbedingungen kündigen , wonach eine kostenlose Überlassung von Diensten gerade an anonyme Dritte nicht mehr zugelassen werden soll .
Der CCC geht davon aus , dass Strato angesichts dieser Formulierung im Prinzip dicht machen könnte .
[ Update : Laut CCC haben sich die Hacker inzwischen mit dem Provider geeinigt , der Server läuft wieder . ]
Mit Thilo Weichert sprach sich auch der ULD - Leiter dafür aus , nicht alle Möglichkeiten zur Strafverfolgung aus der physischen
Welt in den virtuellen Raum zu übertragen .
Übers Internet würden zwar viele " Vorfeldstraftaten " wie Androhungen oder Beleidigungen ermöglicht .
Dies seien aber " Meinungsäußerungsdelikte " , die niemand richtig weh tun würden .
Die eigentlichen Verbrechen fänden nach wie vor in der " realen Welt " statt , sodass sich dort auch Anhaltspunkte zu ihrer Bekämpfung und Verfolgung finden lassen würden .
Weil man anonyme Briefe verschicken könne , habe auch noch niemand eine zwangsweise Identifizierung am Briefkasten gefordert , sekundierte Sven Mörs vom Berliner Datenschutzbeauftragten .
Bisher sei die Strafverfolgung immer durch das technisch Mögliche bestimmt worden .
Angesichts einer sehr einfachen Verfolgbarkeit von Nutzern im Netz bis hin zur Rundumüberwachung elektronischer Spuren dürfe dieses Prinzip aber nicht automatisch auf die digitalen Technologien übertragen werden .
" Ist das Ziel des Verbrechens im Cyberspace , dann ist das Mittel der Wahl bei der Strafverfolgung : bessere IT - Systeme " , plädierte Pfitzmann in diesem Sinne für eine Verhinderung von Cyberdelikten durch mehr Sicherheit im Netz .
Wenn das Internet aber " nur Transit für Verbrechen ist , gibt es Ermittlungsmöglichkeiten außerhalb " , welche primär zu nutzen seien .
Thomas Königshofen , bei der Deutschen Telekom für Belange der Sicherheitsbehörden zuständig und damit Wächter über " massenhafte Bombendrohungen " , vermisste in solchen Äußerungen den " pragmatischen Ansatz " .
Einen Raum zu schaffen , " wo sich im Prinzip die Straftäter tummeln können " , sei " nicht zielführend " .
Es müsse Möglichkeiten geben , die Anonymität aufzuheben .
Konkret zur Zukunft von AN.ON erklärte Pfitzmann gegenüber heise online , dass auch nach dem Auslauf der Förderung Ende des Jahres die angeschlossenen Universitäten und das ULD die Mix -Server weiter laufen lassen wollten .
Die Datenschützer in Kiel würden auch noch in Rechtsfragen rund um den Dienst zur Verfügung stehen .
Generell formulierte er als Schwerpunkte für die Forschung rund um die Anonymisierung digitaler Techniken Ziele wie Bewegungsprofile im Mobilfunk zu verhindern sowie Dienste für VoIP und " irgendwann einmal Video " zu entwickeln .
Den Strafverfolgern gab er zu bedenken , dass es bereits heute viel schlechter zu überwachende Anonymisierungsformen über das so genannte verteilte Senden gebe und diese künftig verstärkt weiter perfektioniert würden .
Angesichts einer schier unendlichen Zahl von " Zwischenknoten " in der anonymisierten Kommunikationskette komme man dort " mit gerichtlichen Beschlüssen überhaupt nicht mehr ran . "

Impure Mathematics : The Adventures of Polly Nomial
On 23 May 2009 I received the following email , from William Boulanger , Adjunct Professor Chemistry , UIUC , which provides further background :
This is a classic .
It has been published in The Best of The Journal of Irreproducible Results , where it is described as " submitted by Richard A. Gibbs " , with no claim to authorship .
On p.iv it states : " Most of the articles compiled in The Best of The Journal of Irreproducible Results have appeared in the Journal between the years of 1955 and 1983 .
Those that have not yet appeared are scheduled for forthcoming issues . "
Unfortunately , the book gives no further bibliographic details .
Impure Mathematics
In George H. Scherr , ed. The Best of The Journal of Irreproducible Results , p.147 .
Workman Publishing , 1983
Once upon a time ( 1/t ) , pretty little Polly Nomial was strolling across a field of vectors when she came to the edge of a singularly large matrix .
Now Polly was convergent and her mother had made it an absolute condition that she must never enter such an array without her brackets on .
Polly , however , who had changed her variables that morning and was feeling particularly badly behaved , ignored this condition on the grounds that it was insufficient and made her way in amongst the complex elements .
Rows and columns enveloped her on all sides .
Tangents approached her surface .
She became tensor and tensor .
Quite suddenly , three branches of a hyperbola touched her at a single point .
She oscillated violently , lost all sense of directrix and went completely divergent .
As she reached a turning point she tripped over a square root which was protruding from the erf and plunged headlong down a steep gradient .
When she was differentiated once more she found herself , apparently alone , in a non-euclidean space .
She was being watched , however .
That smooth operator , Curly Pi , was lurking inner product .
As his eyes devoured her curvilinear coordinates , a singular expression crossed his face .
Was she still convergent , he wondered .
He decided to integrate improperly at once .
Hearing a vulgar function behind her , Polly turned round and saw Curly Pi approaching with his power series extrapolated .
She could see at once , by his degenerate conic and his dissipative terms , that he was bent on no good .
" Eureka " she gasped .
" Ho , ho , " he said .
" What a symmetric little Polynomial you are .
I can see you 're bubbling over with secs " .
" O Sir , " she protested , " keep away from me .
I have n't got my brackets on . "
" Calm yourself , my dear , " said our suave operator , " your fears are purely imaginary "
" i , i , " she thought , " perhaps he 's homogenous then ? " .
" What order are you , " the brute demanded .
" Seventeen , " replied Polly .
Curly leered .
" I suppose you 've never been operated on yet ? " he asked .
" Of course not " , Polly cried indignantly .
" I 'm absolutely convergent . "
" Come , come , " said Curly .
" Let 's off to a decimal place I know and I 'll take you to the limit . "
" Never , " gasped Polly .
" Exchlf , " he swore , using the vilest oath he knew .
His patience was gone .
Coshing her over the coefficient with a log until she was powerless , Curly removed her discontinuities .
He stared at her significant places and began to smooth her points of inflexion .
Poor Polly .
All was up .
She felt his hand tending to her asymptotic limit .
Her convergence would soon be gone forever .
There was no mercy , for Curly was a heavyside operator .
He integrated by parts .
He integrated by partial fractions .
The complex beast even went all the way around and did a contour integration .
What an indignity .
To be multiply connected on her first integration .
Curly went on operating until he was absolutely and completely orthogonal .
When Polly got home that evening , her mother noticed that she had been truncated in several places .
But it was too late to differentiate now .
As the months went by , Polly increased monotonically .
Finally she generated a small but pathological function which left surds all over the place until she was driven to distraction .
The moral of this sad story is this :
If you want to keep your expressions convergent , never allow them a single degree of freedom .
I 'm currently available for hire , to help you plan , architect , and build new systems , and for technical writing and articles .
You can take a look at some projects I 've worked on and some of my writing .
If you 'd like to talk about your upcoming project , do get in touch .

Duke Nukem Forever was a computer game that had been under development by 3D Realms since its announcement on April 28th , 1997 , originally slated to use the ( then ) state of the art Quake II 3D engine .
A few months later , screen shots were published in PC Gamer magazine , along with an intended release date of mid-1998 .
Excitement grew in May of 1998 when a few short video clips of Duke Nukem Forever were shown at E3 ...
Surely a final release of the game was right around the corner !
Just about when mid-1998 arrived ( June , specifically ) 3D Realms announced they were changing 3D engines to Epic 's Unreal engine .
George Broussard , the producer and co-creator of the Duke Nukem series insisted that this change would not cause any significant delay , despite all logic pointing to the contrary .
Also at this point , Broussard assured everyone Duke Nukem Forever would see a 1999 release .
1999 came and went , Duke Nukem Forever saw another engine change , this time to an updated version of the same Unreal engine they were working on .
3D Realms even released a Duke Nukem Christmas card , insinuating a 2000 release .
Not surprisingly , the year 2000 came and went without Duke Nukem Forever .
Another Christmas card was released , this time hinting at a 2001 release .
In the summer of 2001 , 3D Realms released the most substantial proof to date that Duke Nukem Forever has ever existed in any form - a two and a half minute game play trailer :
In 2002 , 3D Realms hired new programmers , and decided instead of switching to another 3D engine , they would just develop their own , making this the fourth engine change since the initial announcement of the game .
Broussard eventually came out to say that at this point , " 95 % " of the already designed levels had been scraped , and had they remained on track they would have been " two years " off from releasing Duke Nukem Forever under the Unreal engine .
In early 2003 , the CEO of Take Two , 3D Realms ' publisher announced Duke Nukem Forever would be released by the end of the year .
This eventually changed to " by the end of 2004 " and then " in the beginning of 2005 . "
In September of 2004 , GameSpot.com revealed a rumor that Duke Nukem Forever had made its fifth 3D engine change , this time using the Quake III engine .
Broussard denied the rumor , but announced only a few days later that they had switched to a different physics engine for the game .
Duke Nukem
Forever news in the years to follow was limited to rumblings on forums and mostly consisted of drama between 3D Realms and Take Two which was n't very interesting .
During this time , the only thing we 've even saw that provided any proof that anything was even happening with Duke Nukem Forever is a small ( and I mean SMALL ) 200x125 image of a supposed screen shot which was posted on several 3D Realms job postings online .
A Duke Nukem Forever teaser was released on the 19th of December , 2007 .
Along with it came the normal " blah blah blah , when it 's done " we 've heard before .
( If the video does n't show up , disable ad blockers . )
On June 5th , 2008 ShackNews posted a story entitled " New Duke Nukem Forever Footage Released " regarding a short interview of George Broussard and Scott Miller on The Jace Hall Show .
During the interview , Jace asks them what has been taking them so long .
Broussard replies , " There 's been a lot of mistakes and a lot of lessons we had to learn , most of all a lot of World of Warcraft . "
A remark intended as a tongue in cheek joke I 'm sure , but probably not far from the truth .
( Interview starts at 2:30 , gameplay footage starts at 4:15 . )
Click here if the embedded video does n't work .
At the end of the segment Jace says , " You 're going to be pleased . "
Honestly , I think everyone wanted to believe this .
The footage looked cool , although nowhere near as revolutionary as the 2001 trailer , given the state of the first person shooter genre at the time ... but never the less , it looked close to being finished .
All was quiet on the Duke Nukem Forever news ticker until May 6th , 2009 .
Almost a year following Jace 's hands - on look at the game , ShackNews announced the death of 3D Realms .
Originally tipped off by a " very reliable source " , ShackNews broke the story of funding issues as phone calls and emails to veterans of 3D Realms went unanswered .
A 3D Realms spokesperson even declined to comment .
Later updates provided some insight to the closure , revealing that Take - Two was not funding the development of Duke Nukem Forever and the closure of 3D Realms was not affecting the development of the handheld Duke Nukem Trilogy .
So there you have it folks , show 's over after 12 years and 9 days , less time than it took Barack Obama to go from his first election as an Illinois Senator to becoming President of the United States ...
And all we have to show for it are a few videos and screen shots .
This whole meltdown of 3D Realms is providing some excellent insight on why things were taking so long , like this forum post allegedly from an ex-3D Realms employee .
( And please keep in mind I have no idea how true this is , but it makes sense .
If someone from 3D Realms wants to drop me an email and set the record straight I 'd be more than happy to add whatever you have to say . )
" The 2001 trailer was 100 % scripted cinematic , and not actual gameplay .
They built specific demo maps just to record video from to make a trailer .
Everything you see in that trailer was phony .
The typical work flow there went something like this :
Designer would be assigned a task ( build a new map , rebuild an old map , polish a bit of a map , etc. ) .
Designer would work on said task for two , three weeks , a month , all the while lower management would be looking over it and making sure it was going in a " good general direction . "
Designer would move on to another task .
A month or two later upper management would finally look at the work and say , " It 's all wrong , do it again . "
Rinse , repeat .
Entire maps would be done from the ground up , almost to beta quality , and then thrown out simply because no one would make decisions early on in the process .
( Read up on Valve 's ' orange box ' method of design -- that 's how you make games )
Another example of is the fact that there was one part of one map that was being worked on before I started working there .
Nineteen months later and the same designer was still working on the same part of that same map ...
I 'm not blaming the designer , it was n't his fault .
I think the biggest problem that the company had in general is being self - funded .
When you 're a developer working directly with a publisher and you have milestones to meet it 's a whole different ballgame .
If you do n't meet those milestones , you do n't get any money .
That right there will keep your project on schedule .
If , however , you 're funding it yourself , you do n't really have anyone to answer to except yourself and you can quickly lose sight of just how much money is going out the door . "
A rebuttal was posted on the 3D Realms forums -
" It was originally posted on Something Awful , and I posted a followup .
Unfortunately the guy who posted it was n't there when the trailer was developed , and he 's mistaken .
Everything but the sandworm and the " talking " parts were just clips of gameplay from the game as - is , other than some effort to polish them up .
The talking parts were written for the trailer , but were accurate representations of the story being told and were intended for real use .
So while those bits were " scripted " they would be scripted in the final shipping game too , but all the rest ( vehicles , weapons , AI , games , etc ) were straight from the production playable game . "
So where does the truth lie ?
It 's hard to say , probably somewhere in the middle .
I have a feeling more and more things like this are going to come to light now that 3D Realms is no more .
What 's going to happen next ?
Who knows .
It 's entirely possible 3D Realms could sell the project off to another developer who finishes it inside of a month and releases it .
Alternatively , George Broussard could take the codebase to his grave .
Regardless , here 's what happened in the time it took Duke Nukem Forever to blow our minds and then disappear like a fart in a strong breeze .
Update - 2/11/2011
Amazingly enough , it seems that Duke Nukem Forever will actually see the light of day .
Its official release date is May 6th , 2011 .
Initial impressions of the game have been posted on quite a few sites , and seem fairly positive .
Kotaku seems to provide the best summary :
Is Duke Nukem the sort of game that comes from more than 13 years of development ?
No , most certainly not .
Was it worth the wait ?
For fans of Duke Nukem ?
Probably .
Here 's the official launch trailer :

Robbie Schumacher
" Hello , My name is Robbie Schumacher .
I 'm from Byesville , Ohio and I 'm 27 years old .
I reserved Duke Nukem Forever at Babbage 's back when it was first announced .
I still have the ticket stub that I 've been carrying in my wallet since that day .
I took a picture of the front and back of it .
The front has a stub number and it also says Babbage 's , Software etc. , Funcoland and GameStop .
The back has " May 48.00 " written on the back .
I 'm wanting to say that it was early ' 98 or even winter of ' 97 when I did because of the May written on the back .
Actually .. I do kind of remember May rolling around and then saying that they 're gonna use a better engine for the game and to keep my reservation stub .. so that had to of been ' 98 .
I 've attached pictures of the ticket stub .. front and back just for proof . "
The following things have been accomplished between Duke Nukem Forever 's announcement on April 28th , 1997 and its death on May 6th , 2009 ...

Recently I ’ve been thinking a lot about what made Microsoft a great company to work for , and why working at Juno was so frustrating .
At first I attributed the difference to the east coast / west coast thing , but I think it ’s a bit more subtle than that .
One of the most important things that made Microsoft successful was Bill Gates ’ devotion to hiring the best people .
If you hire all A people , he said , they ’ll also hire A people .
But if you hire B people , they ’ll hire the C people and then it ’s all over .
This was certainly true at Microsoft .
There were huge branches of the Microsoft tree filled with great people ; these businesses were perennially successful ( Office , Windows , and the developer products ) .
But there were also branches that were just not as successful : MSN failed again and again and again ; Microsoft Money took forever to get going , and Microsoft Consulting Services is full of airheads .
In each of these cases it ’s pretty clear that a B leader built up a business unit full of C players and it just did n’t work .
So : hire smart people who get things done .
( See The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing )
It ’s so important there ’s a web page all about it and it ’s one of PaxDigita ’s most important goals .
And when it worked , it worked quite well at Microsoft .
When I first went to interview at Juno , I was n’t sure that this was the company for me .
The software looked a little bit goofy .
The whole company smelled like a bunch of Wall Street Jocks who heard that the Internet was the New New Thing and they wanted in .
So I called them up and said , “ well , I ’m not sure if I want to work there , but I ’d like to learn more about your company . ”
In typical arrogant manner , they proceeded to schedule me for a whole battery of interviews and made me prove that I was good enough to work there .
At first I was a little bit miffed , because I had n’t really decided that I was interested in the job in the first place .
But then I realized that any company that has such a rigorous hiring process as Juno does has got to be full of smart people .
This alone impressed me enough to take the job .
Sure enough , Juno ( and D. E. Shaw , the corporate parent ) were full of geniuses .
The receptionists had PhDs .
The place was full of people like Dr. Eric Caplan , a former associate professor from U. Chicago who was writing technical documents for the intranet for heaven ’s sake .
Talk about overqualified .
For a couple of years , I was very happy at Juno .
It seemed like a dream job .
( I even got interviewed for a website called dreamjobs.com talking about how dreamy Juno was ) .
One thing was a little bit strange — after about a year , I was promoted to be in charge of exactly 2 people on my little team of 6 .
In fact the average manager at Juno has about 2 reports , a stunningly vertical organization by any standard .
The next thing that I started noticing was strange is that a lot of people were leaving .
In the wired wired world of Silicon Alley that ’s not uncommon .
What was weird is how consistent their reason for leaving was : none of them felt any possibility of moving up in the company .
So what we had here was a company that was already as vertical and hierarchical as imaginable , with about 50 managers for a total of 150 employees , and people were complaining because there was no hope of moving up .
What ’s going on here ?
At Microsoft , for some reason , lots of people at the lowest rung of the hierarchy were completely satisfied with their jobs and were happy to go on doing them forever .
Whereas at Juno , people in the same positions rapidly got frustrated and wanted to leave because they could n’t get promoted .
I think the crucial difference here was in the corporate culture , specifically , in the way management worked .
At Microsoft , management was extremely hands - off .
In general , everybody was given some area to own , and they owned it .
Managers made no attempt to tell people what to do , in fact , they saw their role as running around , moving the furniture out of the way , so their reports could get things done .
There were some great examples of this .
Managers always refused to resolve conflicts .
Typically what would happen is that a designer would get into an argument with a developer over what a feature should look like .
They would argue back and forth , discussing the issue for an hour , and eventually , failing to reach agreement , they would stomp into some manager ’s office hoping for a resolution .
Now you ’ve got three people in the room : a designer , a developer , and a manager .
Who ’s the person who knows least about the problem ?
Obviously , it ’s the manager — who was just hauled in at the last minute for Conflict Resolution .
At Microsoft , the manager would usually refuse to make the decision .
After all , they have the least information about the problem .
The manager would generally force the designer and developer to work it out on their own , which , eventually , they did .
At Juno , quite the opposite was the case .
Nobody at Juno owned anything , they just worked on it , and different layers of management happily stuck their finger into every pie , giving orders left and right in a style which I started calling hit and run management because managers tended to pop up unannounced , give some silly order for exactly how they wanted something done , dammit , without giving any thought to the matter , and leave the room for everyone else to pick up the pieces .
The most egregious example was the CEO and president of the company , who would regularly demand printouts of every screen , take them home , and edit them using a red pen .
His edits were sometimes helpful ( spelling and grammar corrections ) , but usually , they demonstrated a complete lack of understanding as to what went into the screens and why they said what they said .
For months later , we would have meetings where people would say things like “ Charles [ the CEO ] does n’t like dropdown list boxes , ” because of something he had edited without any thought , and that was supposed to end the discussion .
You could n’t argue against this fictional Charles because he was n’t there ; he did n’t participate in the design except for hit and run purposes .
Ouch .
Hit and run management is but one symptom of what I would call Command and Control Management … something right out of the General Motors 1953 operations manual .
In a particularly political company , it even becomes worse — more like Command and Conquer management .
It ’s completely inappropriate because it makes people unhappy , it causes the person with the least information to make the decisions , and it does n’t allow a corporation to take advantage of all the talents of the people it hired .
If , like Juno , the corporation had been careful only to hire the brightest , most talented people , then it squandered an incredible resource and made those talented people frustrated as all hell .
When is Command and Conquer management acceptable ?
Well , it might work where your company is a Herd of Coconuts — a bunch of underqualified morons who need herding .
Perhaps something like the workfare corps that does the raking in Central Park .
But software companies are n’t Herds of Coconuts , and Command and Conquer does n’t cut it .
PaxDigita Culture
So this is why I ’m concerned with creating the right culture of hands - off management at PaxDigita .
In general :
everybody owns some area .
When they own it , they own it .
If a manager , or anybody else , wants to provide input into how that area is managed , they have to convince the owner .
The owner has final say .
.
If a manager , or anybody else , wants to provide input into how that area is managed , they have to convince the owner .
The owner has final say .
every decision is made by the person with the most information .
management is extremely flat .
Ideally , managers just do n’t have time to get their fingers in the pies of their reports .
You may be interested to read about a GE plant in North Carolina that has 170 employees who all report directly to the plant manager .
As a result , we will build a democratic culture where everybody runs the company .
On a day to day basis , PaxDigita people have no boss — they run themselves .
Laura Berg is a clinical nurse specialist at the VA Medical Center in Albuquerque , where she has worked for 15 years .
Shortly after Katrina , she wrote a letter to the editor of the weekly paper the Alibi criticizing the Bush Administration .
After the paper published the letter in its September 15 - 21 issue , VA administrators seized her computer , alleged that she had written the letter on that computer , and accused her of “ sedition . ”
Here ’s what her letter said .
“ I am furious with the tragically misplaced priorities and criminal negligence of this government , ” it began .
“ The Katrina tragedy in the U.S. shows that the emperor has no clothes ! ”
She mentioned that she was “ a VA nurse ” working with returning vets .
“ The public has no sense of the additional devastating human and financial costs of post - traumatic stress disorder , ” she wrote , and she worried about the hundreds of thousands of additional cases that might result from Katrina and the Iraq War .
“ Bush , Cheney , Chertoff , Brown , and Rice should be tried for criminal negligence , ” she wrote .
“ This country needs to get out of Iraq now and return to our original vision and priorities of caring for land and people and resources rather than killing for oil .
. . .
We need to wake up and get real here , and act forcefully to remove a government administration playing games of smoke and mirrors and vicious deceit .
Otherwise , many more of us will be facing living hell in these times . ”
After her computer was seized , Berg wrote a memo to her bosses seeking information and an explanation .
Mel Hooker , chief of the human resources management service at the Albuquerque VA , wrote Berg back on November 9 and acknowledged that “ your personal computer files did not contain the editorial letter written to the editor of the weekly Alibi . ”
But rather than apologize , he leveled the sedition charge : “ The Agency is bound by law to investigate and pursue any act which potentially represents sedition , ” he said .
“ In your letter . . . you declared yourself ‘ as a VA nurse ’ and publicly declared the Government which employs you to have ‘ tragically misplaced priorities and criminal negligence ’ and advocated , ‘ act forcefully to remove a government administration playing games of smoke and mirrors and vicious deceit . ’ ”
Berg , who is not talking to the press , is “ scared for her job ” and “ pretty emotionally distressed , ” says Peter Simonson , executive director of the ACLU of New Mexico .
“ We were shocked to see the word ‘ sedition ’ used , ” Simonson tells The Progressive .
“ Sedition ?
That ’s like something out of the history books . ”
In a press release , Simonson also said : “ Is this government so jealous of its power , so fearful of dissent , that it needs to threaten people who openly oppose its policies with charges of ‘ sedition ’ ? ”
The ACLU of New Mexico is working in Berg ’s behalf .
It has filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents relating to this incident .
And it is asking “ at the very least ” that Berg “ receive a public apology from Mr. Hooker to remedy the unconstitutional chilling effect on the speech of VA employees that has resulted from these intimidating tactics , ” according to a letter from the New Mexico ACLU to the VA ’s Office of Regional Counsel .
Hooker refused to return a phone call , and the VA ’s Office of Regional Counsel refused to comment but referred questions to public affairs .
" While VA does not prohibit employees from exercising their freedom of speech , we do ask that such activity occurs outside government premises and not during their official tour of duty , ” says Bill Armstrong , a public affairs specialist for New Mexico ’s VA Health Care System .
“ When we have reason to believe that this policy is not being adhered to , we have the obligation to review an individual 's computer activity . "
The VA in Washington also refused to comment on the sedition charge .
“ We do n’t discuss internal personnel issues , ” says Phil Budahn , a VA spokesman in Washington , D.C .
Berg has an additional concern : that the VA may have got the FBI on her case .
A union employee “ shared with me that Mel Hooker conveyed to him that my letter had been reported ‘ up through VA channels ’ to the FBI in Washington , and that this had been discussed and confirmed ” with union officials at the national office , Berg wrote in her November 2 complaint .
( The union she belongs to is the American Federation of Government Employees . )
Hooker denied that the VA had contacted the FBI .
“ The Agency has no knowledge of any report alleged to have been made to the FBI regarding you or your letter , ” he said in his November 9 memo .
Meanwhile , Senator Jeff Bingaman , Democrat of New Mexico , has taken up the Berg case .
“ I am writing to express my deep concern regarding news reports that Ms. Laura Berg . . . was investigated for sedition after writing a letter that was critical of the current Administration , ” Senator Bingaman wrote to R. James Nicholson , Secretary of Veterans Affairs , on February 7 .
“ In a democracy , expressing disagreement with the government ’s actions does not amount to sedition or insurrection — it is , and must remain , protected speech . ”
" Seditious " VA Nurse Cleared
" Let me be clear :
Her letter to the editor did not amount to sedition , ” wrote VA Secretary R. James Nicholson .

Betty Wilbraham said her hat ban was " ridiculous "
Retired teacher Betty Wilbraham was told by staff at The Hereward in Ely , Cambs , that its CCTV camera would not be able to see her face clearly enough .
Mrs Wilbraham said it was " ridiculous " to be asked to remove her hat .
The pub said it was its policy to always ask people to remove their hats so any trouble was recorded on CCTV .
Mrs Wilbraham , of Ely , said she could not understand how her black rain hat with a smart maroon ribbon had fallen foul of pub regulations .
Mrs Wilbraham , who has been a member of the Women 's Institute ( WI ) for more than 40 years , said : " I put in my order and I was just about to go to my table when the girl behind the counter said , ' would I mind taking my hat off ' .
She said it was a hatless pub .
' Beware hatted woman '
" I was too taken aback that I did n't answer back .
I was tired because I had just done my shopping .
" I mulled it over and then thought ' How ridiculous ! '
It seems it is all to do with CCTV . "
Mrs Wilbraham , who has about 10 hats in her wardrobe , wrote to her local paper saying : ' Elderly Ladies Wearing Hats - Beware . "
Mrs Wilbraham is now thinking of giving a talk to WI members about the incident , which happened last Thursday .
Pub licensee Tony Love said it was pub policy to always ask people to remove their hats .
" It 's all to do with the CCTV .
We have 13 cameras inside the pub and we cannot be seen to be discriminating between the youths and the elderly people .
" We always approach people politely and most of the elderly take their hats off anyway when they sit down .
Mrs Wilbraham does not understand that the world is changing . "

I 've just gone through the experience of trying to configure CUPS , the Common Unix Printing System .
It has proved a textbook lesson in why nontechnical people run screaming from Unix .
This is all the more frustrating because the developers of CUPS have obviously tried hard to produce an accessible system — but the best intentions and effort have led to a system which despite its superficial pseudo - friendliness is so undiscoverable that it might as well have been written in ancient Sanskrit .
GUI tools and voluminous manuals are not enough .
You have to think about what the actual user experiences when he or she sits down to do actual stuff , and you have to think about it from the user 's point of view .
The CUPS people , despite good intentions , have utterly failed at this .
I 'm going to anatomize this failure in detail , because there are lessons here that other open - source projects would do well to heed .
The point of this essay is not , therefore , just to beat up on the CUPS people — it 's also to beat up on every other open - source designer who does equally thoughtless things under the fond delusion that a slick - looking UI is a well - designed UI .
Watch and learn ...
The configuration problem is simple .
I have a desktop machine named ' snark ' .
It is connected , via the house Ethernet , to my wife Cathy 's machine , which is named ' minx ' .
Minx has a LaserJet 6MP attached to it via parallel port .
Both machines are running Fedora Core 1 , and Cathy can print locally from minx .
I can ssh minx from snark , so the network is known good .
This should be easy , right ?
* hollow laughter * Famous last words ...
First , I do what any nontechnical user would do .
I go to my desktop menu and click System Settings -> Printing , then give the root password to the following popup .
Up comes a " Printer configuration " popup .
I click " New " .
Up pops a wizard that says , in big friendly letters , " Add a new print queue " .
So far , so good .
I click " Forward " .
Now , those of you who are intimate with CUPS know I have already made a basic error .
I should n't be trying to create a new print queue on snark and then glue it to the server on minx , at all .
Instead , if I want to pass print jobs to minx , I should look at the configuration wizard , see minx 's print queue already announced there , and make it snark 's default .
But nothing in the configuration wizard 's interface even hints at that !
And minx 's print queue does not show , for a reason we 'll discover later in this sorry saga .
New form in the window , saying " Queue name " in equally big friendly letters .
It offers a default of " printer " .
I change it to " laserjet " because I might at some point want to hook up the ancient dot - matrix thingy I still have .
I enter the optional short description : " the laser printer " .
So far this is all good .
Aunt Tillie could handle this just fine .
Forward ...
New form .
" Queue type " , it says .
There 's a drop - down menu .
The default is " Locally connected " , which is reasonable .
Clicking on the menu , I am presented with the following alternatives :
Networked CUPS ( IPP ) Networked Unix ( LPD ) Networked Windows ( SMB ) Networked Novell ( NCP ) Networked JetDirect
Here is our first intimation of trouble .
If I were Aunt Tillie the archetypal nontechnical user , I am at this point thinking " What in the holy fleeping frack does that mean ?
And just as importantly , why do I have to answer this question ? "
I do not , after all , have any Windows machines on my network .
Nor any Netware boxes .
And I certainly do n't have a " Networked JetDirect " , whatever that might be .
If the designers were half - smart about UI issues ( like , say , Windows programmers ) they 'd probe the local network neighborhood and omit the impossible entries .
If they were really smart ( like , say , Mac programmers ) they 'd leave the impossible choices in but gray them out , signifying that if your system were configured a bit differently you really could print on a Windows machine , assuming you were unfortunate enough to own one .
But no .
Instead , Aunt Tillie is already getting the idea that this software was written by geeks without clue .
But wait !
Wait !
Hallelujah !
There 's a help button !
I click it .
Up comes a nice glossy page of on - line documentation .
But instead of answering the question in my mind , which is " How do I choose the right queue type " , it is a page on adding a locally connected printer .
That is , it 's associated with the currently selected - by - default queue type , not the operation of choosing a queue .
The help is ... unhelpful .
Aunt Tillie , at this point , is either resigning herself to another session of being tortured by the poor UI choices of well - meaning idiots or deciding to chuck this whole Linux thing and go back to the old Windows box .
It blue - screened a lot , but at least it allowed her the luxury of ignorance — she did n't have to know , or care , about what a JetDirect or a CUPS might be .
I am not ignorant , but I have my own equivalent of Aunt Tillie 's problem .
I know I want one of the top two methods , but I do n't know which one .
And I do n't want to know or care about the difference either ; I have better things to do with my brain than clutter it with sysadminning details .
If the tool can detect that both methods are available on the local net ( and that should n't be hard , they 're both well - known ports ) it should put " ( recommended ) " next to one so I can click and keep going .
But nooooo .
Instead I have to stare at the help screen and think " Where might I find some guidance on this , and why is this already taking too freaking long ? "
Applying my fearsome hacker - jutsu , I try clicking " Prev " .
I get a page about the printer configuration which describes the queue types , but still no guidance on how to choose between CUPS and LPD .
Obviously it never occurred to the designers of the CUPS that this could be an issue , either for Aunt Tillie or for the more technically ept .
There is no large friendly button next to the " Select a queue type " that says " How to select a queue type " .
This lack is a grave flaw in the UI design that turns the superficial spiffiness of the configuration wizard into a tease , a mockery .
Applying my fearsome hacker - jutsu once again , I guess , and select " CUPS ( IPP ) " .
Comes now the form that turns the UI from a mockery to something worse .
It presents two text fields .
One is labeled " Server " and is blank .
The other is labeled " Path : " and contains the string " / printers / queue1 " .
If Aunt Tillie were still along for the ride , she would be using some unladylike language right about now .
And with good reason , because this is a crash landing , an unmitigated disaster .
To understand why , you have to stop thinking like a hacker for a few moments .
Cram your mind , if you can , back into the mindset of a clueless user .
Somebody who not only does n't know what a string like " / printers / queue1 " might mean , but does n't want to know , and does n't think he or she ought to have to learn .
From Aunt Tillie 's point of view , it 's reasonable that the host field is empty ; she has n't selected one , after all .
But the fact that the Path field is filled in is worse than useless , it 's actually harmful — because she does n't know what it means , and does n't know how to tell whether or not that default would be valid if she did fill in a server name .
She is stopped dead .
What she ought at this point to be seeing is one of two things : either a list of CUPS print queues available on the local network , or a big bold message that says " I do n't see any queues available locally ; you may need to go set up a print server . "
The prompt for server / path , presented here , is a stone wall ; not only does it leaves Aunt Tillie with no idea how to proceed , it is just as opaque to an experienced hacker like me .
The meta - problem here is that the configuration wizard does all the approved rituals ( GUI with standardized clicky buttons , help popping up in a browser , etc. etc. ) but does n't have the central attribute these are supposed to achieve : discoverability .
That is , the quality that every point in the interface has prompts and actions attached to it from which you can learn what to do next .
Does your project have this quality ?
In fact , the " Queue type " form is an anti-discoverable interface — it leads you right down a blind alley of trying to set up a local queue pointing to a remote server that you know can print — like my wife Cathy 's machine — and then cursing because your test print attempts fail .
This is , in fact , exactly what happened to me next .
I typed " minx.thyrsus.com " into the server field , on the assumption that " / printers / queue1 " might be a safe default that other CUPS instances would honor .
I went through the manufacturer and model screens and confirmed the queue creation .
The wizard popped up a window offering to print a test page ; I told it yes ... and nothing happened .
Actually , it was worse than nothing ; the configurator window displayed a message that said ` Network host " minx.thyrsus.com " is busy , will retry in 30 seconds ' , and then ( to all appearances ) hung .
We are now deep in the trackless swamps created by thoughtless , feckless UI design — full of glitz and GUI , signifying nothing .
This is the precise point at which I decided I was going to write a rant and started taking notes .
The " Queue type " screen gave me no clue about the existence , nonexistence , or sharable status of any print queues on my network .
I have two other machines in the house , both running full Fedora Core and plugged into Ethernet ; the really right thing would have been a message that said " I see CUPS demons are running on minx , golux , and grelber , but no queues are accessible . " with a pointer into the CUPS documentation .
Again , the help I did get was n't helpful .
The page associated with " Networked CUPS ( IPP ) Printer " says " Any networked IPP printer found via CUPS browsing appears in the main window under the Browsed queues category . "
Oh , really ?
What " main window " would that be in ?
And it does n't give me a clue what to do if I do n't see any Browsed queues category , which is particularly wack since that is the normal , default situation for a new installation !
None of this is rocket science .
The problem is n't that the right things are technically difficult to do ; CUPS is already supposed to have discovery of active shareable queues as a feature .
The problem is that the CUPS designers ' attitude was wrong .
They never stepped outside their assumptions .
They never exerted the mental effort to forget what they know and sit down at the system like a dumb user who 's never seen it before — and they never watched a dumb user in action !
CUPS is not alone .
This kind of fecklessness is endemic in open - source land .
And it's what 's keeping Microsoft in business — because by Goddess , they may write crappy insecure overpriced shoddy software , but on this one issue their half - assed semi-competent best is an order of magnitude better than we usually manage .
But enough prescriptive ranting for the moment .
I 'm going to tell you about my efforts to research my way out of this hole , because there are some lessons there as well .
First , I went looking for documentation .
I did this in a Unix - hackerish way , by eyeballing the output of `locate printers` for anything in /usr / share / doc related to CUPS .
I found /usr / share / doc / cups - 1.1.19 / printers/index.html and fired up a browser on it .
It redirected me to http://localhost:631/
which was OK , though the redirect went by too fast .
And I found myself looking at a web page that was not obviously useful for troubleshooting my problem .
I tried clicking on the button marked " Administration " in hopes the tool behind it would be a bit more discoverable than the configuration .
I got a password prompt .
Hello ?
How am I supposed to know what to do with this thing ?
All it tells me is that it wants a " CUPS login " .
Is this the same as a system root login , or is there some special funky CUPS identity I 'm supposed to telepathically know about ?
The prompt on these password popups is configurable ; it could have offered me a clue and a pointer into the documentation .
It did n't .
Once again , the theme is the absence of discoverability .
That password prompt , rather than being a signpost leading further into an understanding of the system , was another stone wall .
When all else fails , there 's always Google .
I searched on " CUPS printing HOWTO " and found a link to " The Linux Printing HOWTO " — which when I chased it , turned out to be a 404 .
Now that bit is probably not the CUPS designers ' fault ; I 'm throwing it in just to establish that , at that point , I was feeling screwed , blued , and tatooed .
The shiny - surfaced opacity of CUPS had , it seemed , defeated me in what should have been a trivial 30 - second task .
I persevered , however .
My next step was to ssh into minx and see if I could discover the name of the active CUPS queue .
Maybe , I thought , if I found that out I could plug that queue name into the configuration wizard on snark and it would all work .
Alas , it was not to be .
The two commands that seemed possibly relevant were lpinfo ( 8 ) and lpadmin , and you can't get a list of queue names from either of them .
The output of " lpinfo - v " looked like it ought to be useful , but I had no idea how to map these device URLs onto queue names .
We are now in real time .
I am writing this rant as I am trying to figure out the path out of this maze .
I am reading the CUPS System Administrator 's Manual and it claims : " CUPS supports automatic client configuration of printers on the same subnet .
To configure printers on the same subnet , do nothing .
Each client should see the available printers within 30 seconds automatically .
The printer and class lists are updated automatically as printers and servers are added or removed . "
Well , that 's very nice , but the breezy confidence of their exposition leaves me with no clue about what to do when the autoconfiguration is n't working !
I 'm reading the manual , and I find a reference to " BrowseAddress " and /etc/ cups / cupsd.conf which begins to unfold for me the mystery of how the autoconfiguration is supposed to work .
It seems that CUPS instances periodically send broadcast packets advertising their status and available printers to a broadcast address to be picked up by other CUPS instances .
Smart design !
But ... bugger me with a chainsaw , the broadcast facility is turned off by default and the documentation does n't tell you that !
So , let 's review .
In order for the nice , user - friendly autoconfiguration stuff to work , you have to first edit an /etc file .
On a different machine than the one you 're trying to set up .
You have to read the comments in configuration file to know that you need to do this in the first place .
What a truly lovely , classic blunder this is .
That they turned off the autoconfiguration support is understandable from a security - engineering point of view .
But failing to mention this in the Administrator 's Guide , and failing to warn the user during the configuration - wizard dialogue that operating printers may not be visible unless your site admin has performed the appropriate ritual on the printers ' host machines ... that is moronically thoughtless .
This kind of crap is exactly why Linux has had such trouble gaining traction among nontechnical users — and it becomes less forgivable , not more , when it 's surrounded by a boatload of GUI cotton candy that adds complexity without actually delivering friendliness to the user .
I edit a correct broadcast address for my network into /etc/ cups / cupsd.conf on minx .
I am unsurprised to learn that the cupsd ( 8 ) man page does n't tell me whether the standard kill - HUP will force cupsd to reread that file , because at this point I am expecting the documentation to be unhelpful .
I do /etc / init.d / cups restart instead .
I write the last paragraph , then go back to the configuration wizard .
A little poking at it discloses an Action -> Sharing item .
When I click the OK button , " Browsed queues " appears in the wizard window .
Excelsior !
It appears that snark is now receiving broadcast configuration info from minx .
And sure enough , when I click " Browse queues " a LaserJet 6 shows up as a device .
Curiously , however , it is labeled " lp0 " without any indication that it 's not on the local machine .
I fire up the Web interface .
Sure enough , it finds the LaserJet 6 on minx .
But not all is goodness .
When I try to print a test page , a popup tells me " The connection was refused when attempting to contact minx.thyrsus.com:631 " .
I am again unsurprised to learn that neither the user 's nor the Administrator 's Guide has anything to say about troubleshooting CUPS problems .
The lpr ( 1 ) interface is massively unhelpful ; when I submit jobs from snark , they appear to vanish into a black hole .
Eventually I notice the Listen directive in the /etc/cups / cupsd.conf file .
" Aha ! " says I to myself , " Maybe this is like sendmail , where you have to tell it explicitly to listen on the server 's IP address . "
I add " Listen 192.168.1.21 " , the latter being minx 's IP address , restarts cupsd ... and lo and behold my test job comes tumbling out of the printer .
The thing to notice here is how far behind we have left Aunt Tillie .
Rule 1 of writing software for nontechnical users is this : if they have to read documentation to use it you designed it wrong .
The interface of the software should be all the documentation the user needs .
You'd have lost the non-techie before the point in this troubleshooting sequence where a hacker like me even got fully engaged .
But in this case , the documentation was passively but severely misleading in one area , and harmfully silent in others .
I eventually had to apply m4d skillz gained from wrestling with sendmail to solve a problem the CUPS documentation never even hinted about .
As I said before , the point of this essay is not especially to bash on the CUPS guys .
They 're no worse than thousands of projects out there , and that is the point .
We talk about world domination , but we 'll neither have it nor deserve it until we learn to do better than this .
A lot better .
It 's not like doing better would be difficult , either .
None of the changes in CUPS behavior or documentation I 've described would be technical challenges ; the problem is that these simple things never occurred to developers who bring huge amounts of already - acquired knowledge to bear every time they look at their user interfaces .
So , if you are out there writing GUI apps for Linux or BSD or whatever , here are some questions you need to be asking yourself :
What does my software look like to a non-technical user who has never seen it before ?
Is there any screen in my GUI that is a dead end , without giving guidance further into the system ?
The requirement that end - users read documentation is a sign of UI design failure .
Is my UI design a failure ?
For technical tasks that do require documentation , do they fail to mention critical defaults ?
Does my project welcome and respond to usability feedback from non-expert users ?
And , most importantly of all ... do I allow my users the precious luxury of ignorance ?
Postscript , 26 Feb 2004 : I added the new fifth question based on an excellent suggestion in LWN 's comments on the story .
And here are some more design rules , from Nico Kadel - Garcia :
Can you gracefully and easily duplicate your tools and configuration for a similar installation ?
Is it documented ?
( RedHat and CUPS is no help with this , either , most of the print - drivers wend their way from the foomatic and other tools into the CUPS setups without a lot of hint of how it works . )
[ For cups , the answer is " you can duplicate it easily , but it 's a * secret * " !
Every configuration should be built and recompiled from the source tarball !
What are you , a n00b ? ]
Is installing this toolset likely to replace or break something already in place ( such as LPD based printing packages ) ?
If so , explain how to gracefully do the transition .
Are there settings you can do from the command line or hand - editing config files that cannot be done from the GUI ?
Are they documented anywhere ?
Does using the GUI erase these settings ?
( The answer for CUPS is " Yes , you can flush all sorts of hand - edited things this way ! " .
This was an incredible problem for NeXT stations and remains a big freeware GUI problem , although most try harder to address this .
Webmin is an excellent example of how to do it right in most cases ! )
Are all your important features mentioned ?
The automatic flat text -> Postscript conversion is one such feature , and despite its presence in the tarball tools and default use the CUPS claim it 's not theirs and not their problem .
PPS , 27 Feb :
Got a very positive response from the CUPS folks .
At least some of these things will be fixed .
PPPS , 29 Feb : I have written a followup on the luxury of ignorance .
There is now a site for projects looking for usability advice and interaction designers who want to help .
It is openusability.org .
If there was any doubt North Korea had mastered the capacity to build nuclear bombs , it has been removed .
We have clarity .
The effect of North Korea ’s forced entry into the nuclear club , joining the United States , Russia , Britain , China , France , Israel , India , and Pakistan , may be as far - reaching as was Moscow ’s entry in 1949 .
For Kim Jong
- Il now has the ability to smuggle nuclear devices in the cargo holds of merchant ships into U.S. ports , or sell atom bombs to friendly nations like Iran .
He will soon be able to launch missiles with nuclear warheads onto U.S. forces on the DMZ and Okinawa .
Given time and the testing of his long - range rockets , North Korea will one day be able to bombard the American mainland with atom bombs .
Any such attack would of course entail the annihilation of his military and regime .
Nevertheless , Pyongyang now has a credible deterrent to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities .
In his 2002 State of the Union , George W. Bush issued a clear ultimatum to Iraq , Iran , and North Korea , the “ Axis of Evil ” : The United States will not allow the world ’s most dangerous regimes to acquire the world ’s most destructive weapons .
The Bush Doctrine has been defied by Kim Jong - Il .
What do we do now ?
To quote President Lincoln , as our situation is new , so we must think and act anew .
U.S. forces on the DMZ are now as much hostages to the North Korean military as they are defenders of the South .
It is less credible today than yesterday that America would launch any preemptive strike on North Korea  with our forces in Pyongyang ’s nuclear gun sights .
It is also impossible to believe the United States , its forces stretched thin by Iraq and Afghanistan , would send another army of a third of a million men to fight a land war with North Korea , as we did over half a century ago .
Why , then , do we keep an army in South Korea ?
The only rationale is to ensure that Americans are killed in any North Korean invasion , and , thus , that the United States will bring the full force of its air and naval power against Pyongyang in any such war .
But why should we maintain an indefinite commitment to fight a war for South Korea , when the result could now be escalation involving nuclear strikes on U.S. forces in the Pacific or the American homeland ?
For over a decade , this writer has argued for a withdrawal of all U.S. forces from South Korea  because the Cold War was over , the Soviet Union had broken up , and there was no longer any vital U.S. interest on the peninsula .
And because South Korea , with twice the population of the North , an economy 40 times as large and access to U.S. weapons generations ahead of North Korea ’s 1950s arsenal , should defend herself .
If we leave now , however , Seoul will take it as a signal that we are abandoning her to face a nuclear - armed North .
South Korea will have little choice but to begin a crash program to build her own nuclear arsenal .
Yet , as the United States cannot be forever committed to fight a nuclear - armed North Korea to defend South Korea , a nuclear - armed South is probably in the cards .
Pyongyang ’s explosion of Monday is probably already forcing second thoughts in Seoul about the necessity of developing its own deterrent .
China is said to be enraged that North Korea has defied it by detonating a nuclear device .
Beijing should be .
For the Chinese - Russian monopoly on nuclear weapons in North Asia has been broken .
And the democracies there are unlikely to endure a situation where they can be subjected to missile and nuclear blackmail by a backward , bellicose little dictator like Kim Jong - Il .
Japan , a nation of 125 million , with the second - largest economy on earth and the technological equal of any nation , will not allow itself to be blackmailed by this former colony of 20 million impoverished Koreans .
In securing her against any threat from Russia or China in the Cold War , Japan relied on the U.S. nuclear umbrella .
But will Japan be willing to rely on America , and forego her own nuclear deterrent , if she is threatened by a rogue state like Kim Jong - Il’s ?
If all three of Japan ’s closest neighbors  Russia , China , and North Korea  have nuclear weapons , and U.S. power is receding in Asia , and American will is being severely tested in Afghanistan and Iraq , Tokyo will surely have to reconsider the nuclear option .
Beijing refused to use its enormous economic leverage to coerce North Korea into giving up its nuclear program .
Now , China may find herself with a nuclear - armed South Korea , Japan , and perhaps Taiwan .
As for the United States , the nuclearization of Asia means it is time to move U.S. forces back to Guam and , as LBJ said , let Asian boys do the fighting that Asian boys should be doing for themselves .
I want to tell you two stories from my career which I think are classic illustrations of the difference between tech companies that are well - managed and tech companies that are disasters .
It comes down to the difference between trusting employees and letting them get things done , versus treating them like burger flippers that need to be monitored and controlled every minute , lest they wander off and sabotage everything .
My first assignment at my first job was working at Microsoft , where I was told to come up with a new macro language strategy for Excel .
Pretty soon , I had the first draft of the “ Excel Basic ” spec ( which later evolved into Visual Basic for Applications , but that ’s another story ) .
Somehow , this mysterious group of people at Microsoft called the “ Application Architecture ” group got wind of my spec , which must have concerned them , because for some reason they thought that they were in charge of things like macro language strategies , and they asked to see my spec .
I asked around .
Who ’s the Application Architecture group ?
Nobody seemed to think they were very serious .
It turns out that they were a group of just four people , recent hires with PhDs ( very unusual for Microsoft ) .
I sent them a copy of my spec and went to meet them , in case they had something interesting to say .
“ Blah blah ! ” said one of them .
“ Blah blah blah , blah blah blah ! ” said another .
I do n’t think they quite had anything interesting to say .
They were very enamored of the idea of subclassing and sort of thought that people making macros in Excel wanted to subclass a lot of things .
In any case , one of the fellows said , “ Well , this is all very interesting .
What ’s next ?
Who has to approve your spec ? ”
I laughed .
Even though I had only been at Microsoft for a few months , I knew that there was no such thing as somebody approving my spec .
Hell , nobody had time to read my spec , let alone approve it .
The programmers were bugging me every day to get them more pages so that they could write more code .
My boss ( and his boss ) made it very clear to me that nobody else understood macros or had time to work on macros , so whatever I did , it better be right .
And here this PhD working in a strange research group at Microsoft assumed that things were a bit more formal than that .
I pretty rapidly realized that the App Architecture group knew even less than I did about macros .
At least , I had talked to a handful of macro developers and some Excel old - timers to get a grip on what people actually did with Excel macros : things like recalculating a spreadsheet every day , or rearranging some data according to a certain pattern .
But the App Architecture group had merely thought about macros as an academic exercise , and they could n’t actually come up with any examples of the kind of macros people would want to write .
Pressured , one of them came up with the idea that since Excel already had underlining and double - underlining , perhaps someone would want to write a macro to triple underline .
Yep. REAL common .
So I proceeded to ignore them as diplomatically as possible .
This seemed to piss off a guy named Greg Whitten who headed up the App Architecture group .
Now , Greg was something like Microsoft employee number 6 .
He had been around forever ; nobody could quite point to anything he had done but apparently he had lunch with Bill Gates a lot and GW - BASIC was named after him .
Greg called a BIG MEETING and proceeded to complain about how the Excel team ( meaning me ) was screwing up the macro strategy .
We pressured him to come up with some specific reasons but his arguments just were n’t convincing .
I thought it was nice that here I was , a new hire pipsqueak right out of college , arguing with employee number 6 and apparently winning the argument .
( Can you imagine that happening at a Grey Flannel Suit company ? )
My programming team , headed by Ben Waldman ( now a VP at Microsoft ) backed me up completely , which was all that really mattered , because the programming team wrote the code and thus had the final say on how things got done .
I would have been perfectly happy to leave it at that .
If the Apps Architecture team needed care and feeding and wanted to argue about stuff , that was OK , I would argue with them as much as they wanted as long as they left the programmers alone to do their work .
But then something even more interesting happened that blew my mind .
I was sitting at lunch with some coworkers , in the Redmond sun , when Pete Higgins came up to me .
At that time Pete was the general manager for Office — I knew who he was , of course , but did n’t expect that he knew me very well .
“ How ’s it going , Joel ? ” he asked .
“ I hear you ’ve been having some issues with the App Architecture group . ”
“ Oh no ! ” I said .
“ Nothing I ca n’t handle . ”
“ Say no more , ” he said , “ I understand . ”
He left .
By the next day the rumor had gotten back to me : the App Architecture group was disbanded .
Not only that , but each member of the group was sent to a different department at Microsoft , as far apart as possible .
I never heard from them again .
I was blown away , of course .
At Microsoft , if you ’re the Program Manager working on the Excel macro strategy , even if you ’ve been at the company for less than six months , it does n’t matter – you are the GOD of the Excel macro strategy , and nobody , not even employee number 6 , is allowed to get in your way .
Period .
This sends a really strong message .
For one , it makes everyone that much more conscientious about their jobs .
They ca n’t hide behind the idea that “ management approved their spec , ” since management really did n’t look too closely at their spec .
All management did was hire smart people and gave them something to do .
For another , it makes for an extremely nice place to work .
Who does n’t want to be king of their own domain ?
Software , by its nature , is very easy to divide into smaller and smaller components , so it ’s always possible to divide up responsibility among people and let people own an area .
This is probably THE reason why software people love working at Microsoft .
Years passed .
I found myself working at Juno , an online service and free email provider .
This time , the experience was the exact opposite of my work at Microsoft .
I had two programmers reporting to me , but my own manager constantly undermined my ( limited ) authority by going directly to my reports and giving them things to do , often without even telling me .
Even for trivial requests like days off , my manager thought that it was his job to approve or disapprove the request .
After a couple of years at Juno I was working on the new user signup feature .
For Juno 3.x , a major release , I was going to be in charge of a complete overhaul of the signup process .
By this time , I was a relatively senior member of the technical team ; I got great performance reviews , and my managers seemed to appreciate the work I was doing .
But they just could n’t bring themselves to trust me .
Command and control .
One part of the signup process asked the users to type in their birthday .
This was just one small bit of a lengthy signup process that went on for something like 30 screens as Juno grilled you about your income , your favorite sports , how many children you have and how old they were , and about 100 other things .
To make the signup process a little bit easier , I wanted to change the birthday field to be free format , so you could type “ 8/12/74 ” or “ August 12 , 1974 ” or “ 12 Aug 74 ” or whatever .
( Have you used Outlook ?
It would work like Outlook , where you could type dates in just about any format and it would accept them ) .
Without going into too much detail , my manager decided he did n’t like this .
It became an issue of ego for him .
First he yelled at the designer who was working on that page ( without even telling me ) .
Then he yelled at me .
Then he reminded me every single day that I had to change it to the way he wanted it .
Then he got the CEO of the company to review it , and made a big show out of getting the CEO of the company to criticize my new design .
Even the CEO at Juno is perfectly happy to interfere in work done at the lowest level in the company , in fact , it ’s standard operating procedure .
I was furious , needless to say .
It was a small thing , a matter of taste , really .
Some people would prefer my way .
Some people would prefer his .
In either case , the message was clear : you WILL do as you are told here , dammit .
It was a very command - and - conquer mentality that was more of a battle of cojones than a discussion of user interface design .
I wo n’t say that this is the reason I left Juno , but it does illustrate the reason I left Juno : it was the idea that no matter how hard you work , no matter how smart you are , no matter whether you are ‘ in charge ’ of something or not , you have no authority whatsoever for even the tiniest thing .
None .
Take your damn ideas , training , brains , and intelligence , all the things we ’re paying you for , and shove it .
And at Juno , there were plenty of managers , something like 1 / 4 of all the employees , and so they had plenty of times to stick their fingers into every single decision and make sure that they were in control .
The contrast with Microsoft , where VP ’s descended from Building 9 to make it clear that you have the authority to get things done , was stark .
To some extent , Juno ’s hopelessly inept management process is a factor of being a New York City company , not a West Coast company , so modern styles of management have n’t quite permeated .
It ’s also a problem caused by the deep inexperience of Juno ’s managers , and it originates at the top – the CEO , a 29 year old who has never worked outside D. E.
Shaw , who interferes in everything he can get his fingers into , including the wording on error messages that come up when things go wrong ; the CTO regularly screams at his reports if they dare to question his wisdom ; they take it out on the programmers , who go home and kick their dogs .
Compare this to Microsoft , where things are done at the lowest level , and most managers act like their most important job is to run around the room , moving the furniture out of the way , so people can concentrate on their work .

BBC News , Toronto
The two boats are marking a 30 - year first
The visit by two warships to the area is the latest move to challenge rival claims in the Arctic triggered by the threat of melting ice .
The move follows a spat between Canada and Denmark , over an uninhabited rock called Hans Island in the eastern Arctic region .
A visit there by Canada 's defence minister last month angered the Danes .
Now two Canadian warships , the Shawinigan and the Glace Bay , are on a mission to display what Canada calls its territorial sovereignty over parts of the Arctic it believes are within its borders .
The dispute seems rather odd , when scientists say the region around the island is unlikely to be rich in oil or other natural resources .
But Canada is deeply worried that it has taken what it considers as its Arctic territory for granted .
The islands were not included in border discussions between Denmark and Canada more than 30 years ago .
Warming concern
It is also believed that global warming is causing the rapid melting of the ice across the Arctic , and that could make the legendary North - West Passage linking the Atlantic and the Pacific passable for ships for the first time .
The US has already said it regards the passage as an international strait , not Canadian waters .
Russia , Norway and Denmark also have competing claims to the continental shelf and the natural resources such as gas and oil that may lie beneath the sea bed .
If this all alarms the Canadian government , it upsets environmentalists even more .
They say the Arctic is one of the last of the earth 's relatively untouched pristine frontiers and that a rush to exploit it will have a devastating impact on marine mammals and the rest of the fragile eco-system there .
Globe and Mail ( Toronto ) , Oct. 31
Ottawa plans to unveil sweeping changes to immigration , starting today with an increase in the annual intake of new Canadians , and a promise to increase much - needed temporary workers and tackle the enormous backlog of 700,000 prospective immigrants .
Immigration Minister Joe Volpe , who will table his annual report to Parliament today , says Canada hopes to be taking in as many as 300,000 immigrants a year within five years , and will start by raising its target for next year to between 225,000 and 255,000 .
Canada is on track to accept 245,000 this year , the very high end of last year ’s target .
“ We have to start thinking about the Immigration Department as a recruiting vehicle for Canada ’s demographic and labour market needs . . .. we are the lungs of the country , ” said Mr. Volpe in an interview with The Globe and Mail .
“ We are producing more jobs than the labour market has workers for .
. . ..
We ’re desperate for immigration . ”
He also pledged to tackle the backlog problem and introduce a system to expedite the processing of the more than 700,000 prospective immigrants who face waits of as long as 48 months to have their applications processed in Canadian missions around the world .
Under the current process , immigrants are selected on the basis of education , French - . and English - language skills , and adaptability , a recruitment system that attracts mainly highly educated people who complain their professional credentials are not accepted in Canada .
Many foreign doctors and engineers say they end up working as taxi drivers and waiters — a trend confirmed by Statistics Canada , which has found that recent immigrants earn less than their Canadian - born counterparts despite higher levels of education .
Mr. Volpe does not want to scrap this selection system , but he wants to bring in more workers on temporary visas ( there are about 95,000 a year ) to fill positions in the trades , such as pipe fitters and truck drivers .
He plans to consult with his provincial counterparts , unions , business and immigrant - serving groups to better understand exactly what kinds of workers are needed .
He envisions an expanded local and provincial role in immigrant selection .
“ Every provincial minister wants more immigrants .
Today in Saskatoon , they need 5,000 more people to fill new jobs .
But in order for us under the current system to bring in 5,000 people , we have to bring in 15,000 ( their family members ) and it will take three years , ” Mr. Volpe said .
“ So we have to think about a more flexible system , a way to get in professional people and skilled people . ”
Mr. Volpe is also planning to introduce a new “ in-Canada ” application that will allow temporary workers and students to apply for landed - immigrant status once they have worked here for a certain number of months , in much the same way that live - in caregivers can apply for permanent residency after two years working as nannies .
Another priority for the Immigration Department is to process applications more quickly .
“ Under the current system , we make people wait months before we even open their application .
We would like to open their applications more quickly , and get them started on the process , ” an immigration official said .
Applicants who have been accepted on a provisional basis could start language training and credential recognition overseas , while awaiting their landed papers .
The department also plans to hire more staff in either missions overseas or in a centralized processing centre in Canada .
Mr. Volpe is also in favour of introducing a limited amnesty plan and granting legal status to the thousands of workers who toil in the black - market economy , particularly in Ontario ’s construction sector .
This initiative , however , is complicated because 11 other federal agencies must sign on , including the RCMP , the Canadian Security Intelligence Service , the Finance and Justice departments and Human Resources Skills Development Canada .
“ You have to sell them a model that everybody can live with because there are consequences for all of them , ” said Mr. Volpe , adding that he “ totally supports ” a plan to regularize the status of undocumented workers , if they pass security and background checks .
An estimated 200,000 undocumented workers live in Canada .
This year ’s annual report will show that Canada accepted 236,000 immigrants in 2004 .
Of those , 57 per cent are economic immigrants , and 43 per cent are in the family class , including refugees and others granted permanent residency on humanitarian grounds .
Canada is on track to accept 245,000 immigrants in 2005 — at the high end of its target and a signal of what ’s to come .
Want to start a startup ?
Get funded by Y Combinator .
June 2006
( This essay is derived from talks at Usenix 2006 and Railsconf 2006 . )
A couple years ago my friend Trevor and I went to look at the Apple garage .
As we stood there , he said that as a kid growing up in Saskatchewan he'd been amazed at the dedication Jobs and Wozniak must have had to work in a garage .
" Those guys must have been freezing ! "
That 's one of California 's hidden advantages : the mild climate means there 's lots of marginal space .
In cold places that margin gets trimmed off .
There 's a sharper line between outside and inside , and only projects that are officially sanctioned — by organizations , or parents , or wives , or at least by oneself — get proper indoor space .
That raises the activation energy for new ideas .
You can't just tinker .
You have to justify .
Some of Silicon Valley 's most famous companies began in garages : Hewlett - Packard in 1938 , Apple in 1976 , Google in 1998 .
In Apple 's case the garage story is a bit of an urban legend .
Woz says all they did there was assemble some computers , and that he did all the actual design of the Apple I and Apple II in his apartment or his cube at HP . [ 1 ]
This was apparently too marginal even for Apple 's PR people .
By conventional standards , Jobs and Wozniak were marginal people too .
Obviously they were smart , but they can't have looked good on paper .
They were at the time a pair of college dropouts with about three years of school between them , and hippies to boot .
Their previous business experience consisted of making " blue boxes " to hack into the phone system , a business with the rare distinction of being both illegal and unprofitable .
Outsiders
Now a startup operating out of a garage in Silicon Valley would feel part of an exalted tradition , like the poet in his garret , or the painter who can't afford to heat his studio and thus has to wear a beret indoors .
But in 1976 it did n't seem so cool .
The world had n't yet realized that starting a computer company was in the same category as being a writer or a painter .
It had n't been for long .
Only in the preceding couple years had the dramatic fall in the cost of hardware allowed outsiders to compete .
In 1976 , everyone looked down on a company operating out of a garage , including the founders .
One of the first things Jobs did when they got some money was to rent office space .
He wanted Apple to seem like a real company .
They already had something few real companies ever have : a fabulously well designed product .
You 'd think they'd have had more confidence .
But I 've talked to a lot of startup founders , and it 's always this way .
They 've built something that 's going to change the world , and they 're worried about some nit like not having proper business cards .
That 's the paradox I want to explore : great new things often come from the margins , and yet the people who discover them are looked down on by everyone , including themselves .
It 's an old idea that new things come from the margins .
I want to examine its internal structure .
Why do great ideas come from the margins ?
What kind of ideas ?
And is there anything we can do to encourage the process ?
Insiders
One reason so many good ideas come from the margin is simply that there 's so much of it .
There have to be more outsiders than insiders , if insider means anything .
If the number of outsiders is huge it will always seem as if a lot of ideas come from them , even if few do per capita .
But I think there 's more going on than this .
There are real disadvantages to being an insider , and in some kinds of work they can outweigh the advantages .
Imagine , for example , what would happen if the government decided to commission someone to write an official Great American Novel .
First there 'd be a huge ideological squabble over who to choose .
Most of the best writers would be excluded for having offended one side or the other .
Of the remainder , the smart ones would refuse such a job , leaving only a few with the wrong sort of ambition .
The committee would choose one at the height of his career — that is , someone whose best work was behind him — and hand over the project with copious free advice about how the book should show in positive terms the strength and diversity of the American people , etc , etc .
The unfortunate writer would then sit down to work with a huge weight of expectation on his shoulders .
Not wanting to blow such a public commission , he 'd play it safe .
This book had better command respect , and the way to ensure that would be to make it a tragedy .
Audiences have to be enticed to laugh , but if you kill people they feel obliged to take you seriously .
As everyone knows , America plus tragedy equals the Civil War , so that 's what it would have to be about .
Better stick to the standard cartoon version that the Civil War was about slavery ; people would be confused otherwise ; plus you can show a lot of strength and diversity .
When finally completed twelve years later , the book would be a 900 - page pastiche of existing popular novels — roughly Gone with the Wind plus Roots .
But its bulk and celebrity would make it a bestseller for a few months , until blown out of the water by a talk - show host 's autobiography .
The book would be made into a movie and thereupon forgotten , except by the more waspish sort of reviewers , among whom it would be a byword for bogusness like Milli Vanilli or Battlefield Earth .
Maybe I got a little carried away with this example .
And yet is this not at each point the way such a project would play out ?
The government knows better than to get into the novel business , but in other fields where they have a natural monopoly , like nuclear waste dumps , aircraft carriers , and regime change , you 'd find plenty of projects isomorphic to this one — and indeed , plenty that were less successful .
This little thought experiment suggests a few of the disadvantages of insider projects : the selection of the wrong kind of people , the excessive scope , the inability to take risks , the need to seem serious , the weight of expectations , the power of vested interests , the undiscerning audience , and perhaps most dangerous , the tendency of such work to become a duty rather than a pleasure .
Tests
A world with outsiders and insiders implies some kind of test for distinguishing between them .
And the trouble with most tests for selecting elites is that there are two ways to pass them : to be good at what they try to measure , and to be good at hacking the test itself .
So the first question to ask about a field is how honest its tests are , because this tells you what it means to be an outsider .
This tells you how much to trust your instincts when you disagree with authorities , whether it 's worth going through the usual channels to become one yourself , and perhaps whether you want to work in this field at all .
Tests are least hackable when there are consistent standards for quality , and the people running the test really care about its integrity .
Admissions to PhD programs in the hard sciences are fairly honest , for example .
The professors will get whoever they admit as their own grad students , so they try hard to choose well , and they have a fair amount of data to go on .
Whereas undergraduate admissions seem to be much more hackable .
One way to tell whether a field has consistent standards is the overlap between the leading practitioners and the people who teach the subject in universities .
At one end of the scale you have fields like math and physics , where nearly all the teachers are among the best practitioners .
In the middle are medicine , law , history , architecture , and computer science , where many are .
At the bottom are business , literature , and the visual arts , where there 's almost no overlap between the teachers and the leading practitioners .
It 's this end that gives rise to phrases like " those who ca n't do , teach . "
Incidentally , this scale might be helpful in deciding what to study in college .
When I was in college the rule seemed to be that you should study whatever you were most interested in .
But in retrospect you 're probably better off studying something moderately interesting with someone who 's good at it than something very interesting with someone who is n't .
You often hear people say that you should n't major in business in college , but this is actually an instance of a more general rule : do n't learn things from teachers who are bad at them .
How much you should worry about being an outsider depends on the quality of the insiders .
If you 're an amateur mathematician and think you 've solved a famous open problem , better go back and check .
When I was in grad school , a friend in the math department had the job of replying to people who sent in proofs of Fermat 's last theorem and so on , and it did not seem as if he saw it as a valuable source of tips — more like manning a mental health hotline .
Whereas if the stuff you 're writing seems different from what English professors are interested in , that 's not necessarily a problem .
Anti-Tests
Where the method of selecting the elite is thoroughly corrupt , most of the good people will be outsiders .
In art , for example , the image of the poor , misunderstood genius is not just one possible image of a great artist : it 's the standard image .
I 'm not saying it 's correct , incidentally , but it is telling how well this image has stuck .
You could n't make a rap like that stick to math or medicine . [ 2 ]
If it 's corrupt enough , a test becomes an anti-test , filtering out the people it should select by making them to do things only the wrong people would do .
Popularity in high school seems to be such a test .
There are plenty of similar ones in the grownup world .
For example , rising up through the hierarchy of the average big company demands an attention to politics few thoughtful people could spare . [ 3 ]
Someone like Bill Gates can grow a company under him , but it's hard to imagine him having the patience to climb the corporate ladder at General Electric — or Microsoft , actually .
It 's kind of strange when you think about it , because lord - of - the - flies schools and bureaucratic companies are both the default .
There are probably a lot of people who go from one to the other and never realize the whole world does n't work this way .
I think that 's one reason big companies are so often blindsided by startups .
People at big companies do n't realize the extent to which they live in an environment that is one large , ongoing test for the wrong qualities .
If you 're an outsider , your best chances for beating insiders are obviously in fields where corrupt tests select a lame elite .
But there 's a catch : if the tests are corrupt , your victory wo n't be recognized , at least in your lifetime .
You may feel you do n't need that , but history suggests it 's dangerous to work in fields with corrupt tests .
You may beat the insiders , and yet not do as good work , on an absolute scale , as you would in a field that was more honest .
Standards in art , for example , were almost as corrupt in the first half of the eighteenth century as they are today .
This was the era of those fluffy idealized portraits of countesses with their lapdogs .
Chardin decided to skip all that and paint ordinary things as he saw them .
He 's now considered the best of that period — and yet not the equal of Leonardo or Bellini or Memling , who all had the additional encouragement of honest standards .
It can be worth participating in a corrupt contest , however , if it 's followed by another that is n't corrupt .
For example , it would be worth competing with a company that can spend more than you on marketing , as long as you can survive to the next round , when customers compare your actual products .
Similarly , you should n't be discouraged by the comparatively corrupt test of college admissions , because it 's followed immediately by less hackable tests . [ 4 ]
Risk
Even in a field with honest tests , there are still advantages to being an outsider .
The most obvious is that outsiders have nothing to lose .
They can do risky things , and if they fail , so what ?
Few will even notice .
The eminent , on the other hand , are weighed down by their eminence .
Eminence is like a suit : it impresses the wrong people , and it constrains the wearer .
Outsiders should realize the advantage they have here .
Being able to take risks is hugely valuable .
Everyone values safety too much , both the obscure and the eminent .
No one wants to look like a fool .
But it 's very useful to be able to .
If most of your ideas are n't stupid , you 're probably being too conservative .
You 're not bracketing the problem .
Lord Acton said we should judge talent at its best and character at its worst .
For example , if you write one great book and ten bad ones , you still count as a great writer — or at least , a better writer than someone who wrote eleven that were merely good .
Whereas if you 're a quiet , law - abiding citizen most of the time but occasionally cut someone up and bury them in your backyard , you 're a bad guy .
Almost everyone makes the mistake of treating ideas as if they were indications of character rather than talent — as if having a stupid idea made you stupid .
There 's a huge weight of tradition advising us to play it safe .
" Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent , " says the Old Testament ( Proverbs 17:28 ) .
Well , that may be fine advice for a bunch of goatherds in Bronze Age Palestine .
There conservatism would be the order of the day .
But times have changed .
It might still be reasonable to stick with the Old Testament in political questions , but materially the world now has a lot more state .
Tradition is less of a guide , not just because things change faster , but because the space of possibilities is so large .
The more complicated the world gets , the more valuable it is to be willing to look like a fool .
Delegation
And yet the more successful people become , the more heat they get if they screw up — or even seem to screw up .
In this respect , as in many others , the eminent are prisoners of their own success .
So the best way to understand the advantages of being an outsider may be to look at the disadvantages of being an insider .
If you ask eminent people what 's wrong with their lives , the first thing they 'll complain about is the lack of time .
A friend of mine at Google is fairly high up in the company and went to work for them long before they went public .
In other words , he 's now rich enough not to have to work .
I asked him if he could still endure the annoyances of having a job , now that he did n't have to .
And he said that there were n't really any annoyances , except — and he got a wistful look when he said this — that he got so much email .
The eminent feel like everyone wants to take a bite out of them .
The problem is so widespread that people pretending to be eminent do it by pretending to be overstretched .
The lives of the eminent become scheduled , and that 's not good for thinking .
One of the great advantages of being an outsider is long , uninterrupted blocks of time .
That 's what I remember about grad school : apparently endless supplies of time , which I spent worrying about , but not writing , my dissertation .
Obscurity is like health food — unpleasant , perhaps , but good for you .
Whereas fame tends to be like the alcohol produced by fermentation .
When it reaches a certain concentration , it kills off the yeast that produced it .
The eminent generally respond to the shortage of time by turning into managers .
They do n't have time to work .
They 're surrounded by junior people they 're supposed to help or supervise .
The obvious solution is to have the junior people do the work .
Some good stuff happens this way , but there are problems it does n't work so well for : the kind where it helps to have everything in one head .
For example , it recently emerged that the famous glass artist Dale Chihuly has n't actually blown glass for 27 years .
He has assistants do the work for him .
But one of the most valuable sources of ideas in the visual arts is the resistance of the medium .
That 's why oil paintings look so different from watercolors .
In principle you could make any mark in any medium ; in practice the medium steers you .
And if you 're no longer doing the work yourself , you stop learning from this .
So if you want to beat those eminent enough to delegate , one way to do it is to take advantage of direct contact with the medium .
In the arts it 's obvious how : blow your own glass , edit your own films , stage your own plays .
And in the process pay close attention to accidents and to new ideas you have on the fly .
This technique can be generalized to any sort of work : if you 're an outsider , do n't be ruled by plans .
Planning is often just a weakness forced on those who delegate .
Is there a general rule for finding problems best solved in one head ?
Well , you can manufacture them by taking any project usually done by multiple people and trying to do it all yourself .
Wozniak 's work was a classic example : he did everything himself , hardware and software , and the result was miraculous .
He claims not one bug was ever found in the Apple II , in either hardware or software .
Another way to find good problems to solve in one head is to focus on the grooves in the chocolate bar — the places where tasks are divided when they 're split between several people .
If you want to beat delegation , focus on a vertical slice : for example , be both writer and editor , or both design buildings and construct them .
One especially good groove to span is the one between tools and things made with them .
For example , programming languages and applications are usually written by different people , and this is responsible for a lot of the worst flaws in programming languages .
I think every language should be designed simultaneously with a large application written in it , the way C was with Unix .
Techniques for competing with delegation translate well into business , because delegation is endemic there .
Instead of avoiding it as a drawback of senility , many companies embrace it as a sign of maturity .
In big companies software is often designed , implemented , and sold by three separate types of people .
In startups one person may have to do all three .
And though this feels stressful , it 's one reason startups win .
The needs of customers and the means of satisfying them are all in one head .
Focus
The very skill of insiders can be a weakness .
Once someone is good at something , they tend to spend all their time doing that .
This kind of focus is very valuable , actually .
Much of the skill of experts is the ability to ignore false trails .
But focus has drawbacks : you do n't learn from other fields , and when a new approach arrives , you may be the last to notice .
For outsiders this translates into two ways to win .
One is to work on a variety of things .
Since you can't derive as much benefit ( yet ) from a narrow focus , you may as well cast a wider net and derive what benefit you can from similarities between fields .
Just as you can compete with delegation by working on larger vertical slices , you can compete with specialization by working on larger horizontal slices — by both writing and illustrating your book , for example .
The second way to compete with focus is to see what focus overlooks .
In particular , new things .
So if you 're not good at anything yet , consider working on something so new that no one else is either .
It wo n't have any prestige yet , if no one is good at it , but you 'll have it all to yourself .
The potential of a new medium is usually underestimated , precisely because no one has yet explored its possibilities .
Before Durer tried making engravings , no one took them very seriously .
Engraving was for making little devotional images — basically fifteenth century baseball cards of saints .
Trying to make masterpieces in this medium must have seemed to Durer 's contemporaries the way that , say , making masterpieces in comics might seem to the average person today .
In the computer world we get not new mediums but new platforms : the minicomputer , the microprocessor , the web - based application .
At first they 're always dismissed as being unsuitable for real work .
And yet someone always decides to try anyway , and it turns out you can do more than anyone expected .
So in the future when you hear people say of a new platform : yeah , it 's popular and cheap , but not ready yet for real work , jump on it .
As well as being more comfortable working on established lines , insiders generally have a vested interest in perpetuating them .
The professor who made his reputation by discovering some new idea is not likely to be the one to discover its replacement .
This is particularly true with companies , who have not only skill and pride anchoring them to the status quo , but money as well .
The Achilles heel of successful companies is their inability to cannibalize themselves .
Many innovations consist of replacing something with a cheaper alternative , and companies just do n't want to see a path whose immediate effect is to cut an existing source of revenue .
So if you 're an outsider you should actively seek out contrarian projects .
Instead of working on things the eminent have made prestigious , work on things that could steal that prestige .
The really juicy new approaches are not the ones insiders reject as impossible , but those they ignore as undignified .
For example , after Wozniak designed the Apple II he offered it first to his employer , HP .
They passed .
One of the reasons was that , to save money , he 'd designed the Apple II to use a TV as a monitor , and HP felt they could n't produce anything so declasse .
Less
Wozniak used a TV as a monitor for the simple reason that he could n't afford a monitor .
Outsiders are not merely free but compelled to make things that are cheap and lightweight .
And both are good bets for growth : cheap things spread faster , and lightweight things evolve faster .
The eminent , on the other hand , are almost forced to work on a large scale .
Instead of garden sheds they must design huge art museums .
One reason they work on big things is that they can : like our hypothetical novelist , they 're flattered by such opportunities .
They also know that big projects will by their sheer bulk impress the audience .
A garden shed , however lovely , would be easy to ignore ; a few might even snicker at it .
You can't snicker at a giant museum , no matter how much you dislike it .
And finally , there are all those people the eminent have working for them ; they have to choose projects that can keep them all busy .
Outsiders are free of all this .
They can work on small things , and there 's something very pleasing about small things .
Small things can be perfect ; big ones always have something wrong with them .
But there 's a magic in small things that goes beyond such rational explanations .
All kids know it .
Small things have more personality .
Plus making them is more fun .
You can do what you want ; you do n't have to satisfy committees .
And perhaps most important , small things can be done fast .
The prospect of seeing the finished project hangs in the air like the smell of dinner cooking .
If you work fast , maybe you could have it done tonight .
Working on small things is also a good way to learn .
The most important kinds of learning happen one project at a time .
( " Next time , I won't ... " )
The faster you cycle through projects , the faster you 'll evolve .
Plain materials have a charm like small scale .
And in addition there 's the challenge of making do with less .
Every designer 's ears perk up at the mention of that game , because it 's a game you can't lose .
Like the JV playing the varsity , if you even tie , you win .
So paradoxically there are cases where fewer resources yield better results , because the designers ' pleasure at their own ingenuity more than compensates . [ 5 ]
So if you 're an outsider , take advantage of your ability to make small and inexpensive things .
Cultivate the pleasure and simplicity of that kind of work ; one day you 'll miss it .
Responsibility
When you 're old and eminent , what will you miss about being young and obscure ?
What people seem to miss most is the lack of responsibilities .
Responsibility is an occupational disease of eminence .
In principle you could avoid it , just as in principle you could avoid getting fat as you get old , but few do .
I sometimes suspect that responsibility is a trap and that the most virtuous route would be to shirk it , but regardless it 's certainly constraining .
When you 're an outsider you 're constrained too , of course .
You 're short of money , for example .
But that constrains you in different ways .
How does responsibility constrain you ?
The worst thing is that it allows you not to focus on real work .
Just as the most dangerous forms of procrastination are those that seem like work , the danger of responsibilities is not just that they can consume a whole day , but that they can do it without setting off the kind of alarms you 'd set off if you spent a whole day sitting on a park bench .
A lot of the pain of being an outsider is being aware of one 's own procrastination .
But this is actually a good thing .
You 're at least close enough to work that the smell of it makes you hungry .
As an outsider , you 're just one step away from getting things done .
A huge step , admittedly , and one that most people never seem to make , but only one step .
If you can summon up the energy to get started , you can work on projects with an intensity ( in both senses ) that few insiders can match .
For insiders work turns into a duty , laden with responsibilities and expectations .
It 's never so pure as it was when they were young .
Work like a dog being taken for a walk , instead of an ox being yoked to the plow .
That 's what they miss .
Audience
A lot of outsiders make the mistake of doing the opposite ; they admire the eminent so much that they copy even their flaws .
Copying is a good way to learn , but copy the right things .
When I was in college I imitated the pompous diction of famous professors .
But this was n't what made them eminent — it was more a flaw their eminence had allowed them to sink into .
Imitating it was like pretending to have gout in order to seem rich .
Half the distinguishing qualities of the eminent are actually disadvantages .
Imitating these is not only a waste of time , but will make you seem a fool to your models , who are often well aware of it .
What are the genuine advantages of being an insider ?
The greatest is an audience .
It often seems to outsiders that the great advantage of insiders is money — that they have the resources to do what they want .
But so do people who inherit money , and that does n't seem to help , not as much as an audience .
It 's good for morale to know people want to see what you 're making ; it draws work out of you .
If I 'm right that the defining advantage of insiders is an audience , then we live in exciting times , because just in the last ten years the Internet has made audiences a lot more liquid .
Outsiders do n't have to content themselves anymore with a proxy audience of a few smart friends .
Now , thanks to the Internet , they can start to grow themselves actual audiences .
This is great news for the marginal , who retain the advantages of outsiders while increasingly being able to siphon off what had till recently been the prerogative of the elite .
Though the Web has been around for more than ten years , I think we 're just beginning to see its democratizing effects .
Outsiders are still learning how to steal audiences .
But more importantly , audiences are still learning how to be stolen — they 're still just beginning to realize how much deeper bloggers can dig than journalists , how much more interesting a democratic news site can be than a front page controlled by editors , and how much funnier a bunch of kids with webcams can be than mass - produced sitcoms .
The big media companies should n't worry that people will post their copyrighted material on YouTube .
They should worry that people will post their own stuff on YouTube , and audiences will watch that instead .
Hacking
If I had to condense the power of the marginal into one sentence it would be : just try hacking something together .
That phrase draws in most threads I 've mentioned here .
Hacking something together means deciding what to do as you 're doing it , not a subordinate executing the vision of his boss .
It implies the result wo n't be pretty , because it will be made quickly out of inadequate materials .
It may work , but it wo n't be the sort of thing the eminent would want to put their name on .
Something hacked together means something that barely solves the problem , or maybe does n't solve the problem at all , but another you discovered en route .
But that 's ok , because the main value of that initial version is not the thing itself , but what it leads to .
Insiders who dare n't walk through the mud in their nice clothes will never make it to the solid ground on the other side .
The word " try " is an especially valuable component .
I disagree here with Yoda , who said there is no try .
There is try .
It implies there 's no punishment if you fail .
You 're driven by curiosity instead of duty .
That means the wind of procrastination will be in your favor : instead of avoiding this work , this will be what you do as a way of avoiding other work .
And when you do it , you 'll be in a better mood .
The more the work depends on imagination , the more that matters , because most people have more ideas when they 're happy .
If I could go back and redo my twenties , that would be one thing I 'd do more of : just try hacking things together .
Like many people that age , I spent a lot of time worrying about what I should do .
I also spent some time trying to build stuff .
I should have spent less time worrying and more time building .
If you 're not sure what to do , make something .
Raymond Chandler 's advice to thriller writers was " When in doubt , have a man come through a door with a gun in his hand . "
He followed that advice .
Judging from his books , he was often in doubt .
But though the result is occasionally cheesy , it 's never boring .
In life , as in books , action is underrated .
Fortunately the number of things you can just hack together keeps increasing .
People fifty years ago would be astonished that one could just hack together a movie , for example .
Now you can even hack together distribution .
Just make stuff and put it online .
Inappropriate
If you really want to score big , the place to focus is the margin of the margin : the territories only recently captured from the insiders .
That 's where you 'll find the juiciest projects still undone , either because they seemed too risky , or simply because there were too few insiders to explore everything .
This is why I spend most of my time writing essays lately .
The writing of essays used to be limited to those who could get them published .
In principle you could have written them and just shown them to your friends ; in practice that did n't work . [ 6 ]
An essayist needs the resistance of an audience , just as an engraver needs the resistance of the plate .
Up till a few years ago , writing essays was the ultimate insider 's game .
Domain experts were allowed to publish essays about their field , but the pool allowed to write on general topics was about eight people who went to the right parties in New York .
Now the reconquista has overrun this territory , and , not surprisingly , found it sparsely cultivated .
There are so many essays yet unwritten .
They tend to be the naughtier ones ; the insiders have pretty much exhausted the motherhood and apple pie topics .
This leads to my final suggestion : a technique for determining when you 're on the right track .
You 're on the right track when people complain that you 're unqualified , or that you 've done something inappropriate .
If people are complaining , that means you 're doing something rather than sitting around , which is the first step .
And if they 're driven to such empty forms of complaint , that means you 've probably done something good .
If you make something and people complain that it does n't work , that 's a problem .
But if the worst thing they can hit you with is your own status as an outsider , that implies that in every other respect you 've succeeded .
Pointing out that someone is unqualified is as desperate as resorting to racial slurs .
It 's just a legitimate sounding way of saying : we do n't like your type around here .
But the best thing of all is when people call what you 're doing inappropriate .
I 've been hearing this word all my life and I only recently realized that it is , in fact , the sound of the homing beacon .
" Inappropriate " is the null criticism .
It 's merely the adjective form of " I do n't like it . "
So that , I think , should be the highest goal for the marginal .
Be inappropriate .
When you hear people saying that , you 're golden .
And they , incidentally , are busted .
Notes
[ 1 ] The facts about Apple 's early history are from an interview with Steve Wozniak in Jessica Livingston 's Founders at Work .
[ 2 ] As usual the popular image is several decades behind reality .
Now the misunderstood artist is not a chain - smoking drunk who pours his soul into big , messy canvases that philistines see and say " that 's not art " because it is n't a picture of anything .
The philistines have now been trained that anything hung on a wall is art .
Now the misunderstood artist is a coffee - drinking vegan cartoonist whose work they see and say " that 's not art " because it looks like stuff they 've seen in the Sunday paper .
[ 3 ]
In fact this would do fairly well as a definition of politics : what determines rank in the absence of objective tests .
[ 4 ]
In high school you 're led to believe your whole future depends on where you go to college , but it turns out only to buy you a couple years .
By your mid-twenties the people worth impressing already judge you more by what you 've done than where you went to school .
[ 5 ] Managers are presumably wondering , how can I make this miracle happen ?
How can I make the people working for me do more with less ?
Unfortunately the constraint probably has to be self - imposed .
If you 're expected to do more with less , then you 're being starved , not eating virtuously .
[ 6 ] Without the prospect of publication , the closest most people come to writing essays is to write in a journal .
I find I never get as deeply into subjects as I do in proper essays .
As the name implies , you do n't go back and rewrite journal entries over and over for two weeks .

Dave Barry is one funny guy .
His column , which has run in the Miami Herald for more than 20 years , has appeared in more than 500 newspapers .
He 's written more than 20 books , all of them big sellers .
So when he came to town last Friday to promote his latest effort , " Dave Barry 's Money Secrets -- Like : Why is There a Giant Eyeball on the Dollar ? " , and to speak at the Commonwealth Club , I made an appointment to chat with him at his downtown hotel .
I figured I 'd write down his clever quips , repeat them in a column and make it appear that I am witty .
Barry , who is 58 , could not have been nicer and was happy to talk .
" Newspapers , " he said right off the bat , " are dead . "
Uh , to be honest , I was hoping for something a little funnier .
But , the more he talked about it , the clearer it became that it is a worthwhile topic for discussion .
And Barry may even be right .
Everyone has heard about cutbacks in the newspaper business , from the big names on the East Coast to the papers in your driveway .
And if there is anyone who typifies the rapid pace of change in the business and its effect on how you get your news , it is Barry .
Barry has taken his place at the Herald and parlayed it into a national soapbox .
He 's a household name -- or as close to one as you 'll find in the newspaper business -- from a time , not so long ago , when newspapers featured personalities and marketed them .
" The era of the writer in the newspaper was in the '70s and ' 80s , " Barry said , " when newspapers were making money no matter what .
They 'd send somebody off to Fiji for a story .
If you knew you had somebody good , you 'd just send them .
You knew they 'd come up with something . "
Barry is a good example of how the dynamic has changed .
When I arrived for the interview , he was finishing a session with a local podcaster .
Frankly , Barry was n't exactly sure where that podcast was headed , but it seemed like a good idea .
For the technologically clueless , a podcast is a recorded file -- an interview , a news story read aloud , whatever -- that can be downloaded to your computer , an iPod or other MP3 player .
Although podcasts seem mysterious and offbeat to the technologically challenged , my sense is -- and reports from The Chronicle 's popular podcast site confirm -- that they have entered the mainstream and are becoming more popular all the time .
Podcasts could be a perfect place for a writer with some flair to show some individuality .
Of course , they must be used correctly .
Barry suggests the best use of a podcast is targeting people with a specific interest in a relatively narrow topic -- say , an interview with a popular humor columnist .
On the other hand , Barry says his wife , Michelle Kaufman , a sportswriter at the Miami Herald , is covering the Winter Olympics in Turin , Italy .
She 's been asked to podcast the Games .
That does n't seem like a bright idea .
" Explain it to them , " Barry remembered telling his wife .
" THE OLYMPICS WILL BE ON TELEVISION !
You 've got people saying , ' Let 's see , I can watch this on my 57 - inch TV in living color , or I can download this thing from the speed - skating rink . "
Or take blogs .
Barry certainly has .
Again , for the technologically clueless , a blog -- shorthand for Web log -- is something of an online diary where people write pretty much anything they want and provide links to interesting topics , Web sites or stories .
Several years ago , Barry created the blog www.davebarry.com.
It features typical " Barryisms , " odd news stories sent in by ubiquitous " alert readers , " columns , and a recurring feature called " A Fine Name for a Rock Band . "
( Most recent submission : Loincloth Outrage . )
" About five years ago , I went to the Herald and I told them , ' I 've got this blog and maybe you 'd like to run it , ' " Barry said .
" And they said , ' It 's a what ? '
But then they had a committee meeting or something and now they want everybody to have a blog .
They want the security guard to have a blog . "
Barry 's blog has taken off like gangbusters , and like podcasts , blogs are the Next Big Thing in journalism .
More and more newspapers are offering blogs covering everything from the local sports scene to the business world .
( See The Chronicle 's " culture blog " and others at sfgate.com . )
So it 's clear that although there may be doubts about the future of the newspaper industry , there are directions in which it can expand and thrive .
The future is digital .
It has to be said , however , that Barry is not optimistic .
A little more than a year ago , he announced that he was taking a sabbatical from his column , and has now decided to make the break permanent .
The reason , he stresses , was not that he had a lack of faith in the industry , but that he was ready to move on .
Still , he has grave doubts about the future of newspapers .
" It has to start with the kids , " he said .
" My son is 25 .
He 's been around newspaper people all of his life .
He does n't get the paper .
That 's the first problem .
The second problem is :
We can no longer compel people to pay attention .
We used to be able to say , there 's this really important story in Poland .
You should read this .
Now people say , I just look up what I 'm interested in on the Internet . "
Meanwhile , for those of us in the newspaper business , Barry provides an easy step - by - step plan of action for surviving in the new world of journalism .
It is simple , really .
Write a column , win the Pulitzer Prize ( his was in 1988 , for commentary ) , write 25 best - sellers , have a television sit -com based on your life ( " Dave 's World " on CBS ) and then move into blogs and podcasting .
I plan to start immediately .
What to Consider when Starting a Software Project Why Projects are not as Successful as they can be ?
Choosing the right software development consultants
Should you hire Computer Science Majors as Programmers ?
Choosing the Right Database The Pitfalls of Forward Planning Choosing the Right Programming Language Report Driven Design Problem Solving My Problem is Your Problem : Problem Solving in Application Architecture
Copyright Paragon Corporation ( October 06 , 2006 )
Choosing your problems
Many people take the false premise that problems are things that are dumped on your lap and that you have no choice about them .
This perhaps is one of the most dangerous premises taken because it reduces your options by narrowing your vision .
For example if you have a piece of software that has a part that does n't work , You really have a couple of problems to choose from How do I fix this software ?
How do I replace this with something that works ?
How do I live with this defect ?
Destroy your Blind Zones
In addition to not recognizing that you can choose your problems , people often have blind zones that cloud their vision of problem options and solutions .
Before you can even make an earnest effort of selecting from a choice of problems and solutions , you need to first eradicate some of these blind zones .
Below are a couple of blind zones that come to mind Sunk thinking : I spent a million dollars on this or spent a lot of time on this .
I have to salvage my investment .
Mob mentality : Everyone else I know uses this and everyone must be right .
No one ever got fired for recommending Oracle .
Marketing hypnosis :
The sales said it was better than the last that I just got to have it and it would solve all my problems .
Aligning with the wrong group :
Their client list is long and impressive .
If it works for IBM , its got to work for me .
Too much money :
We should get the best that money can buy and the most expensive is always the best .
When all projects have the same problem , resources can be plentiful
When all projects have a common problem , resources from all projects can be pooled to solve the common problem .
A problem does not get harder the more people that need the problem solved , but it does get harder and more difficult the more people trying to solve it in a vacuum or with competing agendas .
Align your problem domains
One way to ensure that all your projects have the same problems is to align your problem domains .
There are many ways to do that of course and here we list just a few .
Many companies choose to go the single product route and sell that to many customers or use it for all their projects .
When someone discovers a bug in the software , then 8 times out of 10 , it is a problem that all the users will have .
Fixing the bug fixes it for all users .
Ensure all your building blocks are the same :
Use the same language for all your applications , same OS , the same widgets , and the same database but assemble them differently to achieve different goals .
Standards :
There are many standards that exist in the software industry for this very purpose .
For example we have Ansi-SQL to make all relational databases look similar so that an application can support various brands of databases relatively easily and DBA knowledge is more transferrable .
We 've got web services - WSDL to make discovering and generation of stub - classes simple .
We 've got W3C standards for HTML and webforms so that regardless of what language you choose to develop your web application as long as you produce compliant html , most browsers will consume it happily .
Standards Compliance
By far , I think the most powerful of the above is standards compliance , but it is unfortunately the most difficult to get going and to succeed .
Why is it so much more powerful than the other 2 .
For a couple of reasons .
You can more easily swap out building blocks or software that does the same thing .
Your database vendor pisses you off one day - get another .
You need a database that works on your palmtop , get one .
You have greater control as to how you dice out your problem domains , because you have a wider option of blocks to choose from .
If there is one piece of software that works better for one group than another in the company , that 's okay because it interoperates with the rest of your infrastructure .
People hate it when the boss says " Eat this oatmeal and live with it " and are much happier with " Choose from these various flavors of cereal " Standards are great but hard to execute for a couple of reasons Everyone wants to do it their way ;
You get a group of members of different companies or different departments in a room , and they will want to control the standard by making the standard what they are doing because they have invested a lot of time in what they are doing .
Commercial software vendors have a love - hate relationship with standards .
They want it to fail because it levels the playing ground .
They want it to succeed because it levels the playing ground .
Leveling the playing ground in one way is beneficial for commercial software vendors because it means complimentary software can better work with them .
For a company that controls the particular market , it is often bad - because all the complimentary software is already cow - towing to them .
They do n't need the food - chain leveled .
They do want some standards to succeed because it opens the gateway up for not yet born technologies that can more easily play with them .
Of course they want other complimentary standards to succeed , not the ones that directly affect their market , but the ones that affect their main competitors market ; unless they can control the standard .
People are resistant to change and can't imagine doing things differently .
Again this is a problem with all the above .
This is a problem not just for standards .
There is a tendency to try to solve too much with a standard which makes a standard impossible to implement .
You have to decide on a subset of a domain of problems the standard will solve and decide what is not worth solving for this round .
This requires a high level of communication and coordination .
Often times people whip out grandiose standards without a proof of concept and that is just hard to digest .
A standard is most successful when it is born from a reference implementation .
People fear that if you have standards , then everything is the same .
Creativity is stifled .
Standards are a lot easier to achieve than they were say ten years ago .
The increased visibility with internet , email , blogging , and electronic media makes everyone 's playing cards face up and information travels quickly like bees carrying pollen .
Communication and coordination has reached an unprecedented level .
It is quickly turning from a game of who has the most money to broadcast their message to a game of whose message is compelling enough to be carried by others .
Where is the Creativity in Standards Compliance ?
Standards compliance reduces competition on the interface level , but allows battling on the fringes .
To understand what that means - take two people .
For all intensive purposes , they walk and run the same , but one walks and runs faster .
The one that runs slower can fit in a small car and consumes less food , while the one that runs faster requires a larger car to stretch out his legs and 10 steaks a day .
Standards may tell you what interfaces you must support , but there is often where it stops .
Anything not defined in the standard is free - game .
In fact anything that is free - game , if it is compelling enough eventually finds itself in future standards .
Standards try to take care of the 70 - 80 percent need and leave out the 20 - 30 percent .
With that said , if there are two ways of doing the same thing , of fairly equal or good enough speed , and one way is standards compliant , and one is not - do it the standards compliant way , because it will be much easier to swap out technology with another more appropriate technology .
Align your Agendas : Competing agendas and the WIN - WIN Proposition A problem that all of the above share is that of agreement and competing agendas .
All the above require a mandate or for the group to decide on the best possible course for all .
This is very difficult when what is good for one is not perceived as good for another .
It is important to align your agendas in such a manner that all parties feel like they are getting something and losing little .
Everyone is trying to maximize their piece of the pie with little regard of how their behavior reduces the overall size of the pie .
This is the " Prisoner 's Dilemma " .
So how can the greater good win out over the suboptimal win of the individual participant ?
One way that comes to mind is to state the game differently to each participant such that the sum of the sociological behaviors of the one would be the optimal for all .
To demonstrate - we 'll take a slight twist to the standard Prisoner 's Dilemma game .
In this particular version you have 3 participants 2 Bank Robbers : Prisoner A and Prisoner B
A good friend of both bank robbers - Friend C
The stakes are the usual If A betrays and B stays silent then A goes free and B serves 10 years
If B betrays and A stays silent then B goes free and A serves 10 years
If both stay silent then they both serve 6 months
If both betray then both serve 2 years Now Friend C likes both robbers and is trusted by both .
He wants to achieve the overall optimal solution .
His challenge is to get both to be silent even though both will have to serve jail sentences .
So to do this he tells both of his friends a little story : " I 've been snooping on the cops and they do n't know if either of you are guilty , but they do know that you two were together at the time of the crime and that the robbery was performed by two people .
If you implicate the other you will be implicating yourself . "
The pie looks different from where you are standing " I 've been snooping on the cops and they do n't know if either of you are guilty , but they do know that you two were together at the time of the crime and that the robbery was performed by two people .
If you implicate the other you will be implicating yourself . "
One of the problems with the Prisoner 's Dilemma solutions is that they often assume that the spoils of war look the same to everyone , when in fact that is often far from the truth .
To demonstrate , let 's assume we have the same stakes as stated above , but with a slight twist .
Friend C is trusted by both and likes both .
He knows that A would die if he were to spend 6 months in jail and B would not be great , but he has got lots of friends in the big cell that can sneak him treats and what - not .
Assessing the situation , he concludes that the optimal solution is for A to betray and B to stay silent .
A is a nice guy and would normally stay silent .
B is an all for myself kind of guy and will most likely betray .
C's challenge is to get A to betray and B to stay silent .
He does the following : To A he says - " You know B is going to betray you and say you did it all .
It will be his word against yours . "
To B he says - " I 've been snooping on the cops and they do n't know if either of you are guilty , but they do know that you two were together at the time of the crime and that the robbery was performed by two people .
If you implicate A you will be implicating yourself . "
The point to get across here is that the actual payoff matrix of a game is different for everyone and that a solution that does n't take this into consideration is suboptimal .
You can witness this in general social behavior .
Some people value money most , some people fame , some people knowledge , some people recognition in a specific area , and some just want to eat ice cream in a corner somewhere and be left alone .
Successful Project Management Regardless of what options you choose above , there are a couple of key factors that lead to successful implementation .
A great Leader
One of the most important factors of a successful project is a leader who leads with an invisible hand .
As in our last 2 examples , the prisoners had no idea that they were being manipulated because they trusted their friend .
The most important factor of a successful project is a good leader and one that leads with an invisible hand .
Below are a couple of factors that make a good leader :
Be able to win trust
Be able to see a starting point and filter out the noise
Must have the interest of all involved
Not afraid to make sacrifices
Be able to weigh the options based on the social dynamics of the group , the technological state of the world , and decide the optimal strategy for each group that will achieve the optimal strategy for all
Be able to think in multiple planes and visualize the thread that ties them all together
State the problem for each group so that the group finds the problem interesting and that the group 's optimal strategy is the optimal for all .
Note : a leader , while often a single person and usually starting as a single person , need not be .
It can be a group who can see where their problems intersect and visualize how cooperating can float the whole boat .
Also as stated , a leader need only see the starting point , not the ending point .
The reality of it is that for most interesting projects , there is never an end , so stop looking for it .
Competition and Cooperation Competition is the need that in any given game that there is a side that wins more than the other , whether that be measured in money , fame , or trophies .
The key is more .
No one needs to lose they just can't all win the same .
Competition makes otherwise boring problems interesting .
Competition is a driving force for problem solving in both a good and a bad way .
Without the thought that we are competing , we would be less driven to achieve .
Having different groups trying different approaches to a problem often produces the best set of solutions for various environments , therefore competition should not be discouraged .
Take the example of the Human Genome project .
Competition drove people to work faster to beat the other team and the Human Genome project as a result completed before its scheduled completion .
People have battles that they are more passionate about than others and spoils that they cherish more than others .
This makes them tackle the same problem with different eyes .
In a nutshell , people visualize the pie differently and find certain games more interesting .
Competition can also be dangerous because it often causes labor to be divided in a win-lose proposition .
In order to mitigate the destructive side of competition while taking advantage of the productive side , the spoils of war must be fashioned such that individuals win that piece which is most precious to them and lose that which they care less about .
Competition is between sides and sides are amorphous structures broken down by time , ideology , race , socio- economic strata , space , etc .
In one game you can be competing with one person and in the next that person is in your team .
Often times you are competing against yourself to see if you can do better than you did in the past .
The sides we choose are all dependent on how we visualize our payout structure and sometimes we do n't know which side will give us a better payout structure .
All complex games are the non-linear sum of simpler sub games .
I say non-linear because the outcomes of some of these games effect the outcomes of other sub games .
For example if you kill off a competitor in one game and that competitor could be beneficial in another more important game , you have reduced your chances of winning the overall game .
Your best strategy may be to lose this round to increase your chances of the next .
In that super - game whose side are you on ?
The sides are fluid .

Zwar habe das Internet wahre Wunder vollbracht – der elektronische Handel floriere , und E - Mails seien ein allgegenwärtiges Kommunikationsmittel für rund eine Milliarde Menschen .
Aber " wir stehen an einem Wendepunkt " , behauptet Clark in der aktuellen Ausgabe von Technology Review ( seit dem 23 .

Seine Prognose ist ausgesprochen pessimistisch : " Wir könnten jetzt an dem Punkt stehen , wo der Nutzen des Internets nicht mehr zunimmt – und vielleicht sogar wieder abnimmt . "
Aus diesem Grund sei es an der Zeit , die dem Internet zugrunde liegende Architektur zu überdenken und noch einmal ganz von vorn anzufangen .
" Es geht nicht darum , dass wir versäumt haben , irgendeine Killer - Technologie auf der Protokoll - oder Netzwerkebene einzusetzen " , sagt Clark .
" Wir müssen nur alle existierenden Technologien so kombinieren , dass wir ein grundsätzlich anderes System erhalten . "
Ein solcher Ansatz findet in den USA zunehmend Anklang .
Vorangetrieben wird er vor allem von der National Science Foundation ( NSF ) .
" Ich bin mit dem gegenwärtigen Zustand nicht glücklich " , sagt auch Internet - Guru Vinton Cerf , der kürzlich einen Job bei Google angenommen hat , dessen Bezeichnung eigens für ihn erfunden wurde : Chief Internet Evangelist .
" Aber die größten Schädlinge nutzen noch immer die Löcher in den Betriebssystemen aus .
Diese Betriebssysteme schützen sich selbst nicht sehr gut , und man könnte fragen , warum das Netzwerk diesen Job übernehmen sollte . "
Über eines aber sind sich alle einig : Die Probleme des Internets nehmen zu , und zugleich wird die Gesellschaft zunehmend von ihm abhängig .

For years , the classic black and white sneakers were the staples of any men ’s wardrobe .
But in the last few years , the black and white leather sneakers have been quietly creeping into many business dress codes in New York to Berlin and from there to many other major cities around the world .
They have even written their very own chapters in the history of the industry .
Black was the color of choice .
Then in 2020 , the Nike High came on the scene .
Black and white were replaced by a new color palette – grey , tan , brown , green , blue and of course , black .
That left the shoe industry a little confused as to what would become of this new style of men ’s shoes .
And then came the resurgence .
Leather sneakers have been around for a while .
There are those that date back to the early Romans who used to wear shoes made out of sheep skin and it has survived to modern times .
As a matter of fact , there are even styles of leather shoes that are actually made of suede , a material that is made of the same protein that gives wood its strength and durability .
This material makes it a great material for making shoes but can also be abrasive and can fade the color of the shoes .
However , in the last couple of years , there has been a big push by some designers and manufacturers to give their shoes a more “ modern ” look by using color .
You can find some great pairs that come in several colors but usually , they are paired with dark - colored socks to give them a more classic look .
When you think of leather sneakers , you probably think of the classic black and white .
But , there are other colors to choose from .
For instance , there are dark browns that look great with black but give a different look when paired with white , as does a bright color like orange .
When people hear the word “ black ” they think of a solid black that will not fade or go off .
But , this is not true for many colors .
Dark colors like chocolate brown fade much easier than black , whereas the color known as black can last a long time and can maintain its color even after time and it ’s been sitting in a closet .
However , if you ’re looking for a more muted color , you might want to go with a darker color such as a wine brown .
{ which is a little greyish in color .
or even an ash grey - brown .
If you ’re looking for a really dark color , you might consider going with black but again , it ’s best to keep the color a little greyish and make sure that it ’s not too dark .
With all these choices available , there are plenty of men ’s shoes for anyone .
Whether you want to buy a pair to dress up or dress down , there ’s one that will fit the bill .
There are so many different kinds of leather in men ’s shoes that even though some may think there ’s no need for these shoes , men still want to have their own pair .
It seems women like the comfort and style that leather shoes provide , but men like a bit of variety .
It ’s hard to deny that leather shoes are a real masculine item .
If you ’ve ever had a pair of leather sneakers in your closet , you know that they are something that can really stand out and make you stand out .
Leather sneakers also can add a very professional look to any outfit that you might be wearing .
Whether you ’re on the golf course or a walk through the park , a pair of leather shoes can always be a great way to bring that look that you want .
and feel .
Men always want to be noticed and wearing something that is classy and stylish can go a long way to that .
The great thing about these speakers is that they do n’t have to cost much .
So if you want to wear something a bit more stylish , but still feel like a man , you can find some really great leather shoes at a discount price .
Report : US ' systematically ' violates Geneva , Supreme Court
RAW STORY
Published : Monday July 10 , 2006
Documents delcassified by the Pentagon to a civil liberties organization show that inmates at Guantanamo Bay have been " systematically tortured , " RAW STORY has learned .
The Center on Constitutional Rights ' 51 - page " Report on Torture and Cruel , Inhuman , and Degrading Treatment of Prisoners at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba " is drawn from primary accounts given by current detainees and their American attorneys at the Guantánamo Bay prison .
According to the report , several accounts indicate that physical , psychological , sexual and religious abuse is commonplace at the prison .
Many incidents catalogued by attorneys would be in violation of the Geneva convention , and as such , also in violation of the Court 's ruling .
" I think the torture and abuse detailed here will shock Congress and the American public , " said CCR Legal Director Bill Goodman , " because it reveals a lawless , immoral and ineffective detention facility and undermines the administration 's increasingly desperate attempts to lie about what is happening down there . "
CCR represents over 200 detainees at Guantánamo .
In 2004 , it successfully argued to the Supreme Court that detainees had a right to challenge their detention .
The report is available at CCR 's website .
Desperate to fit in , the young Mike Staver took one of the first steps to burnout : he tried to conform to values and behaviors he did not share .
“ I obsessed on wearing the right Levis and the right Earth Shoes , ” he recalled .
Then he took the second step to burnout : he lashed out .
“ I refused to get a haircut , I refused to do Sunday school lessons , ” he said .
“ I acted like the typical angry teenager . ”
And still , he did not try to control his own life .
He had always been fascinated by airplanes ; he even took flying lessons when he was 16 .
So he applied to what is now the Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology , which specialized in aviation , in Tulsa , Okla .
He was accepted ; his father balked at letting him go .
So Mr. Staver went instead to California Baptist University , 50 miles east of his home , where he majored in business and minored in psychology .
He still planned to become a pilot when he graduated in 1983 , but his father scuttled that one in an unusual way .
” He persuaded me that Staver men have terrible vision and thus ca n’t fly , ” Mr. Staver recalled .
“ I had 20 - 20 eyesight , and still do .
Yet I believed him . ”
So Mr. Staver married a girl whom he had met at church , and went to work analyzing the books at the car dealership where his father worked .
That job lasted a year .
His marriage lasted five .
“ I was a caged animal , an internal cauldron of hostility , and I pretty much killed that marriage , ” he said .
Mr. Staver pumped all his energy into his career , and rose through a series of corporate jobs he did not enjoy , ending up as chief operating officer for a burglar - alarm company .
But then , with the help of a psychotherapist and a book —
“ The Road Less Traveled , ” by M. Scott Peck — he traded in his passive rage for active change .
He enrolled in a night program at National University in San Diego and graduated with a master ’s degree in counseling psychology in 1990 .
He began running general - interest seminars for local hospitals , first on how to recover from broken relationships , then on how to build healthy ones .
Finally , he was doing something he loved .
So , perhaps inevitably , in 1992 he formed the Staver Group .
Mr. Staver remarried in 2000 , but that marriage ended in divorce in 2005 .
His wife was the one who wanted out , he said , and he acquiesced .
“ We ’re still good friends , but I had learned not to invest energy in situations that just can’t work , ” he said .

Back to NetBSD 3.x formal releases
ユーザテストの実施経験者なら、ユーザには相当の個人差があることをご存知だろう。ユーザインターフェイスを楽々と使いこなす人もいれば、行き詰まって身動きが取れなくなってしまうような人もいる。実際に時間を計測したことがなくても、タスクを達成するのが一番速かったユーザと一番遅かったユーザとの差が極めて
大きいことには、おそらくお気づきだろう。
この差がどれほどのものかを知るには、任意の調査データをタスク達成時間順に並べて四分割し、上位と下位の四分位点の比率を出してみれば良い。
Q3 ：四分割の三番目の中で、一番大きな数値。それより右には、 タスク達成に時間を要した 25 % のユーザが分布する。
：四分割の三番目の中で、一番大きな数値。それより右には、
25%のユーザが分布する。 Q1：一つ目の四分割の中で、一番大きな数値。それより左には、タスクを短時間で達成した25%のユーザが分布する。
もう少し説明すると、タスク達成時間が短かった25%のユーザと残りのユーザとを区切るのがQ1、タスク達成に長い時間を要した25%のユーザと残りのユーザとを区切るのがQ3である。半数のユーザは、Q1とQ3の間にいることになり、残りの半分はQ1とQ3の外側にちょうど半数ずつ分布していることになる。Q3をQ1で割り算して比率を出すと、両端に分布するユーザの個人差を測定することができる。
事例の紹 介
ある視線移動調査の結果を使ってQ1とQ3を具体的に見ていこう。Agere Systemsという会社のウェブサイトで所在地を調べるタスクを76名のユーザにやってもらった。タスクを達成した48名分のデータをグラフにしている。（タスクを達成できなかった28名分のデータは使っていないが、なぜ達成できなかったのかを把握することも、もちろん重要だ。そちらについての詳細は、自社情報をウェブサイトでどのように提供するべきかをまとめた別のコラムを参照いただきたい。）
Q3/Q1は、タスクを短時間で達成したユーザと、逆に時間を要したユーザとの差を示すことになる。ある程度の速さでタスクを達成したユーザ（25%はさらに速くタスクを達成し、75%はもっと時間を要した）と、それなりに時間がかかってしまったユーザ（もっと時間のかかったユーザが25%あり、75%はそれよりも速くタスクを達成できた）とを比較することになる。もっとも速かったユーザともっとも時間のかかったユーザとを比較しないのは、端のデータは外れ値の場合が多いからである。
この例で 、Q1は65秒、Q3は188秒であり、Q3/Q1は2.9となる。もっとも速くタスクを達成したユーザは、本社の所在地を28秒で突き止めた。逆に、もっとも時間を要したユーザは、420秒もかかった。最大値と最小値で比率を出すと15という数値になる。本流のユーザエクスペリエンスにこそ関心があるので、端に寄ったデータの比率ではなくQ3/Q1率に注目することにしよう。
これまでに実施してきた70件のウェブサイトやイントラネットの調査結果から、Q3/Q1 = 2.4という数値がはじき出された。同じタスクでも、遅いユーザは速いユーザの2倍以上の時間を要するということである。
他のユーザインターフェイスと比較
ウェブの場合のQ3/Q1率と、他のユーザインターフェイスの場合とを、これまでの調査結果を活用して比較してみることにしよう。
Dennis Eganは、文書編集、情報探索、プログラミングという3種類のコンピュータインタラクションに関する調査結果をまとめている。1994年に実施して未発表のままになっている私の研究で、Macintosh
System 7、NeXTStep（Mac OS Xの礎） 、Windows 3.1のいずれかを使って、一般的なパーソナルコンピューティングタスクを実施してもらい集めたデータもある。売り上げを合算して、eメールで報告するといったタスクだ。
下表は、コンピュータの利用目的別にQ3/Q1率を算出して、ウェブの場合と比較できるようにしたものである。
コンピュータの利用目的 Q3/Q1 文書編集 1.8 パーソナルコンピューティング 1.9 情報探索 2.2 ウェブ利用 2.4 プログラミング 3.0
文書編集は、ここに挙げたタスクの中でもっとも単純なものである。タイピングのスピードやマウスとキーボードの間を手が行き来するのに要する時間など、主に身体能力に依存する。具体的には、段落を移動したり、文字を太字に変えたり、誤植を修正したりといった操作に着目した調査だった。手紙を書いたり、本を執筆したりといったタスク達成時間にもっと個人差が出そうなタスクについては調査されていない。
パーソナルコンピューティングは、もう少し難しい。表計算ソフトで関数を使ったり、複数のアプリケーションを使い分けたりといった面倒なタスクを要求した。しかし、ファイアウォールの設定のような厄介な課題ではなく、職場の生産性向上に寄与する基本的なタスクにのみ着目した。そういった基礎的なPCの利用は、多くの人々がすでに熟知しているため、個人差は比較的小さくなる。
残 り3つのコンピュータインタラクションでは、個人差が大きくなっている。論理的に思考したり、複数のステップをどう進めるかを計画したり、短期記憶にある多数の情報をやりくりしたり、既有知識に関連する新たな情報を解釈したりといった高度なメンタルプロセスが要求されるからだ。
情報探索とウェブの利用はかなり類似する。情報探索がウェブ利用の大部分を成すのだから当たり前ではある。しかし、単に検索エンジンを使っているだけならともかく、ウェブサイトを使っていると、ニュースの見出しページや類似の製品が並んでいる（はずの）カテゴリーページといった様々なリストに出くわして、情報を分類、精査し、解釈することが求められることも多い。情報が見つかって終わりではなく、それを解釈しなければならない。追加情報をどうやって集めるかを考えなければならないことも往々にしてある。（たとえば、見つけたページの信憑性が低かったり、情報量が足りなかったりした場合。）
最後に、プログラミング。ユーザに多くを求めるタスクとなるため、個人差も極めて大きくなる。ソフトウェアの開発で、最良の開発者を雇うことがもっとも大切なガイドラインの一つとされる理由はここにある。出来の良い開発者は、出来の悪い開発者の3倍のスピードで開発をこなし、企業に巨大な利益をもたらすのだ。その分、求められる報酬も高額にはなるが。（もっとも優秀な開発者ともっとも無能な開発者の差で、生産性は20倍も違ってくると一般には言われている。残念ながら、上位1%に入る優秀な開発者を雇えるケースは少ない。しかし、上位25%に入る開発者を探してみることはできるだろう。）
ウェブは難しい ！
タスクが難しくなればなるほど、個人差が大きくなる。能力の限界に近づくにつれ、脳が有する知力（知能や才能とも言い換えられるだろうか。呼び名はこの際、何でも良い）が増すことによる利点は大きくなる。
たとえば、ウェブサイトを使っているときに、6チャンク分の情報を短期記憶に保持していられるユーザは、4チャンクまでしか保持できないユーザよりもずいぶんと有利になる。記憶力の良いユーザは、一度間違えた遷移を繰り返すことはないし、表示されたページが一つ前のページとどのような関係にあるのかを正しく判断することができる。逆に、短期記憶の容量がいくら多くても、単純な文書編集ではそれが足しになることはほとんどない。段落を一つ動かすのに6個もの手続きが求められるようなことのないまともなワープロを使っていればの話だが。
表から分かるように、5種類のコンピュータ利用シーンの中で、ウェブの利用にみられる個人差は二番目に高い。
個人差が高いことは好ましいことではない。なぜなら、質の悪いユーザエクスペリエンスに悩まされているユーザの存在を紛れもなく示しているからだ。短時間でタスクを達成できているユーザがいるということは、つまりそれが可能
だということだ。時間がかかってしまうのは、ユーザビリティ上の問題が原因でなかなか先に進めなかったり、脇道に逸れたりしてしまうからだ。完璧なユーザインターフェイスであれば、どんなときも迷わず操作ができるだろうし、間違った操作をしてしまう危険性もないはずだ。とすると、どんなユーザもほぼ同じ行動をとることになり、タスク達成時間に個人差が出るとしたら、マウスをクリックするスピードの違い程度になることだろう。
プログラミングはもっとも個人差が大きく、難しいタスクが要求される。しかし、これが一番厄介な問題にはならない。というのは、優秀なプログラマーを正当に雇うことができるからだ。つまり、出来の悪いプログラマーは雇わない、という単純明快な解決策があるのだ。
ウェブサイトの場合は、優秀なユーザだけを選んで相手にするという贅沢はあり得ない。ウェブサイトを訪れてくれるユーザであれば、その人の論理的思考能力に関係なく、お相手しなければならない。タスク達成に時間のかかる25%のユーザも、お客様なのだ。
イントラネットの場合も同様である。スキルの高いユーザだけを受け入れるというわけにはいかない。全社員のために用意されているものであり、高度なコンピュータスキルが雇用の際の判断基準になる職種ばかりではない。
政府機関のウェブサイトであれば、あらゆるユーザに役立つものとなっていなければならないのは当然だ。税金を払っている以上、お返しに適正なサービスを受ける権利を誰もが有している。
商業目的のウェブサイトの場合は、消費者全員を相手にする必要がない場合もある。たとえば、B2Bサイトなら、専門領域の専門ユーザのみを読者として想定することもできる。しかし、たとえば温度測定用のプローブを販売していて、測定技師をターゲットにしているとしても、コンピュータ操作に長けた上位25%の技師のみを選んで相手にするというわけにはいかない。技能や知識のレベルに幅があることは間違いないが、将来有望な技師が駆け出しのうちに初めて購入するプローブをあなたのサイトで見ているかもしれないのだ。
ウェブサイトのインターフェイスは、手腕が問われる。相手にするのは、えり抜きの読者ばかりではないからだ。優れたユーザエクスペリエンスを実現し、ユーザパフォーマンスにみられる個人差を減じていくことが特に重要である。

An assumption that dominates American historical studies is that the wealth and prosperity of the country would be much less without the existence of a powerful central government .
This theme is but part of a larger , and now international , orthodoxy that larger political jurisdictions , as long as they are " democratic , " foster liberty and economic growth while smaller ones stifle it .
In Europe , elites hold up an all - European government as the golden road to a brighter and wealthier future .
Others go further , such as Atlantic Monthly correspondent Robert D. Kaplan , and argue that eventual " world governance " by " global elites " is both inevitable and desirable .
Kaplan , whose books are read by high - ranking government officials and journalists , believes that free markets , democracy , and liberty shall thrive under a world regime .
The truth is far different .
All of history attests that the centralization and concentration of power breed despotism .
In the history of European civilization , liberty and civilization have thrived when political power has been dispersed and checked .
Contrast the Greek city states with the polyglot Alexandrian empire , the Roman Republic with the world - sprawling Roman Empire , medieval Europe with 20th century Europe .
The nature of man being what it is , irresponsible , unchecked power has been , and always will be , abused , and there is no better way of rendering state power oppressive than by concentrating rather than dispersing it .
If your children attend a public or private university in this country , they will be taught that President Roosevelt " saved " capitalism from itself with his New Deal legislative program in the 1930s .
They will also be taught as unquestionable truth that the Federalists rescued the fledgling national economy from imminent collapse during the decade following the War of Independence ( 1780s ) , a decade ominously described by statist historians ( are there any other kind ? ) as " the critical period . "
They learn that these years were a tumultuous and tragic follow - up to the Revolution .
Without a strong central authority , the country was convulsed and confused by violent internal rebellion , economic stagnation , the petty rule of " bad men " ( i.e. local - minded and self - interested ) , and national weakness in the face of predatory commercial rivals .
Into this despairing void , stepped a shining band of broad - minded , far - seeing , disinterested , nationalist leaders who realized the impotent and inept government of the Confederation had not the powers to deal with the crisis or guide the country into the regulated , centrally managed future .
Consequently , they led a constitutional revolution which discarded the Articles of Confederation and replaced it with a broad charter of national power , falsely described as federal , that by taxing , regulating , and promoting ( i.e. subsidies ! ) rescued the economy and laid the solid foundation for America 's future growth and prosperity .
Students graduate thinking that were it not for the federal Constitution , we would all be sitting on the front porch of our cabin spitting tobacco , drinking home - made whiskey , and kicking our dog Blue .
The prevailing historical interpretation of the country under the Articles of Confederation is an example of the harm that has resulted from the ignorance of economics among generations of historians .
Let us consider the work of Richard B. Morris , the Columbia University historian , whose book The Forging of the Union , 1781 – 1789 ( 1987 ) is considered the standard history of that decade .
Morris ascribes the postwar depression ( 1784 – 88 ) to four causes : the " dumping " of low - cost British goods upon the American market ( imagine the gall of those sneaky Brits ; you beat 'em in war and then they do this to us ? ) ; the closing of the British West Indies and other foreign markets to American goods ; an unregulated money supply ( it is not clear if Morris thinks the problem was too much , or not enough , money ; apparently , he seems to think that only the Solons and Greenspans destined to run the federal government knew the right amount ) ; and the lack of a national government with national taxing and regulatory powers ( the horror , the horror ) .
For Morris , the calling of a constitutional convention was a necessity recognized by nearly all .
" Businessmen , mechanics , and artisans witnessed a Confederation government incapable of controlling the money supply , of paying interest on the public debt , or of regulating and encouraging foreign and domestic commerce .
Little wonder that these groups recognized the grim necessity for setting up a stronger central government . "
The economy was beginning to thrive again in 1788 , the year the Constitution was ratified , and Morris naturally awards credit to the new government for the change .
" The ratification of the federal Constitution seems to have laid a basis for economic recovery . "
It never occurs to him that the recession was bound to end sometime , or that its end was due to causes unrelated to the creation of a new national authority .
Our best guides to the critical decade of the 1780s are two of the few American historians who understand economics and are true liberals — William Graham Sumner and Murray Rothbard .
Although Sumner was a nationalist and antidemocrat who favored the new constitution for other reasons , he understands as well as Rothbard that the depression of the 1780s was not due to the lack of a powerful central government .
Both explain that after the war , there was a great pent - up demand for British goods , which were preferred to all others , including domestic , both for their quality and their cheapness .
There was also an abundance of specie in the country , due to French and British disbursements , the Havana trade , and French and Dutch hard - money loans .
However , there was also a large quantity of paper money still afloat .
As the paper money was serving as the principal circulating medium , the merchants shipped much of the nation 's specie abroad to help pay for their large importations of capital and consumer goods .
Lacking credit cards , the American consumer was soon " tapped out , " and merchants found themselves holding large stocks of unsold merchandise .
At the same time , there were many manufacturers and mechanics whose businesses had been profitable only during the autarkic wartime conditions .
Now that peace and commerce had resumed , they were in trouble .
An additional negative factor was the British decision to place the Americans on the outside of their colonial system after the war .
The Americans found the British West Indies closed to them , the North Atlantic fisheries forbidden , and the British home market tightly restricted .
( Of course , the British hurt themselves by these restrictions , for the Americans could not buy from them if they could not sell to them ; but they were acting according to the logic of mercantilism and probably revenge . )
A final factor was the capital losses sustained and the debts incurred during the war .
The capital losses had to be made up and the debts paid .
In summation , the Americans were suffering the natural aftereffects of a long war financed by debt and inflation , and exacerbated by the continuing circulation of inconvertible paper currency .
As Sumner records , " misery was great throughout the country , owing to paper money and debt and the losses of the war . "
The postwar depression was a necessary period of hardship during which Americans readjusted to new trade patterns and economic realities , paid debts , and repaired the damage and neglect wrought by war .
No government could have legislated or regulated away these facts of life .
Americans , flush with soaring hopes unleashed by the Revolution , wanted to believe otherwise , but there was no political substitute for hard work , reconstruction , self - denial , and patience .
Regrettably , as is the case so often in our history , many sought political panaceas to escape economic realities .
Mechanics and manufacturers petitioned their state legislatures for protective tariffs to exclude lower cost British - made goods .
Ship builders and owners lobbied for navigation laws to exclude British shipping from American ports , and southern exporters and northern merchants pleaded for retaliatory legislation to force open closed British markets .
Farmers demanded that paper money be issued and lent on the security of land .
Only a few years after independence , Americans were trying to replicate the main features of the British colonial and mercantile system from which they had just freed themselves .
With his usual perspicuity , Sumner observes how the collapse in prices and the prostration of business following a period of currency inflation led to a movement for protective tariffs , setting a recurring pattern .
Here was the first time , but by no means the last , " in which currency errors become intertwined with errors as to foreign trade , a junction which has run through all our history to the present moment [ 1876 ] and which has been productive of mischief . "
The panic and depression of 1819 would give birth to a protectionist movement culminating in the high tariffs of 1824 and 1828 .
The panic of 1837 and the depression of 1839 – 43 would revive protectionism again , leading to the tariff of 1842 .
Sumner also observes that whenever the economy has floundered , many blame foreign trade for somehow draining the country of its wealth .
For instance , James Madison warned in 1786 of " the present anarchy of commerce . "
He blamed the " unfavorable balance " of trade for " draining us of our metals " and furnishing " pretexts for the pernicious substitution of paper money . "
Madison had it exactly backwards .
It was the habit of using paper money that was driving the nation 's specie abroad , as coin would not circulate alongside paper of similar denomination .
Madison 's solution to commercial " anarchy " was a national government with the power to regulate commerce and the money supply .
Not surprisingly , Madison would be one of the authors of the tariff of 1789 .
As president he would sign the tariff of 1816 and the charter for the second national bank .
State Mercantilism during the 1780s
In 1785 and 1786 , New Hampshire , Rhode Island , Massachusetts , and Pennsylvania passed tariffs averaging 15 percent on foreign manufactures .
They also levied taxes on imported " luxuries " to slow the drain of specie .
During the next two years , they extended duties to more products and raised rates as high as 25 percent .
Sumner 's comment on such legislation is devastating and perceptive : " At the return of peace , [ new American manufactures ] were prostrated , and a cry began to be made . . . that the country could not stand free trade , and that it must do as England had always done , that is , imitate the old restrictive system .
The real demand was that some way should be found by law to continue upon the American people , by their own act , the evils which the war had inflicted upon them . "
The evils to which he was referring were high prices and restricted markets .
When discriminatory duties failed to revive the flagging northern economy , supporters blamed their lack of uniformity and application across the confederation , for the southern states had very low tariffs and their citizens continued to buy cheaper and better - made British goods .
The economic historian Curtis P. Nettles , who was a good historian but a bad economist , noted with reproach that the southern legislatures " did not impose adequate protective duties for the benefits of the exports of the northern area .
It followed , therefore , that only a federal tariff law could provide the kind of protection sought by many manufacturers . "
There is ample evidence that northern manufactures supported the federal Constitution because they hoped through uniform national tariffs to capture the southern market .
Alexander Hamilton 's early correspondence as treasury secretary under Washington is full of complaints that Americans continued to buy from abroad and pleas for duties .
Thus , while the Constitution set up a free - trade zone within the states , it also created a closed or captive market , in which Americans would be free to buy within but not without .
Historians like Morris and Nettles contend that without a federal Constitution trade between the states would have been hindered by a multiplicity of restrictive state tariffs and commercial regulations .
Rothbard was one of the few to see that such could not have been the case due to geographical proximity , as well as cultural , linguistic , and ethnic ties among the states .
The American confederation was destined to become a free - trade area , even without a consolidated union .
Hamilton , in Federalist No. 12 , all but admitted , and complained , that such would be the case .
He worried that the multiplicity of state jurisdictions would keep tariffs too low and variable for the raising of sufficient revenue or the provision of industrial promotion .
The relative situation of these States ; the number of rivers with which they are intersected , and of bays that wash their shores ; the facility of communication in every direction ; the affinity of language and manners ; the familiar habits of intercourse — all these are circumstances that would conspire to render an illicit trade between them a matter of little difficulty and would insure frequent evasions of the commercial regulations of each other .
The separate States or confederacies would be necessitated by mutual jealousy to avoid the temptations to that kind of trade by the lowness of their duties .
( Hamilton )
In other words , under the Confederation government , no one state , or even a group of states , could raise tariffs very high on imported goods or inter - state goods for fear of provoking smuggling or losing trade to other states .
For instance , if New York City raised the cost of imported goods too high through tariffs , Connecticut could buy such goods from Boston , and New Jersey could buy from Philadelphia .
However , under a central government empowered to lay uniform national rates , tariff rates could be tripled without consequence .
It is therefore evident , that one national government would be able , at much less expense , to extend the duties on imports beyond comparison , further than would be practicable to the States separately , or to any partial confederacies .
Hitherto , I believe , it may safely be asserted , that these duties have not upon an average exceeded in any State three per cent .
In France they are estimated to be about fifteen per cent , and in Britain they exceed this proportion .
There seems to be nothing to hinder their being increased in this country to at least treble their present amount .
( Hamilton )
The futility of enacting mercantilist legislation within a confederated polity was also demonstrated with regard to the navigation laws .
In 1784 , northern legislatures began penalizing British shipping by laying additional duties upon goods imported in British bottoms .
New Hampshire , Massachusetts , and New York doubled tariffs on goods arriving in British ships while Rhode Island tripled them .
To make sure that a British ship would be as rare a sight in their port as a Chinese junk , New Hampshire , Massachusetts , and Rhode Island went so far as to prohibit British ships from transporting American exports .
However , despite their severity , none of these laws proved effective , and within two years of their passage the states moved to repeal them .
Nettels explained why such laws " proved to be defective when used by only a few states . "
Apparently , it encouraged British shippers to go to nearby states and use them as bases for distributing European goods and for obtaining American produce .
The readiness of Connecticut to receive British vessels without subjecting them to penalties forced Rhode Island virtually to suspend its act , lest it lose trade to its western neighbor .
So also the assembly of New Hampshire moved to suspend its law until New York and Connecticut should adopt similar acts .
Otherwise , much of New Hampshire 's trade would be diverted from Portsmouth to the Connecticut River route .
Massachusetts repealed its law in July , 1786 , because , as Governor Bowdoin explained , other states , refusing to cooperate , had tried to use it for one - sided advantage .
( Nettles )
In other words , under the Confederation , navigation laws were fruitless .
Sumner believed this realization furnished a powerful motive for northern shippers to support the new constitution .
" The Eastern States wanted the Constitution chiefly in order to get such a law [ i.e. a uniform navigation law ] . "
Funding the Federal and State Debts
The War of Independence saddled the country with an enormous debt .
In 1784 , the total federal debt was nearly $ 40 million .
Of that sum , $ 8 million was owed to the French and Dutch .
Of the domestic debt , government bonds , known as loan - office certificates , composed $ 11.5 million , certificates on interest indebtedness $ 3.1 million , and continental certificates $ 16.7 million .
The certificates were noninterest bearing notes issued for supplies purchased or impressed , and to pay soldiers and officers .
To pay the interest and principal of the debt , Congress had twice proposed an amendment to the Articles granting them the power to lay a five percent duty on imports , but amendments required the consent of all thirteen states .
Rhode Island and Virginia rejected the 1781 impost plan while New York rejected the 1783 revised plan .
Without revenue , except for meager voluntary state requisitions , Congress could not even pay the interest on its outstanding debt .
Meanwhile , the states regularly failed , or refused , to meet the requisitions requested of them by Congress .
While most historians have seen these failures as evidence of the imbecility of the Confederation government and the selfishness of the states , at least one , Sumner , regarded the " no " votes as justifiable and praiseworthy .
In his view , the opposition believed that Congress could not be trusted to use its new revenue only to pay interest on the debt and gradually retire the principal .
They believed that much of the funds would go to the building up of an unnecessary civil service bureaucracy .
" Between 1783 and 1789 , the Continental Congress year by year demanded of the people sums of money for a peace establishment far beyond what was necessary , and . . . the people , by refusing the funds , forced the retrenchment or abandonment of the main features of a great civil establishment , which in fact was not needed . "
Hurrah .
Due to the delay and uncertainty of final payment , the value of the certificates depreciated significantly .
The loan - office variety fell to as low as 20 cents on the dollar while the continental certificates fell to ten cents .
Most Americans who had received the certificates were farmers , storekeepers , small merchants , and veterans of modest wealth .
They needed cash to run their businesses or farms , to feed a family , or just survive .
Holding them for " a rise " was simply not an option .
They had to sell them for whatever they could get .
Hence , by the mid-80s , a few wealthy speculators held most of the continental certificates .
A far larger percentage of the loan - office certificates remained with their original owners , but even they tended to become concentrated in fewer hands .
Although public security holders had a direct and obvious monetary interest in a new national authority with the authority to raise funds to pay the interest and principal in specie , historians have vigorously debated the significance of this motive in the movement for a national Constitution .
The progressive historian Charles A. Beard shocked , shocked , the nation in 1913 with the publication of his Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States .
He pointed out that those who wanted a new national government were personally interested in the outcome , standing to benefit financially if it was ratified .
Beard pointed out that " large and important groups of economic interests were adversely affected by the system of government under the Articles of Confederation , namely , those of public securities , shipping and manufacturing , money at interest ; in short , capital as opposed to land . "
After failing to strengthen the Articles through amendments , the leaders of these groups united behind an effort to institute a new government with the powers to raise taxes , fund the debt , enact tariffs and navigation laws .
One would have thought that Beard had simply stated the obvious truth of the matter , however obscured until then by iconography and mindless patriotism .
The correspondence of Alexander Hamilton , one of the leading men behind the movement for a national constitution , alone would seem to confirm Beard 's thesis .
In a 1781 letter to Robert Morris , he contended that " a national debt . . . will be to us a national blessing .
It will be a powerful cement of our union . "
As treasury secretary of the new government in 1790 , he advocated the federal assumption of outstanding state debts on the grounds of " its tendency to strengthen our infant government by increasing the number of ligaments between the government and the interests of individuals . "
Furthermore , besides seeing this political benefit , Hamilton believed funding the revolutionary debts at full value , and assuming those of the states , would create " a capital in the public obligations which was before dead , and . . . convert it into a powerful instrument of mercantile and other industrious enterprise . "
Sumner ridicules Hamilton 's idea that funding the government debt would create capital in the form of bonds .
Such bonds represented nothing but the government 's promise to draw upon the real capital of the country through taxation .
Hamilton was not only a nationalist but an Anglophile mercantilist who believed that England 's funded debt , national bank , protective tariffs , and navigation acts were the foundation of that kingdom 's commercial , manufacturing , and naval prosperity .
He wanted to replicate not only the key features of the British constitution but the entire edifice of British mercantile , fiscal and financial architecture .
Sumner concluded that Hamilton 's writings " show a remarkable amount of confusion in regard to money , capital , and debt , in the mind of a man who has a great reputation as a financier . "
The last two generations of historians have rejected Beard 's thesis as conspiratorial and simplistic .
One of the best of them , Forrest McDonald , a neo-Federalist , even wrote an entire book , We the People ( 1992 ) supposedly refuting Beard and vindicating the disinterested , generous , noble intentions of those behind the writing and ratification of the Constitution .
While McDonald succeeds in pointing out where Beard overstated his case or failed to account for the full complexity and mixture of motives behind the nationalist movement , he utterly fails to discredit the Beard thesis .
Rather , his research tends to confirm it at many points .
Security holders were a major force behind the Constitution in Connecticut , Massachusetts , and other eastern states .
Meanwhile , social democratic historians , finding economic history to be boring and hard , and primary research rather time consuming , would rather spend their time projecting their egalitarian fantasies upon the framers , whom they contend were really closet feminists and abolitionists who cleverly slipped a " loaded " constitution upon the unsuspecting but charmingly credulous nation .
They created an " Alien - like " document that in time could be used to force racial and gender equality , and welfare programs , upon a profoundly evil , patriarchic , and racist society , a kind of Bolshevik - style revolution from above .
Nettels summarizes the five benefits that Hamilton and his fellow national mercantilists believed would accrue from long - term government bonds .
( My critique follows in italics . )
First , the bonds would provide a secure , interest bearing investment .
True , but only at the price of diverting capital from private enterprise to public projects .
Second , businessmen could use them as collateral for loans .
True , but their very security would encourage less circumspection on the part of lenders and of course obligate the taxpayer to recoup the losses from bad loans .
Third and fourth , they could be used to buy capital goods and discharge debts abroad .
Yes , but so what ?
Bills of exchange and specie could do the same , and could do so without obligating taxpayers to pay the sum involved .
Fifth , by serving as a substitute currency for large payments , they would increase the supply of currency at home .
Here is the seeming ineradicable fallacy that multiplying currency increases wealth and prosperity .
Rothbard began but never completed the fifth volume to his American history series Conceived in Liberty .
In the fascinating and brilliant fragment that remains , he suggests that the confederation Congress should have divided up the federal debt among the states according to their population .
He cites the historian E. James Ferguson who points out , " The idea was supremely practical , " and " it accorded with [ confederal ] nature of the Union and the predilections of the States . "
It even began to be carried out in practice .
By the end of 1786 , New York , Pennsylvania and Maryland had assumed nearly $ 9 million of federal securities ( by exchanging them for state securities ) , almost one - third of the total .
The nationalists were not about to consent to such a resolution , for it would deprive them of the support of the investor classes .
Ferguson again : " Congress would have been left with depleted functions and little reason to claim enlarged powers .
Creditors would have attached themselves to the states , and no ingredients would have remained to attract the propertied classes to the central government . "
Rothbard writes : " By the end of 1786 , then , the Nationalist program was in full rout . "
Congress had failed to secure a federal impost or a navigation act .
" Its requisitions were failing and its eagerly assumed public debt was rapidly being whittled away by the states , and it could not even meet any of the payments on its $ 10 million of foreign debt .
Lacking independent federal revenue , the natural course would have been the disintegration of federal credit and power , and a full resumption of the decentralized policies that had been the initial consequence and the long - range promise of the American Revolution . "
Some have pointed to the likelihood that had the states assumed the federal debt many would have retired it at its depreciated , current market value , for some states ( e.g. , Virginia ) were retiring their state debts this way .
They contend that this would have been unjust to the original creditors .
Yet , as Rothbard points out , most of the continental debt was no longer in the hands of its original owners .
Funding at its full face value would simply have conferred a vast subsidy upon the wealthy investor classes .
In other words , it would have constituted an enormous transfer of wealth ( through taxation ) from the mechanic and agrarian classes to the merchants and speculators who had bought up the debt for a fraction of its face value .
The farmer and soldier who had been paid for his capital and labor with a depreciating certificate , which they would have to sell to live , would then be doubly wronged , first by confiscation , then by taxation .
Only the original owners of the loan - office certificates were entitled to full compensation .
Shay 's Rebellion and the Ratification of the Constitution
Alas , the nationalists took advantage of a propitious rebellion , that of Daniel Shays , a former Continental Army officer .
Shay and other local leaders led an uprising of distressed farmers from western Massachusetts groaning under the load of heavy taxes assessed to pay the interest and principal ( at face value in specie ) of the state 's wartime debt .
During an economic depression , with farm prices low and foreign markets closed , the state government was taxing the farmers ( payable in hard money only ) to pay wealthy eastern creditors who had lent depreciated paper ( accepted at full face value ) to the state government for bonds during the war .
The farmers either could not or would not pay , and when they failed to do , state judges were quick to confiscate their farms .
The farmers organized into a militia and marched on the courts , which they closed .
Seeing an opportunity , the nationalist leaders were quick to misrepresent the grievances and aims of the insurgents .
They claimed that the Shaysites , and similar groups in other states , were radical inflationists , communists , and levelers out to defraud their creditors and redistribute property , instead of being , what in truth they were , property - owning , anti-tax rebels who wanted to keep their farms .
Obviously , the nationalists wanted to scare the country into supporting a more vigorous government .
George Washington was terrified .
" We are fast verging toward anarchy and confusion , " he wrote .
His nationalist friends did their best to heighten his terror .
Henry Knox wrote Washington of the Shaysites that " their creed is that the property of the United States " having been freed from British exactions " by the joint exertions of all , ought to be the common property of all . "
This was utterly false , but it did the trick .
Washington agreed to be the presiding officer at the constitutional convention .
Later , Madison in Federalist No. 10 warned that without the strong arm of a vigorous central government , the states would be vulnerable to movements motivated by " a rage for paper money , for an abolition of debts , for an equal division of property " and for other " improper or wicked project [s ] . "
The Massachusetts historian Mercy Otis Warren , a contemporary of these events , warned of " discontents artificially wrought up , by men who wished for a more strong and splendid government . "
We know the consummation .
The nationalists were able to exploit the situation sufficiently to secure a federal convention to be held in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787 .
Exceeding their instructions ( which were only to draw up a few amendments ) , the delegates decided to throw out the Articles altogether and write a new national constitution which was subsequently ratified by the states ( but not without considerable opposition and probably a national majority opposed to it ) .
Rothbard described it as the triumph of " a radically nationalist program that would recreate as much as possible the pre-liberal situation existing before the Revolution .
. . .
In short , they were able to destroy much of the original individualist and decentralist program of the American Revolution . "
We live with the consequences today .
Thus do we see how the period of the Articles of Confederation was not characterized by chaos and increasingly bad economic times , as historians tend to assume .
Rather , the Articles proved themselves to be a perfectly viable structure for a free society , encouraging trade and prosperity and adherence to the highest ideals of 1776 .
The driving forces for the creation of the central government with the Constitution involved economic imbalances and debts leftover from the war with Britain .
The federalists , ideologically attached to protectionist and nationalist theories , exploited both real and false fears in the hope of resolving these imbalances , but they ended up by recreating what the founding generation had struggled so hard to overthrow ten years earlier .
The strong central authority they created would in time reproduce every statist feature of the British system — political corruption , perpetual debt , debilitating taxation , consolidated power , and a global empire .
Such was not the promise of the Revolution .
AUSTIN , Texas —
One reason despair is not an option is because things can always get worse , and then what ’ll we do ?
I was actually trying to figure that out when I came across a remarkable article written for The Nation magazine ( known for its liberalism for 141 years ) by Richard J. Whalen — a conservative in good standing , a former Nixon staffer .
Whalen has undertaken the singularly valuable task of talking to dissenting generals about the war in Iraq .
I suppose one could argue , and I am sure someone will , that these are mostly retired generals .
Some , like Lt. Gen. William Odom , are calling Iraq “ the worst strategic mistake in the history of the United States . ”
And they are retired precisely because of their opposition to Iraq .
“ The only question is whether a war serves the national interest , ” one retired three - star told Whalen .
“ Iraq does not . ”
Whalen writes :
“ The dissenting retired generals are bent on making Iraq this nation ’s last strategically failed war — that is , one doggedly waged by civilian officials largely to avoid personal accountability for their bad decisions .
A failed war causes mounting human and other costs , damaging or entirely destroying the national interest it was supposed to serve . ”
During Vietnam , senior soldiers kept quiet .
But after it ended , officers , including Colin Powell , “ vowed it would never happen again . ”
But Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the other civilians in charge overruled the military minds and ignored the possible consequences .
Some of Whalen ’s and the generals ’ clearest points come from breaking the unspoken ban on comparing Iraq to the Vietnam War .
Do n’t know if you noticed this , but from the beginning anyone who spoke right up and said , “ This is just like Vietnam , ” had the experience of right - wingers landing on them , screeching : “ This is not like Vietnam .
This Is Not Like Vietnam .
THIS IS NOT LIKE VIETNAM . ”
Of course it is .
We just have n’t wasted 57,000 American lives yet .
Odom tells
Whalen that “ our objectives in Vietnam passed through three phases to defeat .
These were ( 1 ) 1961 - 65 , ‘ containing ’ China ; ( 2 ) 1965 - 68 , obsession with U.S. tactics , leading to ‘ Americanization ’ of the war and ( 3 ) 1968 - 75 , phony diplomacy and self - deluding ‘ Vietnamization . ’
Iraq has now completed two similar phases and is entering the third . ”
In late September , it was reported that the National Intelligence Estimate for April said the war in Iraq is creating more terrorists : “ A large body of all - source reporting indicates that activists identifying themselves as jihadists … are increasing in both number and in geographic distribution .
If this trend continues , threats to U.S. interests at home and abroad will become more diverse , leading to increasing attacks worldwide . ”
The administration has released three pages of the 30 - page report .
We may see the rest of it , but not until after the election .
It ’s difficult to argue this war with people who look straight at you and say : “ Stay the course .
Do n’t cut and run . ”
We ca n’t even get reasonable discourse on the report , the work of 16 U.S. intelligence agencies and signed by Bush ’s man , John Negroponte .
Meanwhile , the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health now estimates about 655,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed in this war .
All the work in the study fell to a knee - jerk response from conservatives , “ Oh , that ca n’t be right . ”
Yet the methodology employed is the same as is used by the federal government to decide how to spend millions of dollars every year .
It is , as they say , the industry standard .
Speaking of money , though ’tis a pittance compared with lives , we are also wasting billions , as the new “ showcase ” Iraq police academy demonstrates .
It seems we are trying to create a police force in Iraq loyal to the state by housing them in a place with water and feces running down the walls .
Further , we ’re going to have to spend millions and millions to investigate how we frittered away billions and billions .

Interessant wäre mal eine Neuauflage mit aktuellen Bildern und eine umgekehrte Darstellung .
A mysterious communication arrived via my agent .
It 's a letter purporting to be from a lawyer which , as far as I can tell , seems to be ordering me to take down a link to a website , without actually ever giving the actual URL of the website I am meant to have linked to .
The letter also seems to be suggesting that I own or control or have something to do with a website ( http://www.tomatoesareevil.com/ ) that I manifestly do n't , as the simplest websearch or WHOIS check would tell you .
In addition it talks about me infringing the trademark and copyright , by linking , of a mostly forgotten movie .
A Google for the web - site of the movie in question ( which I vaguely remember as being a bad film that aspired to be " so bad it 's good " but never got there ) revealed an official website with 77 links to it , none of which , I 'm happy to say , according to a Google link - search I did , came from www.neilgaiman.com
Are they real lawyers , the people who wrote this odd letter , the kind who went to law school ?
Are they actually billing someone for writing these " take down your non-existent link to an unspecified website " letters ?
Is it an internet prank ?
Is there really a " Mark I. Reichenthal " , a " Branfman and Associates " , a " Beth Reno " ?
Are they perhaps surrealist lawyers , or cooler than that , Dada lawyers , who have decided to spread artistic confusion and mystery across the web with their " legal letters " ?
I 'm posting the letter here in the hope that one of my readers can shed light on its myriad puzzles for me , and also , if it is indeed , as I would like to think , a Dada art event , that others can bask in its aesthetic glow .
( Personally , I shall take it as a reminder that I 'm meant to finish making the labels for the demonic salsa jars and send them out to do good in the world . )
( You 'll need to click on the pages to enlarge them enough to read them . )
For it was fitting that he , for whom and by whom all things exist , in bringing many sons to glory , should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering .
For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified have all one origin .
That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren , saying , " I will proclaim thy name to my brethren , in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee . "
And again , " I will put my trust in him . "
And again , " Here am I , and the children God has given me . "
Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood , he himself likewise partook of the same nature , that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death , that is , the devil , and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage .
For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned but with the descendants of Abraham .
Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect , so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God , to make expiation for the sins of the people .
For because he himself has suffered and been tempted , he is able to help those who are tempted .
Wikipedia and other online databases provide a soupy morass of information , but where can we find the variety of views that leads to wisdom ?
" Just who would want to vandalise an entry on cheese ? " wonders Skip , a Wikipedia administrator .
Watching the online encyclopaedia 's raw submission queue in real time can be unnerving .
The online reference site that anyone can edit is defaced 20 times a minute and cheese , it seems , is one of the most popular targets for creative embellishment .
In the administrator 's console , another fresh article - Wikipedia has more than a million now - scrolls past : " James is my fren , " it reads in its entirety .
Robert McHenry , a former editor - in - chief of Encyclopaedia Britannica , has described Wikipedia as " a game without consequences " .
BBC Radio 1's afternoon
DJs recently took turns to deface each other 's entries live on air .
MPs have joined in , too .
But as Skip begins to guide me through the arcane and often Kafkaesque bureaucracy of Wikipedia , vandalism starts to look like the least of its problems .
Skip is n't his real name or his Wikipedia identity .
It 's a pseudonym the 30 - year - old Silicon Valley IT professional uses as he documents the inner machinations of the project , along with a dozen other Wikipedia administrators , on a site called WikiTruth ( www.wikitruth.info).
Wikipedia , endlessly replicated on the web , is one example of a glut of hazy information , the consequences of which we have barely begun to explore , that the internet has made endlessly available .
Is Wikipedia really the best the net can offer - and if it is n't , where should we be looking for the answers ?
While plenty of people nurse resentments against Wikipedia , having failed to win a consensus for their views , Skip 's colleagues at WikiTruth have a different motivation .
Branding themselves the true keepers of the flame , they argue Wikipedia 's wounds are self - inflicted and unnecessary .
When the business author Nicholas Carr identified last October a typically banal Wikipedia entry ( http://tinyurl.com/8mr5x), he prompted a rare admission .
Wikipedia 's co-founder and site owner Jimmy Wales agreed , calling the examples Carr cited " horrific crap " .
Yet these articles were mature , Carr pointed out , and had been edited hundreds of times .
Might the mass participation be hurting , not helping ?
Gradual deterioration
This gradual deterioration afflicts any utopian online space , and Skip ruefully notes even the best Wikipedia work - its catalogue of featured articles of the week - degenerates once out of the spotlight .
That is n't true , of course , of printed work such as Britannica 's entries .
But the encyclopaedia company has been hit hard , first by the arrival of CD - Rom - based rivals such as Microsoft 's Encarta in 1993 , and then the net .
In 1996 it laid off its door - to - door sales staff .
In 1994 it launched a website .
The rise of Wikipedia as an " online encyclopaedia " has added to the pressure .
Now , though , Britannica has been taking the offensive .
The company strongly rebutted a study conducted by journalists at Nature magazine that compared Wikipedia favourably to Britannica , and which was accompanied by an editorial plea for the scientific community to contribute to the project .
The study blind - tested extracts from each site with experts , and was widely reported as showing them to be of comparable quality .
" It should have said 31 % less reliable and worse written , " McHenry says of the Nature study .
Britannica , meanwhile , says the study was biased towards Wikipedia .
" It 's offensive to lump these gross offences against publishing with a typo in Britannica , " says its executive editor Theodore Pappas .
Britannica said Nature cited passages not in the encyclopedia and criticised it for refusing to publish the referees ' reports .
Nature says it stands by its report and can't release the full reports for confidentiality reasons .
Nature 's news editor Jim Giles denies the journal had identified itself closely in the Wikipedia camp .
" Each has its merits , " he says .
" In our editorial , we simply argued that Wikipedia has potential and scientists can help realise that potential . "
Britannica 's president Jorge Cauz identifies a homogeneity online he finds unsettling .
" Internet discourse has the ability to negate the diversity of voices , and no one can differentiate between truth and myth , " he says .
" It 's a hall of mirrors , " agrees Michael Gorman , the Briton who is president of the American Library Association ( ALA ) , " and it 's very addictive . "
But for participants , the appeal fades , notes Skip .
Some of Wikipedia 's most valued contributors have left in the past year , with two waves of departures in recent months , he says .
Former administrators speak of burnout , brought on by bureaucratic warfare .
Now Wikipedia faces a fork .
If it tightens its open approach , it risks losing its most active participants , for whom Wikipedia is a utopian cause .
Away from the hurly - burly of Wikipedia , even current events can seem oddly remote and processed once they are viewed online .
Google News , for example , employs computer algorithms similar to those used in spam filters to identify and present the news .
In looking for similarities , the news is homogenised and breaking stories fail to rise to prominence .
For the veteran researcher Daniel Brandt , who taught CIA whistleblower Philip Agee how to use computers , much of what a human editor provides is lost .
" What 's gone is any sense of ' a scoop ' or ' an important development ' or ' new information that puts a new slant on an ongoing story ' .
There 's no authority , no perspective and no sense of historical continuity .
It 's a dumbing - down process , " says the Texas - based Brandt .
Google News had a serendipity now missing , mourns the veteran blogger Jorn Barger .
When it appeared in 2002 , " the top article might come from anywhere in the world or in small - town America but people complained , I guess , that unwelcome perspectives were getting too much prominence and Google tweaked the algorithm , " Barger wrote last year .
How then are we coping with this glut of unreliable information ?
Some are doing better than others , suggests Will Davies , a senior fellow at the Institute of Public Policy Research .
For Davies , the accumulation of information is no substitute for critical thinking and the problem is it begins to provide its own self - justification .
" It 's a false supposition we can endlessly delay having to interpret and judge things by stacking more and more bits of data in front of us , " he says .
" That data is a comfort blanket in a way - we all do this .
People are becoming addicted to getting more information all the time .
You can see it when they get out their BlackBerrys as soon as they 've stepped off a plane . "
For the former journalist and author Dan Gillmor , this aggregation of information technology enables is synonymous with wisdom .
" My readers by definition know more than me , " he said recently .
" They have facts we do n't know . "
But is the widespread availability of technology generating such wisdom or even improving our learning ?
For the ALA 's Gorman , who in the 1990s wrote for librarians an influential guide to evaluating technology trends , such claims are risible .
" No one would tell you a student using Google today is producing work as good as they were 20 years ago using printed sources .
Despite these amazing technical breakthroughs , these technologies have n't added to human wellbeing . "
Davies agrees .
" It has n't made us addicted to education , " he notes .
Nor do the skills required to aggregate information quickly and multitask between information streams encourage understanding .
Byproducts of businesses
And while technology enthusiasts celebrate the destruction of old industries , Gorman warns technology has failed to create economic conditions to take their place .
Quality information costs money to edit but the best online collections of data - in what is sometimes called the " deep web " - are byproducts of successful print businesses .
Lose these , he suggests , and we 're left with the banality of Google and Wikipedia .
Davies is more optimistic .
People will return to traditional publishers as they see the consequences of the wiki approach , he thinks , and there will be an audience for both .
But supposing these businesses survive .
Will the world be able to read them ?
Google 's relationships with publishers are fraught - its Print project is the subject of lawsuits - but this dispute may be of less lasting significance than we think .
In the US in the 1980s , a movement was born to bring the best of these expensive information collections to the public , free at the point of delivery .
This movement predated the public internet and may yet transform it beyond recognition .
Libraries began to negotiate collectively for access to databases , which their copyright holders today would never let the public view through Google .
The members of San Francisco 's Public Library , for example , can access the full Encyclopaedia Britannica , Lexis Nexis and more than 70 databases from any browser , simply by entering their library card number .
It has n't been easy , points out Susan Hildreth , the city 's former chief librarian and now California State Librarian .
The state 's sheer size steers some database owners to making deals with smaller regional libraries .
But it 's not difficult to imagine churches or community groups taking advantage of such a model .
It 's been a success and real library usage has increased , she says .
For Davies , we can be proud we have made a success of the technology infrastructure - laying down the pipes - but we have neglected the social institutions necessary to make them work .
Obstacles remain to bringing the successful collective licensing model to the UK .
It costs money and Gorman notes funding for US libraries is higher than for Britain 's impoverished public services .
And the utopian dreams of what Carr calls the " cult of the amateur " die hard .
" It 's hard to tell someone who 's devoting 40 hours a week to Wikipedia that it 's going to fail , " says Skip .
" But it will . "
He returns to his console .
Somewhere in cyberspace , a Wikipedia editor is correcting the encyclopaedia 's article for cheese .

( CNN ) -- The United States on Thursday vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding Israel halt its attacks in Gaza .
The proposal also demanded that Palestinian militants release the Israeli soldier abducted June 25 in a raid in Israel and stop launching rockets at Israel from Gaza .
In addition , it called on Israel to release Palestinian government officials and lawmakers it took into custody after the soldier 's abduction .
Ten nations on the council voted in favor of the resolution , and four abstained .
John Bolton , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said that " in light of the fluid events on the ground , " the United States believed the Qatar - sponsored resolution was untimely and out of date , and would have helped inflame passions in the Middle East .
As one of the five permanent members on the Security Council , the United States has veto power over resolutions .
Earlier Thursday , the United Nations called fighting between Hezbollah militants and Israel a " major crisis " and said it was sending a diplomatic team to the region .
A U.N. statement said the team will urge all parties to exercise restraint .
The three - member team first will visit Cairo to meet with Egyptian officials and consult with Arab League Foreign Ministers , who will be meeting there Saturday .
Vijay Nambiar , Alvaro de Soto and Terje Roed Larsen are also expected to travel to Israel , the occupied Palestinian territories , Lebanon and Syria , with other stops added as needed .
Israel has bombed runways at civilian and military airports in Lebanon , as well as a Hezbollah - run television station in response to Wednesday 's abduction of two Israeli soldiers .
It also has imposed a full naval blockade on the country .
Hezbollah fighters have been lobbing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel .
( Full story )
Lebanese Interior Minister Ahmed Fatfat called the airport strikes a " general act of war . "
He said they had nothing to do with Hezbollah but were , instead , an attack against Lebanon 's " economic interests , " especially its tourism industry .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Wednesday said the attack and abductions were an " act of war " and said the Lebanese government would be held responsible for the soldiers ' safe release .
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he is concerned that a " regional war is mounting " with Israel 's military campaigns in Lebanon and Gaza , where forces were deployed after last month 's capture of an Israeli soldier .
" This is not our interest and will not bring peace and stability to the region , " Abbas said , referring to " this [ Israeli ] aggression . "
Bashar Ja'afari , Syria 's ambassador to the United Nations , said Thursday that Syria supports Hezbollah because it is engaging in " national resistance against foreign occupation . "
Ja'afari said the roots of the current conflict go far beyond the recent escalation of tensions .
" The Arab - Israeli conflict did not start with the capture of an Israeli soldier in Gaza or two other Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon .
The Arab - Israeli conflict is 60 years old , and nobody was giving any care to solving this conflict , " he said .
" Those who should be blamed are the Israeli policies , not the Arab policies . "
Asked whether Syria has direct contact with Hezbollah , Ja'afari said , " We have been having direct contacts with everybody , except , of course , the American administration and the Israeli side . "
President Bush , speaking during a trip to Germany , said that " Israel has a right to defend herself . "
But he warned that Israel should take care not to weaken Lebanon 's government .
" The democracy of Lebanon is an important part of laying a foundation of peace in that region , " Bush said .
Bush also said Syrian President Bashar al - Assad " needs to show some leadership toward peace . "
Ja'afari said Damascus " is deploying a huge effort within the Arab circles ... as well as at the international level through direct contacts . "
" We are doing our utmost , " he said .
" Saturday there will be a meeting of Arab foreign affairs ministers in Cairo to discuss the Israeli escalation .
We will do our best .
But , mainly speaking , those who have the upper hand with regard to the Security Council should deal with the Arab - Israeli conflict in its ... wider spectrum . "
Bush said the United States was working to calm the situation .
" We 've got diplomats in the region .
Secretary of State [ Condoleezza ]
Rice , who is here , is on the phone talking to her counterparts .
I 'll be making calls , " Bush said .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the abduction of the soldiers was unacceptable and blamed Hezbollah for starting the crisis .
The European Union reportedly condemned the fighting and criticized Israel for using what it called " disproportionate " force .
It said the blockade of Lebanon was not justified .
" Actions which are contrary to international humanitarian law can only aggravate the vicious circle of violence and retribution , " the EU president said in a statement , according to Reuters .
Hezbollah is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel , but the Islamic militia is a significant player in Lebanon 's fractious politics .
Its leader , Hassan Nasrallah , told reporters Wednesday that abducting the soldiers was " our natural , only and logical right " to win freedom for Hezbollah prisoners held by Israel .
Nasrallah said the two soldiers had been taken to a place " far , far away " and that an Israeli military campaign would not win their release .
The new fighting on Israel 's northern border comes amid a two - week - old Israeli campaign in Gaza in search of Israeli army Cpl. Gilad Shalit , a soldier captured by Palestinian militants there .
newswire article reporting portland metro actions & protests | police / legal October 5th , the pig riot author : Bash I have been to many protests , witnessed countless acts of police brutality , but none compare to what I saw today .
Bean bag guns , pepper spray , rubber bullets , and billy clubs ; all of them used to attack peaceful protestors .
Friends of mine were trampled by horses , beaten by billy clubs , and peppersprayed severely .
All in an disgusting display of extreme police brutality .
My hands are still shaking and my eye still hurts from pepper spray so I will try to write this as best as I can ...
The rally began at 12:00 , in Park and Main .
Around 18 students in my school ( located on 12th and Main ) walked out of school to participate in the protest .
Prior to the protest some students and I were deeply dissatisfied with World Ca n't Waits comments about discouraging direct action , and had absolutely no idea what the protest would be like .
We arrived at the park blocks seeing a crowd of maybe 500 people listening to speeches .
The majority of the population was middle aged liberals , but there were also a good number of students there as well .
After a couple speeches , an incredibly inspiring woman gave a speech about the importance of direct action .
She questioned world can't wait about their ridiculous statements discouraging direct action .
Some world can't wait organizers booed her , which was incredibly disrespectful and rude .
After what seemed like eternity , the march finally began .
Almost half the crowd left during the speeches , but more and more people started joining the protest as we were marching .
I would guess , but I 'm not sure , that there were about 550 people there .
As we walked about 6 blocks from the park , people started asking why we were following the police in what looked like a parade .
Every single speaker talked about taking action to create change , but yet we were still following oppressive police barriers for our permitted marches .
People began becoming confused on where to go , and we walked in a loop all the way down from the park and then back up it .
As we took the next turn , it was visible that we were walking down a street that was n't permitted .
The police tried to cut in front of us , but eventually got orders to let us through , this happened two times .
The crowd was ecstatic ; we had successfully taken the streets , for a short time anyway .
The police had lined up on bikes against a street and we stood there for awhile wondering if they would still let us through .
I strongly believe they would have , if the liberal peace police did n't try to get all the protestors back on the permitted streets .
One man with a megaphone talked about how the government had now given access to schools to strip search students .
He also talked about how we should protect the students .
Ironically , he said all of this while abandoning students who were at risk of being attacked by police .
I screamed for people to protect us , the students , and that change begins now .
Many liberals argued with me that civil disobedience is wrong and what the crowd was doing was stupid .
I informed them about how MLK had been arrested upwards 20 times for acts of civil disobedience , they did n't really argue past that .
Eventually , the crowd had to give up because the rest of the protest had kept marching on .
I was very angry about the lack of solidarity some of those protesters showed .
We moved on to the Oregonian building and chanted " FREE THE PRESS " .
Drummers formed a drum circle on the sidewalk outside the Oregonian building , and the energy of the crowd was immense .
One protestor asked the Oregonian staff to please actually write about this protest and other protests in a truthful matter ; he did n't really get a response .
Security guards were standing right outside the doorway , watching our every move .
Once again , the crowd moved on , and more and more riot police started lining the streets .
A police helicopter flew overhead of us consistently throughout the rest of the protest .
As we were walking back to Park and Main , protestors started sprinting up Jefferson .
The majority of the protest followed , some went back to the park .
I sprinted as fast as I could to the front of the protest to see what was going on .
Police tried to stop many of us , and I think someone was arrested , when we were running up Jefferson .
Bike police had already lined up on 12th and Jefferson , stopping the protest .
Police on horses zoomed passed me , bumping into many people .
All of a sudden , I started hearing screaming , and saw batons fly up in the air .
People were being pepper sprayed at the head of the protest , and police started attacking protestors , doing " snatch and grabs " .
I saw a friend get tackled by the police twenty feet away from the police lineup .
Three police started attacking him and stepping on him while he was on the ground .
Shots fired , people were screaming all around me .
A friend told me a woman was sitting on the sidewalk while all of this was happening and was intentionally kicked by the police .
Police shot rubber bullets at the woman sitting on the ground , but I do n't believe they hit her .
People were getting trampled by the horses , and more shots fired .
Protesters were hyperventilating around me , and I could see three guys in serious pain 30 feet away .
I ran to them and found they had been severely pepper sprayed , they were yelling in extreme pain .
I mixed one part water one part Maalox and poured it in their eyes and all around their body .
Two of them had their entire upper body covered in pepper spray .
Pepper spray , from the guy I was giving medical attention to , had gotten on my arm , and some around my eye .
We ran out of water , and I sprinted to my school , not 10 feet away .
I asked for water and a basic solution safe for the eyes .
My principle came out informing me that the school had gone in lockdown .
The desk attendant at my school would n't even give me water to help the people dosed in pepper spray .
That made me incredibly angry .
I found out that some of the students that go to my school had been very badly pepper sprayed .
Three women , who were doing absolutely nothing , got trampled by the police .
As five minutes went by , riot police had filled Jefferson .
" This is the Portland police , this is an illegal assembly , if you do not move you will be subject to chemical weapons ... blah blah " , the Portland pigs announced .
Everyone went on the sidewalks , as the police began laughing and pointing their rubber bullet and bean bag guns at us .
Cops barricaded the sidewalks with their bikes , giving smirks to all the protestors .
Elmore , a cop who has personally told me he was going to beat the shit out of me in a past protest , waved his gun around , laughing while doing so .
The corporate media flogged the sidewalks , we yelled at them to tell the fucking truth , I doubt they will .
Everyone seemed to disperse , as the protest came to a close .
I was informed that ten people had been arrested .
I could hardly walk back to the bus stop I was so shocked and exhausted .
After many calls to the NWCRC ( Northwest constitutional rights center ) I went home , in pain and confused .
If you had a camera and filmed the police brutality that occurred today , PLEASE CONTACT NWCRC and Portland Indymedia , your footage is extremely important to bringing down these fucking pigs .
Also , if you were attacked by the police , please call the NWCRC ( also jail support ) at 503 233 3194 .

Federal law enforcement attempts to use cell phones as tracking devices were rebuked twice this month by lower court judges , who say the government cannot get real time tracking information on citizens without showing probable cause .
This summer , Department of Justice officials separately asked judges from Texas and Long Island , New York to sign off on orders to cellular phone service providers compelling them to turn over phone records and location information – in real time – on two different individuals .
Both judges rejected the location tracking portion of the request in harshly worded opinions , concluding investigators cannot turn cell phones into tracking devices by simply telling a judge the information is likely " relevant " to an investigation .
" When the government seeks to turn a mobile telephone into a means for contemporaneously tracking the movements of its user , the delicately balanced compromise that Congress has forged between effective law enforcement and individual privacy requires a showing of probable cause , " wrote Magistrate Judge James Orenstein of New York in the latest decision Monday . ( .pdf ) .
In the Long Island case , the DOJ asked to record the location of the cell towers that handled a call using information in a phone 's " control channel , " which is separate from the voice channel used in a mobile telephone call , which would give only a rough approximation of a user 's locations and movement .
In the Texas case , the government sought to capture information regarding the strength , angle and timing of the caller 's signal measured at two or more cell sites – data that might allow investigators to pinpoint a person 's location using triangulation .
Orenstein handed down his 57 - page opinion the same day as the Electronic Privacy Information Center released documents acquired in a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit , which showed the FBI had repeatedly violated its own rules about surveillance of American citizens .
The DOJ applied for the real time cell tracking information alongside orders to install so called " pen registers " and " trap and trace devices " which let investigators immediately learn the dialing information of incoming and outgoing calls .
These orders are relatively easy for the government to get since the Supreme Court ruled that there is no expectation of privacy in the phone numbers a person dials , and federal law requires judges to issue the orders so long as law enforcement promises the information will likely be relevant .
The government cited another law , the Stored Communications Act , to argue those devices could be also used to capture the location - focused information .
Kevin Bankston , an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which filed a friend of the court brief ( .pdf ) in the New York case , says the Justice Department may have been using cell phones to track people for a long time , since judges typically do n't publish opinions on such orders .
" This is a true victory for privacy in the digital age , where nearly any mobile communications device you use might be converted into a tracking device , " Bankston said in a statement .
" Judges are starting to realize that when it comes to surveillance issues , the DOJ has been pulling the wool over their eyes for far too long . "
Bankston noted in an interview that the Justice Department attempted to convince Orenstein he had the authority , under another federal law called the All Writs Act , to order the cell phone tracking by revealing that other judges had used that statute to authorize real time tracking of credit - card purchases , which the government referred to as a " Hotwatch Order . "
It is unclear if those orders are limited to tracking fugitives or if they are also being used in ordinary criminal investigations .
Both judges concluded that Congress needed clarify the laws regarding cell phone tracking .
Though House and Senate lawmakers are currently battling over the final form of the reauthorization of the Patriot Act , it is unlikely the bill will clarify the cell phone tracking issue .
The Justice Department is expected to appeal both judges ' decisions , but did not return a call for comment by press time .
Unraveling the Mac OS X Microkernel Myth
According to proponents of this myth , Mac OS X is in grave danger because it has a microkernel and Linux does n't .
They 're wrong ; here 's why .
Page 1 | 2 | 3
Why the Myth was Woven
This myth is the main thread holding together the Mac OS X Needs a Linux Kernel Myth .
According to the Copy / Paste Development Myth , this should all be easy to fix : yank out that Mach stuff , and throw in Linux !
The Myth Weavers
This myth is of the wishful thinking type , making it more of an irritating distraction from reality than devious misinformation , but it 's also used in fanboyism that borders on FUD .
What is a Kernel ?
The Unix Kernel is the master control program which governs all other programs , schedules access to hardware , and manages the file system and security model .
The name kernel differentiates the core system ( which runs as the root process with special privileges ) from everything else on the system ( which runs under restricted user accounts ) .
Everything outside of the kernel space is called the userland .
In the natural development of Unix , the kernel began to grow rapidly .
For example , Berkeley 's famous contribution to Unix was a fully functional TCP / IP networking stack .
A rapid influx of other new functionality in the core kernel space has resulted in modern versions of Unix ( and Linux , which is essentially a clean room rewrite of Unix ) having 2 - 3 million lines of code in their kernel alone .
The following is a list of things programmers often take as either self - evident or have picked up from others and mistakenly believe .
In disputing these misbeliefs I only intend to improve awareness about performance optimization .
But in doing so , I only offer half the solution .
To be really convinced the aspiring performance conscious programmer should write up examples and disassemble them ( in the case of using a HLL like C ) or simply profile or time them to see for themselves .
Ever improving hardware , makes software optimization unimportant ( 1 ) If you do n't optimize your code , but your competition does , then they end up with a faster solution , independent of hardware improvements .
( 2 ) Hardware performance improvements expectations almost always exceeds reality .
PC disk performance has remained relatively stable for the past 5 years , and memory technology has been driven more by quantity than performance .
( 3 ) Hardware improvements often only target optimal software solutions .
Using tables always beats recalculating
This is not always true .
Remember that in recalculating , you have the potential of using parallelism , and incremental calculation with the right formulations .
Tables that are too large will not fit in your cache and hence may be very slow to access .
If your table is multi-indexed , then there is a hidden multiply which can be costly if it is not a power of 2 .
On a fast Pentium , an uncached memory access can take more time than a divide .
My C compiler can't be much worse than 10 % off of optimal assembly on my code
This is something some people can only be convinced of by experience .
The cogitations and bizarre operator fumbling that you can do in the C language convinces many that they are there for the purposes of optimization .
Modern C compilers usually unify C's complex operators , semantics and syntax into much a simpler format before proceeding to the optimization and code generation phase .
ANSI C only addresses a subset of your computers ' capabilities and is in of itself too generic in specification to take advantage of all of your processor nuances .
Remember ANSI
C does not know the difference between cached and uncached memory .
Also many arithmetic redundancies allow for usage of processor features that C compilers to date have not yet mastered ( for e.g.. , there are clever tricks for host based texture mapping if the stride of the source texture is a power of two , or in particular 256 on an x86 . )
Unfortunately , many research based , and work station programmers as well as professors of higher education , who might even know better , have taken it upon themselves to impress upon newbie programmers to avoid assembly language programming at all costs ; all in the name of maintainability and portability .
A blatant example of this can be seen in the POV - ray FAQ , which outright recommends that there is no benefit to be had in attempting assembly language optimizations .
( I would n't be surprised , if you could n't simply low level optimize POV - Ray , change the interface and turn around and sell the darn thing ! )
The fact is , low - level optimization has its place and only should be passed by if there is a conflicting requirement ( like portability ) , there is no need , or there are no resources to do it .
For more , see High level vs .
Low level below .
Using C compilers make it impossible to optimize code for performance Most C compilers come with an " inline assembly " feature that allows you to roll your own opcodes .
Most also come with linkers that allow you to link completely external assembly modules .
Of course not all C compilers are created equal and the effects of mixing C and assembly will vary depending on the compiler implementation .
( Example : WATCOM and DJGPP mix ASM in very smoothly , whereas VC ++ and Borland do not . )
Modern C compilers will do a reasonable job if they are given assistance .
I usually try to break my inner loops down into the most basic expressions possible , that are as analogous to low level assembly as possible , without resorting to inline assembly whenever possible .
Again your results will vary from compiler to compiler .
( The WATCOM C/C++ compiler can be helped significantly with this sort of approach . )
Compiled bitmaps are the fastest way to plot graphics
This method replaces each bitmap graphics source data word with a specific CPU instruction to store it straight to graphics memory .
The problem with it is , that it chews up large amounts of instruction cache space .
This is to be compared against a data copying routine which needs to read the source data from memory ( and typically caches it . )
Both use lots of cache space , but the compiled bitmap method uses far more , since it must encode a CPU store command for each source data word .
Furthermore , CPU performance is usually more sensitive to instruction cache performance than it is to data cache performance .
The reason is that data manipulations and resource contentions can be managed by write buffers and modern CPU 's ability to execute instructions out of order .
With instruction data , if they are not in the cache , they must be prefetched , paying non-overlapping sequential penalties whenever the pre-fetch buffer runs out .
On older x86's this method worked well because the instruction prefetch penalties were paid on a per instruction basis regardless ( there was no cache to put them into ! )
But starting with the 486 , this was no longer a sensible solution since short loops paid no instruction prefetch penalties , which rendered the compiled bitmap technique completely useless .
Using the register keyword in strategic places C will improve performance substantially
This keyword is a complete placebo in most modern C compilers .
Keep in mind that K&R and the ANSI committee did not design the C language to embody all of the performance characteristics of your CPU .
The bulk of the burden of optimizing your C source , is in the hands of your compiler 's optimizer which will typically have its own ideas about what variables should go where .
If you are interested in the level optimizations available by hand assigning register variable aliasing , you are better off going to hand rolled assembly , rather than relying on these kinds of language features .
( Addenda :
The only real purpose of " register " is to assert to the compiler that an auto variable is never addressed and therefore can never alias with any pointer .
While this might be able to assist the compiler 's optimizer , a good optimizing compiler is more than capable of deducing this feature of a local by itself . )
Globals are faster than locals Most modern C compilers will alias local variables to your CPUs register 's or SRAM .
Furthermore , if all variables in a given scope are local , then an optimizing compiler , can forgo maintaining the variable outside the scope , and therefore has more simplification optimization opportunities than with globals .
So , in fact , you should find the opposite tends to be true more of the time .
Using smaller data types is faster than larger ones
The original reason int was put into the C language was so that the fastest data type on each platform remained abstracted away from the programmer himself .
On modern 32 and 64 bit platforms , small data types like chars and shorts actually incur extra overhead when converting to and from the default machine word sized data type .
On the other hand , one must be wary of cache usage .
Using packed data ( and in this vein , small structure fields ) for large data objects may pay larger dividends in global cache coherence , than local algorithmic optimization issues .
Fixed point always beats floating point for performance Most modern CPUs have a separate floating point unit that will execute in parallel to the main / integer unit .
This means that you can simultaneously do floating point and integer calculations .
While many processors can perform high throughput multiplies ( the Pentium being an exception ) general divides and modulos that are not a power of two are slow to execute ( from Cray Super Computers right on down to 6502's ; nobody has a really good algorithm to perform them in general . )
Parallelism ( via the usually undertaxed concurrent floating point units in many processors ) and redundancy are often better bets than going to fixed point .
On the redundancy front , if you are dividing or calculating a modulo and if you know the divisor is fixed , or one of only a few possible fixed values there are ways to exploit fast integer ( aka fixed point ) methods .
On the Pentium , the biggest concern is moving data around to and from the FPU and the main integer unit .
Optimizing FPU usage takes careful programming ; no x86 compiler I have see does a particularly good job of this .
To exploit maximum optimization potential , you are likely going to have to go to assembly language .
As a rule of thumb : if you need many simple results as fast as possible , use fixed point , if you need only a few complicated results use floating point .
See Pentium Optimizations by Agner Fog for more information .
With the introduction of AMD's 3DNOW !
SIMD floating point technology , these older rules about floating point performance have been turned upside down .
Approximate ( 14/15 bits ) divides , or reciprocal square roots can be computed in a single clock .
Two multiplies and two adds can also be computed per clock allowing better than 1 gigaflop of peak performance .
We are now at a point in the industry where floating point performance is truly matching the integer performance .
With such technologies the right answer is to use the data type format that most closely matches its intended meaning .
Performance optimization is achieved primarily by counting the cycles of the assembly code
You usually get a lot more mileage out of optimizing your code at a high level ( not meaning to imply that you need a HLL to do this ) first .
At the very least , changes to the high level source will tend to affect more target code at one time than what you will be able to do in assembly language with the same effort .
In more extreme cases , such as exponential ( usually highly recursive ) algorithms , thorough hand optimization often buys you significantly less than good up front design .
The cycle counts given in processor instruction lists are usually misleading about the real cycle expenditure of your code .
They usually ignore the wait states required to access memory , or other devices ( that usually have their own independent clocks . )
They are also typically misleading with regards to hidden side effects of branch targets , pipelining and parallelism .
The Pentium can take up to 39 clocks to perform a floating point divide .
However , the instruction can be issued in one clock , 39 clocks of integer calculations can then be done in parallel and the result of the divide then retrieved in another clock .
About 41 clocks in total , but only two of those clocks are actually spent issuing and retrieving the results for the divide itself .
In fact , all modern x86 processors have internal clock timers than can be used to assist in getting real timing results and Intel recommends that programmers use them to get accurate timing results .
( See the RDTSC instruction as documented in Intel 's processor architectural manuals . )
Assembly programming is only done in DOS , there 's no need under Windows
The benefits of assembly over C are the same under Windows or Linux as they are under DOS .
This delusion does n't have anything close to logic backing it up , and therefore does n't deserve much comment .
See Iczelion 's Win32 Assembly Home Page if you do n't believe me .
Complete optimization is impossible ; there is always room left to optimize , thus it is pointless to sustain too much effort in pursuit of it This is not a technical belief -- its a marketing one .
Its one often heard from the folks that live in Redmond , WA .
Even to the degree that it is true ( in a very large software project , for example ) it ignores the fact that optimal performance can be approached asymptotically with a finite , and usually acceptable amount of effort .
Using proper profiling and benchmarking one can iteratively grab the " low hanging fruit " which will get most of the available performance .
Absolutely optimization is also not a completely unattainable goal .
Understanding the nature of your task , and bounding it by its input / output performance and the best possible algorithm in the middle in many cases is not an undoable task .
For example , to read a file from disk , sort its contents and write the result back out , ought to be a very doable performance optimization exercise .
( The input / output performance is known , and the algorithm in the middle is approachable by considering the nature of the input and going with a standard algorithm such as heap sort or radix sort . )
Of course , the degree of analysis that you can apply to your specific problem will vary greatly depending on its nature .
My main objection to this misconception is just that it cannot be applied globally .
In an interview with Liz Jones , Paige Adams - Geller told the Daily Mail her thoughts on how actresses ( and models ) stay so thin .
“ I kept wondering why I would see an actress one week and she would look normal , and the next she would look gaunt , and I found out it is all down to crystal meth [ which suppresses the appetite ] the latest must - have accessory here in LA . ”
She also told me the name of the ‘ celebrity stylist ’ who is now suddenly so in demand , simply because she also acts as the stars ’ drug dealer .
According to gossip columnists , the former model who now designs her own range of jeans , Adams - Geller , was pointing the finger at celebrity “ one- look ” stylist Rachel Zoe .
With super thin actresses and starlets like Nicole Richie , Lindsay Lohan and Mischa Barton on her client list , who knows .
Maybe Lindsay ’s frequent ‘ accidents ’ that lead to hospital stays are n’t just for broken bones ?
It could also explain why the 33 year old stylist looks a bit older than her years … .
Fraudulent Stock Transactions
From a Business
Week story :
During July 13 - 26 , stocks and mutual funds had been sold , and the proceeds wired out of his account in six transactions of nearly $ 30,000 apiece .
Murty , a 64 - year - old nuclear engineering professor at North Carolina State University , could only think it was a mistake .
He had n’t sold any stock in months .
Murty dialed E*Trade the moment its call center opened at 7 a.m.
A customer service rep urged him to change his password immediately .
Too late .
E*Trade says the computer in Murty ’s Cary ( N.C. ) home lacked antivirus software and had been infected with code that enabled hackers to grab his user name and password .
The cybercriminals , pretending to be Murty , directed E*Trade to liquidate his holdings .
Then they had the brokerage wire the proceeds to a phony account in his name at Wells Fargo Bank .
The New York - based online broker says the wire instructions appeared to be legit because they contained the security code the company e-mailed to Murty to execute the transaction .
But the cyberthieves had gained control of Murty ’s e-mail , too .
E*Trade recovered some of the money from the Wells Fargo account and returned it to Murty .
In October , the Indian - born professor reached what he calls a satisfactory settlement with the firm , which says it did nothing wrong .
That last clause is critical .
E*trade insists it did nothing wrong .
It executed $ 174,000 in fraudulent transactions , but it did nothing wrong .
It sold stocks without the knowledge or consent of the owner of those stocks , but it did nothing wrong .
Now quite possibly , E*trade did nothing wrong legally .
There may very well be a paragraph buried in whatever agreement this guy signed that says something like : “ You agree that any trade request that comes to us with the right password , whether it came from you or not , will be processed . ”
But there ’s the market failure .
Until we fix that , these losses are an externality to E*Trade .
They ’ll only fix the problem up to the point where customers are n’t leaving them in droves , not to the point where the customers ’ stocks are secure .

Calvey 's Snap + Send Postcard , a disposable digital camera , is so light and inexpensive it can be sent in the mail .
All it needs is a stamp .
" You would buy it at a newsagent or photo developer , take a few shots and , once it 's full , you stick a stamp on it , address it and put it in the postbox , " Calvey says .
" Then grandma , or your girlfriend , gets it .
They tear open the perforations , fold out a little kick stand on the back and sit it on a bench top .
Then it 's as simple as pressing a button and it will go through a slide show of images . "
Snap + Send Postcard is still just a concept , but the young inventor says the technology exists to turn the idea into a commercial reality .
It 's just
that he , as a full - time student and casual library assistant , does n't have the money to finance it .
The palm - sized camera - cum - postcard , housed in a cardboard shell with a two - megapixel lens , a 10 - centimetre screen , digital memory and an internal battery , would cost about $ 25 .
There would be no delete or zoom functions and it would be one - use only .
" You ca n't get too precious about certain features , " he says .
However , the slide show could be watched a few hundred times and the camera could be taken to a developer to get the photos printed .
Calvey acknowledges disposable digital camera postcards will never compete for quality with more expensive digital cameras but says his concept could be an alternative to mobile phone cameras .
He envisages the Snap + Send Postcard being particularly popular with tourists and backpackers looking for novel ways to share their memories with friends and relatives back home .
" A picture tells a thousand words - as corny as it is , it just rings true , " he says .
Calvey has come up with many clever concepts during his four years at university , including a wrapper designed to take the messiness out of eating a kebab .
The packaging , with tapered sides and tearaway sections , won the young inventor a Packaging Council of Australia award in 2003 .
He could have sold the rights to the clean - face kebab wrapper and the Snap + Send Postcard to keen companies , but prefers to just share his ideas while he 's a student .
" I 'd rather use them to show potential employers my ideas . "
Finger length is linked to testosterone exposure in the womb
The shorter the index finger is compared to the ring finger , the more boisterous he will be , University of Alberta researchers said .
But the same was not true for verbal aggression or hostile behaviours , they told the journal Biological Psychology after studying 300 people 's fingers .
The trend is thought to be linked to testosterone exposure in the womb .
Hand hints
It has been known for some time that there is a direct correlation between finger lengths and the amount of the male sex hormone testosterone that a baby is exposed to in the womb .
In women , the two fingers are usually almost equal in length , as measured from the crease nearest the palm to the fingertip .
In men , the ring finger tends to be much longer than the index .
Other studies looking at finger length ratio have suggested that , in men , a long ring finger and symmetrical hands are an indication of fertility , and that women are more likely to be fertile if they have a longer index finger .
Finger length can tell you a little bit about where personality comes from
Researcher Dr Peter Hurd
One study found boys with shorter ring fingers tended to be at greatest risk of a heart attack in early adulthood , which was linked to testosterone levels .
In the current study , Dr Peter Hurd and his student Allison Bailey measured the fingers of 300 undergraduates at their university .
Men with the shortest index fingers scored higher on measures of physical aggression than those with longer index fingers , but the study 's findings did not apply to women .
Dr Hurd is now looking at male hockey players to see whether there is any correlation between finger lengths and each player 's penalty record for contact and fouling during matches .
Window to the soul ?
He has also been looking at whether men with more feminine finger lengths might be more prone to depression .
He said : " Finger length can tell you a little bit about where personality comes from .
" A large part of our personalities and our traits are determined while we are still in the womb . "
But he said finger length should not be used to draw too many conclusions about an individual person .
" For example , you would n't want to screen people for certain jobs based on their finger lengths . "
I could predict reasonably well who was going to win based on their finger length
Professor John Manning
University of Central Lancashire
Professor John Manning from the University of Central Lancashire 's department of psychology , who first realised that sex hormone exposure in the womb influences finger length , agreed .
He said certain individual characteristics correlate better with finger length than others .
" For example , if you had a group of runners and they were about to start a race I could predict reasonably well who was going to win based on their finger length .
" But I would not be able to predict whether someone was neurotic or not . "
He said Dr Hurd 's findings were logical based on what we know about finger length , testosterone exposure and aggression , but said more research was needed to confirm the findings .
He said another recent study had found women exposed to higher levels of testosterone in the womb , and hence a more ' male ' pattern of finger length , displayed more frustrated behaviour when answering challenging telephone calls than other women .

Friedman Wrong About Muslims Again
And the Amman Statement on Ecumenism
Tom Friedman is a Middle East expert who knows a lot about Islam .
Why , then , does he keep saying misleading things ?
He wrote in his latest column , “ To this day – to this day – no major Muslim cleric or religious body has ever issued a fatwa condemning Osama bin Laden . ”
A “ fatwa ” is simply a considered opinion of a Muslim jurisconsult .
Such opinions are numerous .
First of all , almost all the major Shiite Grand Ayatollahs have condemned Bin Laden and al - Qaeda .
You could say that is easy , since Shiites do n’t generally like Wahhabis .
But they are the leaders of 120 million Muslims ( some ten percent of the 1.2 billion ) .
So that is one .
Tracking these things down is time - consuming , but this should do :
Ayatollah Muhammad Husain Fadlallah of Lebanon condemns Osama Bin Laden .
So then what about the Sunni world ?
The leading moral authority for Sunnis is the rector or Grand Imam of the al - Azhar Seminary / University in Cairo , Egypt .
Al - Azhar is perhaps the world ’s oldest continuous university and has been since the time of Saladin a major center of Sunni religious authority .
The current incumbent is Shaikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi .
So what about Tantawi and Bin Laden ?
Grand Imam of Al - Azhar seminary , Shaikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi , condemns Osamah Bin Laden .
What about Pakistan ?
Admittedly , it has some clerics who are fans of Bin Laden , or at least who would avoid condemning him .
But the allegation Friedman is making is that no major cleric has condemned him .
Try this : Prominent Pakistani Cleric Tahir ul Qadri condemns Bin Laden .
I do n’t personally care for Yusuf al - Qaradawi .
He is an old - time Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood preacher who fled to Qatar and now has a perch at al - Jazeera .
But he does have some virtues .
He is enormously popular among Muslim fundamentalists .
And , he absolutely despises Bin Laden and al - Qaeda .
Al - Qaradawi has repeatedly condemned the latter .
He even gave a fatwa that it was a duty of Muslims to fight alongside the US in Afghanistan against al - Qaeda !
See also :
Yusuf al - Qaradawi condemns al - Qaeda .
There are also substantial Muslim communities in Europe with leaderships that have explicitly condemned Bin Laden .
E.g. :
Spanish Muslim Clerical authorities Issue Fatwa against Osamah Bin Laden .
There are on the order of 250,000 Muslims in Spain .
High Mufti of Russian Muslims calls for Extradition of Bin Laden .
The Russian Muslim community is about 20 million strong , or 15 percent of Russia ’s 143 million population , and is growing rapidly , so that in a century Russia may be 50 percent Muslim .
So this is not a pro forma thing here .
A good round - up on this sort of issue has been put up by al - Muhajabah .
See also Charles Kurzman ’s page .
Friedman also does refer to a major conference of Muslim clerics , thinkers and notables wound up just Wednesday that made a powerful statement about religious tolerance and condemned everything Osama Bin Laden stands for .
But he seems oddly unaware of the significance of having Grand Ayatollah Sistani , Grand Imam of al - Azhar Seminary Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi , and many other great Muslim authorities sign off on this epochal statement of Muslim ecumenism .
The statement forbids one Muslim to declare another “ not a Muslim ” if the believer adheres to any of the mainstream legal rites of Sunnism and Shiism .
The whole basis of al - Qaeda is to call the Muslim leaders of countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia , as well as Shiites , “ not Muslims . ”
The statement also demands that engineers should please stop pretending to issue fatwas , which should be left to trained clerical jurisconsults .
This para . is also a slam at Bin Laden .
PS As for Friedman ’s main point , that Muslims have n’t done a good job of fighting jihadi ideology and terrorism , it is bizarre .
The Algerian government fought a virtual civil war to put down political Islam , in which over 100,000 persons died .
The Egyptians jailed 20,000 or 30,000 radicals for thought crimes and killed 1500 in running street battles in the 1990s and early zeroes .
Al - Qaeda ca n’t easily strike in the Middle East precisely because Syria , Egypt , Algeria , etc. have their number and have undertaken massive actions against them .
What does Friedman want ?
And , besides , he is wrong that this is only a Muslim problem .
In the global age all problems are everybody ’s .
That ’s part of flat world , too , Tom .

Is Your Zipper Real ?
Barely a week ago , I wrote about a company in Brooklyn that fixes Chinese manufacturing mistakes , and asked for similar examples .
Some of you posted your stories ( I loved the one about the white polymer resin that got contaminated by small black cylinders that looked like “ rat turds ” ) .
The Wall Street Journal was good enough to chip in as well .
It ran a front - page article yesterday about a guy in L.A. named Barry Forman , who retired from the garment industry 14 years ago because too much manufacturing had moved overseas .
But Forman has come roaring back to life , thanks to that same overseas manufacturing .
His job is to rescue millions of dollars ’ worth of imported clothing by fixing the manufacturing botches .
( The Journal article is behind a paywall but here ’s the same article reprinted in the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette . )
But the most interesting example in the article was n’t about a mistake exactly ; it had to do with a load of 17,000 Chinese - made denim pants that were confiscated in Long Beach by U.S. Customs .
Why ?
Their zipper tabs were imprinted with “ YKK , ” the Japanese company who made the zipper on the very pair of pants I ’m wearing ( and , probably , yours ) .
But they were counterfeit zippers .
I am not sure why someone would bother to counterfeit a zipper .
( Have you ever bought a pair of pants because of its brand of zipper ?
Now that I think of it , how do I know that my YKK zipper is real ? )
So Barry Forman was called in to fix the problem .
He did this by putting fifteen employees to work with hand drills , grinding off the fake “ YKK ” mark on each zipper .
It took them five days .
I am curious how much this intervention raised the price on this lot of denim pants .
The economics of commercial piracy are vast and fascinating ; I was talking to a lawyer friend not long ago who assured me that a significant fraction of the toiletries and household products I buy every day are fake .
The dinosaurs , along with the majority of all other animal species on Earth , went extinct approximately 65 million years ago .
Some scientists have said that the impact of a large meteorite in the Yucatan Peninsula , in what is today Mexico , caused the mass extinction , while others argue that there must have been additional meteorite impacts or other stresses around the same time .
A new study provides compelling evidence that " one and only one impact " caused the mass extinction , according to a University of Missouri - Columbia researcher .
" The samples we found strongly support the single impact hypothesis , " said Ken MacLeod , associate professor of geological sciences at MU and lead investigator of the study .
" Our samples come from very complete , expanded sections without deposits related to large , direct effects of the impact - for example , landslides - that can shuffle the record , so we can resolve the sequence of events well .
What we see is a unique layer composed of impact - related material precisely at the level of the disappearance of many species of marine plankton that were contemporaries of the youngest dinosaurs .
We do not find any sedimentological or geochemical evidence for additional impacts above or below this level , as proposed in multiple impact scenarios . "
MacLeod and his co-investigators studied sediment recovered from the Demerara Rise in the Atlantic Ocean northeast of South America , about 4,500 km ( approximately 2,800 miles ) from the impact site on the Yucatan Peninsula .
Sites closer to and farther from the impact site have been studied , but few intermediary sites such as this have been explored .
Interpretation of samples from locations close to the crater are complicated by factors such as waves , earthquakes and landslides that likely followed the impact and would have reworked the sediment .
Samples from farther away received little impact debris and often do n't demonstrably contain a complete record of the mass extinction interval .
The Demerara Rise samples , thus , provide an unusually clear picture of the events at the time of the mass extinction .
" With our samples , there just are n't many complications to confuse interpretation .
You could say that you 're looking at textbook quality samples , and the textbook could be used for an introductory class , " MacLeod said .
" It 's remarkable the degree to which our samples follow predictions given a mass extinction caused by a single impact .
Sedimentological and paleontological complexities are minor , the right aged - material is present , and there is no support for multiple impacts or other stresses leading up to or following the deposition of material from the impact . "
The impact of a meteorite on the Yucatan Peninsula likely caused massive earthquakes and tsunamis .
Dust from the impact entered the atmosphere and blocked sunlight , causing plants to die and animals to lose important sources of food .
Temperatures probably cooled significantly around the globe before warming in the following centuries , wildfires on an unprecedented scale may have burned and acid rain might have poured down .
MacLeod and many other scientists believe that these effects led to the relatively rapid extinction of most species on the planet .
Some other scientists have argued that a single impact could not have caused the changes observed and say that the impact in the Yucatan predates the mass extinction by 300,000 years .
MacLeod 's co-investigators were Donna L. Whitney from the University of Minnesota , Brian T. Huber from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and Christian Koeberl of the University of Vienna .
The study was recently published in the ' in press ' section of the online version of the Geological Society of America Bulletin .

[ Frank ] : " If an adult in this country , with his or her own money , wants to engage in an activity that harms no one , how dare we prohibit it because it does n't add to the GDP or it has no macroeconomic benefit .
Are we all to take home calculators and , until we have satisfied the gentleman from Iowa that we are being socially useful , we abstain from recreational activities that we choose ?...
People have said ,
What is the value of gambling ?
Here is the value .
Some human beings enjoy doing it .
Should n't that be our principle ?
If individuals like doing something and they harm no one , we will allow them to do it , even if other people disapprove of what they do . "
[ Stuttaford ] : Barney Frank talking sense , Senator Frist not .
Draw your own conclusions .
UPDATE
With the bulk of the nation 's political attention devoted to the Bush administration 's radical terrorism and war policies , the relentless domestic invasions into the private realm of adult Americans usually go unnoticed .
But underneath the media radar , the administration and its Congressional allies have been actively placating the religious " conservative " wing of the Republican Party through all sorts of liberty - infringing and highly invasive measures .
On every level , it is difficult to envision a political party more hostile to individual liberty than the current Bush - led Republicans .
One of the leading items on the agenda of religious conservatives is their desire to prevent adult citizens who want to gamble from doing so -- not by persuading them of the evils of gambling , but by abusing the power of the federal government to make it a criminal offense for those adults to choose to gamble .
Two weeks ago , Congressional Republicans , led by Sens. Bill Frist and John Kyl , attached a broad anti-gambling provision onto a bill designed to enhance port security , which means that nobody could vote against it .
That provision " prohibit[s ] gamblers [ , adults ] from using credit cards , checks and electronic fund transfers to settle their online wagers , " and it also dramatically enhances the enforcement powers of the federal government to arrest and imprison adults who choose to spend the money they earn by sitting in their homes and gambling online .
As reflected by the observations at National Review 's Corner of Andrew Stuttaford ( a genuine believer in individual liberty ) , Republicans have now almost completely abandoned any belief in limitations on the power and reach of the federal government to regulate every aspect of our lives , while Democrats , imperfect though they are , have taken the role of insisting upon the right of citizens to be free from unwarranted federal government intervention .
Here is Stuttaford , quoting Barney Frank : Barney Frank is typically held up ( for less than noble reasons ) as the face of contemporary big government liberalism , yet Frank 's formulation here -- " If individuals like doing something and they harm no one , we will allow them to do it , even if other people disapprove of what they do " -- is an expression of the core , defining libertarian principle , which previously defined ( at least ostensibly ) small - government conservative ideology .
Those principles are ones which the Republican Party , under power - crazed authoritarians like Bill Frist , not only clearly reject , but actively work to undermine in virtually every realm .
The Bush administration and its GOP Congressional allies have been waging a similar war against the evils of adult pornography .
The Mark Foley - sponsored so - called " Adam Walsh Child Protection Act of 2006 " has as one of its principal , hidden purposes the imposition of a regulatory scheme designed to make it as prohibitively expensive and burdensome as possible to produce and distribute adult pornographic products or to maintain adult websites .
The First Amendment bars them from doing what they really want to do , which is criminalize the production and distribution of any material they consider to be pornographic ( just like they have criminalized gambling ) .
As a result , they are attempting to accomplish the same objective via the indirect strategy of imposing so many record - keeping and other bureaucratic requirements on companies that produce pornography -- compliance is virtually impossible without hiring attorneys and new employees strictly to work on record - keeping -- that companies can no longer afford to do so and are scared out of operating or are driven out of business .
What makes all of this even more indefensible is that these provisions are not only being enacted , but that federal law enforcement resources -- substantial amounts of them -- are being devoted to enforcing these new laws even though we are currently fighting an Epic War of Civilizations .
FBI agents are not being used to search for IslamoFascistJihadists sleeper cells because they are too busy satisfying James Dobson by searching for poker players and spending the day at the homes of single - person pornographers ensuring that their record - keeping is in compliance with the Byzantine requirements of Mark Foley 's new law .
Anti-gambling activities have increased dramatically as of late : " Federal officials have made recent arrests involving offshore companies operating Internet gambling sites .
" And in the lead - up to the November election , the FBI has also been dispatching agents to various pornography companies around the country to conduct so - called " 2257 inspections , " a reference to the provision of Mark Foley 's new law ( as well as a prior one also co-sponsored by him ) which has been dramatically expanded in numerous ways over the past year .
The FBI has been forcing agents to spend literally all day at small , obscure companies that are not suspected of any wrongdoing .
And the FBI has announced that they intend to conduct numerous additional inspections from now until November .
The work is so frivolous that FBI agents have refused the assignment and complained bitterly about being tasked to such matters during the War on Terrorism .
The same people who relentlessly insist that this war against The Terrorists which we are fighting is so grave and of such overriding danger that we have to dismantle the Constitution and vest unprecedented domestic powers in the President to fight it , are simultaneously causing the FBI to devote its resources to finding and arresting adults who choose to spend their time and money on gambling and adult pornography , all because James Dobson and Bill First think those activities are immoral and irreligious and , therefore , the Federal Government can and should use its vast law enforcement powers to dictate how adult citizens conduct themselves in their private lives .
It has been obvious for quite some time , and certainly since the Schiavo travesty , that the Bush - led Republican Party is the very antithesis of individual liberty and a limited federal government .
The administration and its Congressional loyalists not only seek unlimited state power in name of combating terrorism but also in the name of enforcing private morality . :
Several commenters have suggested that one impetus for this bill , if not the primary impetus , was a desire to protect the offline gaming industry from the competitive threat posed by online gambling .
I understand that view , and have written before about one of the lowest forms of political manipulation imaginable -- the way Ralph Reed mobilized his anti-gambling moralist base by making them think the anti-gambling legislation he advocated was achieving some moral good when , in reality , it was all designed to protect the interests of Jack Abramoff 's casino clients , who were paying Reed high fees .
But in this case , the anti-gambling legislation seems clearly aimed at the religious " conservative " component of the GOP and , as this interesting article covering the new law suggests , Bill Frist 's presidential ambitions ( and his need to curry favor with that voting segment ) in particular .
Additionally , this new post from Andrew Stuttaford makes a convincing case that Las Vegas and Native American casino interests strongly opposed this bill .
Entrepreneurs confidently tell Venture Capitalists " Microsoft will acquire my company " .
VCs roll their eyes ... they have heard it a million times .
But , Microsoft does have a rich tradition of acquisitions .
The first , and most important , acquisition was QDOS from Seattle Computer Products which became MS - DOS .
What kind of companies does Microsoft acquire ?
How do they decide to acquire versus build internally ?
First lets start with a review of some of the most successful Microsoft acquisitions .
Some of these may surprise you .
QDOS became MS -DOS
ForeThought became Powerpoint
SoftDesign became Microsoft Project
Vermeer became FrontPage
PlaceWare became Live Meeting
Vicinity became a key part of MapPoint
nCompass Labs became Content Management Server
Bungie Studios became Halo
HotMail
Visio
Great Plains
Groove Networks
Microsoft has acquired an average of 10 companies per year over the past 10 years .
Many of them are smaller ( less than $ 50 M ) acquisitions that go unnoticed by the press .
These smaller acquisitions usually provide a great team of people , and a few key features in a much larger existing Microsoft product .
At the other end of the spectrum , Great Plains is an example of a multi billion dollar acquisition that created a whole new business unit for Microsoft .
For a more complete list of Microsoft investments and acquisitions see http://www.microsoft.com/msft/InvestmentandAcquisitionsList.mspx
What is most important to Microsoft when making acquisition decisions ?
People are the most important factor in any acquisition .
Microsoft looks for talented engineering teams with vision and passion and experienced management teams .
Second is technology and IP that can add value to an existing Microsoft product .
Third is the opportunity to acquire stand alone products for existing customers .
Examples include Visio , Hotmail , and Vermeer .
Another , more rare , decision point is the opportunity to enter whole new markets .
Great Plains and PlaceWare are excellent examples .
How does Microsoft decide to acquire rather than build internally ?
This is the toughest question in any acquisition discussion .
Microsoft has thousands of very talented software engineers that can build just about anything .
How can you justify paying hundreds of millions or even billions for something a team of 30 engineers could build in a year or two .
That translates to about $ 12 M of development cost versus a huge acquisition cost .
Technology is not the issue here .
It is all about marketing channels , sales expertise , and market leadership in segments where Microsoft is not strong .
It comes down to this ; if the company in question has a product that is squarely in the domain of an existing Microsoft product than the valuation is a small premium over the internal development cost .
If the company has market leadership in a new product space or market segment than the valuation goes up significantly .
Entrepreneurs should remember this .
The " barriers to entry " are most often market position , not technical brilliance .
I have heard start - ups say " we have a two year lead on our closest competitor " .
In fact , I have said it myself at previous start - ups .
I was wrong .
Most technologies can be replicated by a talented engineering group within a year or less .
Many times a similar technology can be licensed immediately and a new product shipped within months .
Many start - ups have failed by focusing too much on their technology and not enough on the value they bring to customers and the channels they use to service the customer .
Many times the early innovator fizzles , and a " fast follower " comes in and makes all the money .
That will be the subject of my next post .
Development of ternary computers at Moscow State University
Home → Articles → Development of ternary computers at Moscow State University
Brousentsov N. P. , Maslov S. P. , Ramil Alvarez J. , Zhogolev E.A .
It is known that the ternary arithmetic has essential advantages as compared with the binary one that is used in present - day computers .
In connection with this Donald Knuth assumed that the replacement of " flip - flop " for " flip - flap - flop " one a " good " day will nevertheless happen [ 1 ] .
Now , when the binary computers predominate , it is hard to believe in a reality of such assumption , but if it would happen not only the computer arithmetic , but the informatics on the whole would become most simple and most perfect .
The third value ( Aristotle named it snmbebhkoV – attendant ) what is very actual but hidden in binary logic , will become obvious and direct manipulated .
Ternary logic has better accordance with the Nature and human informal thinking [ 2 ] .
Unfortunately , the modern researches of the multivalued ( non-binary ) logic are formal and are not associated with practical requests .
A remarkable exclusion is the experience of creating the ternary computers " Setun " and " Setun 70 " at Moscow State University [ 3,4,5,6 ] .
This experience convincingly confirms practical preferences of ternary digital technique .
The design of small digital machine " Setun " ( Setun is the little river which flows into the river " Moscow " near the University ) was initiated by member of the academy of Sciences S. L. Sobolev at 1956 .
It was assumed to create small , inexpensive computer , simple in use and service for schools , research laboratories , design offices and for manufacture control .
For such goal at the computer center of the University there was formed a group of young men ( 4 MS and 5 BA ) .
The joint seminar for engineers and programmers was organized and S. L. Sobolev , K. A. Semendjev , M. R. Shura - Bura , I. S. Berezin were its permanent participants .
The problems of optimization of computer architecture and technical realization were examined and the variants of future computer were discussed .
Due to the low reliability of the computer elements on vacuum tubes and inaccessibility of transistors the fast elements on miniature ferrite cores and semiconductor diodes were designed .
These elements work as a controlled current transformer and were an effective base for implementation of the threshold logic and its ternary version in particular [ 7 ] .
Ternary threshold logic elements as compared with the binary ones provide more speed and reliability , require less equipment and power .
These were reasons to design a ternary computer .
" Setun " is a sequential computer containing the fast multiplier , thanks to the speed of operation as in parallel devices is achieved .
The small ( 3 pages of 54 words ) ferrite RAM that has page exchange with the main magnetic drum memory works as a cash .
" Setun " has an one - address architecture with one index-register .
The contents of it , in dependence of value ( +,0 , - ) of address modification trit , may be added to or subtracted from the address part of instruction .
The instruction set consists only of 24 instructions including performing mantissa normalization for floating - point calculation , shift , combined multiplication and addition .
Three instructions are reserved but have never been used because of the lack of necessity .
Simplicity , economy and elegance of computer architecture are the direct and practically very important consequence of the ternarity , more exactly – of representation of data and instructions by symmetrical ( balanced ) code , i.e. by code with digits 0 , +1 , - 1 .
In opposite to binary code there is no difference between " signed " and " unsigned " number .
As a result the amount of conditional instructions is decrease twice and it is possible to use them more easily ; the arithmetic operations allow free variation of the length of operands and may be executed with different lengths ; the ideal rounding is achieved simply by truncation , i.e. the truncation coincides with the rounding and there is the best approximation the rounding number by rounded .
The experience of creating , programming and application of " Setun " unambiguously confirmed the significant preferences of ternarity .
In spite of the fact that the designers of the first were very young and the group was small , the specimen of " Setun " was ready in Dec. 1958 , i.e. in two years since the beginning .
" Setun " worked correctly at once without even debugging and began to execute the existing programs .
At 1960 it was sufficient amount of programs and it was possible to present " Setun " for the official testing .
Such testing was passed in Apr. 1960 very successfully .
The computer demonstrated unusual for that times reliability and stability of operation in wide range of ambient temperature and supply voltage .
It was found that the computer is rather simple both in manufacturing and in service , suitable for wide range of applications .
" Setun " was recommended for production .
Unfortunately the officials of the computer production in the USSR had negative position about non-planned and unusual " fruit of university fantasy " .
Instead of supporting the innovation and taking a possible profit they permanently attempted to annihilate " ugly duckling " .
There were many orders of " Setun " , including ones for export , but only 10 - 15 computers were produced annually and none of them was exported aboard .
The planned manufacture of " Setun " in Czechoslovakia was also broken .
At 1965 the manufacturing of " Setun " was stopped in spite of unsatisfied requests .
It was replaced by a binary computer of the same performance but more than 2.5 times more expensive .
In total there were produced 50 computers ( including the specimens ) .
The 30 ones were installed at universities and colleges , the rest – at research laboratories and plants .
Geographically " Setun " were scattered all over the country – from Kaliningrad to Jakutsk and from Ashkhabad to Novosibirsk .
It was found that ternary computer is very favorable for seizing and application .
Simplicity of programming in codes ( it was decided not to make an assembler ) permitted to design a few interpreters mostly in Polish inverse ( postfix ) notation .
On such base it was possible to program the different tasks from engineering calculations and experimental results processing to manufacturing control and computer education .
On the base of " Setun ’s " positive experience it was designed and exhaustively determined in Algol - like programming language the architecture of other ternary computer [ 5 ] .
This computer named " Setun 70 " was introduced in 1970 [ 6 ] .
In " Setun 70 " the peculiarities of ternarity are embodied with more understanding and completeness : the ternary format for symbols encoding – " tryte " ( analog of binary byte ) consisting of 6 trits ( ~ 9.5 bits ) is established ; the instruction set is updated of auxiliary ternary logic and control instructions ; arithmetic instructions now allow more variation of operand length – 1 , 2 and 3 trytes and length of result may be up to 6 trytes .
The possibility to vary the length of the word - operands is expanded to the word - instructions .
More exactly , in " Setun 70 " the traditional conception of computer instruction as a word does not exists .
The program is a sequence of tryte - operations and tryte - addresses .
The executed combinations of such trytes may be interpreted as virtual instructions .
But there is no necessity for a programmer to think about this – he ( she ) constructs postfix expressions directly from the operands and operations by similar way as it is made in mathematics .
" Setun 70 " is a two - stack computer .
Stack of operands is the evolution of accumulator of one - address " Setun " .
The return stack is the base of an automata that controls the nesting of subprograms .
The simple improvement of such mechanism [ 8 ] permits to transform " Setun 70 " into some computer for the proposed Dijkstra E.W. structured programming .
An adequate realization of Dijkstra ideas [ 9 ] named the " procedure programming " , wholly proved his hopes about radical improvement of programming ( the goal not achieved in " structured revolution " [ 10 ] ) .
Construction and modificatin of the programs on " procedure programming computer " became more easily ( in 3 - 5 times ) and the perfect correctness has been achieved .
However " Setun 70 " was the last " ternac " .
After it the research was stopped .
In " Setun 70 " it was implemented the CAI system " Nastavnik " , the binary versions of which are the perfect example of effective realization of computer didactic up to now [ 11 ] .
The " procedure programming " was transformed into the Dialogue System of Structured Programming ( DSSP ) .
DSSP as a matter of fact emulates " Setun 70 " architecture on binary computers : thus it fulfills the advantages of " procedure programming " [ 12 ] .
DSSP exists and evolves , on its base there is originated a high - level " construct programming " [ 13 ] that allows in particular to realize the very simple and effective dialogue system of Boolean algebra [ 14 ] .
Some details of our work is available in [ 15 , 16 ] .
Reference :
Many of the texts i’m reading these days are talking about the move from childhood to adulthood and the liminal / transitional stage in - between .
Although the concept of “ teenager ” is relatively new ( created during the American depression to keep younger people out of the workforce ) , most societies have a transition period between childhood and adulthood .
Of course , girls ’ transition has been historically marked by menstruation while boys tend to go through some ritual of moving into adulthood .
In almost all these texts , adulthood is seen as a desirable state to be in , full of all sorts of privileges .
It is assumed that children want to move into adulthood and that part of the liminal stage is about taking on adult privileges ( sex , drinking , … ) while still having childhood responsibilities ( a.k.a. few ) .
In most societies , the key to the transitional phase is the removal from the core community to a separate one and then a return …
Contemporary American society has really stretched the liminal stage to include mandatory high school and socially required college .
Rather than moving into adulthood at menstruation / male strength periods , we have another 10 years to wait before we are deemed adults .
We do n’t even leave home until 18 even though menstruation has dropped to 12 and below .
With the liminal stage stretched out , there ’s a drastic increase in participating in adult behaviors with childhood responsibilities .
I started thinking about Burning Man ( yes , i bought tickets this week ) and how , in many ways , it is a celebration of this liminality .
We all go to the desert to act like some peculiar combination of adults and children , represented in the imagination by romping around , making ourselves all messy , sex & insobriety , building large Lego - esque projects , having little responsibility .
I was also thinking about rave culture .
On one hand , we are all trying to take on privileges of adulthood – sex & insobriety , lack of curfew – while working hard to look like small children – big painted eyes and phat pants that create the impression of child - like proportions , bright colors , pacifiers .
I ’m kinda torn in resolving all of this .
In many ways , i feel like half of my generation does n’t want to grow up while half is working hard to do so .
How much of this has to do with our inability to inherit certain other privileges of adulthood ( power , money ) and our lack of interest in dealing with adult responsibilities that are getting increasingly harder like money and health ?
As adults live longer , there is more pressure to remove youth from the workforce , from any position where they can compete .
How much is this fucking with the dynamics ?
How much is the generational divisions and the efforts to legally regulate young people ( both now and in their futures by faulting them for their youth ) part of adults ’ need to maintain power at risk of losing it to a larger liminal generation ?
When the idea of teenagers was created during the depression , schooling became mandatory .
In some senses , this was ideal because it meant that a larger portion of the population was prepared for the future .
But over time , a high school diploma no longer served as a ticket to a better life .
And then it was college .
And then it was graduate school .
What next ?
And what about the fact that we no longer have a construct of “ success ” for working class kids ?
By removing unions and life - long well - paying factory gigs and government jobs with pensions , we ’ve turned “ success ” into a game that can only be acquired through pre-existing privilege or a lottery ( becoming a “ star ” ) .
This really marginalizes a huge chunk of today ’s youth culture .
What if you are n’t really meant to be college bound ?
What then ?
The service economy is not exactly appealing .
No wonder drugs are continuously rising both because using them lets you escape and dealing them provides a way out .
It seems to me that we ’re running full speed into a crisis stemming from a build - up of pushing off moving into adulthood , increasing doubt about the opportunities of adulthood and the complete failure to provide necessary support structures for the population .
I ’m not sure i have my head entirely yet …
Am i crazy ?
Can we really have a stable society without a feasible success route for non-knowledge workers ?
Can we really function with adulthood being pushed off into the mid/late 20s ?

One of life 's greatest sources of satisfaction is the knowledge that something you have created is contributing to the progress of welfare of society .
Some people even get paid for writing computer programs !
Programming can therefore be triply rewarding --- on aesthetic , humanitarian , and economic grounds .
Of course I do n't mean to imply that programming is easy .
Easy things are often amusing and relaxing , but their value soon fades .
Greater pleasure , deeper satisfaction , and higher wages are associated with genuine accomplishments , with the successful fulfillment of a challenging task .
I have spent a good deal of my life trying to help make computer programming as rewarding as possible , in all three senses .
t first , I thought programming was primarily analogous to musical composition --- to the creation of intricate patterns , which are meant to be performed .
But lately I have come to realize that a far better analogy is available : Programming is best regarded as the process of creating works of literature , which are meant to be read .
Literature of the program genre is performable by machines , but that is not its main purpose .
The computer programs that are truly beautiful , useful , and profitable must be readable by people .
So we ought to address them to people , not to machines .
All of the major problems associated with computer programming --- issues of reliability , portability , learnability , maintainability , and efficiency --- are ameliorated when programs and their dialogs with users become more literate .
...
Literate programming is still a fairly new concept , still in its infancy , still undergoing much - needed experimentation .
Many people have contributed important ideas and independent approaches to the creation of systems that improve on WEB in various ways .
In this book I describe the techniques that have worked best for me , but I have never imagined that any of my ideas would be the " last word " in any sense .
I am sure that people with differing tastes will prefer a system that differs from my own initial attempts .
The time is on ripe for second - generation systems that integrate literate programming into complete programming environments . "
-- Donald E. Knuth , " Literate Programming " , 1992 .
The MegaPenny Project
by kokogiak media Visualizing huge numbers can be very difficult .
People regularly talk about millions of miles , billions of bytes , or trillions of dollars , yet it 's still hard to grasp just how much a " billion " really is .
The MegaPenny Project aims to help by taking one small everyday item , the U.S. penny , and building on that to answer the question : " What would a billion ( or a trillion ) pennies look like ? "
All the following pages have tables at the bottom , listing things such as the value of the pennies , size of the pile , weight , and area ( if laid flat ) .
All weights and measurements are U.S. standards , not metric .
It 's best to step through the project from start to beginning , but if you 'd like to just jump in , links are available below .

March 2005
( Parts of this essay began as replies to students who wrote to me with questions . )
Recently I 've had several emails from computer science undergrads asking what to do in college .
I might not be the best source of advice , because I was a philosophy major in college .
But I took so many CS classes that most CS majors thought I was one .
I was certainly a hacker , at least .
Hacking
What should you do in college to become a good hacker ?
There are two main things you can do : become very good at programming , and learn a lot about specific , cool problems .
These turn out to be equivalent , because each drives you to do the other .
The way to be good at programming is to work ( a ) a lot ( b ) on hard problems .
And the way to make yourself work on hard problems is to work on some very engaging project .
Odds are this project wo n't be a class assignment .
My friend Robert learned a lot by writing network software when he was an undergrad .
One of his projects was to connect Harvard to the Arpanet ; it had been one of the original nodes , but by 1984 the connection had died . [ 1 ]
Not only was this work not for a class , but because he spent all his time on it and neglected his studies , he was kicked out of school for a year . [ 2 ]
It all evened out in the end , and now he 's a professor at MIT .
But you 'll probably be happier if you do n't go to that extreme ; it caused him a lot of worry at the time .
Another way to be good at programming is to find other people who are good at it , and learn what they know .
Programmers tend to sort themselves into tribes according to the type of work they do and the tools they use , and some tribes are smarter than others .
Look around you and see what the smart people seem to be working on ; there 's usually a reason .
Some of the smartest people around you are professors .
So one way to find interesting work is to volunteer as a research assistant .
Professors are especially interested in people who can solve tedious system - administration type problems for them , so that is a way to get a foot in the door .
What they fear are flakes and resume padders .
It 's all too common for an assistant to result in a net increase in work .
So you have to make it clear you 'll mean a net decrease .
Do n't be put off if they say no .
Rejection is almost always less personal than the rejectee imagines .
Just move on to the next .
( This applies to dating too . )
Beware , because although most professors are smart , not all of them work on interesting stuff .
Professors have to publish novel results to advance their careers , but there is more competition in more interesting areas of research .
So what less ambitious professors do is turn out a series of papers whose conclusions are novel because no one else cares about them .
You 're better off avoiding these .
I never worked as a research assistant , so I feel a bit dishonest recommending that route .
I learned to program by writing stuff of my own , particularly by trying to reverse - engineer Winograd 's SHRDLU .
I was as obsessed with that program as a mother with a new baby .
Whatever the disadvantages of working by yourself , the advantage is that the project is all your own .
You never have to compromise or ask anyone 's permission , and if you have a new idea you can just sit down and start implementing it .
In your own projects you do n't have to worry about novelty ( as professors do ) or profitability ( as businesses do ) .
All that matters is how hard the project is technically , and that has no correlation to the nature of the application .
" Serious " applications like databases are often trivial and dull technically ( if you ever suffer from insomnia , try reading the technical literature about databases ) while " frivolous " applications like games are often very sophisticated .
I 'm sure there are game companies out there working on products with more intellectual content than the research at the bottom nine tenths of university CS departments .
If I were in college now I 'd probably work on graphics : a network game , for example , or a tool for 3D animation .
When I was an undergrad there were n't enough cycles around to make graphics interesting , but it 's hard to imagine anything more fun to work on now .
Math
When I was in college , a lot of the professors believed ( or at least wished ) that computer science was a branch of math .
This idea was strongest at Harvard , where there was n't even a CS major till the 1980s ; till then one had to major in applied math .
But it was nearly as bad at Cornell .
When I told the fearsome Professor Conway that I was interested in AI ( a hot topic then ) , he told me I should major in math .
I 'm still not sure whether he thought AI required math , or whether he thought AI was nonsense and that majoring in something rigorous would cure me of such stupid ambitions .
In fact , the amount of math you need as a hacker is a lot less than most university departments like to admit .
I do n't think you need much more than high school math plus a few concepts from the theory of computation .
( You have to know what an n^2 algorithm is if you want to avoid writing them . )
Unless you 're planning to write math applications , of course .
Robotics , for example , is all math .
But while you do n't literally need math for most kinds of hacking , in the sense of knowing 1001 tricks for differentiating formulas , math is very much worth studying for its own sake .
It 's a valuable source of metaphors for almost any kind of work . [ 3 ]
I wish I 'd studied more math in college for that reason .
Like a lot of people , I was mathematically abused as a child .
I learned to think of math as a collection of formulas that were neither beautiful nor had any relation to my life ( despite attempts to translate them into " word problems " ) , but had to be memorized in order to do well on tests .
One of the most valuable things you could do in college would be to learn what math is really about .
This may not be easy , because a lot of good mathematicians are bad teachers .
And while there are many popular books on math , few seem good .
The best I can think of are W. W. Sawyer's .
And of course Euclid . [ 4 ]
Everything
Thomas Huxley said " Try to learn something about everything and everything about something . "
Most universities aim at this ideal .
But what 's everything ?
To me it means , all that people learn in the course of working honestly on hard problems .
All such work tends to be related , in that ideas and techniques from one field can often be transplanted successfully to others .
Even others that seem quite distant .
For example , I write essays the same way I write software : I sit down and blow out a lame version 1 as fast as I can type , then spend several weeks rewriting it .
Working on hard problems is not , by itself , enough .
Medieval alchemists were working on a hard problem , but their approach was so bogus that there was little to learn from studying it , except possibly about people 's ability to delude themselves .
Unfortunately the sort of AI I was trying to learn in college had the same flaw : a very hard problem , blithely approached with hopelessly inadequate techniques .
Bold ?
Closer to fraudulent .
The social sciences are also fairly bogus , because they 're so much influenced by intellectual fashions .
If a physicist met a colleague from 100 years ago , he could teach him some new things ; if a psychologist met a colleague from 100 years ago , they 'd just get into an ideological argument .
Yes , of course , you 'll learn something by taking a psychology class .
The point is , you 'll learn more by taking a class in another department .
The worthwhile departments , in my opinion , are math , the hard sciences , engineering , history ( especially economic and social history , and the history of science ) , architecture , and the classics .
A survey course in art history may be worthwhile .
Modern literature is important , but the way to learn about it is just to read .
I do n't know enough about music to say .
You can skip the social sciences , philosophy , and the various departments created recently in response to political pressures .
Many of these fields talk about important problems , certainly .
But the way they talk about them is useless .
For example , philosophy talks , among other things , about our obligations to one another ; but you can learn more about this from a wise grandmother or E. B .
White than from an academic philosopher .
I speak here from experience .
I should probably have been offended when people laughed at Clinton for saying " It depends on what the meaning of the word ' is ' is . "
I took about five classes in college on what the meaning of " is " is .
Another way to figure out which fields are worth studying is to create the dropout graph .
For example , I know many people who switched from math to computer science because they found math too hard , and no one who did the opposite .
People do n't do hard things gratuitously ; no one will work on a harder problem unless it is proportionately ( or at least log (n ) ) more rewarding .
So probably math is more worth studying than computer science .
By similar comparisons you can make a graph of all the departments in a university .
At the bottom you 'll find the subjects with least intellectual content .
If you use this method , you 'll get roughly the same answer I just gave .
Language courses are an anomaly .
I think they 're better considered as extracurricular activities , like pottery classes .
They'd be far more useful when combined with some time living in a country where the language is spoken .
On a whim I studied Arabic as a freshman .
It was a lot of work , and the only lasting benefits were a weird ability to identify semitic roots and some insights into how people recognize words .
Studio art and creative writing courses are wildcards .
Usually you do n't get taught much : you just work ( or do n't work ) on whatever you want , and then sit around offering " crits " of one another 's creations under the vague supervision of the teacher .
But writing and art are both very hard problems that ( some ) people work honestly at , so they 're worth doing , especially if you can find a good teacher .
Jobs
Of course college students have to think about more than just learning .
There are also two practical problems to consider : jobs , and graduate school .
In theory a liberal education is not supposed to supply job training .
But everyone knows this is a bit of a fib .
Hackers at every college learn practical skills , and not by accident .
What you should learn to get a job depends on the kind you want .
If you want to work in a big company , learn how to hack Blub on Windows .
If you want to work at a cool little company or research lab , you 'll do better to learn Ruby on Linux .
And if you want to start your own company , which I think will be more and more common , master the most powerful tools you can find , because you 're going to be in a race against your competitors , and they 'll be your horse .
There is not a direct correlation between the skills you should learn in college and those you 'll use in a job .
You should aim slightly high in college .
In workouts a football player may bench press 300 pounds , even though he may never have to exert anything like that much force in the course of a game .
Likewise , if your professors try to make you learn stuff that 's more advanced than you 'll need in a job , it may not just be because they 're academics , detached from the real world .
They may be trying to make you lift weights with your brain .
The programs you write in classes differ in three critical ways from the ones you 'll write in the real world : they 're small ; you get to start from scratch ; and the problem is usually artificial and predetermined .
In the real world , programs are bigger , tend to involve existing code , and often require you to figure out what the problem is before you can solve it .
You do n't have to wait to leave ( or even enter ) college to learn these skills .
If you want to learn how to deal with existing code , for example , you can contribute to open - source projects .
The sort of employer you want to work for will be as impressed by that as good grades on class assignments .
In existing open - source projects you do n't get much practice at the third skill , deciding what problems to solve .
But there 's nothing to stop you starting new projects of your own .
And good employers will be even more impressed with that .
What sort of problem should you try to solve ?
One way to answer that is to ask what you need as a user .
For example , I stumbled on a good algorithm for spam filtering because I wanted to stop getting spam .
Now what I wish I had was a mail reader that somehow prevented my inbox from filling up .
I tend to use my inbox as a todo list .
But that 's like using a screwdriver to open bottles ; what one really wants is a bottle opener .
Grad School
What about grad school ?
Should you go ?
And how do you get into a good one ?
In principle , grad school is professional training in research , and you should n't go unless you want to do research as a career .
And yet half the people who get PhDs in CS do n't go into research .
I did n't go to grad school to become a professor .
I went because I wanted to learn more .
So if you 're mainly interested in hacking and you go to grad school , you 'll find a lot of other people who are similarly out of their element .
And if half the people around you are out of their element in the same way you are , are you really out of your element ?
There 's a fundamental problem in " computer science , " and it surfaces in situations like this .
No one is sure what " research " is supposed to be .
A lot of research is hacking that had to be crammed into the form of an academic paper to yield one more quantum of publication .
So it 's kind of misleading to ask whether you 'll be at home in grad school , because very few people are quite at home in computer science .
The whole field is uncomfortable in its own skin .
So the fact that you 're mainly interested in hacking should n't deter you from going to grad school .
Just be warned you 'll have to do a lot of stuff you do n't like .
Number one will be your dissertation .
Almost everyone hates their dissertation by the time they 're done with it .
The process inherently tends to produce an unpleasant result , like a cake made out of whole wheat flour and baked for twelve hours .
Few dissertations are read with pleasure , especially by their authors .
But thousands before you have suffered through writing a dissertation .
And aside from that , grad school is close to paradise .
Many people remember it as the happiest time of their lives .
And nearly all the rest , including me , remember it as a period that would have been , if they had n't had to write a dissertation . [ 5 ]
The danger with grad school is that you do n't see the scary part upfront .
PhD programs start out as college part 2 , with several years of classes .
So by the time you face the horror of writing a dissertation , you 're already several years in .
If you quit now , you 'll be a grad - school dropout , and you probably wo n't like that idea .
When Robert got kicked out of grad school for writing the Internet worm of 1988 , I envied him enormously for finding a way out without the stigma of failure .
On the whole , grad school is probably better than most alternatives .
You meet a lot of smart people , and your glum procrastination will at least be a powerful common bond .
And of course you have a PhD at the end .
I forgot about that .
I suppose that 's worth something .
The greatest advantage of a PhD ( besides being the union card of academia , of course ) may be that it gives you some baseline confidence .
For example , the Honeywell thermostats in my house have the most atrocious UI .
My mother , who has the same model , diligently spent a day reading the user 's manual to learn how to operate hers .
She assumed the problem was with her .
But I can think to myself " If someone with a PhD in computer science can't understand this thermostat , it must be badly designed . "
If you still want to go to grad school after this equivocal recommendation , I can give you solid advice about how to get in .
A lot of my friends are CS professors now , so I have the inside story about admissions .
It 's quite different from college .
At most colleges , admissions officers decide who gets in .
For PhD programs , the professors do .
And they try to do it well , because the people they admit are going to be working for them .
Apparently only recommendations really matter at the best schools .
Standardized tests count for nothing , and grades for little .
The essay is mostly an opportunity to disqualify yourself by saying something stupid .
The only thing professors trust is recommendations , preferably from people they know . [ 6 ]
So if you want to get into a PhD program , the key is to impress your professors .
And from my friends who are professors I know what impresses them : not merely trying to impress them .
They 're not impressed by students who get good grades or want to be their research assistants so they can get into grad school .
They 're impressed by students who get good grades and want to be their research assistants because they 're genuinely interested in the topic .
So the best thing you can do in college , whether you want to get into grad school or just be good at hacking , is figure out what you truly like .
It 's hard to trick professors into letting you into grad school , and impossible to trick problems into letting you solve them .
College is where faking stops working .
From this point , unless you want to go work for a big company , which is like reverting to high school , the only way forward is through doing what you love .
Notes
[ 1 ]
No one seems to have minded , which shows how unimportant the Arpanet ( which became the Internet ) was as late as 1984 .
[ 2 ]
This is why , when I became an employer , I did n't care about GPAs .
In fact , we actively sought out people who'd failed out of school .
We once put up posters around Harvard saying " Did you just get kicked out for doing badly in your classes because you spent all your time working on some project of your own ?
Come work for us ! "
We managed to find a kid who had been , and he was a great hacker .
When Harvard kicks undergrads out for a year , they have to get jobs .
The idea is to show them how awful the real world is , so they 'll understand how lucky they are to be in college .
This plan backfired with the guy who came to work for us , because he had more fun than he'd had in school , and made more that year from stock options than any of his professors did in salary .
So instead of crawling back repentant at the end of the year , he took another year off and went to Europe .
He did eventually graduate at about 26 .
[ 3 ]
Eric Raymond says the best metaphors for hackers are in set theory , combinatorics , and graph theory .
Trevor Blackwell reminds you to take math classes intended for math majors .
" ' Math for engineers ' classes sucked mightily .
In fact any 'x for engineers ' sucks , where x includes math , law , writing and visual design . "
[ 4 ]
Other highly recommended books : What is Mathematics ? , by Courant and Robbins ; Geometry and the Imagination by Hilbert and Cohn - Vossen .
And for those interested in graphic design , Byrne 's Euclid .
[ 5 ]
If you wanted to have the perfect life , the thing to do would be to go to grad school , secretly write your dissertation in the first year or two , and then just enjoy yourself for the next three years , dribbling out a chapter at a time .
This prospect will make grad students ' mouths water , but I know of no one who 's had the discipline to pull it off .
[ 6 ]
One professor friend says that 15 - 20 % of the grad students they admit each year are " long shots . "
But what he means by long shots are people whose applications are perfect in every way , except that no one on the admissions committee knows the professors who wrote the recommendations .
So if you want to get into grad school in the sciences , you need to go to college somewhere with real research professors .
Otherwise you 'll seem a risky bet to admissions committees , no matter how good you are .
Which implies a surprising but apparently inevitable consequence : little liberal arts colleges are doomed .
Most smart high school kids at least consider going into the sciences , even if they ultimately choose not to .
Why go to a college that limits their options ?
Thanks to Trevor Blackwell , Alex Lewin , Jessica Livingston , Robert Morris , Eric Raymond , and several anonymous CS professors for reading drafts of this , and to the students whose questions began it .

As New Orleans slips into lawlessness after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf of Mexico coast , officials say they can still only guess at the death toll of the disaster — though it is likely to be in the thousands .
Many survivors are still waiting for help
THE natural catastrophe is past , but the human catastrophe in the wake of Hurricane Katrina seems to be worsening still .
Around four - fifths of New Orleans was still under water on Thursday September 1st , three days after the storm slammed into Louisiana , with winds roaring up to 140 mph .
Much of the city is below sea level and its ageing levees — a system of flood walls , earthworks and pumping stations designed to hold the waters back — could not resist Katrina 's might .
As the hurricane travelled on across Mississippi , Tennessee and Alabama , it left a trail of death and devastation there too .
Officials say it is impossible to know how many people have been killed , but the official count has already moved into the hundreds ; at least 30 died in a single catastrophic collapse of a seaside apartment building in Biloxi , Mississippi .
In New Orleans , reports of bodies floating in the floodwaters herald a dreadful accounting to come ; the mayor has said that the final death toll may be in the thousands .
With many roads blocked by the floods and fallen trees , rescue workers and volunteers are working round the clock to reach the uncounted number in need of food , medical attention and uncontaminated drinking water .
But while catastrophes often bring out the best in people , in this case it has brought out some of the worst , too .
Looters and armed gangs stalk New Orleans , fires started by arsonists rage as desperate refugees clamour for rescue , and CNN has reported shots fired at medical convoys evacuating the sick and helpless .
On Thursday , more troops were sent in to quell the lawlessness .
In the early hours of Friday , the waterfront area was rocked by a series of massive blasts that sent clouds of acrid smoke drifting across the city .
It was not clear what had caused the explosions , which , according to early reports , may have come from a chemical plant .
Some are warning that it could be a matter of weeks , or even months , before electricity is restored to all of the millions who lost it in the wake of the storm .
The army 's chief engineer says it could take up to 30 days to remove the water , and New Orleans officials have said it could be several months before those who fled before Katrina hit are able to return .
Though most of the city 's residents left before the storm , huge efforts are now being made to rescue and evacuate those who remained behind to care for pets or ageing relatives and neighbours , or simply because they had nowhere else to go .
The Superdome , a downtown sports arena , was a temporary home for at least 20,000 , but heat , humidity , failed plumbing and a lack of supplies have turned it into a festering nightmare .
Buses are now being brought in to transport the refugees to a stadium in Houston , but violence and the overwhelming number of the needy have slowed this and other evacuation efforts .
Reports have emerged of people dying in the crowds waiting for buses to take them to safety .
More worrisome still is the toll of disease on those who are trying to wade to safety .
The floodwaters are now a toxic stew of raw sewage , household and industrial chemicals , and the rotting corpses of the people and pets who drowned as the waters rose .
Doctors worry that this may mean an increase in the sorts of gastrointestinal diseases commonly seen only in the poorest countries .
The water is also an excellent breeding ground for mosquitoes , particularly in the warm , wet climate of the Gulf Coast , which could mean a spike in mosquito - borne illnesses such as West Nile virus .
Once the floodwaters have been pumped out of the city — which may take weeks — insurers expect a deluge of claims .
Estimates of the losses range from $ 9 billion to $ 25 billion .
The high end of this range would make Katrina the most expensive natural disaster in America 's history for underwriters , topping the $ 21 billion paid out after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 .
To the insurers ' losses must be added the cost to the government of rescue operations , plus many uninsured losses that will ultimately be met by private individuals or the taxpayers .
For instance , homeowners ' insurance typically does not include flood coverage , which is underwritten by the federal government , and business - interruption insurance may not cover losses from looting .
There will undoubtedly be wrangling between insurance adjusters , homeowners and the feds over what water damage was due to the storm , and what is attributable to the rising flood .
NOVEMBER 16--Meet Bryan James Hathaway , alleged venison lover .
The Wisconsin man , 20 , is facing charges that he had sex last month with a dead deer .
Hathaway , who previously has served time for killing a horse he intended to sexually assault , allegedly found the deer in a ditch alongside a roadway .
Now Hathaway 's lawyer has filed a court motion ( a copy of which you 'll find here ) arguing that since the animal was already dead , Hathaway should not face a misdemeanor rap of sexual gratification with an animal .
" The statute does not prohibit one from having sex with a carcass , " lawyer Fredric Anderson wrote in the motion filed in Douglas County Circuit Court .
As reported in today 's Daily Telegram , in response to Anderson 's motion , prosecutor James Boughner noted that state criminal statutes did not seem to " draw a line between the living and the dead . "
Judge Michael Lucci , who heard motion arguments Tuesday , said he will issue a decision by December 1 .
Hathaway is pictured at left in a Wisconsin Department of Corrections mug shot .

It 's endemic to Republicans .
Covering up sexual predation by a Member of the House of Representatives is one thing .
But covering up the fact that Condoleeza Rice ignored warnings she received in July 2001 about the potential for an imminent attack by al Qaida on American soil is a whole new level of malfeasance and deceit
Details of the previously undisclosed meeting on July 10 , 2001 , two months before the Sept. 11 terror attacks , were first reported last week in a new book by the journalist Bob Woodward .
The final report from the Sept. 11 commission made no mention of the meeting nor did it suggest there had been such an encounter between Mr. Tenet and Ms. Rice , now secretary of state .
. . .
Although passages of the book suggest that Mr. Tenet was a major source for Mr. Woodward , the former intelligence director has refused to comment on the book .
Nor has there been any comment from J. Cofer Black , Mr. Tenet 's counterterrorism chief , who is reported in the book to have attended the July 10 meeting and left it frustrated by Ms. Rice 's " brush - off " of the warnings .
He is quoted as saying , " The only thing we did n't do was pull the trigger to the gun we were holding to her head . "
Mr. Black did not return calls left at the security firm Blackwater , which he joined last year .
The book says that Mr. Tenet hurriedly organized the meeting -- calling ahead from his car as it traveled to the White House -- because he wanted to " shake Rice " into persuading the president to respond to dire intelligence warnings that summer about a terrorist strike .
Mr. Woodward writes that Mr. Tenet left the meeting frustrated because " they were not getting through to Rice . "
The disclosures took members of the bipartisan Sept. 11 commission by surprise last week .
Some questioned whether information about the July 10 meeting was intentionally withheld from the panel .
Ms Chavez said she was n't prepared to be crushed like an ant
When Coca - Cola 's Mexican subsidiary told Raquel Chavez to get rid of a rival cola product or else they might stop selling her Coke , she took action .
She complained to Mexican competition authorities , who have now hit Coca - Cola with fines totalling $ 68 m ( £ 40 m ) .
Ms Chavez , 49 , said she would not be " crushed like an ant " .
Coca -Cola denies wrongdoing and has lodged an appeal .
Rival cola
The row started bubbling in 2002 when the fast - talking shopkeeper began to stock Big Cola , a newly created rival product from Peru .
You [ Coca - Cola ] may call the shots everywhere else , but I 'm the boss in my store
Raquel Chavez
Big Cola was instantly popular in Ms Chavez 's deprived suburb as it is significantly cheaper than Coke and the other big name soft drink brands .
When a Coca - Cola distributor told Ms Chavez to remove the product from her shelves , she went to Mexico 's Federal Competition Commission .
Now three years later , Coca - Cola 's Mexican unit - Coca - Cola Export Corporation - and a number of its distributors and bottlers have been hit with fines of $ 68 m .
Some $ 13 m of this is directly a result of Ms Chavez 's complaint , and $ 53 m is thanks to a parallel case brought by Coca - Cola 's main rival Pepsi .
' Standing up '
" I told them [ Coca - Cola ] , ' you ca n't refuse to sell to me , that 's unconstitutional ' , " said Ms Chavez .
Coca -Cola dominates the Mexican soft drinks market
" I did n't really know if it was unconstitutional , but I said it anyway . "
She added that she told the Coca - Cola distributor : " You may call the shots everywhere else , but I 'm the boss in my store . "
Ms Chavez said she felt proud after her victory , but she did not expect to win .
" I was sure we would lose , because in Mexico for so long , people get away with anything , " she said .
" Maybe now people will start standing up for themselves . "
Appeal process
Coca - Cola spokesman Charlie Sutlive said the company respected the decision of Mexican competition authorities .
" However , we have used the appeal processes open to us to present arguments that our business practices comply with Mexican competition laws , and to demonstrate that our commercial practices are fair , " he said .
Analysts expect the fines to be reduced after the appeal process .
More Coca - Cola products are consumed per person in Mexico than any other country , and the company has 70 % of the nation 's soft drinks market .
In June , Coca - Cola in Europe formally agreed to end deals with shops and bars to stock its drinks exclusively after a European Union investigation found its business methods stifled competition .
In Mexico City Ms Chavez is now continuing with work as normal at her shop .
" I am a common citizen who demands her rights , but wo n't allow herself to be stepped on , that 's all , " she said .
Your comments :
I think this is a fantastic ruling , and hopefully it will be upheld in the face of any appeal .
While we never stop hearing about the benefits of free - trade , it seems that it only exists for the big companies and powerful countries .
There are so many restrictive practises in place that affect consumers , it is time they were highlighted and torn down .

Good on her - let 's hope she sets an example to more people to stand up to the big bully boys .
Nathalie Marshall , Swindon UK
I think this is a wonderful ruling for ordinary people everywhere .
Hopefully more people will be encouraged and inspired by Ms. Chavez 's story .
Lewis Turner , Beit Sahour , Palestine
Ms Chavez is to be applauded in her successful fight .
Multinationals practicing anti-competition and protectionism should be challenged at every level to level the playing field for smaller businesses .

I think this story only highlights the edge that companies will go to , to have a monopoly in a store , or store chain or even as evident from this story a country wide monopoly .
I think it is totally unjust of Coke to do so and am glad that a big corporate has been hit with a big fine , if only more of this actually happened around the world rather than just being slapped on the wrist for doing something wrong !
Luke , Reading , Berkshire
I sincerely congratulate Mrs. Chavez .

Coca Cola are quite within their rights to ask any shop owner to not sell another brand , in the same way it is the shop owners right to refuse the request .
If Coca Cola want to refuse to sell to any individual , then that is their prerogative as the manufacturer .
The shop owner must decide whether they make more profit from a variety of other brands , or by stocking only Coca Cola 's brand .
I thought this freedom of choice for all was an integral part of the capitalist society .

Ministers want to promote a get - up - and go attitude
A new body will try to boost financial literacy and communicate the benefits of wealth creation more effectively .
The rejection of an unpopular labour contract earlier this year is seen to have reinforced prevailing sceptical attitudes toward business in society .
Ministers want people to get a clearer understanding of France 's economy .
Financial awareness
Attempts at economic reform have largely stalled and some senior ministers , including presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy , have called for a radical break with France 's corporatist economic model .
They are worried about what they see as an over - reliance on the state and a lack of entrepreneurial dynamism .
The Council for the Diffusion of Economic Culture will operate under the auspices of the finance ministry when it launches later this year .
It will be headed by Claude Perdriel , a media veteran who once edited the current affairs magazine Le Nouvel Observateur .
Attempts at economic reforms have led to mass protests
The new body will seek to promote financial education through popular culture including television , the print media and computer games .
A survey earlier this year revealed widespread ignorance of financial terminology including the meaning of issues such as debt and output .
Finance minister Thierry Breton lamented the " significant lack of an economic culture " in France in a speech earlier this year .
Attitudes to the private sector have hardened since the government was forced to drop an employment contract in the face of mass protests .
The measure , designed to help tackle youth unemployment by making it easier for firms to hire and fire workers , was criticised for favouring the interests of business owners over employees .

At first we were excited about the Ektra , which Kodak billed as the photographer 's phone .
But its 21 - megapixel shooter was n't all that great , it has a poor battery life and the design is clunky and feels cheap .
Worst of all ?
It 's way too expensive for its own good .

Do n't get us wrong -- the Phab 2
Pro is a completely novel device .
With a 16 - megapixel rear camera that has Tango depth sensor and motion tracking from Google , its 3D camera system can render an interactive augmented reality between virtual objects and the real world .
But as a phone in itself , it 's pretty meh .
It 's big and heavy , runs an old version of Android , has a short battery life and does n't have NFC .

We 'll admit that the Le S3 is fast and competitively - priced .
But there are just too many things that we do n't like about it .
It has a clunky interface , the content it provides under its live streaming service is underwhelming and it lacks a headphone jack .
And despite LeEco's predicting for being tech 's next great disruptor , the company is going through some troubles .

With the DTEK50 ( ) , BlackBerry put its own spin on Google 's Android OS .
And while the software experience was relatively fine , everything else was sort of disappointing .
The camera was weak in low - light settings and the phone 's performance was slow .
Plus , the claim that the device is " The World 's Most Secure Android Smartphone " is overblown .
In reality , its security features come included in most Android phones .
Bummer .

The Forgotten War The Korean War was a bloody conflict .
It left Korea , North and South , with several million dead and the UN forces involved in the fighting with over 100,000 casualties .
But despite fighting as intense and as violent as any other conflict since World War Two , Korea has always been history 's ' Forgotten War ' .
... US commanders repeatedly , and without ambiguity , ordered forces under their control to target and kill Korean refugees caught on the battlefield .
While atrocities conducted both by North and South Korean forces have already been documented , recently a much darker side to the US involvement in the Korean War has begun to emerge .
It casts a shadow over the conduct of US forces during the conflict , particularly of officers and generals in command .
Declassified military documents recently found in the US National Archives show clearly how US commanders repeatedly , and without ambiguity , ordered forces under their control to target and kill Korean refugees caught on the battlefield .
More disturbing still have been the published testimonies of Korean survivors who recall such killings , and the frank accounts of those American veterans brave enough to admit involvement .
The Korean War began on 25 June 1950 when communist North Korea invaded the South with six army divisions .
These North Korean forces , backed by impressive Soviet equipment including tanks , made quick gains into the territory .
The United States decided to intervene in the defence of the South and , taking advantage of the Soviet absence from the UN Security Council , proceeded to press for UN resolutions condemning the invasion .
Days later a resolution was passed calling upon member countries to give assistance to South Korea to repulse the attack .
General Douglas MacArthur , then in charge of US forces in the Pacific and of the occupation of Japan , was appointed commander of the joint forces .
Top
Undertrained and underprepared
Things began to go wrong almost immediately for the American troops .
Those who were rushed to the front line straight from occupation duty in Tokyo in July 1950 were undertrained and underprepared .
They were also badly led and quickly defeated by superior North Korean forces .
US commanders were outmanoeuvred by North Korean units using guerrilla methods to target US lines from the rear .
But there was another problem .
The surprise attack from the North had generated a very real refugee crisis .
Just weeks after the conflict had begun , up to two million refugees were streaming across the battlefield ; they clogged the roads and the UN lines .
Under pressure and fearing North Korean infiltration , the US leadership panicked .
Soon command saw all civilians as the enemy regardless .
On 26 July the US 8th Army , the highest level of command in Korea , issued orders to stop all Korean civilians .
' No , repeat , no refugees will be permitted to cross battle lines at any time .
Movement of all Koreans in group will cease immediately . '
On the very same day the first major disaster involving civilians struck .
... up to 400 South Korean civilians gathered by the bridge were killed by US forces from the 7th Cavalry Regiment .
The stone bridge near the village of No Gun Ri spans a small stream .
It is similar to a great many others that cross the landscape of South Korea , except that the walls of this bridge were , until very recently , pockmarked by hundreds of bullet holes .
On the very day that the US 8th Army delivered its stop refugee order in July 1950 , up to 400 South Korean civilians gathered by the bridge were killed by US forces from the 7th Cavalry Regiment .
Some were shot above the bridge , on the railroad tracks .
Others were strafed by US planes .
More were killed under the arches in an ordeal that local survivors say lasted for three days .
Top
Deadly orders
' The floor under the bridge was a mixture of gravel and sand .
People clawed with their bare hands to make holes to hide in , ' recalls survivor Yang Hae Chan .
' Other people piled up the dead like a barricade , and hid behind the bodies as a shield against the bullets . '
Corroborating the Korean survivors ' testimony are the accounts of 35 veterans of the 7th Cavalry Regiment who recall events at No Gun Ri. Perspectives differ , but the detailed memories of veterans recalling events burnt into their souls by their first days in combat are as painful as they are shocking .
' There was a lieutenant screaming like a madman , fire on everything , kill 'em all , ' recalls 7th Cavalry veteran Joe Jackman .
' I did n't know if they were soldiers or what .
Kids , there was kids out there , it did n't matter what it was , eight to 80 , blind , crippled or crazy , they shot 'em all . '
Along with the My Lai atrocity 20 years later in Vietnam , the killings discovered at No Gun Ri mark one of the largest single massacres of civilians by American forces in the 20th century .
When the news of the killings at No Gun Ri was first broken by a team of investigative journalists from the Associated Press in September 1999 , the effects were to be as seismic as the allegations themselves .
Top
Darkness revealed America was deeply shocked by the AP report .
Previously , the US Army had dismissed the claims of South Korean survivors who , since 1960 , had been trying to tell the truth about the killings at No Gun Ri .
The Army said that US forces were not even in the area of No Gun Ri at the time of the killings .
But not only did new evidence put No Gun Ri firmly within the US 7th Cavalry area of operations at the time , the discovery of US veterans willing to talk about events 50 years later made the massacre undeniable .
The Clinton administration quickly directed that the Pentagon , specifically the Army , conduct an investigation into what actually happened at No Gun Ri. ... as late as January 1951 , the US 8th Army was detailing all units in Korea that refugees be attacked with all available fire including bombing .
Since the original AP report , more documents detailing refugee ' kill ' orders have been unearthed at the US national archives .
They point to the widespread targeting of refugees by commanders well after No Gun Ri .
In August 1950 there were orders detailing that refugees crossing the Naktong River be shot .
Later in the same month , General Gay , commander of the 1st Cavalry Division ( of which the 7th Cavalry Regiment involved at No Gun Ri was part ) , actually ordered artillery units to target civilians on the battlefield .
And as late as January 1951 , the US 8th Army was detailing all units in Korea that refugees be attacked with all available fire including bombing .
New allegations have also emerged of the indiscriminate killing of civilians in Korea .
In August 1950 , 80 civilians are reported to have been killed while seeking sanctuary in a shrine by the village of Kokaan - Ri , near Masan in South Korea .
Other survivors recall 400 civilians killed by US naval artillery on the beaches near the port of Pohang in September 1950 , and dozens of villages across southern South Korea report the repeated low - level strafing by US planes of ' people in white ' during July and August 1950 .
A total of 61 separate incidents involving the killing of civilians by US forces are now logged with the South Korean authorities .
Top
Denial The Pentagon inquiry into No Gun Ri was finally released in January 2001 .
The basis of its conclusions are doubtful .
The investigation acknowledged the killing of civilians at No Gun Ri by US forces , but it concluded that the killings that took place there were not deliberate attacks but ' an unfortunate tragedy inherent to war ' .
... clear orders had been given by command not to let refugees through the lines .
Yet whatever the confusion on the battlefield at the time , clear orders had been given by command not to let refugees through the lines .
More importantly , documents showed orders had actually been received by the 8th Cavalry Regiment , sister to the 7th Cavalry involved at No Gun Ri .
' No refugees to cross the line .
Fire everyone trying to cross the lines .
Use discretion in the case of women and children . '
This was an order from the headquarters of the 1st Cavalry Division .
More documents were discovered that showed that the Air Force was strafing civilians at the request of the Army .
Air Force Colonel Turner Rogers wrote a memo the day before events at No Gun Ri .
' The Army has requested we strafe all civilian refugee parties that are noted approaching our positions , ' the memo read .
It went on to confirm the instructions had been acted upon .
' To date , we have complied with the army request in this respect . '
Top
Veterans speak out Despite this the Pentagon maintains in the report that no orders were issued to shoot refugees at No Gun Ri .
This rather narrow frame of reference effectively ignores whatever evidence there might be of other orders given at the time to treat civilians as the enemy .
Only orders specifically mentioning No Gun Ri would qualify .
Even so this is a surprising conclusion to draw for a number of other reasons .
... a significant number of the veterans interviewed did in fact recall orders to open fire on the civilians at No Gun Ri .
Firstly , the oral testimony given by veterans of the 7th Cavalry to the Pentagon during its 14 - month investigation may contradict the Pentagon 's position .
This evidence has never been made fully public , but what has been discovered by those allowed access to the material , is that a significant number of the veterans interviewed did in fact recall orders to open fire on the civilians at No Gun Ri.
Secondly , the 7th Cavalry communications log - the log that might have contained evidence of such orders had they been given - has gone missing .
The significance of this is highlighted by Charles Hanley , one of the AP journalists who first investigated No Gun Ri. '[ The Pentagon ] report declares that there were no orders at No Gun Ri - and it declares that flatly - but it does n't have the document that would prove that one way or the other . '
Top
Seeking the truth
The inconsistencies that surround the Pentagon 's investigation have even led those brought in as independent advisors to voice doubts .
Pete McCloskey , a decorated Korean War veteran and former Congressman , was brought in to advise on the Pentagon report .
He was disappointed with what was finally published .
' I think the American government , the Pentagon and most government agencies do n't want to see the truth come out if it will embarrass the government .
I think the American government , the Pentagon and most government agencies do n't want to see the truth come out if it will embarrass the government .
' I think it 's almost a rule of political science .
The government will always lie about embarrassing matters .
And when you are up in the Pentagon a full Colonel and have a chance to make General , and General with the chance to become Chief of Staff , there 's as much politics high in the Pentagon as there is in the halls of Congress .
And I think that the Army just chose to try and down play the terrible character of Army leadership in 1950 . '
It is now nearly 50 years since the end of the conflict in Korea .
The only major American investigation into the killing of refugees focused exclusively on the activities of the US Army over a small geographic area during one month of a conflict that lasted three years .
Contradicting testimony from veterans and Korean survivors , the report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that orders to kill civilians were given at No Gun Ri.
Clearly there are still many unanswered questions over American involvement in Korea , questions that were not answered by the narrow view of the US Army 's investigation .
Yet this burden now falls not on those responsible for giving the orders , but on the veterans and survivors alike .

Opposition to same - sex marriage dropped sharply across the country during the past two years , though just over half of Americans still oppose allowing gays and lesbians to marry , according to a poll by the Pew Research Center released Wednesday .
The poll also showed increased support for allowing same - sex couples to adopt children , and substantial backing for the rights of gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military .
The survey was released one day after a poll of California residents indicated increasing support for gay rights in the state , including for same - sex marriages .
The nonpartisan Field Poll found that support for same - sex marriage in the state had risen from 38 percent in 1997 to 43 percent today .
The Pew center 's national poll of 1,405 adults , conducted from March 8 - 12 , found that 51 percent opposed same - sex marriage and 39 percent supported it .
In February 2004 , as same - sex couples were marrying in San Francisco , a Pew poll found 63 percent of Americans opposed the right of gays and lesbians to marry and 30 percent in favor .
The margin of error in the latest survey was plus or minus 3 or 4 percentage points , depending on the question .
" In 2004 , ( same - sex marriage ) was an emotional issue that struck a very deeply rooted chord in a lot of people , " said Michael Dimock , associate director of the Pew Research Center for People and the Press .
" It is still an issue -- a lot of people who opposed it then still oppose it now .
But a lot of people who opposed it then were in an intense environment and either feel less strongly or feel that people can do what they want to do . "
Support for same - sex marriage has grown steadily over the past decade , according to the Pew center , which is an independent research organization .
In 1996 , 65 percent of Americans opposed same - sex marriage and 27 percent supported it .
Wednesday 's poll found the country nearly evenly split on allowing gay and lesbian couples to adopt children -- 46 percent in favor , 48 percent opposed .
In 1999 , 38 percent of Americans supported adoptions by same - sex couples , while 57 percent opposed them .
Sixty percent of those polled in the most recent survey supported allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military , while 32 percent opposed the idea .
" It indicates people are changing , " Dimock said .
" They 're becoming more open and tolerant , and we also have a shift in generations , which has a big impact . "
The poll noted a distinct change in the number of respondents who said they " strongly oppose " same - sex marriage .
In February 2004 , 42 percent were in that category .
That dropped to 28 percent this year , with the biggest decreases being among people over 65 , Republicans and those who described themselves as religious moderates .
Gay rights advocates said Americans have had plenty of opportunity in the past two years to hear the stories of gay couples and same - sex parents , which has increased tolerance for gay and lesbian rights .
" I think people have thought more about gay families in the last two years than in the previous 30 , " said Matt Foreman , executive director of the National Lesbian and Gay Task Force in New York .
Any shift toward support for same - sex marriage has yet to show up at the polls , however , Since 2004 , voters in 13 states have passed constitutional bans on same - sex marriage .
At least seven states will vote on similar measures in November .
A representative from the evangelical Christian organization Focus on the Family declined to comment on the poll .
The Family Research Council , a conservative Christian lobbying group in Washington , D.C. , did not return a phone call .
National poll on gay and lesbian rights Public acceptance of homosexuality has increased yet remains a deeply divisive issue , according to a recent nationwide survey .
Trend of opinion on allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally Oppose Favor March ' 01 57 % 35 % February ' 04 63 % 30 % March ' 06 51 % 39 % .
Shifting views on policies toward gays and lesbians Adoption by gays or lesbians 1999 Oppose 57 % Favor 38 % No opinion 5 % 2006 Oppose 48 % Favor 46 % No opinion 6 % .
Gays serving openly in military 1994 Favor 52 % Oppose 45 % No opinion 3 % . 2006 Favor 60 % Oppose 32 %
No opinion 8 % Results from the 2006 survey are based on telephone interviews conducted March 8 - 12 from a nationwide sample of 1,405 adults .
The survey has a sampling error of plus or minus 3 - 4 percentage points .

The pro-choice group needs to collect 16,728 signatures
The South Dakota Campaign for Healthy Families aims to collect 16,728 signatures needed to put the ban on hold and put it to a public vote .
The law bans all abortions except to save a woman 's life , but not in cases of rape or incest .
Its supporters hope it could help challenge the 1973 US Supreme Court decision that legalised abortions .
Many believe two recent conservative appointments to the Supreme Court may have tipped the balance in favour of anti-abortionists .
The supporters of the South Dakota law say they want to trigger a battle over the 1973 Roe-versus - Wade ruling , in which the US Supreme Court established that governments lacked the power to prohibit abortions .
June deadline
The South Dakota Campaign for Healthy Families filed papers with the state to start its petition drive .
Gov Rounds has said he expects the law to be challenged in court
If it obtains the necessary signatures by 19 June , the law will be put on hold until the voters decide on its fate in a question added to ballot papers in a November election .
If the petition fails , the law will take effect on 1 July .
About 800 abortions are performed each year in South Dakota .
Under the law signed by South Dakota Governor Mike Rounds earlier in March , doctors could get up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 ( £ 2,800 ) fine for performing an illegal abortion .
It is likely that a federal judge would suspend the ban if it was challenged in court .
The law would therefore not take effect unless South Dakota state got the case to the US Supreme Court and won .
Gov Rounds has said abortion opponents have already started offering money to help the state pay legal bills for the anticipated court challenge .
Some examples of what you can do with Yubnub :
Oct. 22 , 2006  -- Cheryl Kagan , a former Maryland Democratic legislator , was shocked when she opened her mail Wednesday morning .
Inside , she discovered three computer discs .
With them was an anonymous letter saying the discs contained the secret source code for vote - counting that could be used to alter the votes cast through Maryland 's new electronic voting machines .
" My understanding is that with these disks a malicious person could skew the outcome of an election , " Kagan said .
Diebold , the company that makes the voting machines , told ABC News , " These discs do not alter the security of the Diebold touch - screen system in any way , " because election workers can set their own passwords .
But ABC
News has obtained an independent report commissioned by the state of Maryland and conducted by Science Applications International Corporation revealing that the original Diebold factory passwords are still being used on many voting machines .
The SAIC study also shows myriad other security flaws , including administrative over - ride passwords that cannot be changed by local officials but can be used by hackers or those who have seen the discs .
The report further states that one of the high risks to the system comes if operating code discs are lost , stolen or seen by unauthorized parties -- precisely what seems to have occurred with the discs sent to Kagan , who worries that the incident indicates the secret source code is not that difficult to obtain .
" Certainly , just tweaking a few votes in a couple of states could radically change the outcome of our policies for the coming year , " she said .
Worry That Elections Could Be Hacked
Computer experts and government officials have voiced serious concerns that if these machines malfunction , no paper record will exist for a recount .
Even worse is the fear that an election could be hacked .
Princeton University researchers using an Accuvote TS -- a touch screen version of the Diebold machine -- showed how easy it would be to deploy a virus that would , in seconds , flip the vote of any election .
" We 're taking the vote - counting process and we 're handing it over to these companies -- and we do n't know what happens inside these machines , " said Edward Felten , a professor and a researcher at Princeton 's Center for Information Technology Policy , which ran the study .
Diebold called the Princeton study " unrealistic and inaccurate . "
But many computer scientists , including cyber - security expert Stephen Spoonamore , disagree , pointing out that the Accuvote TS was used in the 2004 presidential election and is still used in at least four states -- including all machines in Georgia and Maryland .
Spoonamore said the hack attacked the operating system layer of software and would affect any touch screen machine built by Diebold .
Diebold argues that the software from the 2004 elections has been updated to fix any possible security problems .
But Spoonamore is not convinced , saying Diebold 's " system is utterly unsecured .
The entire cyber - security community is begging them to come back to reality and secure our nation 's voting . "
There is also the matter of computer glitches .
In primary elections and test runs this year , there were glitches with electronic voting machines from Diebold and other companies .
Machines malfunctioned in Texas , where 100,000 votes were added .
In California , directions for voters with vision problems came out in Vietnamese .
And in Maryland , screens froze and memory cards went missing .
Gov. Robert Ehrlich , a Republican running for reelection , advised residents to vote by absentee ballot because he had no confidence in the machines .
" I do n't care if we paid half a billion dollars or $ 1 billion , " Ehrlich said .
" If it 's going to put the election at risk , there 's no price tag for a phony election or a fraudulent election . "
Many are concerned about how the confusing technical issues will be handled by poll workers , who tend to be senior citizens and who are not necessarily tech - savvy .
Electronic voting machines were supposed to be the solution to the paper ballot problems from the 2000 presidential election .
But to many critics , America 's voting system has gone out of the frying pan and into the fire .
First Chinese astronaut Yang Liwei waves as the capsule door was opened after landing on the Inner Mongolian grasslands of northern China Thursday , Oct. 16 , 2003 .
China isparing down the list of astronauts to fly aboard its second manned spaceflight , a two - person mission set to launch within weeks , state news reports saidWednesday .
Severaltwo - astronaut teams have been selected from a candidate field of 14 formerfighter pilots , though the final decision will depend on how they perform inupcoming tests , Zhang Qingwei , president of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp. , told the Shanghai Morning Post .
The state run XinhuaNews Agency later reported the announcement .
" The launchof Shenzhou 6 spacecraft could be in September or October , " Zhang told the Shanghai Morning Post , adding that a flag for the 2010 World Expo in Shanghaiwill be included on the flight .
Accordingto earlier reports , a Long March2 F rocket is slated to launch two Chinese astronauts , also known as " taikonauts , " on a five - day to six - day mission to conduct experiments aboardShenzhou 6 .
One such experiment will apparently study the effects ofmicrogravity and space radiation on pig sperm , Xinhua reported .
The two - personflight will follow the Oct. 15 , 2003 launchof Shenzhou 5 , which carried astronaut Yang Liwei into orbit and made China oneof only three countries to independently launch a human into space .
Russia and the U.S. are the others .
Tuckedinside his Shenzhou 5 capsule , which is based on Russia 's Soyuz spacecraft butextensively modernized , Yang orbited Earth 14 times during his 21 1/2- hourspaceflight before returning safely .
Chinesespace officials have said in the past that the Shenzhou flights will testtechnologies that will lead toward docking and , ultimately , space stationhardware .
The Chinese National Aerospace Administration hopes to land a probeon the moon by 2010 , according to past reports .
Preparingfor the future
As Chinacounts down to its second manned Shenzhou flight , plans are already underwayfor an extended human spaceflight program .
InShanghai , construction began Tuesday on a new $ 160 - million space center to bedevoted to researching , testing and producing rockets , manned spacecraft anddefense satellites , the Shanghai Space Bureau told Xinhua .
Five researchinstitutes will be based at the new center 's 183 - acre site , the report stated .
Meanwhile , China has also begun training its first group of female astronauts this year .
Accordingto Xinhua reports , 35 women between the ages of 17 and 20 - years - old wererecruited for the country 's female astronaut program .
At least fouryears of university courses , as well as flight and science training , will berequired before any of the candidates fly , though Chinese space officials hopeto launch their first female astronauts by 2010 .
" They willembark on a space mission no later than 2010 , working as flight commanders oron - board engineers , " Hu Shixiang , deputy chief of commander of China 's mannedspace program , told China Daily during the announcement .
Writing A Lisp Interpreter
In Haskell
A while ago , after what now seems like eternity of flirting with Haskell articles and papers , I finally crossed the boundary between theory and practice and downloaded a Haskell compiler .
I decided to do a field evaluation of the language by two means .
I was going to solve a problem in a domain that Haskell is known to excel at followed by a real world problem1 that has n't had much exploration in Haskell2 .
Picking the problems was easy .
There 's a lot of folklore that suggests Haskell is great for building compilers and interpreters so I did n't have to think long to a pick a problem that would be self contained , reasonably short , and fun - writing an interpreter of a Lisp dialect .
For the second test case I decided to go with a web application - plenty of people are writing them for money and there has n't been much Haskell - related work done in this area .
I 've now completed the first test case and the results are incredibly promising .
I was able to write an interpreter that can evaluate many of the examples from my lisp article in 188 lines of reasonably well designed , extensible , commented Haskell code .
I made no effort to squeeze functionality into as few lines of code as possible , furthermore , because I am new to Haskell the code is probably much longer than it normally would be .
Beyond a doubt , Haskell is incredibly expressive .
I could get far more functionality in with far less typing than I 've normally come to expect of mainstream languages and I still had code that was easy to extend and modify .
After getting such impressive results I had to tell the world .
I quickly jot down the first draft of this article and immediately discarded it because I realized I 'm preaching to the choir : people that use Haskell would already know what I was about to tell them and people that do n't use it would find lines of code to be a terrible benchmark to draw any valuable conclusions from ( and they 'd be right ) .
You 're now reading the second draft of this article which is about much more than the results of my first experiment .
The article is about my experience with Haskell and the process of working with it .
I will describe which features of Haskell I used to implement particular aspects of my interpreter , how they 're different from the object oriented world , why they helped me get things done faster , and how I had to change my program whenever my initial efforts took me to a dead end .
While the jury 's still out how well Haskell performs in other domains ( I 'm just starting my web application project ) I hope this article sparks your interest in this beautiful language and explains some things programmers new to Haskell often find confusing .
The first thing I did to kick off the interpreter project was to determine its scope .
I decided that I would only deal with integers , symbols , functions , and lists - a bare minimum required to make something that resembles Lisp .
At this point I needed to convert these concepts into code Haskell would understand - exactly the same thing I 'd do with any other language .
Immediately I was rewarded .
I was able to create a type that supported a required data structure in only four lines of Haskell code !
The definition was encoded into what Haskell calls an algebraic data type and looked like this :
data Expr = BlaiseInt Integer | BlaiseSymbol String | BlaiseFn ( [ Expr ] -> Expr ) | BlaiseList [ Expr ]
Algebraic data types are tricky beasts .
Because they 're very different from everything people with imperative programming backgrounds are used to , they tend to cause much confusion for a long time until intuitive understanding finally develops .
Above code simply states than an expression may be and integer , a symbol , a function , or a list , and each version contains a single member field , respectively an integer , a string , a function that takes a list of expressions and returns an expression , and a list of expressions .
The closest ( very lossy ) translation to Java that I can think of is this :
abstract class Expr {} final class BlaiseInt extends Expr { public int _value ; } final class BlaiseSymbol extends Expr { public String _value ; } interface BlaiseFunction { public Expr evaluateFunction ( List arguments ) ; } final class BlaiseFn extends Expr { BlaiseFunction _value ; } final class BlaiseList extends Expr {
List _value ; }
Notice how the Java version is already much longer than the Haskell one despite the fact that I took obvious shortcuts and avoided writing constructors and accessor methods .
Additionally , as we continue developing the interpreter , extending the Java translation appropriately will become a very costly and verbose task .
I will attempt to demonstrate what I mean at various points in the article .
One example I can provide immediately is actually instantiating the data structure .
For example , suppose I want to use it to create a list of three integers .
In Haskell I can do this :
myList = BlaiseList [ BlaiseInt 1 , BlaiseInt 2 , BlaiseInt 3 ]
A Java alternative would look like this ( we 'll even give it an advantage , assume BlaiseList and BlaiseInt have appropriate constructors ) :
BlaiseList myList = new BlaiseList ( ) ; myList._value.add(new BlaiseInt ( 1 ) ) ; myList._value.add(new BlaiseInt ( 2 ) ) ; myList._value.add( new BlaiseInt ( 3 ) ) ;
While we could ( unnecessarily ) transform the above Haskell code to take up four lines , the clarity is already starting to speak for itself : you can do more with Haskell in less code that 's easier to read and maintain in the long run .
In the previous section we developed a data structure capable of holding Lisp 's abstract syntax trees ( a famous Lisp list ) .
One common task all Lisp interpreters are able to perform is to print out this data structure .
Haskell has an alternative to Java 's toString , a polymorphic function show .
By default , show will normally print out the values the way you type them in Haskell source code ( which makes it far more useful than toString , but we wo n't get into that ) .
Java's toString does something similar .
Both of these implementations are n't very useful to us because we need our interpreter to print the data structure out via s-expressions .
Therefore , we must customize this functionality .
In Haskell we can do it like this :
instance Show Expr where show ( BlaiseInt x ) = show x show ( BlaiseSymbol x ) = x show ( BlaiseFn x ) = " < function > " show ( BlaiseList x ) = " ( " ++ unwords ( map show x ) ++ " ) "
Do n't let the word instance throw you off - the code above has nothing to do with instances in a conventional object oriented sense of the word .
Instead , it tells Haskell that Expr " implements " a Show " interface " .
This allows anyone to call show on our data structure and it will print in out as an s-expression .
The code above uses pattern matching - the function show is defined four times .
When show is called , Haskell runtime will examine available definitions and will call appropriate one depending on which " form " of expression it 's dealing with .
This is similar to Java 's virtual functions but a lot more powerful .
In Java we can define four versions of toString and the runtime will call the correct one depending on the instance type .
However , Haskell pattern matching can match on far more than the type - it can also match on values , boolean expressions ( using guards ) , particular structures , etc .
The tremendous benefit of this technique will become more apparent later .
For now , let 's try to implement a subset of this code in Java : a toString method to render a list .
String toString ( ) { StringBuffer output ( " ( " ) ; Iterator it = _value.iterator ( ) ; if ( it.hasNext ( ) ) { Expr value = ( Expr ) it.next ( ) ; output.append(value.toString ( ) ) ; } for ( ; it.hasNext ( ) ; ) { output.append ( " " ) ; Expr value = ( Expr ) it.next ( ) ; output.append(value.toString ( ) ) ; } output.append ( " ) " ) ; return output.toString ( ) ; }
Yet another Haskell one - liner turned into sixteen lines of Java code .
In isolation such examples mean little but once you run into them again and again and again you can see an interesting picture start to emerge .
We 're now able to create Haskell data structures that represent Lisp 's abstract syntax trees and print them as s-expressions .
The next logical step is to write a parser so we can build these structures using Lisp 's infamous parentheses .
One good thing about writing a Lisp interpreter is that the parser is very simple - most of the time we can write it by hand without resorting to advanced parsing tools .
This approach has obvious benefits ( no separate build steps to generate code , no other tool to learn , ability to easily debug the parser without trying to understand generated code , etc. ) and I took it when I wrote Lisp interpreters in C and Java .
My initial approach to writing a parser in Haskell was to do the same thing - write it by hand without resorting to parser generator tools .
However , very quickly I realized that Haskell is different enough to give me the best of both worlds .
Haskell comes standard with a parsing library called Parsec which implements a domain specific language for parsing text .
If you 're familiar with Boost Spirit library written in C++ you 'll understand what I mean .
The library " embeds " a parsing language into Haskell .
The user of the library can specify a parser 's grammar directly in Haskell code !
Parsec takes some time to get used to , but once you understand it you can drop the conventional parser generators forever .
To give you a bit of flavor for Parsec , here 's a code snippet that parses a symbol :
parseSymbol = do f <- firstAllowed r <- many ( firstAllowed < |> digit ) return $ BlaiseSymbol ( f:r ) where firstAllowed = oneOf " +-*/ " < |> letter
The code is rather descriptive .
It first looks for the first allowed character ( traditionally no digits ) followed by many of these same characters or digits .
You can see the rest of the grammar in the source code of the interpreter .
This is but one example of how domain specific languages eliminate crude tools , extra build steps , debugging pain , and repetitive work .
Haskell is an excellent host for domain specific languages - perhaps as close to Lisp as any language can be .
A word of warning : using JavaCC after learning Parsec becomes a very unnerving experience .
We 've now come to a point where we can get to the core of the interpreter - the code that evaluates Lisp expressions .
This bit demonstrates a number of Haskell features : type inference ( along with optional type declarations ) , pattern matching , additional power of algebraic data types , functions as first class objects , and power of higher order functions .
Let 's view the code snippet and discuss these features one by one .
eval :: Expr ->
Expr eval ( BlaiseInt n ) = BlaiseInt n eval ( BlaiseSymbol s ) = ctx Map .!
s eval ( BlaiseFn f ) = BlaiseFn f eval ( BlaiseList ( x : xs ) ) = apply ( eval x ) ( map eval xs ) where apply :: Expr -> [ Expr ] ->
Expr apply ( BlaiseFn f ) args = f args
This code defines a single function , eval , that evaluates our Lisp expression .
The code looks strange if you 're unfamiliar with Haskell but it 's just a matter of learning a few powerful features before you can warm up to it .
Let 's start with type inference .
The first line is a type declaration - we tell the compiler that eval is a function that takes a single argument of type Expr and returns a value of the same type .
Notice that the declaration is separate from the rest of the code - it almost gives you a hint that it is n't always necessary .
If you open the interpreter 's source code you 'll notice that functions very rarely have type declarations .
To the uninitiated it may seem that Haskell is a dynamically typed language but it is n't - everything is resolved at compile time .
Haskell does this with type inference and it works surprisingly well .
Most of the time you do n't have to specify types - Haskell will figure them out for you .
Sometimes it will get confused and you 'll have to add a type declaration but that 's an exception rather than the rule .
If you 're confused about what the type of something is , you can always start an interpreter and ask ( :t something ) .
Most of the type declarations in Blaise are n't necessary - I only put them there for clarity ( I wonder how many lines of code I 'd save if I removed them ) .
After you get used to type inference it 's really hard to come back to work and write my share of Java code :
ReallyLongClassName i = ( ReallyLongClassName)foo.getBar ( ) ;
The next line is first in a series of pattern matches .
This feature is a mix of virtual functions , regular expressions performed on live data structures , and an abstraction over large switch statements .
The four lines after the type declaration specify four cases of pattern matching and what the value of the eval function should be in those cases .
For example , the second line states : " if the first ( and only ) argument is a blaise integer , just let it return itself " ( because a value of 5 is 5 ) .
In the example above pattern matching does something similar to what virtual functions do in Java - it executes different code depending on the type of the argument ( in Haskell 's case we can look at the type as well as the constructor of the algebraic data type , among other things ) .
However , the abstraction is much more powerful .
In principle , virtual functions are just a large switch statement like the one in the pseudo - code below :
if ( typeof ( something ) == someType ) { doSomething ( ) ; } else if ( typeof ( something ) == someOtherType ) { doSomethingElse ( ) ; }
Traditional object oriented languages let us abstract ourselves from writing such switches and take the task upon themselves freeing us up to do more important work .
Haskell does the same thing , however , it does n't limit the abstraction to types - we can get the compiler to write such switches based on any component we 're interested in abstracting !
We can , for example , get the compiler to write code for us that will cause the runtime to only execute a particular function if the first argument is equal to five , or if the second element in a list is equal to three .
We could do that in traditional languages with if statements and switches but Haskell does this for us in a much more elegant and expressive way .
After all , why are we only allowed to create virtual functions based on the type of the object they belong to ?
Why ca n't we define " virtuality " based on the type ( or value ) of the function 's third argument , for example ?
Interestingly , this is one of the reasons why Haskell is n't object oriented - it 's functions do n't need to belong to objects because the compiler and the runtime system allow us to abstract over any argument 's type and structure ( contrast that to being able to abstract only over an implicit this ) !
In our case eval also takes advantage of functions being first class objects .
Take a look at how we evaluate a symbol - we simply grab its value from the map .
At this point the symbols are predefined and added to the map on startup like so :
ctx = Map.fromList [ ( " * " , BlaiseFn blaiseMul ) ]
In this case we added a multiplication operator .
Now if we try to evaluate " * " , we 're going to get a function from the map that we can call !
This is similar to getting an instance of a class that implements multiplication , except we do n't have to deal with the boilerplate - Haskell will do the work behind the scenes .
We also use higher order functions ( functions that take other functions in arguments ) in order to evaluate the function 's arguments .
Take a look at how we use map - Haskell 's function to iterate over a list .
We pass it a function and a list , and map iterates the list and calls our function on each member .
We could do this with a for statement ( or if we 're lucky with a foreach ) , but we do n't have to - Haskell lets us build abstractions over boilerplate code we write over and over again without waiting for the compiler developers to write them for us ( of course map is a standard part of Haskell but if it were n't we could easily implement it ourselves ) .
At this point our interpreter boils down to a simple calculator .
We can evaluate mathematical expressions like this :
(+ 1 2 ) (+ 1 (+ 2 3 ) ) (* 5 (+ 3 4 ) )
While this is a calculator with the spirit of Lisp , it can hardly be called an interpreter for a programming language .
The next natural step in building our interpreter is to introduce variables .
Given the fact that Haskell does n't allow mutable data and that our design is currently limited to four elements ( integers , symbols , functions and lists ) , we 're going to run into some problems .
The first problem is obvious : how are we going to implement mutable data in Haskell if it provides no support for it ?
We can't simply declare a global map of symbols that we can update - all Haskell " variables " can only be written to once .
In order to solve this problem we 're going to have to modify our design : the eval function will need to explicitly take the current state of the interpreter ( a map of symbols ) and return the update state along with the evaluated expression .
Additionally we 'll have to modify our Expr type because functions may end up modifying the symbol table .
The resulting code looks like this :
type Context = Map.Map String Expr data Expr = BlaiseInt Integer | BlaiseSymbol String | BlaiseFn ( Context ->[ Expr ] ->( Context , Expr ) ) | BlaiseList [ Expr ] eval :: Context -> Expr -> ( Context , Expr ) eval ctx ( BlaiseInt n ) = ( ctx , BlaiseInt n )
Our interpreter can now handle state !
However , we still can't implement an assignment operator because of a more subtle problem .
Consider the following expression :
( set i 5 )
If we try to implement set as a function our interpreter will crash !
The reason is rather simple - our code evaluates all arguments to functions as they are passed in .
In the above example our interpreter will attempt to evaluate the symbol i and because it does n't exist it will result in an error .
Clearly functions are n't proper abstractions to implement such operators .
We need to modify our Expr type again to introduce special kinds of functions that evaluate their arguments themselves .
This way our implementation of set may choose to evaluate only the second argument and leave first as is .
Lisp normally calls such functions special forms and we can easily define them like this :
data Expr = BlaiseInt Integer | BlaiseSymbol String | BlaiseFn ( Context ->[ Expr ] ->( Context , Expr ) ) | BlaiseSpecial ( Context ->[ Expr ] ->( Context , Expr ) ) | BlaiseList [ Expr ]
The last thing we need to do before we can implement assignments is change our eval function to treat simple functions and special forms differently .
We can easily achieve this with pattern matching like this :
eval ctx ( BlaiseList ( x :xs ) ) = let ( new_ctx , fn ) = ( eval ctx x ) ( last_ctx , eval_args ) = mapAccumL eval new_ctx xs apply ( BlaiseFn f ) = f last_ctx eval_args apply ( BlaiseSpecial f ) = f new_ctx xs in apply fn
We can now implement the actual assignment operator .
It turns out to only take up three lines of code .
blaiseSet ctx [ ( BlaiseSymbol s ) , e ] = ( Map.insert s eval_e new_ctx , eval_e ) where ( new_ctx , eval_e ) = eval ctx e
That 's it !
We now assign values to variables and use them in our expressions :
( set i 5 ) (+ i 1 ) ( set j (+ i 5 ) ) ( set j (+ j 1 ) )
While the changes take a rather long time to describe , the actual code modifications are minimal .
You can see how well a Haskell program adapts to changing requirements - there are no classes to refactor , fewer dependencies to track down , and most importantly , no implicit state to worry about .
The type system is expressive enough to warn us at compile time about most types of errors we may introduce with our changes .
We also do n't have to worry about breaking the order in which things are called or the possibility that we broke state other components expect - all state management is explicitly managed by us and type checked by Haskell .
In the next two sections we 'll see two more examples of Haskell 's ability to easily adapt to changes .
The previous section probably made both Java and Haskell programmers cry out in horror .
We have to pass state explicitly ?!
Well , yes and no .
The fact that we have to formalize exactly what state our program will need is a good thing - it lets us minimize dependencies and maximize encapsulation which results in more robust programs .
The real problem is accepting and returning the state in every function that needs it .
This results in a lot of boilerplate code that we have to waste time writing and maintaining .
Fortunately Haskell lets us avoid these issues with monads .
I will not go into a detailed description of monads here as they are beyond the scope of this article - your favorite search engine should bring up plenty of monad tutorials .
The idea , however , is rather simple - monads use Haskell type system in innovative ways to let us abstract the boilerplate code away .
For example , the State monad deals with passing the state for us so we can focus our efforts on solving problems .
We can use the State monad in our interpreter to clean up the code written in the previous section .
The first thing we 'll do is clean up our declarations that pass state explicitly :
data Expr = BlaiseInt Integer | BlaiseSymbol String | BlaiseFn ( [ Expr ] ->BlaiseResult ) | BlaiseSpecial ( [ Expr ] ->BlaiseResult ) | BlaiseList [ Expr ] eval :: Expr -> BlaiseResult
We define BlaiseResult in terms of StateT monad which allows us to do composition with IO :
type BlaiseResult = StateT Context IO Expr
We can now rewrite our code to take advantage of the monad and avoid passing the state explicitly .
Effectively StateT monad abstracts this away from us - we only have to write code to modify the state .
The code that passes it around is written once when the monad is implemented ( StateT comes standard with Haskell ) .
blaiseSet [ ( BlaiseSymbol s ) , e ] = do eval_e <- eval e modify ( \sym_table - > Map.insert s eval_e sym_table ) return eval_e eval ( BlaiseInt n ) = return ( BlaiseInt n ) eval ( BlaiseList ( x :xs ) ) = do fn <- eval x apply fn where apply ( BlaiseSpecial f ) = f xs apply ( BlaiseFn f ) = do args <- mapM eval xs f args
A common misconception among Haskell beginners is that monads are an unfortunate evil necessary in a a lazy , side - effect free language .
While it is true that monads solve the lazy IO problem , it is only one example of their power .
As I plunged deeper and deeper into Haskell I began to realize that monads are a desirable feature that allows the programmer to build otherwise impossible abstractions .
Monads , together with higher order functions , provide excellent facilities for abstracting away boilerplate code .
In this sense Haskell 's monads serve a similar purpose to Lisp 's macros ( though the concept is entirely different ) .
Languages like Java include a more verbose alternative to higher order functions in the form of classes but completely lack alternatives to Monads and macros .
Many language features ( including exceptions and continuations , for example ) can be implemented via Monads or macros .
Languages that lack these features leave us completely at the mercy of compiler writers - there 's no way we 're going to get continuations in Java until Sun decides this feature should make it into the language .
Perhaps the most compelling feature of monads is composition - ability to mix and match monads that serve different purposes to write well designed , extensible code .
We can demonstrate Haskell 's ability to rapidly adapt to change by refactoring our program one more time - this time to implement error handling .
At this point our interpreter will crash if we type in code that cannot be parsed or uses an undefined symbol .
We can easily fix it with the standard Error monad - a monad that implements exceptions ( try implementing something like that as a Java library ! )
The first thing we need to do is define a type that will be responsible for handling errors .
We 'll use the Error monad to do most of the work and we 'll compose it with the IO monad so we can still perform input output :
type BlaiseError = ErrorT String IO
We should now redefine BlaiseResult to account for a possibility of an error :
type BlaiseResult = StateT Context BlaiseError Expr
That 's it !
We can now rewrite our code to throw and catch exceptions - a feature implemented in Haskell as a library !
eval ( BlaiseSymbol s ) = do sym_table <- get if s `Map.member` sym_table ==
True then return ( sym_table Map .! s ) else throwError ( " Symbol " ++ s ++ " is unbound . " )
parse source = case ( Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec.parse parseExpr " " source ) of Right x -> return x Left e -> throwError $ show e
do expr <- parse x evaledExpr <- eval expr liftIO $ putStrLn ( ( show evaledExpr ) ) repl `catchError` ( \e -> do liftIO $ putStrLn e repl )
We can now make syntax errors and try to look up symbols that do n't exist and get a meaningful error message .
I deliberately avoided handling errors that deal with calling functions with a wrong number of arguments or mismatched types .
I encourage you to dive into the interpreter 's code and implement this yourself - it will be a rewarding experience !
We now have one final touch before we can call our Lisp dialect a programming language : we must implement conditions and function definitions .
Once we get this done we can write a program that will , for example , compute the Fibonacci sequence - a sure sign of a language approaching Turing completeness !
Fortunately doing this is rather simple - all we have to do is add two more functions to our interpreter .
We can implement conditional statements like this :
blaiseIf [ condExpr , expr1 , expr2 ] = do eval_cond <- eval condExpr if ( 0 `notEqual` eval_cond ) then eval expr1 else eval expr2 where notEqual val1 ( BlaiseInt val2 ) = val1 /= val2
Function definitions can be done in a similar manner :
blaiseFnArgs = [ " args " , " ... " ] blaiseFn = do [ ( BlaiseList args ) , ( BlaiseList body ) ] <- getSymbols blaiseFnArgs let newFn = do evalBody <- mapM eval body return $ last evalBody return $ BlaiseFn newFn ( map ( \( BlaiseSymbol arg ) -> arg ) args )
That 's it !
We can finally define fib to compute a Fibonacci sequence like so3 :
( set fib ( fn ( n ) ( if ( eq n 0 ) 1 ( if ( eq n 1 ) 1 (+ ( fib (- n 1 ) ) ( fib (- n 2 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
We can now call fib as if it were any other function !
( fib 4 ) ( fib 10 )
You can download the sources for the interpreter here .
Alternatively you can grab them via darcs :
darcs get http://sources.defmacro.org/blaise
Assuming you have GHC installed on your system , you can compile the interpreter with Cabal as you would compile any other haskell program :
runhaskell Setup.lhs configure runhaskell Setup.lhs build
You will then find the natively compiled executable in dist / build / blaise .
If you do n't want to compile the interpreter on your own or you do n't feel like installing GHC you can download a native Windows executable here .
Start it up and you 'll have a read - eval - print loop at your fingertips where you can evaluate samples of Lisp code from this article .
If you 're new to Haskell I strongly encourage you to play around with the source .
Add more functions ( logic functions like or and and are a good start ) .
After you 're done with those you can start adding standard lisp functions for dealing with lists ( list , car , and cdr are a good idea ) .
As usual , if you have any questions , comments , or suggestions , please drop a note at coffeemug@gmail.com .
I 'll be glad to hear your feedback .
2000 : director of a company which wins $ 200 m contract to sell nuclear reactors to North Korea 2002 : declares North Korea a terrorist state , part of the axis of evil and a target for regime change
Donald Rumsfeld , the US defence secretary , sat on the board of a company which three years ago sold two light water nuclear reactors to North Korea - a country he now regards as part of the " axis of evil " and which has been targeted for regime change by Washington because of its efforts to build nuclear weapons .
Mr Rumsfeld was a non-executive director of ABB , a European engineering giant based in Zurich , when it won a $ 200 m ( £ 125 m ) contract to provide the design and key components for the reactors .
The current defence secretary sat on the board from 1990 to 2001 , earning $ 190,000 a year .
He left to join the Bush administration .
The reactor deal was part of President Bill Clinton 's policy of persuading the North Korean regime to positively engage with the west .
The sale of the nuclear technology was a high - profile contract .
ABB's then chief executive , Goran Lindahl , visited North Korea in November 1999 to announce ABB 's " wide - ranging , long - term cooperation agreement " with the communist government .
The company also opened an office in the country 's capital , Pyongyang , and the deal was signed a year later in 2000 .
Despite this , Mr Rumsfeld 's office said that the de fence secretary did not " recall it being brought before the board at any time " .
In a statement to the American magazine Newsweek , his spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said that there " was no vote on this " .
A spokesman for ABB told the Guardian yesterday that " board members were informed about the project which would deliver systems and equipment for light water reactors " .
Just months after Mr Rumsfeld took office , President George Bush ended the policy of engagement and negotiation pursued by Mr Clinton , saying he did not trust North Korea , and pulled the plug on diplomacy .
Pyongyang warned that it would respond by building nuclear missiles .
A review of American policy was announced and the bilateral confidence building steps , key to Mr Clinton 's policy of detente , halted .
By January 2002 , the Bush administration had placed North Korea in the " axis of evil " alongside Iraq and Iran .
If there was any doubt about how the White House felt about North Korea this was dispelled by Mr Bush , who told the Washington Post last year : " I loathe [ North Korea 's leader ] Kim Jong-il . "
The success of campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq have enhanced the status of Mr Rumsfeld in Washington .
Two years after leaving ABB , Mr Rumsfeld now considers North Korea a " terrorist regime _ teetering on the verge of collapse " and which is on the verge of becoming a proliferator of nuclear weapons .
During a bout of diplomatic activity over Christmas he warned that the US could fight two wars at once - a reference to the forthcoming conflict with Iraq .
After Baghdad fell , Mr Rumsfeld said Pyongyang should draw the " appropriate lesson " .
Critics of the administration 's bellicose language on North Korea say that the problem was not that Mr Rumsfeld supported the Clinton - inspired diplomacy and the ABB deal but that he did not " speak up against it " .
" One could draw the conclusion that economic and personal interests took precedent over non-proliferation , " said Steve LaMontagne , an analyst with the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation in Washington .
Many members of the Bush administration are on record as opposing Mr Clinton 's plans , saying that weapons - grade nuclear material could be extracted from the type of light water reactors that ABB sold .
Mr Rumsfeld 's deputy , Paul Wolfowitz , and the state department 's number two diplomat , Richard Armitage , both opposed the deal as did the Republican presidential candidate , Bob Dole , whose campaign Mr Rumsfeld ran and where he also acted as defence adviser .
One unnamed ABB board director told Fortune magazine that Mr Rumsfeld was involved in lobbying his hawkish friends on behalf of ABB .
The Clinton package sought to defuse tensions on the Ko rean peninsula by offering supplies of oil and new light water nuclear reactors in return for access by inspectors to Pyongyang 's atomic facilities and a dismantling of its heavy water reactors which produce weapons grade plutonium .
Light water reactors are known as " proliferation - resistant " but , in the words of one expert , they are not " proliferation - proof " .
The type of reactors involved in the ABB deal produce plutonium which needs refining before it can be weaponised .
One US congressman and critic of the North Korean regime described the reactors as " nuclear bomb factories " .
North Korea expelled the inspectors last year and withdrew from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in January at about the same time that the Bush administration authorised $ 3.5 m to keep ABB 's reactor project going .
North Korea is thought to have offered to scrap its nuclear facilities and missile pro gramme and to allow international nuclear inspectors into the country .
But Pyongyang demanded that security guarantees and aid from the US must come first .
Mr Bush now insists that he will only negotiate a new deal with Pyongyang after the nuclear programme is scrapped .
Washington believes that offering inducements would reward Pyongyang 's " blackmail " and encourage other " rogue " states to develop weapons of mass destruction .
The king is working to improve Saudi Arabia 's image in the US
The king told US TV that Islam is a " religion of peace " that rejects the 11 September 2001 attacks , but admitted extremism had not been eliminated .
He also said he is working towards cutting oil prices after recent rises .
King Abdullah was crowned monarch of Saudi Arabia , the world 's biggest oil exporter , in August .
The BBC's James Coomarasamy in Washington says his interview with ABC's Barbara Walters is part of a policy to improve his country 's image in the US .
But , our correspondent says , he admitted that differences over Iraq , Afghanistan and the wider Middle East had soured Saudi public opinion about the US .
' Scourge '
The king called al - Qaeda " madness and evil " and " the work of the devil " and vowed to fight " 30 years if we have to until we eliminate this scourge " .
" Such acts can not be perpetrated by any individual who has a sense of decency or humanity or justice or faith , " he said .
Admitting the extremist threat in Saudi Arabia remained , he questioned why the kingdom was the focus of world attention when it " exists in every country of the world " .
King Abdullah insisted that his government had " withdrawn support for institutions that we found to be extremist " .
Oil
The king told ABC that high oil prices had caused damage to other countries , but acknowledged his kingdom had benefited financially from them .
King Abdullah said Saudi oil production had soared to 10 million barrels a day to meet rising global demand and calm soaring prices .
" We believe that the damage to other countries is tremendous and we do n't believe prices should be at this level , " the king said .
On the subject of Iraq and reports that Iran was supporting insurgents , he said he hoped Tehran " will not become an obstacle to peace and security in Iraq " .
Regarding women , whose rights and freedoms in the kingdom are severely restricted , the king said Saudi women would one day be able to drive .
" Our people are just now beginning to open up to the world and I believe that with the passing of days in the future , everything is possible , " he said .
Zwiebelfisch Hallo , Fräulein !
Wie macht man heute in einem Lokal auf sich aufmerksam ?
Hallo , Sie , dürfte ich wohl Entschuldigung !
Haaallo , ich würde gern Sie , hallo , könnten Sie bitte Das gute alte Fräulein ist uns abhanden gekommen , und bis heute haben wir keinen passenden Ersatz gefunden !
A worker seeks fulfillment in a new job involving expanded skills and responsibilities .
The dilemma :
Without prior experience in the field , how can she prove her capability to a potential employer ?
The challenge is even more daunting for contract workers making their living outside of an established organization .
What they need , say researchers Siobhan O'Mahony and Beth Bechky , is " stretchwork " that fits with an individual 's previous experience and yet extends their skills in a new direction .
Stretchwork can help workers bridge the gap to a more rewarding position and enable them to manage and advance their careers in the less predictable world of contract labor .
But how do you land those kinds of jobs ?
In " Stretchwork : Managing the Career Progression Paradox in External Labor Markets , " forthcoming in the Academy of Management Journal , the authors examine tactics used by contract workers to obtain stretchwork .
O'Mahony is an assistant professor at Harvard Business School while Bechky is an assistant professor at the Graduate School of Management at the University of California , Davis .
" More people are working in more organizations over the course of their careers , " O'Mahony says .
" In addition , they 're moving in and out of contract work .
There are a number of open research issues here , such as questions of health insurance and retirement .
What we did was focus on a very specific problem : I 'm qualified to do X , but what I want to do is Y .
How do I get there ? "
For their study , O'Mahony and Bechky surveyed two strikingly different groups : high - tech contractors and film crew members .
While roles in the film industry tend to be more fixed — a key grip on one project will most likely perform the same function on a different project — the work of high - tech contractors varies widely from job to job .
People who are good at presenting their prior experience can narrow the gap between their past experience and future capabilities .
" Film crew work is also intensely co-located and collaborative , with intense periods of togetherness , " O'Mahony says .
" Tech workers are usually off on their own and do n't necessarily work in teams . "
In the end , however , the differences between the two groups played less of a role in the study than their commonalities .
" Both are trying to do the same thing in terms of their career ; get the next job that will get them the next job , " O'Mahony says .
Stretchwork Strategies
The researchers identified four successful tactics for obtaining stretchwork that were common to both groups :
Differentiate competence .
Anyone hoping to advance must distinguish his or her performance on the job .
This is particularly true , however , for contract workers — because they are paid for each short - term job , their employers are likely to subject their work to close , frequent evaluation .

Because high - tech contractors tend to work with a number of clients , brokers , and fellow contractors , they enjoy a broader social network from which to draw referrals than most permanent employees .
In the film industry — where most hiring is done based on a production manager 's previous experience with an individual — referrals are a vital aspect of getting any job , particularly if it stretches a worker in a new direction .

Framing and bluffing .
" This is one of the most creative attributes for obtaining stretchwork , " O'Mahony notes .
" People who are good at presenting their prior experience in a way that allows for an easy translation to the desired job can narrow the gap between their past experience and future capabilities . "
Adopting a hybrid job title to identify oneself — " director - screenwriter , " for example — can also help establish authority in more than one area .

Discounting .
Accepting pay below the market rate is a temporary disadvantage some contract workers are willing to accept , if it means gaining the experience and exposure that will lead to a new position .
One technical writer put it this way : " I turned down solid offers from three companies , all paying over $ 100 K a year … I would take a job at $ 55 K if they 're using a totally new technology so I learn something …
It 's like playing pool …
You hit the green ball with the white ball , and the point is to place the white ball to get the next shot .
So I take that job in order to learn skills for my next project . "
The assumption that skills transfer easily from one context to another rarely holds , O'Mahony notes ; making that transition frequently involves hidden work of a social nature .
Future research might test which tactics are most effective in translating skills from one assignment to another , or it could examine how strategies for obtaining stretchwork might differ , depending on the types of skills individuals hope to acquire .
Further work could also be done in other industries ; while the high - tech and film worlds are far apart in some sense , they share the common characteristic of highly skilled , specialized workers .
I 'm qualified to do X , but what I want to do is Y .
How do I get there ?
There 's also potential for examining the overall shape of a contract worker 's career over the course of a thirty - to forty - year period .
" If one 's career path is no longer through an organization , what are the long - term consequences of the individual assuming greater and greater responsibility for career progression ? "
O'Mahony asks .
" The problem is , this is a relatively new phenomenon , and longitudinal research takes time . "
The New Career Path
With that said , there should be ample opportunity to study this area further in the coming years .
" The increased focus on the external labor market is not a trend that is reversing easily , " O'Mahony remarks .
" There 's been a fundamental change in the compact between the employer and employee that is not going away . "
In other words , the notion that one 's career path will follow an orderly succession of jobs is long outdated .
" I do n't think we have good research available that points to the uneven nature of progression , " O'Mahony concludes .
" People assume that they will keep moving up until they plateau ; the fact is , the process may be much more bumpy than they expect . "
Summary : A field study identified 22 ways that automated hospital systems can result in the wrong medication being dispensed to patients .
Most of these flaws are classic usability problems that have been understood for decades .
Usability is often a matter of life or death .
In a fighter plane 's user interface , for example , taking a second off the time required to operate targeting - and - firing systems offers pilots a dramatic edge in dog - fights .
The most striking example of how bad design can kill comes from in - car user interfaces : thousands of deaths per year are related to drivers being distracted by overly complex designs .
Conversely , good automotive design can save lives .
As an example , take my new Lexus LS430 's slightly nagging navigation system , which tells you far in advance whether the freeway exit you need will be to the left or the right .
This feature gives you plenty of time to change lanes , rather than having to wait until the last moment , which is when you typically spot the road sign .
( The number of people killed due to poor sign usability must be astounding . )
Medical systems have also provided many well - documented killer designs , such as the radiation machines that fried six patients because of complex and misleading operator consoles .
What 's less known is that usability problems in the medical sector 's good old - fashioned office automation systems can harm patients just as seriously as machines used for treatment .
Field Study in a Hospital
In a recent Journal of the American Medical Association paper , Ross Koppel and colleagues reported on a field study of a hospital 's order - entry system , which physicians use to specify patient medications .
The study identified twenty - two ways in which the system caused patients to get the wrong medicine .
Most of these issues are usability problems .
I 'll briefly discuss the ones of general interest here .
Misleading Default Values .
The system screens listed dosages based on the medication units available through the hospital 's pharmacy .
When hospital staff members prescribed infrequently used medications , they often relied on the listed unit as being a typical dose , even though that 's not the true meaning of the numbers .
If a medication is usually prescribed in 20 or 30 mg doses , for example , the pharmacy might stock 10 mg pills so it can cover both dosage needs and avoid overstocking a rare medication .
In this case , users might prescribe 10 mg , even though 20 or 30 would be more appropriate .
The solution here is simple : Each screen should list the typical prescription as a guidance .
Years of usability studies in many domains have shown that users tend to assume that the given default or example values are applicable to their own situations .
New Commands Not Checked Against Previous Ones .
When doctors changed the dosage of a patient 's medication , they often entered the new dose without canceling the old one .
As a result , the patients received the sum of the old and new doses .
This common type of user error is equivalent to a banking interface error , where you specify payment of the same amount to the same recipient twice in one day .
Many bank websites will catch these errors and ask you to double - check so you do n't pay the same bill twice .
In general , if users are doing something they 've already done , the system should ask whether both operations should remain in effect or whether the new command should overrule the old one .
Poor Readability .
Because patient names appeared in a small font that was difficult to read , it was easy for users to select the wrong patient .
The problem was compounded by the fact that names were listed alphabetically rather than grouped by hospital areas , which meant that users looking for a specific patient saw many similar names .
Also , in individual patient records , the patient 's name did n't appear on all screens , reducing the probability that users would discover the error before reaching a critical point in the interaction .
Memory Overload .
At times , users had to review up to twenty screens to see all of a patient 's medications .
The well - known limits on human short - term memory make it impossible to remember everything across that many screens .
In a survey , 72 % of staff reported that they were often uncertain about medications and dosages because of the difficulties in reviewing a patient 's total medications .
Humans are notoriously poor at remembering exact information , and minimizing users ' memory load has long been one of computing 's top - ten usability heuristics .
Facts should be restated when and where they 're needed rather than requiring users to remember things from one screen to the next ( let alone twenty screens down the road ) .
Date Description Errors .
The interface let users specify medications for " tomorrow . "
When surgeries were late in the day and users entered such orders after midnight , patients would miss a day 's medication .
Overly Complicated Workflow .
Many aspects of the system required users to go through numerous screens that conflicted with hospital workflow .
As a result , the system was n't always used as intended .
Nurses , for example , kept a separate set of paper records that they entered into the system at the end of the shift .
This both increased the risk of errors and prevented the system from reflecting real - time information about the medications each patient had received .
In general , whenever you see users resorting to sticky notes or other paper - based workarounds , you know you have a failed UI .
Methodology Weaknesses
To supplement their field observation of actual user behavior , the researchers administered a survey that asked hospital staff how often various errors had occurred during the previous three months .
Unfortunately , the paper relies overly much on this self - reported data in estimating the impact of the usability problems .
It 's well known that people have a hard time remembering what they do with computers .
Valid data comes from what people do , not what they say .
When it comes to user errors caused by bad design , there 's a further problem as well :
If the interface fails to provide adequate feedback , users might not even realize that they 've committed an error .
With medication errors in particular , it's also quite possible that hospital staff might tend to minimize the extent to which patients get the wrong medication — even when a survey guarantees anonymity .
I would have much preferred error - frequency estimates based on actual observations , rather than fallible human memory and possibly biased survey answers .
Still , the survey indicated that many of the errors reportedly occurred at least weekly .
If anything , the true error rate is probably higher than the self - reported estimates in the survey .
It 's great to see usability branching out beyond its origins and being researched in a clinical epidemiology department .
It 's less great to observe methodological weaknesses that stem from studying usability issues without the benefit of the last twenty - five years ' experience with usability research .
Of the paper 's sixty references , 92 % are from medical journals and the like .
Only five of the sixty references are from the human factors literature .
And , despite the fact that the study related to software design , none of the five references are from leading journals , conferences , books , or thinkers in human - computer interaction .
Hospital systems offer just one example of the usability problems that proliferate in domain - specific systems .
Such systems rarely get as much public exposure and analysis as websites do .
Vendors often think that having domain experts on staff means that their software will work in the field .
But the way people are supposed to work in theory never matches reality .
The more specialized the system , the more you need user research to ensure success .
From physicians to firefighters , if you do n't observe real users and test your designs with them , you are guaranteed a plethora of usability problems .
Locating the Paper : More Usability Trials
I 'm not a regular reader of the Journal of the American Medical Association ; I discovered the study through an article in The New York Times .
Unfortunately , getting from the newspaper to the paper it referenced was a trying ordeal .
I never cease to be surprised at the miserable usability of university websites .
The Web was invented to disseminate academic papers , but it 's almost impossible to find research results on academic websites .
In this case , I did n't know the paper 's title , as it was n't reported in the newspaper .
I did have the lead author 's name , so I searched for it and was promptly led to a faculty homepage at the University of Pennsylvania .
Unfortunately , this page was useless , as are most faculty member homepages .
The most recent entry on the " selected publications " list was from 2002 .
The professor 's main research interest was presented in colored text , offering a strong perceived affordance of clickability .
Nevertheless , it offered no link .
The biography page offered no further information about the professor 's research either .
It did link to his full curriculum vitae ( in PDF , oh woe ) , but it had n't been updated since March 2003 and also had no links .
Looking for the author failed to produce any information about the research .
What about the academic institution responsible for the project ?
The newspaper handily provided the department 's full name , making for an easy search .
The top search result was the correct one , but the page title — CCEB — had almost no information scent .
Further probing revealed that CCEB stands for " Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics . "
With an entire line available to spell out their names , you 'd think organizations would want to help poor outside users by doing so .
But this was far from the worst problem .
Sadly , the university has almost no idea of how to use the Web for PR .
On a day when the " CCEB " was featured on the front page of The New York Times ' business section , the department 's latest News page entry was ten months old .
Where the University of Pennsylvania failed miserably , the American Medical Association performed wonderfully : a search for Journal of the American Medical Association retrieved the journal 's website as the first hit .
The JAMA homepage offered a direct link to the article I wanted , in keeping with the homepage guideline to feature high - priority content .
JAMA 's main navbar also had a prominent link to Past issues ( unfortunately presented in low - contrast colors and ALL CAPS text ) .
This link led to an archive that included the current issue .
This is quite helpful for users — like myself — who do n't realize their target content is actually in the current issue .
All that said , JAMA 's website had plenty of usability problems , including a proliferation of undifferentiated More links that simultaneously hurt the homepage 's scannability for sighted users , reduced accessibility for blind users , and prevented search engines from associating destination pages with meaningful keywords from the anchor text .
Mainly , though , JAMA did its job on the Web .
Once I changed my strategy and searched for the paper 's publisher , rather than the author and his academic institution , it took me about a minute to go from a major search engine to retrieving the paper 's full text on the JAMA site .
The fact that academic websites are so miserable to use is surely a contributing factor to the isolating and narrowing effect of current research practices .
If outsiders could more easily connect with research results in other disciplines — where they do n't know the scientists personally — we might see more cross-fertilization and growth in our shared knowledge base .
Indeed , a unified , worldwide hypertext system was the Web 's founding motivation .
Reference
While the cityscape of Chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
Money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after German reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high - tech center .
It 's not a bad place to live .
Still , women in Chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
With only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as Karl - Marx - Stadt during the East German era , has fallen into the sub-sub - basement .
Few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon .
" Families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said Annette Buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the Stadtmission Chemnitz .
She and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options .
" In our office , we hear all the time that it's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said .
The spruced - up market square of Chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears
Chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern German cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then - Chancellor Helmut Kohl when East and West Germany were unified .
The unemployment rate in Chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
Many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty .
For those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic .
" You still see pregnant women on the street , " said Buschmann .
" What you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . "
Deaths outpace births
While the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern Germany , it 's not limited to the former GDR .
The report out this week from Germany 's Federal Statistics Office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born .
While there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
That means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period .
A rare species in Germany
According to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in Germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
The society is getting greyer .
Germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 ( according to numbers by the EU 's statistics office Eurostat ) , puts it near the bottom of the western European pack , although some southern and eastern European countries are lower .
That number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large - scale immigration .
Eastern extreme
While birth rates in Germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern Germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
In parts of Saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of East Germany .
The numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one - third the number of children born in eastern Germany as were before the Berlin Wall fell .
Empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down -- their residents have left
Experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst - case scenario " developed .
The low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western Germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels .
Besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women .
" Young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said Andreas Lange , a researcher at the German Youth Institute .
" The ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . "
The government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
Benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that Germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas .
" For example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said Regina Mannel , director of the Saxony state office of the Paritätische Wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" That might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . "
Consequences ?
Business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt Germany 's competitiveness .
Shape of things to come ?
" We are reaching a critical point , " Michael Hüther , head of the Cologne Institute of Business Research , said in an interview in the newspaper Die Welt .
" The availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . "
But others warn against panicking , saying Germany 's population is going to shrink and it's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
The German Youth Institute 's Andreas Lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller Germany .
" We already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student - teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" This could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
Each one of them will become more important . "
I was reading through Bruce Eckel 's Static vs. Dynamic , which repeats a message we see many places in many forms :
This last point is a major puzzle -- we believe that static type checking prevents bugs , and yet a dynamically - typed language produces very good results anyway .
There 's a couple reasons , like a good language for rapid prototyping leaves you more time to debug , or more time to use good practices early on ( like unit testing and continuous refactoring ) .
But then it might just be a wash , if it leaves us more time to fix our problems , it still might be the same distance to " finished " .
I think this is the case for Perl and PHP , but not for other dynamic languages like Python , Smalltalk , Ruby , Lisp .
The difference being a really high - level language , and just a dynamic language : I do n't think Perl and PHP are really high - level .
Which is to say , there is a limit to how far you can build abstractions .
Regular expressions are an excellent example .
They are really nice , especially if you compare it to C string handling .
But once you have them , they do n't lead anywhere .
They are one tool among many , and while they are useful , at some point programs need to move to a higher level where that kind of string manipulation is an incidental ( and replaceable ) implementation detail .
So Perl seemed hot when regular expressions were cutting edge , but it loses momentum now that they are widely usable in all decent programming environments .
When reading Phillip 's Python Is Not Java , the basic message is really : aim higher .
You 've been given a high - level language ( finally ! ) , so make use of it , otherwise the improvements will only be nominal .
Back to reliability : one way to decrease bugs is testing , but another way is to decrease the amount of code .
Code deleted is code debugged .
Static typing can decrease the number of bugs , but decreasing the amount of code is a much , much more effective way to decrease bugs .
If you can have both -- short code and static typing -- then more power to you .
I just have n't seen it myself .
I think this is in part because types are n't actually that interesting .
People often talk about the four attributes : dynamic typing ( Python ) vs. static typing ( Java ) , and weakly typed ( C ) vs. strongly typed ( Python or Java ) .
Now forgotten , at one time there were languages that were both weakly typed and dynamically typed ; things like assembly and Forth .
Ouch .
There were two paths from there : one to make runtime values intrinsically typed ( Lisp ) , and one to make the source code intrinsically typed ( C ) .
But just because assembly sucked a lot does n't mean all languages afterward must approach the problem in terms of its suckage .
And just because there was that split , does n't mean joining both worlds ( a language with both intrinsically typed values and source , i.e. Java ) is better .
And luckily you can't take intrinsically typed values any further ; once you 've accomplished it , your work is over , values can't be more intrinsically typed .
Intrinsically typed source is really hard , and it's an unfinished job ; ML , Haskell , and their progeny continue the work , but it 's clearly not finished .
So here we we are , the dynamic languages have finished the work on types ( at least the work we choose to do ) .
We moved on a long time ago ( well , they moved on with Lisp when I was still a child , long before I could consider myself a member of any we ) , and we 've been moving on to other techniques of higher level programming while statically typed languages have languished .
That is why I believe dynamically typed languages are better , simply because it addressed a real problem ( weak dynamic languages ) in a solvable way .
Static typing wo n't lead to less bugs , because hard problems are still hard .
Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad - hoc , informally - specified , bug - ridden , slow implementation of half of Common Lisp ( source ) .
In part that 's a defense of a big standard library , but it 's also a defense of high level programming .
Low - level languages do n't just reimplement specifics , like hash tables or regular expressions , but there 's a loss of many abstractions because you can't express some concepts in low - level languages in a way that is reusable .
Static type defenders complain about the combinatorial type interactions in dynamically typed languages -- how can you test all the code paths , given all the possible types ?
But their languages lead to combinatorial code , which is far worse : for many classes of hard problems , they can't solve them once , they have to solve them everytime they are encountered .
Ouch .
Dynamic typing is n't the solution , it 's just the best place we have to start from if we 're looking for a solution .
Maybe part of the problem is a lack of imagination .
People ask which system is the right system ?
when the answer should clearly be none .
Rather we must ask which system has the most potential for leading us towards the right system ?
To advocate any system as The Right Way is as absurd as it is obnoxious ; as long as there are unanswered problems we have n't figured out the Right Way .
Perhaps the time has come to examine a rather different myth , embraced by gifted - child advocates themselves : that children of unusual intelligence and accomplishments remain a misunderstood , marginalized resource in a culture obsessed with equity and prone to conformity .
In fact , youthful prodigiousness is the leading edge of a wider cultural preoccupation with early high performance in our meritocratic era .
Among the educated elite , the superchild has become the model child , and the model parent is an informed advocate with an eye trained on his or her child 's future prospects .
The unusual fate of the precocious child -- to become adultified early and yet to remain hovered over for longer -- is echoed in the situation of the privileged child , ushered along a highly scheduled path of credentialed performance from cradle onward , with college and career ever in mind .
In short , thanks not least to the gifted - child movement itself , the mission of discovering and molding precocious talent has been mainstreamed more successfully than anyone expected .
Once in a while , the more mundane variety of Ivy League - aspiring kids and their ambitious parents pause to ask themselves whether the ethos entails too much early pressure to compete .
For truly extraordinary kids , a different version of the question arises , but it is considered less often : could it be that in the quest to pinpoint and promote exceptional youthful promise , testers and contests and advocates may have unwittingly introduced early pressure to conform , not to the crowd but to an assiduously monitored , preprofessionalized and future - oriented trajectory ?
If the mold - breaking creativity and innovation that advocates invoke are what society wants more of , perhaps it is worth asking whether anointing the ranks of talent - search stars with a sense of foreordained distinction and steering them onto a prize - and degree - laden fast track , the earlier the better , may have its costs .
Of course , it is every parent 's hope to help satisfy highly gifted children 's zeal for mastery and give them fulfilling childhoods , and programs like those the Davidson Institute runs help make that easier .
But a look back over a century suggests it may be hubris if the goal of the guidance is to shape truly exceptional destinies in adulthood .
Well - intentioned efforts to smooth the path and hone expertise in a hurry might even -- who knows ? -- be a hindrance in the mysterious process by which mature originality ultimately expresses itself .
Long before 20th - century psychology turned its attention to young geniuses , children with extraordinary powers were enshrined in myth as figures to be at once feared and revered .
Baby Hercules had occasion to display his prowess in strangling serpents because jealous Juno , angered that Jupiter had sired a son with a mere mortal , dispatched snakes to his cradle .
Twelve - year - old Jesus in the temple after Passover , " sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions , " invites not only astonishment " at his understanding and answers , " but also rebukes from his bewildered parents ; they 're unsettled by his insistence that he " must be about my Father 's business , " well aware that he is n't referring to Joseph .
In the Infancy Gospel of Thomas , perhaps the first early Christian attempt to fill in Jesus ' life before that temple story , awe is mixed with terror .
Jesus is an alarming little boy who does n't merely make real birds out of clay and work other miracles but causes the death of those who scold him for not resting on the Sabbath and shames masters who try to instruct him in his letters .
From the divine / demonic child of antiquity to the Romantic era's idealization of the innocent imaginative genius was perhaps not as big a leap as it seems : the prodigy was the very emblem of prophecy , in touch with mystical truth and powers outside of human time .
In his different guises , the phenomenal young emissary came bearing an implicit message : adults beware .
Lewis Terman , however , was not a man readily daunted , and his endeavor embodied the ambitions and the confusions -- and the elusive predictions -- that have marked gifted research and development ever since .
Five years after he revised Alfred Binet 's intelligence test , creating what became known as the Stanford - Binet I.Q. test , he put it to use in a pioneering survey of a little - understood population .
When Terman began seeking gifted California schoolchildren to participate in his " Genetic Studies of Genius " in 1921 , he was undertaking the first youthful talent search , eager not just to explore the nature of gifted children but ultimately to predict and improve their chances of future greatness .
Convinced that intellectual capacity was innate , he was a eugenicist eager to see the brightest selected out and trained up to guide society .
But he was also aware that no one knew when or how , much less which , buds of brilliance might ultimately produce glorious flowers .
Terman became determined to see to it that the proverb " early ripe , early rotten " would n't describe their fate .
He would do his best to boost , not just stand back and trace , the trajectories of subjects , whose well - rounded giftedness augured such promise .
If that interfered with the purity of his findings and predictions , so , too , did Terman 's methods for choosing his subjects .
His approach made it less than surprising that the Termites , as the study participants were nicknamed , proved exemplary schoolchildren , not lopsided or eccentric at all .
Terman 's tool , the I.Q. test , was devised in and for an academic context , focusing on verbal and quantitative reasoning and memory skills , which meant scores at the high end correlated closely with classroom success .
He was in search of the overall high performers , and his fieldwork further ensured a sample low on idiosyncratic characters .
Since Terman did n't have the resources to comprehensively test the more than a quarter - million students in the California school districts he was looking at , he enlisted teachers to help make the first cut .
They supplied him with the kids they considered the best , a group unlikely to include " some nerdy person in the corner mumbling to himself , " points out Dean Keith Simonton , a professor of psychology at the University of California , Davis , who specializes in the scientific study of historical genius .
Testing this cohort -- as well as other batches of bright children he rounded up earlier -- Terman emerged with an overwhelmingly white and middle - class sample of roughly 1,500 students whose average age was 11 and whose I.Q. 's ranged between 135 and 200 , about the top 1 percent .
( The mean I.Q. in this group was 151 , and 77 subjects tested at 170 or higher . )
It is worth noting that his methods selected for a conscientious breed of parents as well , given that lengthy questionnaires about their children were part of the drill .
The data reviewed in the first volume of findings , in 1925 , demolished " the widespread opinion that typically the intellectually precocious child is weak , undersized or nervously unstable . "
Terman 's inventories -- of physical and personality traits , books read , intellectual and recreational interests , family background -- revealed children physically superior as well as more trustworthy and honest , and much better at school ( where about 85 percent of them had skipped grades ) than a nongifted group used for a rough comparison .
On the East Coast , a fellow psychologist , Leta Hollingworth of Columbia University Teachers College -- a forerunner whom the Davidsons salute -- chimed in with similar positive findings about the gifted students she studied in two public schools .
For the rare specimens with I.Q.'s of 180 or higher , the record was somewhat more mixed on the question of social adjustment ( more recent studies on " psychological well - being " continue to conflict ) ;
Hollingworth drew particular attention to the problem of disengagement at school .
But home life in their samples ' comparatively well - off and small families seemed enviable .
" Fortunately , " Hollingworth wrote , " the majority of gifted children fall by heredity into the hands of superior parents , who are themselves of fine character and worthy to ' set example . ' "
With this portrait , the pioneers confronted a tension that exists to this day in the quest to rally support for the select cohort .
Such a positive account of gifted children was good for their image , but less so for the message that , as Terman proclaimed at the close of the first volume , " the great problems of genius " require urgent attention .
The young geniuses seemed to be doing nicely -- perhaps all too competently , in fact .
In the 1930 follow - up volume to " Genetic Studies of Genius , " the Terman team betrayed a hint of defensiveness that reappeared in the 25 - year and 35 - year follow - ups .
Anticipating later critics , they cautioned against undue expectations .
" The title is not meant to imply that the thousand or more subjects who have entered into the investigations described are all potential geniuses in the more common meaning of that term .
A few of the group may ultimately achieve that degree of distinction , but not more than a few . "
Summary : The Internet is growing at an annualized rate of 18 % and now has one billion users .
A second billion users will follow in the next ten years , bringing a dramatic change in worldwide usability needs .
Sometime in 2005 , we quietly passed a dramatic milestone in Internet history : the one - billionth user went online .
Because we have no central register of Internet users , we do n't know who that user was , or when he or she first logged on .
Statistically , we 're likely talking about a 24 - year - old woman in Shanghai .
According to Morgan Stanley estimates , 36 % of Internet users are now in Asia and 24 % are in Europe .
Only 23 % of users are in North America , where it all started in 1969 when two computers — one in Los Angeles , the other in Palo Alto — were networked together .
It took 36 years for the Internet to get its first billion users .
The second billion will probably be added by 2015 ; most of these new users will be in Asia .
The third billion will be harder , and might not be reached until 2040 .
In 2002 , NUA estimated that we had 605 million Internet users .
Since then , Internet use has grown by 18 % per year — certainly not as fast as the 1990s , but still respectable .
Overall , the Internet 's growth has been truly remarkable .
Ten years ago , the ' net was mostly used by geeks ; now it 's the default way to do business in many countries .
In our U.S. and European B2B studies , many business professionals said they visit a company 's website as the first step in researching potential vendors .
E-commerce Implications
E -commerce will continue to grow .
It typically takes people two to three years from when they first get online to feel confident enough to buy from websites .
This means that e-commerce sales will at least double from their current level when more of the current billion users start shopping online .
The billion - user Internet is a highly diverse environment that has moved far beyond the elite in Silicon Valley and other global technology hubs .
There are hundreds of millions of old people online , and there are even more users without fancy graduate degrees .
Users are not like you , and the difference between elite and mainstream users is getting bigger every day .
This means that for e-commerce to fulfill its potential to double , sites must be more systematic at following the e-commerce usability guidelines .
Selling to the 200 million early adopters was easy .
The 800 million mainstream users who are now starting to shop need much smoother sites ; the next billion will require even higher usability levels .
Demographic Shifts
By 2015 , Americans will be less than 15 % of Internet users and will likely account for about one - third its value ( Americans typically spend more than other users ) .
The fact that two - thirds of Internet revenues will come from other countries highlights the growing importance of international usability .
Unfortunately , few companies currently do user testing abroad , and fewer still have a truly robust internationalization strategy .
Sooner or later , local options will increase and overseas users will stop using sites that do n't meet their requirements .
Another implication of this demographic shift : U.S. market share and Silicon Valley buzz will become less important than international use as the metric for judging the potential of companies and technologies .
The Mac , for example , already matters less than you think .
Although it has a prominent role in the U.S. , it 's hard to refer to a company with single - digit market share as " dominant . "
In Asia , the Mac is practically nonexistent .
China , India , and Usability
As China and India add another billion Internet users , the need for usability in these two markets will explode .
As I mentioned three years ago , the two nations can't even meet the demands for offshore usability .
Recently , I 've heard even worse stories from several big American and European companies who 've found it almost impossible to recruit high - quality usability staff for their development teams in China and India .
There 's obviously a risk that offshoring will absorb the talent in China and India , leaving their domestic website design projects wanting .
Difficult - to - use Chinese and Indian sites will have dire consequences for the second billion users ' productivity and happiness .
To meet the demand for senior usability professionals over the next decade , both countries — as well as other large nations in Asia and Latin America — need a crash program to grow domestic usability professionals .
Putting aside the details of how to make the multi-billion - user Web work , the very fact that it 's realistic to expect a second billion users points to interactive media 's compelling value .
People all over the world are experiencing unprecedented levels of empowerment : being able to do things is why the Web has grown so fast , and will continue to grow for years to come .
Update January 2012
The Internet passed 2 billion users in early 2011 — about 6 years after I wrote this article to celebrate the first billion users .
This is 4 years earlier than I had expected .
Amazing that growth kept going so strong during a period that was partly characterized by the worst recession since the 1930s .
As predicted , most growth was in Asia , which will hit a full billion users in its own right during 2012 , if it 's not already there .
( Statistics are slightly iffy across so many diverse countries . )
Reflecting back on my 2005 article , I think it 's still about right .
E- commerce revenues ( and the resulting importance of good e-commerce UX ) have certainly exploded .
Looking forward , there is every reason to expect continued growth .
Lower growth rates , for sure .
We almost certainly wo n't see a second doubling to 4 billion users during the 6 years from 2011 to 2017 .
But it might be realistic to add another billion users during this period .
The absolute incremental growth would be the same , even though the growth rate would drop to 50 % per 6 years ( or 7 % per year ) .
So let this be my new prediction :
3 billion Internet users by 2017
Continued stronger growth in Asia and slower growth in the almost - fully saturated markets of North America , Europe , and Australia .
In our countries , one of the few remaining growth segments is older users , who will finally start using the Internet in almost the same proportion as younger people .
Update 2015 : 3 Billion
My prediction from 2012 has already been beaten : we were at 3.2 billion Internet users as of May 2015 according to the ITU ( International Telecommunication Union ) .
Of these , 2.2 billion live in developing countries , which again means that there 's 1 billion Interent users in rich countries .

Learning to use Firefox keyboard shortcuts to reduce your trips to the mouse can lead to a much more fulfilling web browsing experience , especially at those times that your mouse just is n't doing the trick .

Okay , you got me .
I have , on occasion ( read : often ) , neglected to charge my wireless mouse for long enough that , when it 's time to get posting on Lifehacker , I find myself totally mouse - less .
Now you 're thinking , " What , just because this wire - hating jerk can't remember to put his mouse on the charger every now and then , I 'm supposed to get all excited about the idea of using Firefox without a mouse ? "
But that 's not it at all , people !
Advertisement
I 'm the kind of web surfer who 's never terribly happy when he has to move his hand over to the mouse , and frankly , jumping over to the mouse every time you need to follow a link is so 2004 .
Check out the following Firefox keyboard shortcuts ( some well - known , others not ) , and before long you 'll forget all about the little rodent next to your keyboard .
Navigation from the toolbar
The address bar shortcut should be as instinctual as breathing by now , but there 's a few more shortcuts to that top bar that you should keep in mind .
Select location bar : Ctrl / Cmd+L or Alt +D
or Select search bar : Ctrl / Cmd+K
Back : Backspace or Alt / Cmd+Left
or Forward : Alt / Option + Right or Shift + Backspace
or Change search engine : Ctrl / Cmd +Down ( Next ) + Up ( Previous )
The last shortcut , used to change the search engine , was a big discovery for me .
I 've always been interested in additional search bar plugins , but it was never worth the trip to the mouse .
No problem any more .

Searching pages
The find - as - you - type feature was an epiphany .
While Google is great at getting you to the right web page , Firefox 's find - as - you - type feature gets you the rest of the way .
Advertisement
Find as you type text : /
Find as you type link : '
Regular old find : Ctrl / Cmd+F
The link search is very useful , especially when used in conjunction with ...
Opening pages
Unless you do all of your browsing in one page , these shortcuts are huge when you do n't want to go running for your mouse .
Advertisement
Open link in new window : Shift + Enter
Open link in new tab : Ctrl / Cmd+Enter
Open address / search in new tab : Alt / Option + Enter
Used together with their respective shortcuts ( address and search bar shortcuts and the find - as - you - type link shortcut ) , the page opening shortcuts go a long way toward mouse - less browsing .

Grab bag
The following shortcuts fall into a more general grab bag of useful shortcuts .
Caret browsing : F7
Refresh : Ctrl / Cmd+R or F5
or Refresh ( override cache ) : Ctrl / Cmd+F5 or Ctrl / Cmd + Shift+R
or Switch tabs : Ctrl / Cmd+Tab
Select tab ( 1 - 9 ) : Ctrl / Cmd + [ 1 - 9 ]
Compose email : Ctrl / Cmd+M
The preceding shortcuts are of mostly obvious usefulness .
Switching tabs and reloading pages are must - have shortcuts for any mouse - eschewing Firefox - er .
A less - known feature , Caret browsing , inserts a cursor into the text of the page and is very useful for highlighting and copying text .

If you 're looking to change your default mail program ( e.g. to Gmail , etc. ) to best utilize the Compose email shortcut , check out these tips for setting your default mail program .

So you 're a web writer , huh ?
If you 've recently turned Firefox into a full - fledged web writer , then there are a couple more useful shortcuts that you need to know .
Advertisement
Spellcheck ( with Spellbound extension Ctrl + Shift+F7
Save Entry ( with Scribe extension Ctrl+S
And there 's so much more !
Hate the mouse and the keyboard ?
While I can't solve that entirely , I can suggest that you throw some very useful and time - saving Quick searches into the mix .

Keyconfig extension
Finally , if you have n't totally satisfied your shortcut cravings , you can install the Keyconfig extension .
Keyconfig allows you to define Firefox shortcuts to your hearts content .
Advertisement
Download Keyconfig
Some of the shortcuts above may be old hat , while others may be news to you .
I 've excluded a lot of the more obvious universal shortcuts ( like copy and paste ) , but I tried to include everything you need to browse just as you would with a mouse in hand .
Still not enough ?
You might want to check out the full list of Firefox keyboard shortcuts .

Any other must - have Firefox shortcuts or extensions that make the mouse - less Firefox experience that much easier ?

Adam Pash is an associate editor of Lifehacker .
His special feature Hack Attack appears every Tuesday on Lifehacker .
I ’ve been freelancing since 2003 , first as a sole trader and more recently with a limited company .
The title still has a double meaning — this is both for beginners and by a beginner , because I know I still have a lot to learn .
This post is a summary of things I ’ve learned so far , and suggestions from other people .
This was first written in October 2006 and was revised and expanded in May 2011 .
( The original version is here . )
Some of this might only be relevant to coders or web designers , and some of the financial stuff will only be relevant to UK readers , but I hope there ’s plenty interesting for anyone thinking of going freelance in any field .
If I ’ve missed something , either post in the comments or email me ( phil [ at ] gyford [ dot ] com ) and I ’ll update the page .
Contents
1 . When to start freelancing
I was fortunate in that I was made redundant , stumbled into freelancing because I could n’t think where to apply for a job , and it all worked out .
If , like many potential freelancers , you ’re in a job and unsure about whether to take the plunge , here ’s what you should do first :
Decide why you want to freelance .
What ’s your aim ?
Maybe you want to do a specific kind of work , or work with a certain kind of person or company ?
Maybe you simply want to avoid commuting .
Maybe you want to earn as much money as possible or work as little time as possible .
Whatever the reason , it would help now and in the future to be clear on your ambition , even if it ’s only so you can check back occasionally if you ’re feeling dispirited .
Work out how much money you spend each month , and how much you need to scrape by .
It ’s useful to know what your break even point will be .
Save some money .
Even if you begin a paid project the day after you leave employment , you might not see any income from it for a couple of months or more .
Think about how you ’re going to get work ( see You are your marketing department for more ) .
Ask friends and contacts if they employ freelancers in your field and whether your skills would be suitable .
If someone says “ Yes , I ’ll give you loads of work ! ” do n’t quit your job just because of that ; there ’s a big difference between a suggestion or promise of future work and a signed contract .
2 . You are your own marketing department
I hate the idea of marketing but as a freelancer you can’t avoid the fact that you must sell yourself to get work .
The first thing to do is to tell everyone you know that you ’re available for work .
Also tell them exactly what it is you can do and want to do .
Even people you know well might not know exactly where your skills and ambitions lie .
You ca n’t be too clear .
Email , phone , IM or just talk to people and let them know .
Do n’t assume everyone will hear about it if you do n’t tell them directly ( not everyone follows you on Twitter ) .
You should have a website , or at least a page , even if your line of work is nothing to do with the internet .
Your Facebook or Twitter page does n’t count .
A website serves two purposes .
First , you should have a page that describes what you can do , with examples of your work .
Make it as clear and simple as possible ( here ’s mine although I ’m not saying it ’s a perfect example ) .
This is n’t necessarily so people can stumble across it and decide to hire you , although they might ; it ’s more so that your friend can email the link to their boss and say “ we should hire this guy ” .
It ’s a page to point at that describes what you can do to people who do n’t know you .
Without this , you ’re just a name .
The second point of a website is to keep you visible .
Blog .
Tweet about anything new you ’ve done .
Write about your field so people can see where your interests and talents lie .
Post things about work you ’ve just completed so that people can see what you ’re working on , and that you ’re still freelancing .
If you ’ve got no work do n’t feel too ashamed about saying so .
It ’s easy for people to assume you ’re fully booked , or have stopped freelancing , unless you remind them occasionally .
Of course , putting yourself about in the real world is just as important ( and something I ’m particularly bad at ) .
If you ’re working from home this is especially important .
Meet friends and colleagues for lunch , coffee , drinks , whatever .
Go to any industry social gatherings you can face .
Go to conferences .
If you really want to get yourself known , and your field has conferences , and you have things worth saying , speak at the conferences .
I used to think it was a lot of effort just to make contact with a relatively small number of people , compared to all those people on the Internet .
But it ’s a chance to talk uninterrupted to dozens or hundreds of people for twenty solid minutes ( or whatever ) .
You do n’t often get to do that .
It ’s a good way to think through your ideas and set out your stall .
It may generate other publicity via Twitter and the web , and you ’ll get to meet interesting people .
I have n’t done a lot of this myself , but Suw Charman - Anderson wrote a handy guide on how to become a conference speaker .
3 . You are your own boss
Home distractions vs office distractions
For the first few years of my freelancing life I worked from home .
Occasionally , particularly if working for an agency , I ’d go to their office ( in which case having your own laptop to take is essential ) .
I ’d heard that working from home could be difficult , that it ’s hard to keep work and home life separate .
I did n’t think it would be a problem as I ’m fairly disciplined and organised .
But no , it really can be difficult , particularly if you like to spend some of your free time doing something similar to work ( eg , making websites ) — the two can inconveniently overlap however hard you try .
Other downsides to working from home :
You need to be organised and conscientious — there ’s no boss to look over your shoulder .
There ’s no one to talk to .
Twitter , IM and email do n’t make up for real life chat .
Home has its own variety of distractions : popping to the shops , doing the washing , watching TV , raiding the fridge , and anything else that seems more appealing than work .
But there are plenty of good things about being at home :
No commuting .
No office politics .
No pointless meetings .
Peace and quiet ( or your own music ) .
The comfort of your own working set - up ( desk , chair , screen , etc. ) .
I ’m not sure whether working from home provides greater or fewer distractions than being in an office .
A lot of time in some offices seems to be spent chatting , laughing at YouTube videos , having meetings , playing pool , making tea , having more meetings , etc .
On the other hand , when there ’s no one around to notice what ’s on your screen the distractions ( or addictions ) of Facebook , Twitter and email seem so much greater .
Working from home can require more discipline to avoid distractions .
For the past year or so I ’ve been renting a desk in an office shared with friends .
If you can find some people you ’d like to spend working days with I can recommend this as a good balance .
Even as someone who likes spending time alone , working at home for weeks on end does n’t feel entirely healthy .
A shared office can have the downsides of commuting , increased expense , more distractions … but it seems a good balance .
And you can always work at home sometimes too .
If you ’re in the UK Office Genie has listings of desks to rent , although I ’ve never used it .
Working hours
One of the supposed great benefits about freelancing is “ you make your own hours ” .
Well , kind of .
If you want to work fewer hours per day , or days per week , you need to be very definite about it and be strict with yourself .
I generally try to keep Fridays free to work on my own things , but if I have n’t had much work and someone comes along with a good and / or well - paid five - days - a - week contract , it can be hard to say no .
Ryan Carson has some good advice from when he decided to work a four day week .
I mentally mark weekends as completely off - limits and in several years of freelancing I ’ve only worked at a weekend a couple of times .
This is easier if you ’re being paid by the day , rather than a lump sum to complete a project and the deadline is looming and you have n’t got enough done …
What hours each day do you want to work ?
Again , be strict with yourself or else it ’s easy for distractions to eat into your work time .
I ’ve found it simplest to stick to fairly normal office hours .
If I ’m not working at a client ’s office I might pop to the gym mid-morning and finish an hour later in the evening , but otherwise keeping regular hours is a good way to keep work separate from play — it ’s easier for everyone to make the distinction .
Having fairly standard hours also means you ’ll be available when the client is at work ( assuming they ’re in the same timezone ) .
Also , while you might work better from 6 pm until the early hours , many clients will think it unprofessional and may find it hard to picture how much time they ’re getting for their money .
On the flip side , some clients might think you should be available to answer their questions , or do bits and pieces of work , at odd hours .
If you ’re quite clear about your working hours it ’s easier to say “ That ’s fine , but I ’ll have to do it first thing tomorrow . ”
More on this kind of thing in You are your own account manager .
Paul Graham has an interesting post about the types of schedules different kinds of workers favour , and how disruptive meetings can be to the days of some people .
Worth thinking about if you need to arrange meetings .
Another aspect of how much time you spend working is what holidays you take .
Although you can , in theory , have holidays whenever you like it is harder when you ’re freelancing .
I always feel wary of booking holiday far in advance in case my dream project turns up at the same time .
I ’m getting better at ignoring this and just booking holidays and have n’t regretted it so far .
Holidays also feel more expensive than they would if you had a “ proper job ” because every week off is a week when you ’re earning no money .
I ’ve got round this feeling a bit by paying myself a regular amount each month , but this does take planning and a financial cushion ( see Bank accounts ) .
This year , for the first time , I ’m keeping track of how many days of holiday I ’ve taken , just as if I was at a real company with a real holiday allowance .
I figure that if I get close to the end of the year and have n’t taken my 25 days of holiday ( or whatever number you choose ) then I ’m owed some time off .
It can be hard to work out what counts as “ holiday ” when you have no client work on .
For me , even if I ’m not doing paying work , if I go to the office and do useful internetty stuff , it ’s a working day , not holiday .
4 . You are your own HR department
Whether you ’re working at home or at your desk in a shared office , make sure you have a good working environment .
Working on a laptop on the sofa might be comfy but it wo n’t do your body any favours after 40 + hours every week .
Buy a decent desk and chair and position your monitor at a suitable height .
Look away from the screen every few minutes ( if you play music , look out the window , stretch your arms and move your shoulders whenever the song changes ) .
Get up and walk around and stretch at least once an hour .
Have your eyes tested at least once a year .
Get some exercise .
If you ’re working at home and not even walking to the train station you need to find a way to get some exercise a few times a week , Tubby .
This is all dull but important nonetheless .
If you ’re young and about to ignore the above , please just do it and come and thank me in ten or twenty years when all your friends are hunched over , half - blind and only able to earn a living by consuming prescription pain - killers .
Really .
5 . You are your own accounts department
Keeping track of income , expenses , tax , etc can be a nightmare for some people .
You do have to be organised but it should n’t be too complicated .
Some of what I say in this section is very specific to the UK , but hopefully there ’s some good general advice for others too .
Your main choice , from a legal and financial standpoint , is whether to be purely a sole trader ( you invoice people directly ) or whether to form a limited company ( a legal entity from which you invoice clients and which pays you money ) .
The latter involves a bit more paperwork ( both to set up and at the end of each financial year ) but can save you money if you income is above a certain amount .
I ’ll first discuss finances for sole traders , as it ’s simplest and most peoples ’ first step , and then discuss the differences for limited companies .
When you start freelancing , if you ’re in the UK , call Revenue & Customs and tell them you ’re going freelance .
They keep a record of this and you ’ll have to do Self Assessment tax returns each year ( which some people , mostly higher earners , do even if they have normal jobs ) .
They also have a page all about Self Assessment for the Self Employed and there ’s a page about becoming self employed generally .
Bank accounts
You should open a separate bank account for your work - related money ( just a regular current account ; it does n’t have to be a “ business ” account ) .
I ’m not sure it ’s strictly / legally necessary for sole traders but it makes things much less confusing .
I did n’t do this at first but would now recommend keeping “ business ” and “ personal ” finances as separate as possible — treat your work like a “ business ” even if it ’s not technically a “ company ” .
Have clients pay money directly into your work bank account and pay for work - related expenses from it .
When you want money for you , personally , transfer money from the work account to your personal one .
Just as it ’s a good idea to have some savings before you start freelancing it ’s worth trying to keep some savings in case of cash flow problems .
It only takes a quiet month and a late payment or two and you may not have income for 2 - 3 months .
If you manage to build up a pot of savings in your work account I can recommend transferring a regular monthly amount to your personal account , rather than ad - hoc amounts whenever cash comes in .
It ’s a good way to smooth out any ups and downs in your work income and gives you a better feeling for how much you ’re earning , on average .
You might also want to set up a second account , probably a savings account , for the money you owe the taxman , as suggested at greater length by Doug Bowman .
Whenever some money is paid into your work current account , immediately pay a percentage into your work savings account so that when tax time arrives you have the money to hand .
How much to put aside ?
You can estimate your annual gross income and work out how much of it will need to go in tax ( and National Insurance if you ’re in the UK ) .
Doug suggests 30 % .
I ’ve been putting 25 % aside which has done me alright so far , but the more you earn , the larger percentage you ’ll need to put aside ( more of your income may be within a higher tax bracket ) .
In summary , you ’ll have :
Your existing personal bank account (s ) .
A current account for all your work - related income and expenditure .
A savings account for putting money aside to pay tax with .
Invoicing
When you finish some work for a client you send them an invoice which , in theory , puts into motion their processes for ensuring you get paid .
When to send invoices depends on the job , and if it ’s not clear it ’s worth asking the client what they expect before you start work .
If the work is going to take a month or less I usually invoice once the project ’s complete and the client ’s happy .
If it goes on for longer I usually invoice at the end of each month ( either calendar month or after a month of work ) , but check with the client .
The government ’s Business Link site has a good page about what information an invoice should contain .
In addition to that , a few other things that I do :
I put the word ‘ INVOICE ’ at the very top of the page .
It ca n’t hurt to make it clear exactly what this piece of paper is .
I make up a unique reference number for each invoice by combining the current date with a counter .
So invoice 20110506/01 is the first invoice sent on 6th May 2011 .
If the client has a reference number , purchase order number , etc , include that on your invoice .
When it comes to the “ clear description of what you are charging for ” I tend to break this up a bit .
I usually charge per day , so I ’ll tend to list each week on a separate line with the number of days worked that week .
If you ’d like the client to pay direct into your bank account , provide the necessary details .
So that ’s the bank name and address , account name , account number and sort code .
If you ’re doing work for foreign clients you ’ll need to include both the “ SWIFT / BIC ” code for your bank and the “ IBAN ” number for your account .
Ask your bank .
Terms — by when do you expect payment ?
At the bottom of the invoice I include the phrase “ Payment by transfer within 30 days ” unless something else has been agreed with the client previously .
I also include the phrase “ We understand and will exercise our statutory right to claim interest and compensation for debt recovery costs under the late payment legislation if we are not paid according to agreed credit terms ” which I think I found on the Better Payment Practice Campaign site , although I ’ve never had to worry about that kind of thing thankfully .
I usually send a PDF of the invoice via email , and have n’t had any complaints , although a few larger organisations have a separate postal address to which I mail a paper version instead .
What records to keep
Whether you hire an accountant ( see below ) or not you must keep records of your incomings and outgoings .
I still use a fairly low - tech method involving a spreadsheet for each financial year .
Many people I know use an online service for keeping track of these things , plus sending invoices , reconciling things with their bank accounts etc .
I ’ve heard each of these services being recommended :
Xero .
This is probably overkill if you ’re a sole trader , but people I know with limited companies of varying sizes are very enthusiastic about it .
American , but works well in the UK .
FreeAgent .
This is aimed at “ freelancers and small businesses ” and I ’ve heard many good things about how easy it is to use .
Bsed in the UK .
Crunch .
A couple of people said good things about this UK - based service .
Looks like it involves more contact and advice from humans .
Income
In my low - tech spreadsheet , every year I have one page for income , one for expenses .
The income list has the following columns :
Date invoice was sent
Date invoice was paid
My reference number
Client name
Project
Amount charged
Amount to put aside for tax
If you ’re in the EU and registered for VAT ( see below ) you might replace the last two columns with :
Net amount charged
VAT charged
Total amount charged
VAT owed to HMRC ( which , if you register for the Flat Rate Scheme , will be less than the amount you charged , see below ) .
( which , if you register for the Flat Rate Scheme , will be less than the amount you charged , see below ) .
Amount to put aside for tax
At the end of the tax year I copy any unpaid invoices over to the next year ’s spreadsheet .
You should still list any unpaid invoices in the original spreadsheet however , as they represent money owed to you in that year .
Expenses
The other page of the spreadsheet lists my expenses .
There are columns for :
Date
My reference number ( again , make up your own system )
Company / shop name
Item name
Cost
Every time you spend money get a receipt ( or , with online purchases , print out your email confirmation ) , write your reference number on it , and put it with all your other receipts for the current tax year ( in an envelope , shoe box , or just paperclip them together ) .
The more organised you are through the year , the less of a nightmare you or your accountant will have ( and an easier job for an accountant means paying them less ) .
You could separate the expenses into different categories .
My old accountant suggested these , but I ’ve no idea if they ’re ideal :
Direct costs
Labour costs
Repairs & Renewals
Printing , Postage & Stationary
Subscriptions
Protective Clothing
Computer Consumables
Research , Books & Journals
Mobile phone
Landline
Car expenses
Travel & subsistence UK
Travel & subsistence abroad
Advertising & promotion
Professional Indemnity Insurance
Bank Charges and Interest
Other Finance Charges
Capital Computer
Capital Car
Capital Equipment
Services
Misc
Basically you can include anything you buy solely for work and a percentage of things you buy partly for work .
If you work from home a proportion of your bills could count as expenses .
There are many grey areas and I probably err on the side of caution as to what counts as a legitmate expense .
When the end of the tax year comes around you subtract your total expenses from your total income to work out your net income , the amount on which you ’re taxed .
( Yes , this is a very simple explanation . )
Which means that if , say , you ’re paying 22 % income tax you ’re effectively buying anything expensable at a 22 % discount .
Is an accountant necessary ?
It depends on how prepared you are to do your own tax returns etc , and how much income and expenses you have .
I expect that the more complicated and substantial your finances , the more the cost of paying an accountant will be worthwhile in the money they save you .
My finances are pretty simple and I pay about £ 400 for a set of very simple accounts and a completed tax return .
Of course , an accountant can also provide advice on other things you could be doing to save money .
Even many of the friends who recommended services like Xero , FreeAgent , etc. still pay for accountants .
Unless you enjoy doing all this stuff yourself , and taking time off paying work to do it , ask friends if they can recommend accountants .
It may be a good idea to talk to the accountant first about your business to get a feel for whether you like them .
Do n’t be afraid to say “ no thanks ” there and then , or at any point during your working relationship , if you feel they ’re not right for you in some way .
You ’re putting a lot of trust in them — you ’re still ultimately responsible for signing off your tax returns — so you should be happy with the accountant and their work .
This is the voice of experience .
If you do n’t know anything about accounts it may be useful to get a basic understanding , so your eyes do n’t glaze over too much when talking to your accountant .
I ’m currently reading Anthony Rice ’s Accounts Demystified which a friend recommended , and which seems nice and clear ( and UK - oriented ) .
VAT
If you ’re in the UK ( and , I assume , the rest of the EU ) you can become VAT registered .
In the UK you must register for VAT if your “ taxable supplies ” ( what you charge clients ) are over £ 73,000 per year ( as of 2011 / 12 ) .
If you bring in less than that you can voluntarily register .
Read more on registering for VAT in the UK .
When you ’re registered you must add VAT on top of your charges to clients ( that ’s 20 % at time of writing ) .
If you only deal with other VAT - registered entities ( ie , businesses ) this is n’t a problem as they will claim the VAT back from the government eventually .
I ’ve rarely had a problem with this .
If you deal with individuals who are n’t VAT registered you ’ll be effectively raising the price of your services by 20 % which is less good .
On the plus side , you get to claim back all the VAT you spend on purchasing goods and services .
Once you ’ve registered you ’ll have to complete a VAT return every quarter outlining the VAT you ’ve charged and paid .
Rather than registering for VAT normally another option is the Flat Rate Scheme , which is much simpler .
You add VAT when you invoice as normal , but you no longer have to keep track of VAT on individual purchases .
Instead you pay a flat percentage of your income , a percentage that ’s lower than the VAT rate .
This means you gain a small amount on the difference .
It ’s not a huge amount of money but it can be worth the minimal quarterly hassle of filling out a simple VAT return .
For example , you invoice a company for £ 1,000 and add 20 % VAT , making a total charge of £ 1,200 .
At the end of the quarter you fill out your VAT return and send HMRC a percentage of your income ( the percentage assigned to you depends on your trade ; mine is currently 14.5 % ) .
In this case we pay 14.5 % of £ 1,200 : £ 174 .
This leaves us £ 26 better off than if we had n’t registered for VAT , before paying income tax .
Not a lot , but it all adds up .
As with income tax there is , of course , much more to it than I ’ve mentioned here .
And do n’t blindly take my advice without checking with someone who knows what they ’re talking about !
Forming a limited company
Should you form a limited company or stay as a sole trader ?
There are some financial advantages in forming a company and it can also make you seem more professional and capable .
Forming a limited company creates a legal entity of which you are probably the director ( and probably only employee ) .
When you do work for clients you do so under the company name ( which should go on contracts ) and your invoices are sent under the company ’s name instead of your own .
You will need a proper “ business ” bank account ( which tend to have more charges ) and it ’s more important to keep the finances of your company and you as an individual separate .
There may be varying ways to receive money yourself , but one way is to have a salary of a small amount ( enough to keep paying National Insurance contributions ) and receive the rest of your income as dividends ( either way , it ’s just transferring amounts from your business bank account to your personal one ) .
This is where I currently start to get a bit hand - wavy and vague , which means it ’s best to consult an accountant before doing any of this .
Is it worth doing ?
The main reason is usually to pay less tax overall ( mainly due to the slightly lower level of corporate tax compared to personal tax levels ) .
This page on an accountants ’ website offers some suggested savings at different levels of income .
I ’ve also read an earlier version of Using a Comany to Save Tax which was pretty good .
Another benefit is that you , personally , are shielded from liabilities .
If someone breaks their leg because of your shoddy work , then sues your company , the worst that can happen is your company being bankrupted , rather than you losing your home , car and life savings .
( But I am not a lawyer . )
It also , I think , helps you feel “ bigger ” somehow .
If you ’ve got a company you could now do all the things real companies do .
You could hire people !
It feels like a step towards expanding your business to greater things , if that ’s something you ’re interested in .
But it does mean more admin overhead .
There are forms to fill in when setting up and then every year you need a set of accounts for your company , filed with Companies House , and a tax return .
If you use an accountant , which is more likely if you ’re going this route , you ’ll incur extra accountancy fees .
If you ’re registered for VAT as a sole trader and later form a limited company , you can transfer the VAT registration to the new company and keep the same VAT number .
Personally , I avoided forming a limited company for a few years because I like to keep things simple and I did n’t think I ’d save much money .
I ’ve now had a limited company for a few years and it ’s probably been worth it financially and , aside from higher accountants ’ fees it has n’t been any hassle .
Other people I know who have gone freelance recently have set up limited companies from day one .
How much to charge
Working out how much to charge clients is very difficult .
There are many variables at play ( your experience , your speed , tightness of deadlines , type of client , etc ) and it ’s not something for which people freely give solid examples .
I wrestled with this early on and had some useful comments posted .
Most of my work has been at a standard day rate — the client will hire me for a set amount of time and pay me accordingly .
The alternative is to be asked how much a particular project will cost to build .
Either way , you need to work out how much you charge per day .
When pricing an entire project you ’ll need as many details about it as possible .
Break it down into small parts and work out how long each will take .
This can take a long time and can be difficult — certainly , it ’s not something I ’m good at .
I tend to be over - optimistic so I usually add a bit of extra time on to allow for the inevitable and unexpected problems , and all those final little details that take a surprisingly large amount of time when you ’ve “ nearly finished ” .
Also , be clear what is and is n’t included so you can charge extra for any additional work .
Once you ’ve worked out how long the project will take , and you know your day rate , you know the cost of the project .
How to set your day rate ?
Anil Dash suggests that clients should be shocked when you tell them .
Steve Friedl ’s consulting guide says “ If you ’re booked up solid , your rates are too low . ”
Here ’s an “ Hourly Rate Calculator ” .
Not only do you have to allow for your own skills in your price but the price changes depending on the client .
Simply , some clients will have more money than others and are used to paying larger amounts .
You need to factor this in with how much you want to do the work :
Will it be fun or a chore ?
Will you learn new skills and meet interesting new people ?
Will it be something you can show future potential clients to generate new business ?
I ’ve done quite a few internal - use - only , prototype websites which are fun to work on but do n’t get seen outside the client ’s company .
Will you own any of the intellectual property or will your client own everything you ’ve done ?
( Usually it ’s the latter . )
Will it be a long project of constant work that might earn them a discount ?
One long project is less hassle than lots of short ones .
If you ’re going to do this , make it clear you ’re offering your client a discount off your standard price .
Matt Webb has some interesting thoughts on this kind of weighing up .
Stowe Boyd uses the Ten Day Rule : he plans to do client work ten days per month , and charges accordingly .
As for my own experience …
Most of my clients have been businesses rather than charities —
I ’m doing this for money so I can afford to do other fun and interesting things in my non -work time .
But there ’s a big difference in what different businesses will pay for the same work .
For example , you ’re doing work for a new media agency on a project for their client EndlessMegacorp .
The agency might be prepared to pay you amount x for a day ’s work , but they ’ll be charging Endless Megacorp amount x+y ( quite possibly a multiple of x ) for the same day ’s work ( which , to be fair , includes the agency ’s greater overheads ) .
On the other hand , if you do some work directly for EndlessMegacorp , or some other large company that often employs new media agencies , they ’re less likely to blink when you suggest a day rate that ’s larger than x .
On the downside , you then have to handle the client , do some project management , etc .
It ’s very hard to give specific advice about what to charge because there are so many factors involved .
For my kind of work ( which itself varies a lot ) , with my kind of client , with my sort of experience , I ’ve charged between £ 400 and £ 800 per day over recent years .
Pension
No , not exciting , but worth mentioning .
If you ’re freelancing you ’ve got no company pension scheme so you should sort one out .
Now , rather than later .
Who knows , it might even be worth something one day .
6 . You are your own project manager
You need to keep track of how long you spend working on each project .
If you ’re getting paid by the day you need to know how much to charge .
If it ’s a flat - fee for a project it ’s still useful for you to know how long the project took ( and how long each part of it took ) so you have a better guide next time you ’re asked for a similar quote .
I do n’t have a sophisticated system for this .
I mark full or half days worked for a client in my calendar and sometimes keep track at a more detailed level elsewhere , particularly for a flat - fee project .
There are various tools to help with this kind of thing such as Billable for the Mac and the web - based Side Job Track and Harvest ( which a few friends have recommended ) .
You should also keep notes of meetings and phone calls .
Even if your memory is better than mine these may come in very useful when trying to recall if a particular feature is in or out after a weekend of not thinking about work .
Not long after starting to freelance I wanted one place to keep track of all my work notes .
Seeing as I already had a weblog system in place I settled on creating a private weblog .
I have categories for each client and project , and every day I post an entry outlining what I ’ve done that day ( maybe simply pasting in an email I ’ve sent the client ) .
Notes of meetings and phone calls go in there along with snippets of code and anything else that might be useful .
I ’ve never had a client ask me to account for my time , but I ’d like to be able to provide them with a good answer if they ever do .
Because every project has a slight overhead in terms of setting it up ( meetings etc ) , running it ( client contact , space in your brain , etc ) , and winding it down ( invoicing , archiving , etc ) , the fewer projects you have running at once , the simpler life will be .
If you have five projects on the go and you ’re working one day a week on each you ’ll have a harder job than if you ’re spending all week on a single job .
Of course , often one takes what one gets , but it ’s worth bearing in mind .
Scheduling projects in advance can be tricky .
Some clients will be eager for you to start right away but then have to delay you because of some internal bureaucracy .
Some clients will say they definitely need you , but not for a couple of weeks , only for the project not to happen after all , or to only start two months later .
Given that I often do n’t have written contracts there ’s an added element of vagueness about scheduling .
My rule of thumb is to assume the project wo n’t happen until the client gives a definite start date , deadline ( or number of days the job will last ) and agrees the fee .
It could still fall through but not as frequently as all the projects that are “ going to happen next month probably ” .
I ’ve probably had nearly as many “ possible ” projects not materialise as I ’ve had definite projects that I actually worked on , so I ’ve learned not to get my hopes up .
While a lot of jobs can be quite last minute it is possible to get booked up — there have been a few times when I ’ve been booked up for three months ahead and have turned other clients away because I did n’t want to be tied down for any longer ( I might as well have had a proper job if I wanted that ! ) .
7 . You are your own account handler
Communicating with your client is important , particularly if you ’re working off - site where the client ca n’t see you .
Once you ’ve started a project I ’d suggest a minimum of emailing the client at the end of each day with an outline of what you ’ve done .
There are no hard and fast rules , and each client is different , but do n’t assume that they think everything is going smoothly if they do n’t hear from you .
You might be able to ease off a bit once the project gets going .
If you email , post or FTP work to the client ( designs , HTML templates , etc ) , be sure to keep a copy .
If you do work on - site at a client ’s office , keep a copy of what you ’ve done .
( Obviously , this is harder if , say , you ’re working on an existing codebase , but then it ’s hopefully all version controlled so you wo n’t need to keep copies of anything . )
On a couple of occasions I ’ve had clients come back to me weeks after a project ended as they ’ve lost the work I did for them and they were extremely grateful when I was able to immediately send them another copy .
Also , if the client sends you designs , code or documents to work from , keep them safe somewhere and work from copies — it can be very handy to have untouched versions in case something goes wrong .
Earlier I discussed working hours and these can have an effect on your relationship with a client .
Unless you confirm things beforehand the client probably assumes you ’re going to be working fairly regular office hours .
If they call mid-morning and do n’t hear back until the evening because you ’ve decided you ’re working into the night , it wo n’t go down well .
And to be honest , for most clients , it ’s going to be harder for them to feel confident about you if you work irregular or unusual hours .
Of course , some clients will work irregular hours and in return , unless you ’ve agreed otherwise , you should stick to your regular hours .
Just because the client emails you at 11 pm with some notes do n’t feel you have to respond until the next day .
If the client gets used to you responding late at night then they may come to expect it .
Generally , make it as obvious as possible when you ’re working and when you ’re not .
If you ’re working in a client ’s office they know , otherwise they do n’t know unless you help them .
You should also be prepared for clients wanting to talk about their project while you ’re working on a different one .
This is inevitable , particularly if you often have a few projects current at once , and it ’s a balancing act — obviously , if a client is paying for you to work for them today , they have priority , but you do n’t want to be completely unavailable to other clients ( unless you ’ve warned them first ) .
Finally , a new client will involve more overhead in terms of communication , bureaucracy , getting to know each other , peculiar invoicing and payment methods , etc .
Clients with whom you already get on , and may have future work , are worth keeping hold of .
8 . You are your own legal department
Should you expect a contract when you begin a project ?
I can only say that I ’ve done a lot of work for clients with nothing more than a verbal agreement and I ’ve never had a dispute over payment from either side .
I may have been extraordinarily lucky , and a large number of my clients have been people I already know or are friends of friends .
If I was working for an individual I had no connection to I ’d probably be more keen on getting something in writing , but I ’d be less worried with a reputable company I did n’t know ( they ’re less likely to disappear overnight ) .
Larger companies will often provide a contract , although they vary in their efficiency at getting it ready , which can be a problem if you ’re both otherwise ready to start work .
One large company I ’ve worked for sometimes ends up providing lengthy contracts for me to sign after all the work has been completed , such is the bureaucracy .
Depending on your work you may need more involved legal documents .
Something like ContractStore might be useful : fairly low - cost standard format contracts for different purposes .
( I ’ve never used them myself . )
Occasionally I ’ve worked for a large public service media organisation that has stipulated I should have £ 1 million of indemnity insurance .
It might be a useful thing to have anyway I guess .
If you need something like that Hiscox are one provider ( I used them but never had to claim anything ) and you can sign up immediately online .
9 . You are your own IT department
When you ’re working for yourself there are a few techy things to remember .
If your computer dies — dodgy disk , overheating , OS upgrade that goes wrong , etc — any time you spend fixing it is time you ’re not earning .
If you ’re on a tight deadline and your computer ’s unusable , you ’re in trouble .
I ’ve kept my old laptop around in case my new ( er ) one dies and I need a rapid , if slow , replacement .
If you get a new computer — because the other one died or just because they ’re shiny and irresistable — the time it takes you to install and configure all your favourite applications and extra doodads is also time out from doing paying work .
The same issues affect any part of your personal IT infrastructure — if your wifi goes down , your router mysteriously stops working , or your ADSL suddenly cuts out , it ’s bound to be at the moment you really , really need it .
Think about where you ’ll work if your home or office is cut off .
Finally , backups .
Losing your own data is bad enough , but if you lose something you ’ve spent a couple of weeks working on for someone else it ’s possibly even worse .
They ’re not going to pay you to do it again , so you ’ve got a lot of unpaid and very dull catching up to do .
And if it happens just before a deadline you ’ve also got some explaining to do .
You should be backing up your work , email , and anything else vital , at least once a day .
If you ’ve got a Mac you ’ve got no excuse not to buy an external drive and painlessly back your computer up using Apple ’s Time Machine .
Ideally you should back things up off - site too .
The cost of something like Backblaze or Mozy , both popular with people I know , will more than pay for itself when something goes wrong .
10 .
You are your own careers adviser
If you have a proper job then career progression is often more obvious .
Your role might change if it ’s a quickly expanding company , you might become responsible for new hires below you , you might get promoted , you might move to a different post in the company , or you may leave for a better job elsewhere .
If you ’re freelancing , on your own , it ’s very easy to effectively stay in the same job for a long time .
You can become known for doing a certain type of work , so that might be all you ’re offered .
There ’s also a limit to the scale of work you can accomplish on your own , whereas in a company you can be one part of a team working on something bigger .
It ’s easy to stagnate , particularly if you ’re lucky enough to have lots of work — there ’s no time to stop and think about what you want to do , to develop new skills , or to create examples of other things you can do to attract different work .
So , particularly if you ’ve been freelancing for a while , it ’s good to set aside time to read , play , meet new people , and make sure you ’re heading in the right direction .
On the other hand , if you work with a variety of clients you do get to see how many companies operate — both in terms of processes and code ( if you ’re a programmer ) .
This can give you wider horizons than if you work for the same company for years .
But , back on the first hand , particularly if you ’re usually producing work from scratch without input from others , it ’s easy to get stuck in a rut of how you design , code , etc , as you see too much of your own work and too few examples of how else to do things .
If you ’re on your own it ’s also harder to ask others for advice about how to tackle something .
There is also the issue of feedback , or the lack of it .
Hopefully , in any decent company , you get a sense of whether colleagues like your work or not — it ’s easier to give feedback when you ’re face to face , even if it ’s just a few words .
You also get formal appraisals and while ( in my experience ) they ’re rushed through as quickly as possible they can be useful .
If you ’re working remotely however , you often do n’t get much feedback .
I suspect this is simply because everyone is too busy and unless you ’re face - to - face decent feedback is the kind of thing that gets forgotten .
It ’s useful to know if you ’ve exceeded or failed to meet expectations , and in what way , or you feel like you ’re working in a void .
As your own careers adviser you should be asking if you ’re heading in the right direction .
Are you aims still the same ?
If you feel stuck , or you ’re not sure , talking to friends or colleagues can be useful for some ideas and inspiration .
I have n’t used a proper mentor myself , but friends have done and are glad they did .
Martin Vogel has some good posts on finding and working with a coach .
11 . Conclusion
Although I fell into freelancing for a negative reason — I could n’t think of a company I wanted to work for or a role I wanted to fill — it ’s been a good few years .
In that time I ’ve done a larger amount of more varied work than in any three years of having a “ proper job ” .
I ’ve also had much more time to work on my own projects while still , overall , making alright money .
I ’ve worked with interesting and lovely people on some great projects and have had enough work .
However , I have found it tough at times .
Working at home alone for a few years became a bit much .
And , it feels like I only ever get to work on projects , or parts of projects , of a repetitively similar scale — there ’s a danger of not being stretched after a while .
Also , as a solo worker I ’m only ever around for short periods and it ’s tough to feel fully invested in a project , product or company in the way permanent employees can .
On balance it ’s still a great way to work , full of variety , freedom , interesting people and opportunities .
And the more organised you are about it , and the clearer you are about what you want to achieve , the better you ’ll be .

Europe 's economies are growing ahead of the US and Japan
Growth across the 25 members of the European Union was 0.9 % in the quarter , up from 0.8 % in the first quarter and representing 2.8 % over the year .
Comparable growth figures for the US and Japan were 0.7 % and 0.2 % .
The economies of the 12 - nation euro currency group also grew at 0.9 % over this period .
Jobs failure
Europe is lagging behind its economic rivals when it comes to creating new jobs , however .
During the second quarter unemployment across the EU was unchanged at 8 % , some distance behind the US with 4.8 % unemployment or Japan at 4.1 % .
Poland has the highest jobless rate in the EU , with a 15 % jobless toll .
Slovakia is second in the unemployment league , with 14 % out of work .
Economists expect the rate of growth to cool towards the autumn , with the European Central Bank signalling the likelihood of further interest rate rises in order to curb inflation .
Though incumbent Governor Rick Perry is almost assured to win the Republican nomination for this year 's gubernatorial election in Texas , he does face three long - shot challengers .
One of them , Corpus Christi rancher Star Locke , has proposed eliminating property taxes in the Lone Star State with revenue from taxing three things he finds undesirable .
Specifically , Locke is proposing a $ 10,000 per-abortion tax on medical clinics that perform abortions and a 50 percent tax on all soda that " contains added glucose , fructose , sucrose to the beverage for sale to humans . "
[ UPDATE ]
However , gamers will be especially alarmed by the third part of Locke 's property - tax - relief proposal -- a 100 percent tax on " violent video games . "
According to the candidate 's official Web site , the candidate would impose " The Family Security & Protection Act " when elected .
Section 4 of the act calls to " levy a 100 percent of price sales cost tax for the sale on ... any video game containing any form of human violence . "
" I take the position that the Founding Fathers took : that the power to tax is the power to destroy , " Locke told the Amarillo Globe News .
" So our concept is that we need to tax things we do n't want and you want to not tax things that you want to encourage . "
However , in the unlikely event he is sent to the governor 's mansion , Locke would create a 10 - member board that would label games as violent .
According to the Globe , the tax itself would be levied against the publishers of said games -- and quickly .
" Once it 's reviewed , the tax would be levied swiftly , " he said .
[ UPDATE ]
Locke 's other platform promises call for the repeal of all alcoholic beverage laws and a 50 percent " grease tax " on " all food prepared by deep - frying or cooking in any form of oil or grease for human consumption . "
Email to Brown claims
Bush was happy former FEMA head was taking heat for Katrina response RAW STORY
Published : Friday June 9 , 2006 Print This | Email This An " embarrassing email " leaked by former FEMA head Michael Brown to CNN quotes President Bush as saying at a Cabinet meeting held shortly after Katrina that he was pleased that Brown was taking most of the heat for the federal government 's roundly criticized response to the hurricane .
" I 'd rather they beat up on him than me or Chertoff , " President Bush allegedly said at the meeting , referring to the head of the Department of Homeland Security , Michael Chertoff .
The sender also thanked Brown for " diverting hostile fire away from the leader . "
CNN was n't able to conclusively confirm that the email sent on September 7 , 2005 came from the White House , but Brown said that it was sent to him by a high - level White House official , and the sender 's email address ends with " eop.gov , " as in " Executive Office of the President . "
The sender 's name was blocked out by the network , as per Brown 's request .
Full text of the email : # I did hear of one reference to you , at the Cabinet meeting yesterday .
I was n't there but I heard someone commented that the press was sure beating up on Mike Brown , to which the President replied , " I 'd rather they beat up on him than me or Chertoff . "
Congratulations on doing a great job of diverting hostile fire away from the leader .

The email can be viewed at this link .
A White House spokesman told CNN that this was an old rumour and refused to comment on it .
" Some of the contents of the e-mail were first claimed in a column written by Brown 's lawyer , Andy Lester , in the conservative publication , " Human Events , " and subsequently picked up by news media , but until now , the existence of a written record has been unreported , " reports CNN at its Situation Room blog ( link ) .
Test & Kaufberatung | Test
Mit der anstehenden Version 6.06 ( Dapper Drake ) will Ubuntu Linux seine Tauglichkeit für den Unternehmenseinsatz auf Desktop und Server unter Beweis stellen .
Dazu gehört eine Supportgarantie von bis zu fünf Jahren .
Ubuntu Linux ( das Zulu - Wort Ubuntu bedeutet Menschlichkeit , Gemeinsinn ) ist einer der Shooting Star unter den Linux - Distributionen : Das im Oktober 2004 erschienene erste Release 4.10 ( die Versionsnummer bestimmt sich aus Jahr und Monat der Veröffentlichung ) mit dem Codenamen Warty Warthog schoss binnen kurzem auf Platz eins der Liste der beliebtesten Linux - Distributionen auf Distrowatch .
Dazu beigetragen haben neben der freien Verfügbarkeit die gute Lokalisierung , Einfachheit als Design - Prinzip , Anstrengungen in Richtung Barrierefreiheit und eine hilfsbereite Entwickler - und Benutzer - Community .
Die treibende - und vor allem finanzierende - Kraft hinter Ubuntu ist Mark Shuttleworth , der sich einen Namen als Weltraumtourist auf der ISS machte .
Seine Firma Canonical sponsort neben Ubuntu weitere Open - Source - Projekte : das verteilte die verteilte Quellcode - Revisionsmanagementsystem Bazaar , die OpenCD , eine Sammlung von Open - Source - Software für Windows , und die südafrikanische Go Open Source - Kampagne , die Aufmerksamkeit für Open - Source - Software schaffen will .
Das Unternehmen bezahlt Gnome- , Debian - und Bazaar - Entwickler .
Canonical bietet kommerziellen Support für Ubuntu Linux an .
Für Updates , Online - und telefonische Unterstützung zahlt man 250 US - Dollar pro Jahr für ein Desktop - System , 700 für einen Server und 1200 für Cluster und Thin Clients .
In Deutschland bieten eine Reihe kleinerer Systemhäuser Support für Ubuntu an .
Seit Juli 2005 existiert eine von Canonical unabhängige Stiftung , die Shuttleworth mit einem Startkapital von 10 Millionen US - Dollar ausgestattet hat .
Sie soll den Support bereits erschienener Ubuntu - Linux - Versionen sicherstellen und für das regelmäßige Erscheinen neuer Versionen im Halbjahrestakt sorgen .
Zentrale Ubuntu - Entwickler sind bei der Ubuntu Foundation angestellt .
Debian inside
Ubuntu ist ein angepasstes Debian GNU / Linux .
Dabei hat man versucht , die Stärken von Debian zu erhalten und seine Schwächen zu beseitigen .
Zu den Stärken von Debian gehört das leistungsfähige System zur Softwareverwaltung , das Ubuntu über das grafische Frontend Synaptic und eine selbst entwickelte Sofwtare , die regelmäßig auf Updates checkt und sie auf Wunsch automatisch einspielt , zugänglich macht .
Eine weitere Stärke ist die große Auswahl von Programmpaketen , die unter Ubuntu zwar zum größten Teil nutzbar sind , in der Standardinstallation jedoch auf wenige wirklich nötige Anwendungen reduziert sind .
Das macht den Umgang mit Ubuntu für den Anwender einfach :
Er muss sich nicht zwischen mehreren grafischen Bedienoberflächen , einem Dutzend Webbrowsern und - zig E - Mail - Programmen entscheinen , sondern findet nach der Installation einen vorkonfigurierten Gnome - Desktop mit dem Browser Firefox , dem E - Mail - Programm Evolution , OpenOffice.org und einigen weiteren Desktop - Anwendungen für den Büro - und Heimeinsatz vor .
Die gesamt Ubuntu - Distribution passt auf eine CD .
Software - Repositories , deutlich unterteilt nach vom Ubuntu - Team unterstützten und nicht unterstützten Programmen , machen viele in Ubuntu nicht enthaltene Anwendungen , aber auch proprietäre Treiber der Hardwarehersteller via Internet zuänglich .
Die meisten Programmpakete für Debian GNU / Linux lassen sich problemlos in Ubuntu einspielen .
Die Schwächen von Debian - die im Vergleich zu anderen Linux - Versionen bescheidene Hardwareerkennung , veraltete Software und umständliche Konfiguration - bügelt Ubuntu recht erfolgreich aus .
Gängige Hardware wird automatisch erkannt und in Betrieb genommen , regelmäßige Releases alle sechs Monate halten die Programme auf dem aktuellen Stand , das System ist nach der Installation weitgehend vorkonfiguriert .
Der Debian - Unterbau , kombiniert mit aktueller Software und mehr Komfort , dürften maßgeblich zu dem großen Erfolg der Distribution beigetragen haben .
Deutlich hinter Debian zurück bleibt Ubuntu hinsichtlich der unterstützten Hardwareplattformen : Neben x86 in 32 - und 64 - Bit - Spielart läuft die Version 5.10 lediglich auf PowerPC - Rechnern .
Mit dem für den 1 . Juni 2006 angekündigten Release 6.06 sollen die Serverplattformen Itanium ( IA64 ) , Sparc und PA - RISC dazukommen .
Eine Besonderheit , konzeptuell bei Mac OS
X ausgeborgt , ist der deaktivierte root - Account : Der Anwender meldet sich grundsätzlich als normaler Benutzer an , die nötigen Rechte für Administrationsaufgaben verschafft man sich mit dem Befehl sudo .
Neue Ziele
Mit der für April 2006 geplanten Version 6.04 ( Dapper Drake ; nach einer Verschiebung des Veröffentlichungsdatums dürfte es wohl Version 6.06 werden ) will das Ubuntu - Team in neue Einsatzbereiche vorstoßen .
Bislang verstand sich Ubuntu vor allem als eine Distribution für private Linux - Anwender , jetzt will man die Unternehmen für den Einsatz von Ubuntu Linux gewinnen - auf dem Desktop wie auf dem Server .
Im Dezember letzten Jahres wurde ein Server - Team gegründet , das für die Berücksichtigung der Belange des Servereinsatzes bei der Entwicklung von Ubuntu sorgen soll .
Es arbeitet unter anderem an einer Testsuite , um die Kompatibilität von Serverhardware zu überprüfen , an einfachen Möglichkeiten zur Einbindung der Software von Drittherstellern und an Sicherheitsmechanismen .
Erste Erfolge in Richtung Server sind bereits zu verzeichnen : IBM hat Ubuntu 5.10 als " Ready for IBM DB2 Software for Linux " zertifiziert .
Vor allem an der Dauer des garantierten Supports macht sich die neue Professionalität fest : Ab Dapper Drake sollen die Desktop - Versionen für drei , die Server - Versionen für fünf Jahre gepflegt werden .
Details , welche Supportleistungen man zu welchen Konditionen erhalten kann , sind zwar noch nicht bekannt ; aber zumindest verspricht man kostenlose Bugfixes für drei beziehungsweise fünf Jahre .

Little shark helps pierce great white mystery MONTEREY , Calif . 
Let 's put a great white shark scientist on the spot .
Tell us how many great whites there are .
We do n't know .
Tell us about their breeding habits .
Pretty much a mystery .
How big do they get ?
Not sure .
How long do they live ?
Ditto .
The great white shark is one of the oceans ' greatest predators , an animal feared by man and fish alike , an object of public fascination even before that campy hit movie Jaws .
Yet only recently have we begun acquiring the skimpiest of knowledge about the species .
A little guy in a 1.3 - million - gallon tank here at Monterey Bay Aquarium is crucial to that effort .
An instant celebrity when he went on display Sept. 1 , already the second - longest great white shark to survive in captivity , the juvenile is doing more than drawing visitors to one of the world 's top aquariums .
SWIMMING WITH SHARKS : Keep track of sharks via this website Swimming with huge tunas , Pacific barracudas , a giant green sea turtle and other denizens of deep offshore waters , the shark is bringing in revenue that goes back into research .
He 's helping to educate the public about the plight of sharks — many species are depleted by overfishing — and he 's beefing up a growing body of work on white shark habits .
" There 's no doubt we 'll learn a lot about white shark behavior , biology and physiology from captive animals , " says Chris Lowe , a marine biology professor and director of SharkLab at California State University , Long Beach .
" But the biggest value is these little sharks are ambassadors .
The aquarium 's ability to keep them will be a key turning point in getting people to look at white sharks not just as a threat . "
Great whites are king of their natural environment but become delicate creatures when confined .
A few dozen attempts have been made since the 1950s .
None was successful until two years ago when the aquarium here kept a young female for 198 days , releasing it only after it killed two soupfin sharks in the big tank .
The aquarium 's first try , in 1984 , ended badly when a 5 - foot great white , caught by a fisherman in Bodega Bay north of here , refused to eat and died after 11 days .
In 2000 , curators decided to try again , but only after careful study of what would put a great white at ease .
By then other aquariums , including SeaWorld in San Diego , had learned that a great white needs a big space because it must swim constantly to breathe .
A tank had to have rounded sides , so a shark would n't bump into a corner and injure its nose .
Starting small
Tanks had to be cleared of pumps because electrical currents disorient sharks .
A key step , copied from a world - class facility in Okinawa that keeps whale sharks , was building a 4 - million - gallon pen in Monterey Bay outside the aquarium to mimic open - ocean conditions .
That provided a sea - to - tank transition where curators could observe a shark and make sure it was healthy and eating food they offered .
The aquarium sought small whites after early attempts with large ones failed at SeaWorld and San Francisco 's Steinhart Aquarium .
The new resident is 5 feet , 8 inches long , weighs 100 pounds and is about a year old .
" We 're not trying to display a large 18 - foot animal , " curator Jon Hoech says .
" We believe starting small gives us our best chances . "
The unnamed male appears to be as big a hit as his female predecessor .
She attracted 1 million visitors and $ 3 million in revenue during the winter 2004 - 05 tourist offseason .
The aquarium has spent nearly $ 4 million since 2000 on its white shark project ; $ 840,000 of that went back into field conservation research , spokesman Ken Peterson says .
The young male , a resident for 53 days as of today , has brought in 250,000 extra visitors .
The aquarium 's success has won over critics such the Pelagic Shark Research Foundation , a Santa Cruz , Calif. , group that opposes confining certain deep - ocean animals .
" Their program has evolved , " director Sean Van Sommeran says .
" We stick to our policy , but we 're supportive of the project , and it 's bringing in a lot of money that can be used on behalf of the shark . "
Visitors linger in front of the tank 's 15 - foot - tall , 13 - inch - thick acrylic viewing wall , startled by 500 - pound bluefin tuna but mostly waiting for the star to cruise by .
He 'll swim high and low , glide along the walls , keep to himself .
The big tuna ignore him , but a school of sardines stays out of his way .
Twice - daily feedings are a big draw .
From above , a worker lowers a pole and chunk of black cod , albacore tuna , salmon or other delicacy into the water .
Another handler shoos away other fish .
Soon the shark , as he would in the wild , moves swiftly up from below toward the food , grabs it in his jaws , pivots and swims away .
Most of what had been known about white sharks came from fishermen .
The sharks ' migratory movements were mysterious , though it was assumed they hung out mostly in coastal waters .
" We do n't even begin to understand how animals use the ' blue ' part of the planet , " says Barbara Block , a professor at Stanford University 's marine station here .
In recent years , a lot of effort went into tagging whites and tracking them by satellite .
Findings , still limited in scope , were surprising .
Whites had long been found in the Farallon Islands west of San Francisco , in the Marin Headlands to the north and at the rocky coastal point Año Nuevo to the south , gorging on seals and sea lions .
Tracking by satellite Whites also were known to be around Mexico's Guadalupe Island , on the Chilean coast , in Spencer Bay in southern Australia and off South Africa .
They like chilly waters associated with Mediterranean climates , says Peter Klimley , a marine biology professor at the University of California , Davis .
Satellite tracking showed adults traveling much farther : from coastal California to the Hawaiian Islands , from Northern California to Baja , from South Africa to Australia .
Scientists do n't know why .
Block says whites may swim to Hawaii in winter for its marine mammal buffet , including baby humpback whales .
" Are there populations at these places " so you can calculate a total , Klimley says , " or are they moving between these sites so there may be even fewer , which is perhaps the likely scenario ? "
A graduate student of Klimley 's is working on what 's hoped is the first reliable estimate of the global white shark population .
" There are n't going to be a lot of them , " Klimley says , because the top - of - the - food - chain predator reaches sexual maturity late in life and bears a single pup every other year .
One hypothesis is that no more than 5,000 exist , he says .
Knowing the population and whether it 's going up or down helps predict effects on other marine life , Klimley says .
If the white shark is depressing the seal population , that could increase the population of a fish humans eat .
Scientists were perplexed when tracking found white sharks going to a place about halfway between California and Hawaii .
It 's the ocean equivalent of a desert — no mountains , no valleys , no food , just an aquatic wasteland .
Yet the sharks were showing up .
Researchers called it the Shark Cafe .
At first they thought that if the cafe had nothing to do with food , it must be about reproduction .
" Adult males and females were showing up , so that would sound like sex , " Block says .
" But then young ones showed up , too , which makes everybody wonder what 's going on . "
Kevin Bachelor , 2 , leans against the glass as a juvenile white shark swims in the million gallonOuter Bay Exhibit at the Monterey Bay Aquarium .
The great white attracts big crowds to the aquarium .

I just finally got around to reading my June 2006 Communications of the ACM ( an academic computer journal ) and spotted a little news brief about Britannica trying to sue Nature magazine for this December 2005 Article that noted that the error rate in science entries of Wikipedia is comparable to that in Britannica .
Nature magazine is the premier peer - reviewed high - level publication for science in the world .
For an article to get into this journal , it has to be rigorously supported .
Their discussion of the controversy is here .
One point about the coverage I had n’t seen was the different natures of how the information was put together in each of these encyclopedias .
Britannica is Intelligently Designed .
For a dozen decades they hired the best and brightest crafters of techinical prose to cover all the subjects that the intelligent editors can think of as being worthwhile .
Yes , the design is always evolving .
But it is limited by the need to have a designer watching and controlling its growth and changes .
Wiki evolved from chaos .
It provided an environment , and anyone was invited to add and edit entries .
It covers millions of more subjects than Britannica can hope to .
It cross references virally , with apparently absurd links to subjects that someone thought were related , and often do turn out to be relevant .
People do go in and edit and even mark content to remove .
There is some oversight to prevent ideology from trumping understanding .
But basically , it is an example of pure evolution with no plan or guidance .
So my point is that over a hundred years of intelligent design has produced something that , in its limited intersecting subset , is slightly better than the half - decade of raw evolution produced .
Okay , the Britannica only consults experts , and Wiki entries are written by everyman .
But usually knowledgeable amateurs or even parties to the discoveries themselves .
It ’s only a century or so since that difference was moot .
Chas .
Darwin had a degree in Divinity .
R. Feynman made a study of the behavior of a Frisbee , and got a Nobel when he applied the math he worked out for flying disks to electron behavior .
Interested amateurs often become closet experts in fields for which they have no papers .
But , I digress .
So here I ’ll stop .
This article is an introduction to the principles of C++ library writing and templates .
It should be suitable for people at all levels of C++ experience .
Even if you 're an expert you may learn ( or re-learn ) something .
We want to cover :
Why we should n't use get and set in our accessor names .
How to write a class to implement the accessors so we do n't need to keep repeating ourselves .
How to use a template so that we can better control the underlying attribute type .
Finally , this is an introduction to these techniques .
At the level expressed in this article the usefulness is often limited .
However , when used for the sorts of things listed at the end of the article they can be a very useful and powerful .
In order to understand which attributes should have accessors and whether they should be read or write accessors read Encapsulation is a Good Thing™ .
A simple way to get started on the principles behind writing C++ libraries by seeing how to get rid of all of those accessor functions ; all to the tune of Video Killed the Radio Star .
One of the basic rules of encapsulation is that we should hide the implementation of our classes .
We define the interfaces and not the data structures so that we are free to alter our implementations without having to worry quite so much about how this will affect the client code .
This leads to a style of implementation where every attribute ends up with get and set accessor functions .
In turn this leads to classes that look a lot like this :
class GeoPosition { public : GeoPosition ( ) ; GeoPosition ( double lat , double lon ) ; double getLat ( ) const ; void setLat ( double newValue ) ; double getLon ( ) const ; void setLon ( double newValue ) ; private : double lat , lon ; } ;
I 'm sure that I do n't need to labour the point by showing the blindingly obvious implementation here .
Compare this with the following code :
class GeoPosition { public : GeoPosition ( ) ; GeoPosition ( double lat , double lon ) ; double lat , lon ; } ;
That 's a huge saving in the declaration alone .
The implementation has just shortened by no small order either .
The problem is that it breaks the encapsulation .
If we ever need to do anything more complex with the attribute we will have to re-write a lot of client code which is going to be very time consuming .
What sort of thing are we likely to want ?
The obvious thing is a range check .
Why the range check ?
Well , both latitudes and longitudes are constrained to a range of ± 180° .
This means that our accessors are n't quite as brain dead as we might first imagine .
The set members should really look something like this :
void GeoPosition :: setLat ( double nLat ) { if ( n Lat < - 180 . || n Lat >= 180 . ) throw std::out_of_range (
" New latitude is out of allowed range of +-180 degrees " ) ; lat = nLat ; }
Note that I 've followed the standard C++ convention of allowing the lower bound but excluding the upper bound .
The get is still fairly brain - dead though , looking like this :
double GeoPosition : : getLat ( ) const { return lat ; }
A slightly more idiomatic accessor
The first thing we 're going to do is to change the accessors so that they 're slightly more idiomatic .
Because we can overload the same name with different parameters in C++ we can just chop the get and set from the names .
This gives us a class that looks like this :
class GeoPosition { public : GeoPosition ( ) ; GeoPosition ( double lat , double lon ) ; double lat ( ) const ; void lat ( double newValue ) ; double lon ( ) const ; void lon( double newValue ) ; private : double m_lat , m_lon ; } ;
This means the we can now replace anything that looks like :
place.setLat( place.getLat( ) + 10 . ) ; return place.getLat ( ) ;
With this :
place.lat( place.lat ( ) + 10 . ) ; return place.lat ( ) ;
It may seem like a small matter , but again it saves us some typing .
More importantly it also gives us a lot more flexibility on how to implement the attribute which at the end of the day is one of the reasons for using encapsulation .
Even if you do n't read any further than this you should take away that in C++ you should never use get and set in accessor names because it limits what you can do later on .
What those things are is what the rest of this article is about .
Objects to the rescue
We found that we could get rid of the get and set parts of the names , but there 's still a lot of boring repetitive code to write .
Boring and repetitive tasks is one of the things that classes help us to deal with so maybe we can write a class to handle it all for us .
Let 's see what happens if we implement the attribute as a class .
class Latitude { public : Latitude ( ) ; Latitude ( double ) ; double get ( ) const { return m_lat ; } void set ( double nLat ) { if ( n Lat < - 180 .
|| n Lat >= 180 . ) throw std::out_of_range (
" New latitude is outside of allowed range of +-180 degrees " ) ; m_lat = nLat ; } private : double m_lat ; } ;
Hmmm …
What was I going to call the accessors ?
I can't leave them with no name so I 've brought back in get and set .
Not ideal .
It turns out that C++ provides us a way of not giving them a name at all .
We can actually overload the ( ) operator .
Now this sounds odd and in a way it is , but the reason that it 's there is for exactly this sort of eventuality .
We overload an operator by defining a method name of operator X where X is the operator .
For our purposes we want ( ) so this gives us operator ( ) .
Now watch carefully when we use it though .
The syntax is pretty obvious when you think about it , but looks really strange at first .
class Latitude { public : Latitude ( ) ; Latitude ( double ) ; double operator ( ) ( ) const { return m_lat ; } void operator ( ) ( double nLat ) { if ( n Lat < - 180 .
|| n Lat >= 180 . ) throw std::out_of_range (
" New latitude is outside of allowed range of +-180 degrees " ) ; m_lat = nLat ; } private : double m_lat ; } ;
If you think about you 'll see that the first ( ) is the operator name and the second set are for the operator 's parameters .
The first one of course does n't have any parameters and the second one takes a double .
Just to double underline this ( ahem ) , I 've written the members as prototypes with the accessor names in bold below :
double operator ( ) ( ) const ; void operator ( ) ( double nLat ) ;
The whole operator ( ) is the name of the function .
We can now use this in our first class like this :
class GeoPosition { public : GeoPosition ( ) ; GeoPosition ( double lat , double lon ) ; Latitude lat ; double lon ( ) const ; void lon( double newValue ) ; private : double m_lon ; } ;
Note that I 've only changed the latitude member so far .
To manipulate it we will have code that looks like this :
place.lat( place.lat ( ) + 10 . ) ; return place.lat ( ) ;
Notice that this looks exactly like the accessors we had earlier after we removed the get and set .
This is the first part of the reason why leaving the get and set out of accessor names is a pretty good idea .
It gives us the possibility of switching between writing accessor members in a class and using a seperate helper class to implement them .
We can imagine that we can of course do exactly the same thing with a class Longitude which would reduce the size of our class even more , but we do n't actually have to .
Looking at the class you can see that it does n't really need to be limited to latitude at all .
If we rename it we can use it for both :
class SphericalCoordinate { public : SphericalCoordinate ( ) ; SphericalCoordinate ( double ) ; double operator ( ) ( ) const { return m_coord ; } void operator ( ) ( double nCoord ) { if ( nCoord < - 180 .
|| nCoord >= 180. ) throw std::out_of_range (
" New co-ordinate value is outside of allowed range of +-180 degrees " ) ; m_coord = nCoord ; } private : double m_coord ; } ;
Just by renaming it we have something that is suitable for use as either latitude or longitude .
class GeoPosition { public : GeoPosition ( ) ; GeoPosition ( double lat , double lon ) ; SphericalCoordinate lat , lon ; } ;
This is clearly much better :
The class is shorter and much more clearly expresses our intent without any excessive verbosity .
Instead of writing two sets of accessors which are nearly identical we 've written one in a helper class .
We have two classes that do exactly half the job that one was doing .
This means that each class is smaller and easier to understand .
We 're still free to change the underlying implementation if we want to because we have n't changed the syntax used to access the latitude and longitude .
If you stop reading now you have a technique that you can use to help you write classes quicker and with less errors .
But we can do even better .
Then convert it to a template
What is a template and what is it meant to do for us ?
A template is a way to write a class so that we can configure some things that we would otherwise have to specify in our code .
What do we mean ?
In our class we 've decided that we want our co-ordinate to be stored as a double .
This is fine , but what if there are some places that we need to store the location as an int and other places where we need to store it as a double .
Do we need to write two versions of our class ?
Do we need a SphericalCoordinateInt and a SphericalCoordinateDouble ?
It 's exactly this that the templates do for us .
We can write the class without having to decide what type we use to store the actual co-ordinate .
The syntax is actually fairly straightforward .
To change the class into a template we simply tell it that it is going to be a template and tell it that we want to specify a type to use .
The first part of the class declaration changes to this :
template < typename t_coordinate > class SphericalCoordinate ...
Now we just need to replace the occurances of double with t_coordinate in our complete implementation :
template < typename t_coordinate > class SphericalCoordinate { public : SphericalCoordinate ( ) ; SphericalCoordinate ( t_coordinate ) ; t_coordinate operator ( ) ( ) const { return m_coord ; } void operator ( ) ( t_coordinate nCoord ) { if ( nCoord < - 180 .
|| nCoord >= 180. ) throw std::out_of_range (
" New co-ordinate value is outside of allowed range of +-180 degrees " ) ; m_coord = nCoord ; } private : t_coordinate m_coord ; } ;
In order to use it in our class we now have :
class GeoPosition { public : GeoPosition ( ) ; GeoPosition ( double lat , double lon ) ; SphericalCoordinate < double > lat , lon ; } ;
This now looks a little more complex , but actually it has one important benefit over the previous version — the precision of the latitude and longitude are now explicitly stated in our GeoPosition class and can just as easily be changed there .
This last point is more important than it at first seems .
When somebody else is going through this code the fact that the actual underlying type is in GeoPosition will make it easier for them to understand the class .
This means that although we have used much more complex techniques the code is actually easier to maintain .
And even better , because we 're not writing the same accessors time and again we have something that is much more likely to be correct .
Some final thoughts
I 'm going to just bullet these out .
There are some other considerations that you should be aware of , but nothing that should stop you from using the technique :
It is possible to templatise the range check , but not without using even more complex template syntax in the template implementation .
We 'll leave that for another day .

We 'll leave that for another day .
The set accessor ( the void operator ( ) ( t_coordinate ) in our case ) at the moment does n't return anything .
There is a good argument that it should return the new value ( or even the old value ) .
This depends on the context that it is being used in though .
If you suspect that there is any chance of confusion between the return value being the old or the new one then do n't do it .
The principle of least surprise would to me intimate that it should return the new value , but what one person finds surprising is often very different to what another finds surprising .

The would to me intimate that it should return the new value , but what one person finds surprising is often very different to what another finds surprising .
You may be wondering why we do n't just use some of the other operators ( assignment and casts ) in order to make the template bahave exactly like the plain data type .
The reason here is that it changes the syntax and means that if we ever need to go back to using accessor functions then we have to re-write all the client code again .
A laborious task .
There is one aspect of encapsulation that this technique does n't help with .
If you retain the accessors as members of the original class then it is possible to update the accessor without forcing a recompile .
I do n't worry too much about this as in practice it 's pretty rare not to have to recompile .
Obviously there will be some situations where this may be more important .
Because our template class members are inline there is no run-time overhead for using the technique .
In fact , it is possible that if the compiler inlines the accessors properly it may even be faster than the original accessors .
than the original accessors .
The templates that you use can be extended to handle other common idioms and patterns .
For example : Managing strings by enforcing maximum lengths , and range enforcement for any other data type .
Generation of SQL for UPDATE or INSERT statements or even WHERE clauses ( for example adding single quotes where appropriate ) .
Converting to and from COM types ( for example to and from BSTR or VARIANT ) .
Memoization ( or caching of complex results ) .
Conclusions
We 've seen what we should call accessors and why .
We 've also seen that we can use helper classes to implement the attributes which reduces the amount of code we need to write which is good for all sorts of reasons .
We 've also seen that we can use some simple template syntax to start us to get used to them and to put control of the types closest to where they 're needed .
As ever there is an interesting discussion on Reddit .

Mathematical Proofs Set to Music
Is it " music " ?
I guess that 's for you to decide .
It is richly structured , with underlying themes that on the one hand seem to repeat but on the other hand are interestingly unpredictable , teasing your mind as the piece progresses .
For these MIDI files , make sure your media player is set to a " piano " sound and not an " electronic organ " sound , otherwise it will sound horrible , because the sustained notes need to decay automatically .
For example , I had to select Yamaha OPL3 - SA SoftSynth from Devices / Properties in Microsoft Media Player on a Windows 95 computer I tried .
More recent computers seem to default to the piano sound .
If you are using QuickTime , it has a bug that sometimes causes a burst of loud , annoying static at the beginning of a piece ; you can work around this bug by changing the MIDI settings [ retrieved 3 - Feb - 2017 from archive.org ] .
I set the tempo quite fast , partly to help you decide more quickly whether it interests you .
( The tempo can be slowed down by rerunning the program that generated these . )
I chose to give the selections a " syncopated " character by substituting a repeated note with a silent pause , since to me it usually sounded a little better .
The frenetic non-syncopated version can be interesting too , with one note for every proof step .
Sometimes , syncopation has only a small effect , as in the case of the Second Peano Postulate 0:16 .
Other times the effect is significant ; compare the syncopated 1:49 and non-syncopated 1:49 versions of the Triangle Inequality ( and also another version ) .
Another curious piece with a pronounced syncopated effect is the Square Root Theorem 0:41 .
In deeper proofs , a kind of tension sometimes builds up , with occasional partial relief but growing overall , until finally many subproofs come together .
For example , you may want to sample the Axiom of Choice Equivalent 3:51 , where a crescendo slowly builds up starting at around 2:20 minutes , reaching a dramatic climax at 3:11 minutes and then suddenly cascading down to the main theme .
Another frenzied , climactic piece is Zermelo 's Well - Ordering Theorem 0:50 .
The Schröder - Bernstein Theorem 1:47 ( I like this one ) changes its theme during its course , starting off with a ominous staccato then breaking out into a colorful display of notes .
The music generated from these mathematical proofs stands in sharp contrast to certain other experimental music based on such mathematics as the digits of π ( pi ) .
Unlike a proof 's tree structure , which is inherently suggestive of a musical score , the digits of π have no obvious pattern .
To make it interesting , a human composer will often add a non-mathematical creative element such as an underlying beat with pre-selected chords and instrumentation .
What one hears , then , might be based as much on the originality of the composer as on the essential nature of π : the same algorithm applied to the digits of say e ( Euler 's constant ) , or even a series of random digits , would typically sound about the same after the first few notes .
The music here , on the other hand , is a raw and unadorned representation of the mathematics itself , involving few human preconceptions beyond a basic mapping needed to accommodate the Western tonal scale .
Music Sampler
The theorems below are from ( the August 2000 version of ) the Theorem Sampler on the Metamath Proof Explorer Home Page .
Click on a theorem name to see its proof , and click on the musical note to hear it set to music .
The music is faithful to the original proofs .
For example , the five sustained ( lower ) notes you will hear in the Law of Identity match , in order , the five steps of its proof , while the faster notes represent the construction of the formulas used in those steps .
Each of the above proofs is actually just the highest level of each theorem 's proof , where typically several other theorems are pieced together to obtain the final result .
In fact the Metamath database has over 7,000 other proofs - who knows what they sound like !
Music Visualization
1:47
What does this mean ?
I 'm not sure , other than that it says something about the complexity of the music structure .
But it looks neat .

Extract the file t2 mf.exe ( a program that converts a text file to a MIDI file ) from mf2t.zip , which you can download from http://www.hitsquad.com/smm/programs/mf2t/download.shtml [ retrieved 3 - Feb - 2017 ] .
( You can also download and unzip mf2t.zip .
The t2 mf.exe file is located in the folder mf2t\mf2t- original\mf2t\ . )
Step 2 . Extract the files metamath.exe ( the Metamath program ) and set.mm ( the Metamath set theory database ) from metamath.zip , which is the Metamath Program download .
Step 3 .
Put the three files metamath.exe , set.mm and t2 mf.exe into a new directory ( folder ) .
Step 4 . Browse through the Metamath Proof Explorer proof pages to find a proof you want to listen to .
For this example , we 'll suppose you want to listen to the Schröder - Bernstein Theorem , whose proof page is sbth.html .
The name " sbth " is the name of the theorem that you will give to the program .
Step 5 .
Let 's say you called your new directory C:\metamidi in Step 3 .
To create the MIDI file for theorem sbth , open an MS - DOS or Command Prompt window ( Start -> Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt , or Start -> Run -> command , or Start -> Run -> cmd ) and type :
C:\WINDOWS >cd \ metamidi C:\metamidi>metamath set.mm MM > midi sbth / parameter " fsh " Creating MIDI source file " sbth.txt " ... length = 107 sec MM > exit C:\metamidi > t2 mf sbth.txt sbth.mid
1:47
sbth.mid
The parameter argument is specified by a combination of the following letters , with no spaces separating them :
f = make the tempo fast ( default is slow ) .
= make the tempo fast ( default is slow ) .
m = make the tempo medium ( default is slow ) .
Both " f " and " m " should not be specified simultaneously .
= make the tempo medium ( default is slow ) .
Both " " and " " should not be specified simultaneously .
s = syncopate the melody by silencing repeated notes , using a method selected by whether the " h " parameter below is also present ( default is no syncopation ) .
= syncopate the melody by silencing repeated notes , using a method selected by whether the " " parameter below is also present ( default is no syncopation ) .
h = allow syncopation to hesitate i.e. all notes in a sequence of repeated notes are silenced except the first ( default is no hesitation , which means that every other note in a repeated sequence is silenced - this makes it sound slightly more rhythmic ) .
The " h " parameter is meaningful only if the " s " parameter above is also present .
= allow syncopation to hesitate i.e. all notes in a sequence of repeated notes are silenced except the first ( default is no hesitation , which means that every other note in a repeated sequence is silenced - this makes it sound slightly more rhythmic ) .
The " " parameter is meaningful only if the " " parameter above is also present .
w = use only the white keys on the piano keyboard ( default is potentially to use all keys ) .
= use only the white keys on the piano keyboard ( default is potentially to use all keys ) .
b = use only the black keys on the piano keyboard ( default is all keys ) .
Both " w " and " b " should not be specified simultaneously .
= use only the black keys on the piano keyboard ( default is all keys ) .
Both " " and " " should not be specified simultaneously .
i = use an increment of one keyboard note per proof indentation level .
The default is to use an automatic increment of up to four notes per level based on the dynamic range of the whole song .
( An increment of " one keyboard note " means adjacent keys by default , successive black keys if " b " was selected , and successive white keys if " w " was selected . )
midi sbth
midi sbth / parameter " fsh "
You can see what theorems are available by typing " show labels " .
In general you can use " help " to guide you , including " help midi " .
Tip : The " midi " command in Metamath will not destroy existing files , but will rename an existing one with ~ 1 appended ( for example , an older sbth .
txt would be renamed sbth . txt ~1 ) , an existing ~ 1 to ~ 2 , etc. up to ~ 9 .
( An existing ~9 is deleted . )
This makes it safer to use but also will clutter up your directory , so you may want to clean them out occasionally .
Tip :
There is a problem with t2 mf.exe : it can only handle Microsoft 's 8.3 file format ( 8 - character file name , period , and 3 - character extension ) .
It will complain if you ask it to convert pm2.11. txt because a file name can't have 2 periods , so you have to use the " real " Microsoft file name such as PM211~ 1.TXT which you can see with the MS - DOS DIR command ( or DIR / X in the Windows XP Command Prompt ) .
Alternately you could rename the file to , say , pm2_11.txt before running t2 mf.exe .
I am not the author of t2 mf.exe and unfortunately have no other solution at this point .
MacOSX :
In 2006 , Luca Ciciriello modified the program to run on MacOSX .
Download and unzip mf2t.zip .
The files are located in mf2t / mf2t- Mac / .
I have not tested it personally .
For Unix / Linux :
The t2mf program was written in 1991 , before C was standardized by ANSI , and it will not compile on modern compilers .
However , if you wish to attempt to convert it to modern C , download and unzip mf2t.zip .
The source files are located in mf2t / mf2t-original / mf2tsrc / , which includes the sources for t2 mf .
You may also wish to consult the sources for Luca Ciciriello 's Mac upgrade , located in mf2t/mf2t-Mac/Midi_MacOSX_Xcode/Midi_MacOSX_Xcode/midisrc/t2mf/.
If you are successful , let me know and I will add it to the mf2t.zip download .
Note that the authors Tim Thompson ( original author ) and M. Czeiszperger agreed to place their code in the public domain , but I was unable to contact Piet van Oostrum who made some additional modifications to the code .
For Unix / Linux and MacOSX :
Assuming you have successfully compiled t2 mf , next download the file metamath.tar.gz .
Type :
$ tar - xzf metamath.tar.gz
This will create a directory called " metamath " .
To compile the program with gcc , type
$ cd metamath $ gcc m*.c -o metamath
t2mf
$ ./metamath MM > read " set.mm " MM > midi sbth / parameter " fsh " Creating MIDI source file " sbth.txt " ... length = 107 sec MM > exit $ t2 mf sbth.
txt sbth.mid
See the notes above for Windows for information on the parameters .

Reading down , you can see the indentation levels ( each level indents 2 more spaces ) are successively
2,3,3,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,3 , ...
We want to fit the proof within a desirable maximum dynamic range of note frequencies , which I defined as 27 < n < 104 , where n is the midi note number .
We obtain an the largest possible integer " scale factor " , with a maximum of 4 , that allows the music to fit in the dynamic range .
For the id1 proof , the scale factor will be 4 .
We also compute a " baseline " note which allows the proof to fit in the dynamic range .
For the id1 proof , the baseline is 61 .
We multiply the indentation level by the scale factor 4 and add it to the baseline .
In addition , whenever we encounter a " logical " ( real ) proof step ( as opposed to a formula - building proof step ) , identified by a |- in the proof listing , we shift the note down by 12 ( one octave ) and sustain it rather than turning it on and off .
So in this example the midi note numbers will be be
69,73,73,69,65,69,73,65,69,69,53,73 ...
where 53 = 65 - 12 is the shifted note of step 11 , which you can see has a |- in it in the proof listing .
Finally , if syncopation is selected , which was the case for all the selections on this page , repeated notes are replaced with silence .
( The sustained notes are not syncopated . )
So what we hear through step 12 above is
69,73,-,69,65,69,-,65,69,-,53,73 , ...
where the 53 is the first sustained note .
Now , listen carefully to the Law of Identity 0:05 , and you will hear that the first 12 notes and pauses match exactly the above sequence .
Experimenting With the Algorithm
" Kind of amusing in that the entire output of these pages proves a theorem of its own : that not all mathematicians make good music ( take THAT , Douglas Hofstadter ! ) .
Mis -step one was to program using only equal distances between pitches ( MIDI note numbers ) , resulting in endless whole - tone melodies . " — musician Tom Djll [ external ]
1:49
To modify the algorithm , download the Metamath program , which includes the source code .
In the file mmcmds.c , at the very end you will find the function outputMidi ( ) which generates the MIDI file .
I put in a lot of comments , so hopefully you wo n't find it too hard to follow what it does .
I recommend confining any experiments to this function , which gives you access to everything you should need .
Let me know if there is something you do n't understand .
Tip :
In Metamath program download , the C programs are stored in Unix ASCII format with no carriage - return at the end of lines .
If you are using Windows , see the note on text files at the end of the download help section .
The user parameter from the " / parameter " argument in the Metamath " midi " command is just an arbitrary string that is not syntax - checked , and you can use it to put in your own parameters to experiment with .
To compile the program , you need an ANSI C compiler such as gcc , which is built into Linux and available free for Windows as part of Cygwin [ external ] .
Assuming you have only the Metamath source files in your directory , you type in the Cygwin or Linux shell
gcc m*.c -o metamath.exe
.exe

Jennifer Lopez has denied she is pregnant .
The ' Maid In Manhattan ' actress revealed she has been trying for a baby for months but has so far been unsuccessful .
Speaking at the Women In Film Crystal Awards she joked : " The rumours about me being pregnant are always strong and always wrong !
" Lopez , who is married to Latin star Marc Anthony , also admitted she is having second thoughts about playing the role of Sue Ellen in the film adaptation of hit US series ' Dallas ' .
The star revealed she had spoken to John Travolta - who is rumoured to be playing her on - screen husband JR Ewing - regarding her doubts about the movie .
She said : " He asked me if I was going to take the role of Sue Ellen and I said ' I think so .

THE members of the swim team at Bloomington High School South in central Indiana cheer wildly every time Nathan Buffie races .
In his two years on the team , Nathan has never won first place at a meet .
Often , he finishes far behind .
But it is the fact that Nathan even goes into the water and manages to compete at all that his teammates find so remarkable .
Nathan , a trim 16 - year - old with a boyish smile , has autism , the devastating developmental disorder that makes his participation in any sport or social activity a struggle .
“ He is probably the worst swimmer on the team , but he keeps getting better and he wants to win , ” said his mother , Penny Githens .
“ He tells his teammates this , and they just get so excited for him . ”
For years , children with autism were left on the sidelines , a consequence of a widespread belief that they were incapable of participation in athletics .
But while it is true that autistic children can be difficult to motivate and resistant to exercise , they are now being pushed to take part in physical education programs , encouraged by experts who say that certain sports can ease repetitive behaviors like pacing and head - banging as well as provide a social outlet .

ただただしさんのおれだったらフォト蔵APIをこうするを読んで、僕が del.icio.us に書いた感想は
+1。ID == URI ですよね 。Cool URI は名詞であるべき、というのは強調したい。 「 日本REST 協会」入りたくないなー(笑) 。みんな休んでそう
というもの。たださんのエントリでは URI と書くべきところが ID になっててちょっと気になったり、「作法 」 は「アーキテクチャ」じゃなくて「アーキテクチャスタイル」だ、とか思ったのだけれど、でも本筋としては納得の内容だった。
しかし、たださんのエントリの、たかはしさんや mizzy さんのコメントを読んでうーんと唸ってしまった。
僕にはお二人の言いたいことがわかる。んで両方間違っていないと思う。
たとえばたかはしさんの言うとおり、RoyF の元論文では GET / POST / PUT / DELETE
を使えなんて一言も書いてないわけで。そうじゃなくて単に
Uniform Interface が重要だよ、というだけの話 。
でも今回のフォト蔵 API に関して言えば 、Uniform Interface の間違った使い方をしちゃっているので、ちゃんと RESTful に設計するな ら
HTTP の GET / POST / PUT / DELETE
をたださんが指摘したように使うのがまっとうな方法だとも思う。
mizzy さんのコメントの最 後
ここでたださんが言っているRESTというのは、正確には「RESTアーキテクチャスタイルのアーキテクチャであるHTTPを利用したAPI」のことだと思われますので、アーキテクチャの話に絞って問題ないかと思います。
というのは重要で、問題の根源はここにある気がする。異なる次元の別の話(アーキテクチャスタイルの話、HTTP
の話、Web API 設計の話 ) が全部 REST という名前の下で行われていうので、混乱してしまう。これは僕にも一因があって、これまでのこの blog のエントリでも上記をごっちゃで使ってしまっている 。
言葉を正確に使おうとすると非常にメンドウなので、僕自身の文章力ではなんともならないのだけれど、ここではせめてそれぞれの次元がどう違うのかを下記に列挙しておきたい。
REST アーキテクチャスタイル RoyF の元論文に基くアーキテクチャスタイルについての議論。 ここでは HTTP のメソッドがどうしたという話は原則関係ない。 REST アーキテクチャスタイルを基にし た
Web アプリのアーキテクチャを設計する段で、 たとえば GET / POST / PUT / DELETE を使うのがいいのか、 GET と POST だけを使えばいいのか、という議論もありえる。 このレベルの話を、下記の偶然 REST っぽい Web API に適用してもあまり意味がない。 プログラミング初心者にいきなり最先端のデザインパターンの話を聞かせるようなもの。 偶然 REST っぽい Web API いわゆる XML を HTTP でやりとりしますよ的な API を REST API と呼んでいるケース。 この場合の REST という 言葉は非常に矮小化されてしまっていて、 僕としてはこれは POX over HTTP と呼びたい。 個人的には正直あんまり興味なし。 Restful Web サービス RoyF の論文はそこらの×× な( 自己規制 ) 博士論文の1万倍凄いんだが、 それでもやっぱり脇が甘いところもあるし古くなっちゃってるところもある。
それに REST アーキテクチャスタイルを実装( アーキテクチャ ) に落そうとすると とたんに色々な問題が出てきて、そう単純な話では済まないのも事実。
一方 で2000 年以降、このような設計・実装の議論はずっとされてきて、進化してる。 実際にいろいろな試みがなされていて 、Paul Prescod の経験則とか Mark Baker の蘊蓄とか、すごく蓄積されている。 たとえば POST は新規作成とか URI は名詞でとかいう話はより実装に近い話。 APP ( AtomPP ) はここでの重要な成果の一つ。 その他にも REST にまつわる現在進行形の議論はたくさんあって、 たとえ ば OOP と REST とか SOA / WS -* と REST とか Ajax と REST とか XML vs YAML vs JSON とか階層化ファイルシステムと単一階層モデルとか microformats と REST とか。まさ に
Web 2.0 が表現するアルファギークの気分の中でフワフワ浮いているような話題なんだけれど、この話題、まだ体系的に言語化/文書化されてないので
現在進行形の文脈を共有している人とじゃないと議論できない。 僕が今一番興味があるのはここ。
実は今 REST の入門記事を某誌向けに書いているんだけど、 この原稿でも上記の次元の異る REST が無意識にまざってしまっていて、 困ったなあと思っていたりする。締切も近いしどうするかなあ。

A Plan for Pugs
Autrijus Tang is a talented Perl hacker , a dedicated CPAN contributor , and a truly smart man .
His announcement of starting an implementation of Perl 6 in Haskell on February 1 , 2005 might have seemed like a joke from almost anyone else .
A month later , his little experiment runs more code and has attracted a community larger than anyone could have predicted .
Perl.com recently caught up with Autrijus on # Perl6 to discuss his new project : Pugs .
chromatic : I ’ve followed your journal from the beginning , but it did n’t start from the start .
Where did you come up with this crazy idea ?
Autrijus : Ok .
The story is that I hacked SVK for many months with clkao .
SVK worked , except it is not very flexible .
There is a VCS named darcs , which is much more flexible , but is specced using quantum physics language and written in a scary language called Haskell .
So , I spent one month doing nothing but learning Haskell , so I could understand darcs .
Which worked well ; I convinced a crazy client ( who paid me to develop Parse : : AFP ) that Perl 5 is doomed because it has no COW ( which , surprisingly , it now has ) , and to fund me to develop an alternate library using Haskell .
( I mean “ Perl 5 is doomed for that task ” , not “ Perl 5 is doomed in general ” . )
chromatic : Copy - on - Write ?
Autrijus : Yeah .
chromatic :
So that ’s a “ sort - of has ” .
Autrijus : Yeah .
As in , sky suddenly worked on it and claims it mostly works .
Have n’t checked the code , though .
chromatic :
It ’s been in the works for years .
Or “ does n’t works ” perhaps .
Autrijus : But I digress .
Using Haskell to develop OpenAFP.hs led to programs that eat constant 2 MB memory , scale linearly , and are generally 2OOM faster than my Perl library .
Oh , and the code size is 1 ⁄ 10 .
chromatic : Okay , so you picked up Haskell to look at darcs to borrow ideas from for svk , then you convinced a client to pay you to write in Haskell and you started to like it .
What type of program was this ?
It sounds like it had a bit of parsing .
Autrijus : AFP is IBM ’s PDF - like format , born 7 years before PDF .
It ’s unlike PDF in that it ’s all binary , very bitpacked , and is generally intolerant of errors .
There was no free library that parses or munges AFP .
chromatic : Darcs really impressed you then .
Autrijus :
The algorithm did .
The day - to - day slowness and fragility for anything beyond mid-sized projects did not .
But darcs is improving .
But yeah , I was impressed by the conciseness .
chromatic :
Is that the implementation of darcs you consider slow or the use of Haskell ?
Autrijus : The implementation .
It basically caches no info and recalculates all unnecessary information .
Ca n’t be fast that way .
chromatic :
Hm , it seems like memoization is something you can add to a functional program for free , almost .
Autrijus : Yeah , and there are people working on that .
chromatic :
But not you , which is good for us Perl people .
Autrijus : Not me .
Sorry .
Anyway .
So , I ordered a bunch of books online including TaPL and ATTaPL so I could learn more about mysterious things like Category Theory and Type Inference and Curry - Howard Correspondence .
chromatic :
How far did you get ?
Autrijus : I think I have a pretty solid idea of the basics now , thanks to my math - minded brother Bestian , but TaPL is a very information - rich book .
chromatic : Me , I ’m happy just to recognize Haskell Curry ’s name .
Autrijus : I read the first two chapters at a relaxed pace .
By the end of second chapter it starts to implement languages for real and usually by that time , the profs using TaPL as textbook will tell the students to pick a toy language to implement .
chromatic : I have n’t seen you pop up much in Perl 6 land though .
You seemed amazingly productive in the Perl 5 world .
Where ’d Perl 6 come in ?
Autrijus :
As an exercise .
I started using Perl 6 as the exercise .
I think that answers the first question .
Oh. p6 land .
chromatic :
More of a playground than a full land , but we have a big pit full of colorful plastic balls .
Autrijus : Yeah , I was not in p6l , p6 i or p6 c .
However , the weekly summary really helped .
Well , because I keep hitting the limit of p5 .
chromatic :
It seems like an odd fit , putting a language with a good static type system to use with a language with a loose , mostly - optional type system though .
Autrijus :
Most of more useful modules under my name , ( including the ones Ingy and I inherited from Damian ) were forced to be done in klugy ways because the p5 runtime is a mess .
chromatic :
You should see Attributes : : Scary .
Total sympathy here .
Autrijus : Template :: Extract uses ( ?{} ) as a nondet engine ; PAR comes with its own perlmain . c ; let me not mention source filtering .
All these techniques are unmaintainable unless with large dosage of caffeine .
chromatic : Yeah , I fixed some of the startup warnings in B:: Generate a couple of weeks ago …
Autrijus : Cool .
Yeah , B:: Generate is abstracted klugery and may pave a way for Pugs to produce Perl 5 code .
chromatic : Parrot has the chance to make some of these things a lot nicer .
I ’m looking forward to that .
Yet you took off down another road .
Autrijus : Actually , I think Pugs and Parrot will meet in the middle .
Where Pugs AST meets Parrot AST and the compiler is written in Perl 6 that can then be run on Parrot .
chromatic : I thought Pugs would get rewritten in C for Parrot ?
Autrijus : No , in Perl 6 .
chromatic : Can GHC retarget a different AST then ?
Autrijus :
It can , but that ’s not the easier plan .
chromatic :
It ’s easy for me .
I do n’t plan to do it .
Autrijus :
The easier plan is simply for Pugs to have a Compile.hs that emits Parrot AST .
Which , I ’m happy to discover yesterday , is painless to write .
( Ingy and I did a KwidAST -> HtmlAST compiler in an hour , together with parser and AST . )
chromatic : Kwid and HTML , the markup languages ?
Autrijus : Yeah .
Ok .
So back to p6 .
P5 ’s limit is apparent and not easily fixable
chromatic :
It sounds like you wanted something more , and soon .
Autrijus : Parrot is fine except every time I build it , it fails .
chromatic : Try running Linux PPC sometime .
Autrijus : Freebsd may not be a good platform for Parrot , I gathered .
Or my CVS luck is really bad .
But I ’m talking about several months ago .
chromatic : 4.x or 5.x ?
Autrijus : 5.x .
chromatic : Ahh , perhaps it was ICU .
Autrijus :
Two out of three times is .
I think .
chromatic : I guess it ’s too late to interest you in a Ponie then .
Autrijus : I was very interested in Ponie .
I volunteered to Sky about doing svn and src org and stuff , but svn was not kind for Ponie .
obra : Well , that was before svn 1.0
Autrijus : Right .
Now it all works just fine , except libsvn_wc , but we have svk now , and I learned that Sky has been addicted to svk .
But anyway .
And the beginning stage of Ponie is XS hackery which is by far not my forte .
I ’ve read Lathos ’ book , so I can do XS hackery when forced to but not on a volunteer basis .
Oh no .
chromatic :
That ’s a special kind of pain .
It ’s like doing magic tricks , blindfolded , when you have to say , “ Watch me push and pop a rabbit out of this stack .
By the way , do n’t make a reference to him yet … . ”
Autrijus : So , on February 1 , when I had too much caffeine and could n’t sleep , I did n’t imagine that Pugs would be anything near a complete implementation of Perl 6 .
I was just interested in modeling junctions but things quickly went out of control .
And some other nifty things like subroutine signatures .
chromatic :
There ’s a fuzzy connection in the back of my head about Haskell ’s inferencing and pattern matching being somewhat similar .
Autrijus : Sure .
Haskell has very robust inferencing , pattern matching , and sexy types .
Which I ’m trying to inflict on luqui to improve Perl 6 ’s design .
chromatic :
As long as they do the right thing with regard to roles , go ahead .
Autrijus :
They do . :)
chromatic :
This was an academic exercise though ?
Autrijus : Yeah .
It stayed as an academic exercise I think for two days .
chromatic : “ Hey , this Perl 6 idea is interesting .
I wonder how it works in practice ?
I bet I could do it in Haskell ! ”
Autrijus : Yup .
Using it as nothing more than a toy language to experiment with , iitially targeting a reduced set of Perl 6 that is purely functional .
But by day three , I found that doing this is much easier than I thought .
chromatic : Did you say “ highly reduced ” ?
Autrijus : Yeah .
Term is “ featherweight ” .
chromatic :
What makes it easier ?
Autrijus : Parsec and ContT. Parsec is like Perl 6 rules .
chromatic : Parsec ’s the most popular Haskell parsing library , right ?
Autrijus : Well , Parsec and Happy .
Happy is more traditional ; you write in a yacc - like grammar thing and it generates a parser in Haskell for you .
Parsec is pure Haskell .
You just write Haskell code that defines a parser .
The term is “ parser combinator ” .
chromatic : Haskell is its own mini-language there .
Autrijus :
It ’s a popular approach , yes .
When you see “ blah combinator library ” , think “ blah mini- language ” .
chromatic : I looked at the parser .
It ’s surprisingly short .
Autrijus :
And yet quite complete .
Very maintainable , too .
chromatic : Now I ’ve also read the Perl 5 parser , in the sense that I picked out language constructs that I recognized by name .
Is it a combination parser / lexer , or how does that work ?
That ’s the tricky bit of Perl 5 , in that lexing depends on the tokens seen and lots of context .
Autrijus : Yup .
It does lexing and parsing in one pass , with infinite lookahead and backtracking .
Each lexeme can define a new parser that works on the next lexeme .
chromatic :
Does that limit what it can do ?
Is that why it ’s purely functional Perl 6 so far ?
Autrijus :
The purely functional Perl 6 plan stops at day 3 .
We are now fully IO .
Started with say ( ) , and mutable variables , and return ( ) , and &?
CALLER_CONTINUATION
.
So there ’s nothing functional about the Perl 6 that Pugs targets now :) .
chromatic : Does Haskell support continuations and all of those funky things ?
Autrijus : Yes .
And you can pick and match the funky things you want for a scope of your code .
“ In this lexical scope I want continuations ” ; dynamic scope , really .
“ In that scope I want a logger . ” “ In that scope I want a pad . ”
chromatic : Performance penalty ?
Autrijus : Each comes with its own penalty , but is generally small .
GHC , again , compiles to very fast C code .
chromatic : Can you instrument scopes at runtime too ?
Autrijus : Sure . &?
CALLER ::SUB works .
And $ OUTER ::var .
chromatic :
Are you compiling it to native code now ?
I remember that being a suggestion a few days ago .
Autrijus :
Pugs itself is compiled to native code ; it is still evaluating Perl 6 AST , though .
chromatic :
It ’s like Perl 5 in that sense then .
Autrijus : Yes , it ’s exactly like Perl 5 .
Have you read PA01 ?
chromatic : I have .
Autrijus : Cool .
So yeah , it ’s like Perl 5 now .
The difference is B ::* is trivial to write in Pugs
chromatic : Except maintainable .
Autrijus :
And yeah , there ’s the maintainable bit .
Pugs is < 4 k lines of code .
I think porting Pugs to Perl 6 will take about the same number of lines , too .
chromatic :
You already have one module , too .
Autrijus : Yup .
And it ’s your favorite module .
chromatic : I ’ve started a few attempts to write Test : : Builder in Parrot , but I ’m missing a few pieces .
How far along are classes and objects in Pugs ?
Autrijus :
They do n’t exist .
6.2.x will do that , though .
But the short term task is to get all the todo_ ( ) cleaned .
which will give us an interpreter that really agrees with all synopses .
At least in the places we have implementation of , that is .
chromatic : I see in the dailies that you are producing boatloads of runnable Perl 6 tests .
Autrijus : Yup , thanks to # Perl6 .
I seldom write tests now :)
The helpful committers do that for me .
chromatic :
How do you know your code works then ?
Autrijus : I just look at newest todo_ and start working on it .
chromatic :
Oh , they write tests for those before you implement them ?
Autrijus : Yup .
It ’s all test - first .
chromatic : Okay , I ’ll let you continue then .
Autrijus : Ha .
So yeah , the cooperation has been wonderful .
Camelfolks write tests and libraries , and lambdafolks makes those tests pass .
If a camelfolk wants a particular test to pass sooner , then that person can learn from lambdafolk :) .
Things are easy to fix , and because of the coverage there ’s little chance of breaking things .
If lambdafolks want to implement new things that may or may not agree with synopses or p5 norm , then they learn from camelfolks .
chromatic : Have you started giving Haskell tutorials ?
I know Larry and Patrick have started to pick up some of it .
I ’m pretty sure Luke and Damian have already explored it ( or something from the same family tree ) .
Autrijus : I think I ’ve read a paper from Damian that says he taught Haskell in monash .
It ’s before the monadic revolution though .
chromatic :
If not Haskell , certainly something from the ML family .
Autrijus : Right .
So , I ’ve been pointing people to YAHT and # Haskell .
chromatic :
It sounds like you ’re attracting people from both sides of the fence then .
Autrijus :
It indeed is .
I get svn /svk patches and darcs patches .
chromatic :
Is there a lot of overlapping interest ?
Where does it come from ?
Autrijus :
Well , ever since the monadic revolution of ‘ 98 Haskell people have started to do real world apps .
chromatic :
Now that they can do IO , for example .
Autrijus : Yeah .
It ’s been only 7 years ago .
And recently Haskell world has its native version control system ; a Perl - review like magazine , cpan / makemaker - like infrastructure , etc .
So it ’s growing fast .
chromatic :
There ’s still a lot of attraction there for real world applications , of which Pugs is one ?
Autrijus : Pugs is a practical project in that working on it has a chance of solving real problems , and is very fun to boot .
And although p5 got no respect , in general p6 is very slick .
So the mental barrier is lower for lambdafolks to join , I think .
chromatic :
The lambdafolks like what they see in Perl 6 ?
Autrijus : Yup .
I quoted Abigail on # Haskell a while ago .
chromatic : I saw something earlier about access to libraries and such .
Do you have a plan for the XS - alternative ?
Autrijus : Yeah ,
Ingy is working on it ext / Kwid/ eventually inline Haskell code .
And with luck , inline other kinds of code as well through Haskelldirect ( the Haskell equiv of Inline ) .
chromatic :
Is this within Pugs or Perl 6 atop Pugs ?
Autrijus :
It ’s within Pugs .
The Parrot side had not been well - discussed .
chromatic : Yeah , the Parrot AST needs more documentation .
You ’re devoting a lot of time to it .
Obra mentioned that you ’ve cleared most of your paying projects out of the way for the time being .
What ’s the eventual end ?
Autrijus :
And whither then ?
I cannot say :) .
As you mentioned , I ’ve diverted most of my paying projects away so I should have at least 6 months for Pugs .
chromatic :
How about in the next month ?
Autrijus :
This month should see robust semantics for basic operations , the beginning of classes and objects , and many real modules hooks to Haskell - side libraries .
chromatic : I ’ll do T : : B then .
Autrijus : Oh and Pugs hands out committer bit liberally so if you want to do T::B , I ’ll make you a committer :) .
You can start now actually .
Just write imaginary Perl 6 code , and we ’ll figure out how to make it run .
Most of the examples /* started that way .
chromatic :
Ah , I ’ll take a look .
Autrijus : Oh .
Right .
I was quoting Abigail .
“ Programming in Perl 5 is like exploring a large medieval castle , surrounded by a dark , mysterious forest , with something new and unexpected around each corner .
There are dragons to be conquered , maidens to be rescued , and holy grails to be quested for .
Lots of fun . ”
“ Perl 6 looks like a Louis - XVI castle and garden to me .
Straight , symmetric , and bright .
There are wigs to be powdered , minuets to be danced , all quite boring . ” .
I , for one , am happy for Perl to move from the dark age to the age of enlightenment .
I think many camelfolks and lambdafolks share the same sentiment :) .
chromatic is the author of Modern Perl .
In his spare time , he has been working on helping novices understand stocks and investing .
