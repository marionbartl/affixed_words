With HD DVD now buried six feet under and all major Hollywood studios onboard in the Blu-ray camp , the stars are aligned for next - generation format sales to finally take off .
Surprisingly , prices are n’t falling , and customers still are n’t buying .
The War Has Just Begun
Do n’t laugh , Blu-ray vs. DVD is really THE new format war .
When comparing specs from Blu-ray and DVD players , on paper , Blu-ray has a clear advantage .
But on the field , it ’s a different story .
Truth is , there are many reasons why consumers are happy with the traditional DVD format :
They barely see the audio / video improvement
They already own a DVD player
DVD Players are much cheaper to buy
DVDs are 30 % to 40 % cheaper than Blu-ray disks
Video stores have considerably more DVDs for rental
While this one may seem odd , the fact that DVDs are easier to copy also plays in favor of the old poorly protected format
Upconverting DVD Players : Simply Too Good ?
If you want to take your DVD collection to the next level on your sexy high - definition television , get yourself an upscalling DVD player , also known as an up - converter , such as the Sony DVP - NS700H / B , the OPPO DV - 980H or the Panasonic DVD - S54K .
Equipped with an HDMI cable , these players upscale the 480 p signal to 1080i/1080 p by using complex maths to improve color ratios , contrasts and the overall picture quality .
Of course , with a native signal of 480 p , they cannot beat the native resolution of a Blu-ray disk that ’s 1080 p .
But the wow effect is not significant enough to make people drop 400 bucks ( and up ) on a Blu-ray player .
Not Enough Bang For The Buck
This is where DVDs overtake Blu-ray by a mile .
Looking at the concept of bang for the buck from a mathematical and graphical perspective , we understand that when prices go up , devices usually provide more features .
At a certain price though , quality cannot sustain value as cost increases substantially , while the product itself has less and less to offer .
DVDs and up - converting DVD players are comfortably sitting in the bang for the buck area of the graph , while Blu-ray has not yet fallen from the overpriced zone .
Christmas 2008
While many of you may be tempted to wait for the holiday season before taking the next - generation format highway , experts are expecting no significant decrease in price in the upcoming months .
Surprisingly , Blu-ray prices have gone up since the death of HD - DVD .
Also , the rising price of oil increases transportation costs , and directly impacts the production of plastic .
The format war is far from being over , and the economical situation resulting may restrain the Blu-ray group from making it to your living room .
All things considered , DVD may end up being a stronger contender than HD DVD ever was .
Edit : Nearly 6 months have past since we wrote this article , and the situation has changed quite a lot since then .
With Christmas time coming , it is now possible to get a very good blu - ray player for around $ 200 , namely the Samsung BD - 1500 .
Amazon.com is the cheapest place to get it right now .
REGARDLESS of what happens Tuesday in the Democratic presidential primary in Pennsylvania , Hillary Clinton will not quit .
Call it Divine Right or chutzpah , the Clintons believe she is entitled to the presidency .
They 've been planning it since their days at Yale .
They are also convinced Barack Obama will be clobbered in a general election , on a par with George McGovern and Michael Dukakis .
Ties that bind .
Clinton campaign leaders regard quitting as an admission that they could n't elect a once - sure thing .
Think of it :
No interviews on the Sunday talk shows .
No best table at the best DC restaurant .
And no Redskins tickets .
Geoff Garin , her new strategist , wo n't want to fold the tents anytime soon .
He just got started .
For the Clintons , dropping out would be a career catastrophe .
If Obama wins the nomination and the election , and gets reelected , Hillary , 60 , would have to wait eight years to run again .
Meanwhile , Obama will control key jobs in the federal government and the Democratic Party machinery .
He 's too wrong .
Clinton insiders argue that Obama will lose because he 's African - American , weak with Hispanics , too liberal , too exotic , and too close to a deranged preacher , a corrupt developer , and an unrepentant '60s radical Weatherman .
Do n't know the Weathermen ?
You will .
The Wright stuff .
The bizarre rants of Obama 's former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , are the subject of the Clinton superdelegate sales pitch .
President Clinton and Harold Ickes are saying Wright makes Obama unelectable in the fall .
An elephant on a waffle .
Obama 's gaffe in San Francisco , saying people in small - town America are bitter about their circumstance , is largely true .
It was the thesis of " What 's the Matter with Kansas , " an influential book on how Republicans get Middle Americans to ignore their economic self - interest .
Clinton jumped on the gaffe like an elephant on a waffle .
Black man as elitist .
Hillary Clinton , whose combined eight - year income with her husband was $ 109 million , called Obama an elitist and out of touch .
In his attempt at pop-sociology , Obama became a " San Francisco Democrat , " GOP code for ultra-liberal .
Obama gave Clinton new ammunition , especially for superdelegates , who may have more to say about her future than voters .
Hillary 's San Francisco moment .
In November , Time.com quoted Hillary as saying , " During the 1990s , I cannot remember being asked about immigration .
Why ?
Because the economy was working .
And average Americans did n't have to go around looking for others to blame . "
Archie Bunkerism .
Clinton is doing well with Pennsylvania 's white ethnics , blue - collars , and gray - hairs .
Caucasian pundits , led by ex-Philadelphian Chris Matthews of MSNBC , believe the state wants a plain - spoken , die - hard , self - described fighter ( Clinton ) , not a fancy - talking Harvard - educated black elitist with a funny name who can't bowl and has a crazy preacher .
What 's the damage ?
So far , none .
A new Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll , taken during the small - town flap , showed Obama trailing by only 5 points in Pennsylvania .
He wo n't win Pennsylvania , but it 's because of the anti-black or " hidden " vote .
How would Hillary do ?
She would begin a fall campaign with nearly half of all voters saying they can't stand ( or trust ) her .
Her Tuzla sniper fire myth - inexplicably regurgitated by her husband , embellished with four falsehoods - will be particularly damaging against warrior McCain .
And those dubious characters Bill Clinton has taken money from as ex-president ?
Some can charitably be called sleazy .
Monica .
Obama has been an absolute gentleman for not even hinting at sex in the Oval Office with a 19 - year - old intern .
McCain wo n't mention it .
Independent groups will do it for him .
The kind that made Willie Horton and Swiftboats famous .
The co-pilot .
McCain will attack Bill Clinton 's foreign policy misadventures in Rwanda , Somalia , Haiti , and Kosovo .
And Hillary will be pilloried for saying she was there every step of the way .
Fast forward .
SurveyUSA polled 50 states and found Obama winning 280 electoral votes to 258 for McCain , and that 's giving McCain Pennsylvania , Florida , New Jersey , and West Virginia .
" Get your hand off that Bible ! "
Because the Clintons believe Obama could be destroyed at any moment , she will never quit .
On " Saturday Night Live , " the Hillary character declares : " I 'm not jumping out of this until the inauguration .
And even then , I wo n't be gracious . "

A male Antarctic fur seal attempts to have sex with a king penguin near the Antarctic .
A seal has been caught on camera trying to have sex with a penguin .
This seems to be the first known example of a sexual escapade between a mammal and another kind of vertebrate such as a bird , reptile or fish , " although some mammals are known to have attempted sexual relief with inanimate — including dead things — objects , " said researcher Nico de Bruyn , a mammal ecologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa .
One summer morning , scientists observing elephant seals on a beach on Marion Island near the Antarctic spotted a young male Antarctic fur seal subduing a king penguin .
" At first we thought it was hunting the penguin , but then it became clear that his intentions were rather more amorous , " de Bruyn recalled today via email .
The roughly 240 - pound seal subdued the 30 - pound adult penguin by lying on it .
The hapless bird of unknown sex struggled , rapidly flapping its flippers and attempting to stand and flee , without luck .
The seal then alternated between resting on the penguin and thrusting its pelvis at the bird in vain attempts to insert its penis for 45 minutes .
Natural , unsuccessful sexual escapades by this variety of seal with members of its own species may last as long as this penguin assault did , " but yes , it is quite a long time and thus unusual , " de Bruyn told LiveScience .
The seal then abruptly gave up , moving to sea and completely ignoring the target of its affections .
The penguin apparently did not suffer any injury .
The scientists detailed their findings in the May issue of the Journal of Ethology .
Sexual harassment is common in the animal kingdom — " Homo sapiens are often testimony to that , " de Bruyn said .
Many species perform some form of sexual harassment on members of their own species , " for a variety of reasons many of which are hotly debated , " he added .
Many species of seal are polygynous , where one male mates with many females .
The males often fight each other to control females .
" This system thus promotes extreme aggression in males towards each other , and if a male cannot control a beach , this aggression may spill over to sexual aggression directed at outlying females , pups or even in rare cases other seal species , " de Bruyn said .
And this sexual aggression apparently might leap well beyond the species gap .
The Antarctic fur seals of Marion Island are the only ones known that eat king penguins .
The thrill of the hunt felt by the seal the researchers saw may have channeled into its sex drive , as the mating season had just come to an end .
" It may have wanted to eat it and half - way through the chase changed its mind , " de Bruyn speculated .
" I personally believe the link between aggressive and sexual behavior is evolutionarily far closer linked than we currently believe .
This has obvious implications for humans . "
On the other hand , the amorous seal may simply have been sexually inexperienced and playful , and wanted practice , the researchers conjectured .
" There are many things that we do not understand about ourselves that are mirrored in other species , " de Bruyn said .
" Thus by continuing with research efforts on other vertebrates we could learn a great deal about the whys behind human behaviors . "
It 's been tried before –with little success .
But high fuel prices continue to soar .
So Chrysler is offering to subsidize gasoline when you purchase a vehicle .
The Let 's Refuel America incentive puts a debit card in your hand when you purchase a select Chrysler , guaranteeing that you will pay no more than $ 2.99 a gallon for three years and up to 12,000 miles per year .
Speculative frenzies in the oil market have begun to raise fears around the world that gas could reach $ 7 at the U.S. pump this year ( it has already grabbed that ring in Europe and Japan ) .
So Chrysler 's strategy just might work this time .
The company 's sales are down 18 % this year .
Dealerships have been reporting a direct link between rising gas prices and the amount of free time their salespeople have on hand because of empty showrooms .
The program is already under fire .
Read after the jump .
The Union of Concerned Scientists has blasted the incentive :
" At the current price of $ 3.61 a gallon , the buyer of an average
Chrysler vehicle would save $ 400 a year under Chrysler 's deal .
But a mere 3 - mpg boost would yield the same savings over the 15,000 miles per year typically driven in the first three years of ownership .
Over the lifetime of a vehicle , such a fuel economy increase would save drivers more than $ 3,000 .
It would n't stop saving drivers money after just three years . "
To be sure , it 's a sign that Chrysler is offering yesterday 's gas prices for yesterday 's vehicles .
But it takes several years to revamp a company 's model lineup .
Meanwhile , Chrysler has a lot of gas guzzlers it needs to move in an increasingly sour market .
The incentive also plays in with the political pandering around rising prices at the pump .
Everyone , it seems , wants to reduce the pain of high prices .
States are now feeling pressure to reduce the levy they charge for gasoline , regardless of what happens with the federal fees .
So far , Americans smell the flimflam in these incentives .
With very few exceptions , it 's nearly impossible to find an economist who thinks they would benefit anyone .
Those considering a Chrysler should get out their calculators before they bite .
Some of the up - front cash incentives dealers now offer will add up to more than they 'll save on gasoline over three years .
Brandy Escapes Criminal Prosecution
is singing for joy after receiving word that she will not be criminally prosecuted for the chain reaction crash that claimed a woman 's life .
She 's far from off the hook , however , and will have to face multiple civil suits that have been filed by crash victims and their families .
The Los Angeles City Attorney 's office released a statement indicating that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Brandy Norwood .
The fatal crash occurred on December 30 , 2006 when the celebrity slammed her 2007 Land Rover into the back of a 2005 Toyota Corolla at a speed of 65 miles per hour .
This caused a chain reaction accident involving four vehicles .
The 38 year old Toyota driver , wife and mother of two , died of her injuries .
The California Highway Patrol had recommended that the star be charged with misdemeanor manslaughter .
If convicted , the 28 year old could have been sentenced to a year behind bars .
Brandy 's attorney indicated that it has been a difficult year for his client .
She has been living under a cloud of suspicion and was fearful of being found guilty .
She is n't off the hook by a long shot .
There have been three civil lawsuits filed against the singer by families involved in the accident , which include a wrongful death complaint filed by the victim 's husband , and another filed on behalf of her two children .
Brandy wo n't do any jail time but she 'll likely have to dig into her deep pockets in order to settle the pending litigation that is stacking up against her .
The Simpsons went from TV to big screen success
The Simpsons has been dropped from morning TV in Venezuela after being deemed unsuitable for children - and has been replaced by Baywatch .
The popular US cartoon about the yellow dysfunctional family was branded " inappropriate " and pulled by the country 's television authorities .
Caracas TV station Televen has started showing episodes of the beachside show in the same mid-morning slot .
It became famous for its bikini - clad stars , including Pamela Anderson .
Glamorous locations
The country 's TV regulator said the saga of Homer Simpson , wife Marge and their three children flouted regulations that prohibit " messages that go against the whole education of boys , girls and adolescents " .
It said that some unspecified complaints had been received from viewers .
Televen 's manager may decide to show The Simpsons , which has been dubbed into Spanish , at another time of day .
Baywatch became famous for beaches and bathing suits
The station is showing episodes of Baywatch Hawaii , a later incarnation of the lifeguard rescue show which started in 1989 .
The serial , about a group of beach lifeguards , gained notoriety for its attractive male and female cast members coupled with glamorous locations and slow - motion running sequences .
Venezuelan TV is known for filling its schedules with re-runs of old US series and Latin American soap operas .
But it also includes a talk show hosted by the country 's president , Hugo Chavez .
In an episode of the weekly programme last year , the Venezuelan leader gave a speech which reportedly lasted eight hours .
An abridged version of the show has been broadcast every day since February 2007 .
In memory of Dirk Vander Ploeg
Dirk Vander Ploeg was the publisher of this website dedicated to UFOs and the Paranormal until his untimely death in 2015 .
Upon his passing , his family , friends and colleagues decided to keep this website alive in his memory .
Like body slams and Minnesota gubernatorial bids , Playboy pictorials are a tradition in the world of wrestling .
Over the years , WWE fans have been treated to shots of beautiful grapplers such as Torrie Wilson , Candice Michelle and Ashley Massaro naked within the pages of Hugh Hefner 's creation .
They 're also still recovering from the grotesque images of Chyna ( Joanie Laurer ) nude .
This month , the honor falls to WWE Diva Maria Kanellis .
She 's the cover girl for Playboy 's April 2008 issue .
" I 'm very glamorous in this photo shoot , " Maria said .
" I 'm very high fashion and it definitely brings out that personality in me and makes me look strong .
Our fans do n't necessarily get to see me done up to this extent ; they do n't get to see me up close and personal . "
Do n't worry , guys :
When the photos of Maria Kanellis nude from this shoot are released online over the next few days , we 'll be sure fans have a chance to truly see this beauty up close and personal .
" Why are most Africans , unless forced by dire necessity to earn their livelihood with ' the sweat of their brow ' , so loath to undertake any work that dirties the hands ? "
" The all - encompassing preoccupation with sex in the African mind emerges clearly in two manifestations ... "
" In the African view of human nature , no person is supposed to be able to maintain incessant , uninterrupted control over himself .
Any event that is outside routine everyday occurrence can trigger such a loss of control ...
Once aroused , African hostility will vent itself indiscriminately on all outsiders . "
These statements , I think you 'll agree , are thoroughly offensive .
You would probably imagine them to be the musings of some 19th century colonialist .
In fact , they come from a book promoted by its US publisher as " one of the great classics of cultural studies " , and described by Publisher 's Weekly as " admirable " , " full of insight " and with " an impressive spread of scholarship " .
The book is not actually about Africans .
Instead , it takes some of the hoariest old prejudices about black people and applies them to Arabs .
Replace the word " African " in the quotations above with the word " Arab " , and you have them as they appear in the book .
It is , the book says , the Arabs who are lazy , sex - obsessed , and apt to turn violent over the slightest little thing .
Writing about Arabs , rather than black people , in these terms apparently makes all the difference between a racist smear and an admirable work of scholarship .
The book in question is called The Arab Mind , and is by Raphael Patai , a cultural anthropologist who taught at several US universities , including Columbia and Princeton .
I must admit that , despite having spent some years studying Arabic language and culture , I had not heard of this alleged masterpiece until last week , when the investigative journalist Seymour Hersh mentioned it in an article for New Yorker magazine .
Hersh was discussing the chain of command that led US troops to torture Iraqi prisoners .
Referring specifically to the sexual nature of some of this abuse , he wrote : " The notion that Arabs are particularly vulnerable to sexual humiliation became a talking point among pro-war Washington conservatives in the months before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq .
" One book that was frequently cited was The Arab Mind ... the book includes a 25 - page chapter on Arabs and sex , depicting sex as a taboo vested with shame and repression . "
Hersh continued : " The Patai book , an academic told me , was ' the bible of the neocons on Arab behaviour ' .
In their discussions , he said , two themes emerged - ' one , that Arabs only understand force , and two , that the biggest weakness of Arabs is shame and humiliation ' . "
Last week , my own further enquiries about the book revealed something even more alarming .
Not only is it the bible of neocon headbangers , but it is also the bible on Arab behaviour for the US military .
According to one professor at a US military college , The Arab Mind is " probably the single most popular and widely read book on the Arabs in the US military " .
It is even used as a textbook for officers at the JFK special warfare school in Fort Bragg .
In some ways , the book 's appeal to the military is easy to understand , because it gives a superficially coherent view of the Arab enemy and their supposed personality defects .
It is also readily digestible , uncomplicated by nuances and caveats , and has lots of juicy quotes , a generous helping of sex , and no academic jargon .
The State Department , too , used to take an interest in the book , although it seemingly no longer does .
At one stage , the training department gave free copies to officials when they were posted to US embassies in the Middle East .
In contrast , opinions of Patai 's book among Middle East experts at US universities are almost universally scathing .
" The best use for this volume , if any , is as a doorstop , " one commented .
" The book is old , and a thoroughly discredited form of scholarship , " said another .
None of the academics I contacted thought the book suitable for serious study , although Georgetown University once invited students to analyse it as " an example of bad , biased social science " .
There is a lot wrong with The Arab Mind apart from its racism : the title , for a start .
Although the Arab countries certainly have their distinctive characteristics , the idea that 200 million people , from Morocco to the Gulf , living in rural villages , urban metropolises and ( very rarely these days ) desert tents , think with some sort of single , collective mind is utterly ridiculous .
The result is a collection of outrageously broad - and often suspect - generalisations .
Patai asserts , for example , that Arabs " hate " the west .
He backs up this claim with two quotations : one from a book published in the mid-50s ( " Most westerners have simply no inkling of how deep and fierce is the hate , especially of the west , that has gripped the modernising Arab " ) , and another from Bernard Lewis - currently the neocons ' favourite historian - referring to the mood of " many , if not most Arabs " in 1955 ( just before the Suez crisis ) .
We are also informed ( page 144 ) of " the Arab view that masturbation is far more shameful than visiting prostitutes " .
Whether this is why Iraqi prisoners were forced to masturbate in front of cameras is unclear , but the only supporting evidence for Patai 's claim is a survey of Arab and US students published in 1954 : the US students admitted to masturbating twice as often as the Arabs , while 59 % of the Arabs , but only 28 % of the Americans , said they had visited a prostitute during the previous 12 months .
In " outlying areas " , such as Siwa oasis in Egypt , Patai says , " homosexuality is the rule , and practised completely in the open " .
This unequivocal statement is based on accounts dating from 1935 , 1936 and 1950 , and , in a footnote , Patai concedes that they " need to be checked out by an anthropologically trained observer " .
There is also a good deal of confusion in the book between the present and the past .
An Arab man , Patai writes , even if he has four wives , " can have sexual relations with concubines ( slave girls whom he owns ) " .
All this adds up to an overwhelmingly negative picture of the Arabs .
Positive characteristics are mentioned , but are given relatively short shrift .
Hospitality and generosity - two highly regarded virtues in Arab societies - get three and one and a half pages respectively , compared with a whole chapter devoted to alleged sexual hang - ups .
The book is a classic case of orientalism which , by focusing on what Edward Said called the " otherness " of Arab culture , sets up barriers that can then be exploited for political purposes .
The Arab Mind was originally published in 1976 , but - according to one US academic - actually belongs to the " national character " genre of writing that was popular in comparative politics around the middle of the last century .
Its methodology , therefore - not to mention much of its content - was considerably behind the times even when it first appeared .
Patai died in 1996 , but his book was revived by Hatherleigh Press in 2002 ( nicely timed for the war in Iraq ) , and reprinted with an enthusiastic introduction by Norvell " Tex " De Atkine , a former US army colonel and the head of Middle East studies at Fort Bragg .
" It is essential reading , " De Atkine wrote .
" At the institution where I teach military officers , The Arab Mind forms the basis of my cultural instruction . "
In a speech last week , the US president , George Bush , congratulated himself on having removed " hateful propaganda " from the schools in Iraq .
Perhaps it is now time he turned his attention to military schools in the US .
A simple idea for monitoring earthquakes that Elizabeth Cochran , a seismologist at UC Riverside , came up with in 2006 is being realized today , and has the potential to save lives in case an earthquake strikes .
The idea involves inviting the public to help monitor earthquakes by simply using their laptop computers at home .
In doing so , the laptops join a network of computers designed to take a dense set of measurements that can help capture an earthquake .
Anyone with a personal computer will be able to participate in the experiment once software linking such computers to the project is publicly released , tentatively this summer .
The free software , being developed by Cochran and colleagues Jesse Lawrence of Stanford University and Carl Christensen , a software architect and consultant , will be available at the Website BOINC .
Because the project makes use of inexpensive motion sensors , called accelerometers , which are already in place as safety devices in most new laptops , participants incur no significant costs related to the project .
Called “ Quake - Catcher Network , ” the project involves distributed computing , a method in which different parts of a computer program run simultaneously on two or more computers that are in communication with a central server over a network .
“ We ’re turning the laptops ’ accelerometers into earthquake monitors , ” said Cochran , an assistant professor of seismology in the Department of Earth Sciences .
“ With a dense grid of detectors in place , an early warning can be sent through the Internet to neighboring cities should an earthquake strike , giving people up to 10 - 20 seconds to prepare themselves before the seismic waves reach them . ”
Already , about 300 people spread around the world are taking part in the Quake - Catcher Network , with roughly a third of the participants in the United States .

“ The idea is to fill in the spaces – or holes – in the seismic network currently being used to report earthquakes , ” Cochran said .
“ With the public ’s participation in Quake - Catcher Network , however , we can have a lot more ‘ stations ’ recording earthquakes , allowing for a better early warning system .
At present in California , no such early warning system for earthquakes exists . ”
Currently , approximately 350 stations monitor earthquakes in Southern California using underground sensors .
They do so , however , not in real time .
“ There is a delay of 10 - 15 seconds from when the sensors record an earthquake to when the data is processed at either Caltech in Southern California or UC Berkeley in Northern California , ” Cochran explained .
“ Quake - Catcher Network would process data in real time , as it comes in .
And the network can stretch out to any region of the world .
Besides being inexpensive , it makes an extremely small demand on CPU resources . ”
According to Cochran , a person ’s laptop needs to remain inactive for at least three minutes before the system starts up .
“ This is to get rid of noise in the data and to ensure that any movement the laptop ’s accelerometer is detecting is indeed out of the ordinary , ” she said .
Currently , only Apple computers can participate in the project , but Cochran and her colleagues are working on including other computers in Quake - Catcher Network .

“ We also are working on developing an accelerometer which can be plugged into a desktop like a USB flash drive , ” she said .
“ That way , we ’d have less interference from typing on the keyboard .
It also would allow for a more robust and reliable system , with computers running the software all of the time . ”
Cochran said she plans to make all the data gathered by the sensors freely available to researchers and the public .
“ This data can be used to study how a seismic wave propagates in the ground , ” she said .
“ How fast a wave travels can give us useful information , such as more details on seismic hazard as well as the structure of the Earth .
The denser our network , the clearer will be the picture of what is happening at each step in time .
A series of such pictures could be used to develop a movie showing the wave ’s propagation , which could give us extremely useful information about seismic waves . ”
Next , Cochran and her colleagues will further test their software program before its release on BOINC ; currently , the program is available on very limited release .
Cochran also plans to involve K - 12 schools through education and outreach .
“ We think this would be an excellent project for students to take an interest in , ” she said , “ so we ’re hoping we ’ll see more of their participation . ”
The Araby family lives in Shubra - al - Khama , a poor , congested suburb in northern Cairo .
Mohammed , 50 , has worked as an accountant for 32 years , and earns 2,000 Egyptian pounds ( LE ) a month , or £ 200 , with which he has to support his wife , Hoda , and three children .
Ahmed , 23 , is their oldest son .
After two years of university , he has dropped out to try and find work in order to help support the family .
His ad hoc work as a handyman or builder pays LE20 a day .
Ahmed 's younger brother Kareem is 20 , and studying for career in the tourism industry .
Their 13 - year - old sister , Omnia , is at school .
The whole family , including Mohammed 's elderly mother , aged 80 , shares a three - bedroom apartment .
Mohammed has never thought of himself as well - off , but in previous years was able to save enough from his salary to give the family a few treats - a summer holiday in Alexandria , a monthly picnic together or a meal .
Now , thanks to the rising food prices , these luxuries are a thing of the past .
All of Mohammed 's salary goes on basic essentials , and he has had to sell his car to continue providing for the family and cut back on the amount spent on on Omnia 's education .
Here we look at their average daily diet during a working week
Monday
Breakfast : T'amiyya ( Egyptian falafel ) , fool ( fava beans ) , milk , bread .
Cost this year : LE5 ( last year : LE3 ) .
Lunch : Beef , tomatoes , cucumber , aubergine , bread , mulukhiyya ( green leaf soup ) , green beans .
Cost this year : LE 47 ( LE31.50 ) .
Dinner : Yoghurt , bread , cheese .
Cost this year : LE 8.50 ( LE3.50 ) .
Cost for daily food this year : LE60.5 ( LE38 ) .
Hoda used to be able to buy lots of dried food that could be stored for the week ahead , but now the family does n't have enough money to do that and instead has to shop on a day - by - day basis .
The cost of tomatoes and meat has risen by 50 % , while most other vegetables have doubled in price .
Tuesday
Breakfast : Bread , fool , t'amiyya .
Cost this year : LE 4 ( LE2 ) .
Lunch : Butter , tea , sugar , potatoes .
Cost this year : LE 32 ( LE20 ) .
Dinner : Milk , yoghurt , cheese .
Cost this year : LE 7.50 ( LE4.50 ) .
Cost for daily food this year : LE43.50 ( LE26.50 ) .
The family would normally have bought some fruit for the children today as well as some sweets to share in the home , but now there is no money left over for these luxuries .
Butter alone has gone up almost 70 % in the past year .
Wednesday
Breakfast : Bread , fool , t'amiyya .
Cost this year : LE 4 ( LE2 ) .
Lunch : Potatoes , cucumber , tomato , spices , fruit .
Cost this year : LE 20 ( LE11 ) .
Dinner : Milk , yoghurt , cheese .
Cost this year : LE 6.50 ( LE4.50 ) .
Cost for daily food this year : LE 30.50 ( LE17.50 ) .
Wednesday was the day that Mohammed and Hoda 's three children would each receive a small allowance to spend on treat themselves on whatever they wanted .
Now , with the cost of potatoes having almost doubled , the allowances have been stopped .
Thursday
Breakfast : Bread , fool , t'amiyya .
Cost this year : LE4 ( LE2 ) .
Lunch : Fried chicken , cucumber , pasta , aubergine .
Cost this year : LE26 ( LE15.50 ) .
Dinner : Milk , yoghurt , cheese .
Cost this year : LE7.50 ( LE4.50 ) .
Cost for daily food this year : LE37.50 ( LE22 ) .
Once again , Hoda has had to chose between buying meat or fruit for her children .
Today she has gone for chicken , the price of which has gone up 50 % , leaving her with nothing left to spend on oranges or mangoes .
The price of cheese , like most dairy products , has also skyrocketed – up 100 % from last year .
Friday
Breakfast : Eggs , bread , fool , t'amiyya .
Cost this year : LE9 ( LE4.50 ) .
Lunch : Fish , cucumber , tomato , cooking oil .
Cost this year : LE 33 ( LE17 ) .
Dinner : Milk , French bread , yoghurt , cheese .
Cost this year : LE 10 ( LE6 ) .
Cost for daily food this year : LE 52 ( LE27.50 ) .
It 's the beginning of the Egyptian weekend and the family 's food budget is exhausted .
The cheapest oil they could find in the market has doubled in price from LE4 to LE8 .
Hoda used to spend the weekend decorating the family apartment , buying new covers for the sofa and chairs , but that 's now a thing of the past .
Total cost of food shopping for five days this year : LE224
Total cost of food shopping for five days last year : LE131.5
Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar ( also known as Burma ) very hard on the second of May .
Fatalities and people missing are currently at 23,000 and 42,000 respectively , according to Reuters , but the final total number of fatalities is still climbing and may top 100,000 , according to CNN .
Myanmar needs all the international help it can get ; relief for the small country is coming from various organizations , government bodies , and companies from all around the world .
Microsoft has announced it is joining the effort by teaming up with NetHope , a nonprofit IT consortium , to provide technology resources .
The Redmond - based company is also turning to its own employees , promising to match every dollar made by US - based employees : " At Microsoft , we are saddened by the devastation caused by the cyclone in Myanmar , and our hearts go out to the many people impacted by this tragedy , " the company said in a statement .
" We have encouraged employees who wish to donate to give through our partner international humanitarian relief organizations , such as CARE , World Vision , The American Red Cross or Save the Children . "
Microsoft has a long history of providing help and resources in disaster situations .
Currently , the company is collaborating with humanitarian organizations to try to figure out where its resources can be most helpful for the impacted region .
Microsoft has also linked to InterAction , which has a list of 41 organizations that are accepting donations for the cause .

Below are the real March foreclosure numbers for CA just released minutes ago from ForeclosureRadar .
Sit back , relax , have a large bottle of brown liquor nearby and read away .
Remember when reading , that Notices - of - Default lead foreclosures by several months in some cases .
Also remember , this housing and credit crisis will not end until home prices / sales / foreclosures bottom and stabilize .
By the looks of the most recent data , that is a long way off .
** In CA for March , there were 27,541 FORECLOSURE FILINGS and 42,704 NOTICES OF DEFAULT for a total of 70,246 early / mid stage foreclosure filings .
This is the killer that nobody reports ... in CA in Feb , ALL HOMES ( New & Existing ) SOLD WERE ONLY 20,513 .
ALL NEW HOMES SALES for the ENTIRE 10 - STATE WESTERN REGION in Feb were only 13 k and ALL EXISTING HOME SALES for the ENTIRE 10 - STATE WESTERN REGION were only 55 k .
One more thing ... the MAJORITY of the Notice of Default surge is not from subprime loans .
Not even close .
I can't specifically tell you which program types are defaulting to the greatest degree , as that is part of a paid service rolling out soon , but I can say they are not subprime and they are not fixed ... actually they likely are subprime but the ratings agencies just have n't got there yet !
This means that March CA foreclosure activity is ... A ) greater than all THE HOMES PURCHASED IN THE WESTERN REGION the month prior .
B ) nearly 350 % GREATER than all the homes bought in CA alone !
C )
Not primarily a subprime problem .
This is a disaster .
Also note that repossessed homes that are sold through a real estate agent count in the Existing Home Sales number , so the problem is alot worse than the public data show .
Foreclosure sales at auction declined 6.5 % to 15,833 units likely due to the unavailability of financing and general fear .
Wow !!
ONLY 2.3 % of foreclosed homes sold at auction ... the rest went back to the lender swelling inventories ... how about tham apples Charles Bederman .
This is despite an average discount of 21 % with 39 % of the homes offering a 30 % or greater discount .
In summary , the worst in CA is absolutely still to come for housing .
And everyone is too busy trying to figure out how to bail people out and focusing on subprime to realize that WE HAVE NO JUMBO LOAN PROGRAMS .
The Fannie / Freddie ' conforming / Jumbo ' programs stink , as they have very few programs available and nobody wants a 7 % 30 - yr fixed rate loan .
Why , when they have an exotic currently and their payment is one - third of a 30 - yr fixed .
It is all about the monthly payment , remember .
For purchases , a 7 % 30 - yr fixed with a large down payment does not buy the average household much home .
Given this , the worst is yet to come for the financial markets because until real estate quits crashing and goes through a long period of stabilization there can be no basing and subsequent recovery .
Either that or bring back all the exotic loan programs and the problems end tomorrow .

One thing that keeps popping up lately is how different people expect communities to rise up and work together .
Communities are hard to build .
They do n’t happen over night , and you ca n’t force them .
I have been part of many forums since connecting to the Internet , and very few have been able to sustain themselves for any long period of time .
Much like the trend I am seeing with blogs , forums rise in popularity , do well for a period of time , and then slowly decline as a new site takes its place .
Someone asked me how easy it would be to build a community forum around their site , where each person helped each other , much like happens on WordPress ’ support forum , and just like with other people that have asked me , I had to tell them that it is n’t easy .
Most of the time when I am searching Google to try to find a solution to a problem , I run across forums where the problem is posted , a dozen people agree that the problem exists , but no one ever chimes in to solve it .
This is the case on a variety of forums because once you have found your answer , most people forget to come back and share it with others .
This even occurs on the WordPress Support forum from time to time .
If you want to build a community , there are a few things that need to take place .
Leadership
Do n’t think that having one person leading a community of thousands is enough .
You will want to put in place a group of around one “ leader ” type personality for every few hundred members .
The leaders must be strong willed individuals willing to carry conversations , and spend a fair bit of time doing damage control , polling the needs of the user base , solving issues , answering questions , and starting most of the biggest and best conversations .
Common Need
You would assume that people joining a forum would have a common need , but that is n’t always the case , and this can be due to weak leadership .
Think long and hard about what needs the forum is trying to fulfill , and make sure users , before they sign up , understand exactly why the forum was created .
Do n’t just expect them to help each other , most people in any community are looking for ways to help themselves , not spend all day helping others .
What do you offer them above a place to air their problems ?
What does you community do for your members ?
Ease of Use
Why do most forums have multiple topics about the same issue ?
Because the normal forum interface is horrible for finding the information you need and want , or even just learning where the more active conversations are .
This is why many communities are trying a variety of different setups in hopes of optimizing the user experience , reducing repeat posts , and encouraging conversation .
When it comes to phpBB forums , I do n’t even participate if they do n’t have some form of Quick Reply hack installed .
One system that I like is the Talk section on BlogFlux .
The only issues I see are the lack of a top discussions list , and the ability to subscribe to conversations in some way , but I find it much nicer to use than most traditional forum software .
Understanding of the 80/20 Rule
Eighty percent of the content on any community forum is going to come from twenty percent of the membership .
This is pretty much a bankable fact .
If you have all the other key factors in place , for every hundred members you have , only twenty will really put time and energy into growing or communicating with the community .
What ’s sometimes worse is that out of the twenty percent , only half are there to help the community , while the other half are usually only there to help themselves .
Certain types of users can be detrimental to a community , even if they are providing a wide variety of content .
Conclusion
A community is a wonderful thing , and can be very powerful , but if you try to force it , or manage it incorrectly , you will only be doing yourself and your members a disservice , and most likely , they will move on to a more vibrant , helpful place to get the answers or help they seek .
The platypus , native to Australia , is so odd that when the first specimens were sent to Europe in the 19th century , scientists suspected a hoax .
It was classified as a mammal , one of only two monotremes ( echidna is the other ) living today that are offshoots of the main mammalian lineage .
The divergence occurred some 166 million years ago from primitive ancestors combining features of both mammals and reptiles .

“ What is unique about the platypus is that it has retained a large overlap between two very different classifications , while later mammals lost the features of reptiles , ” Dr. Warren said in an interview .
In their investigation of the platypus genetic blueprint , the scientists found that its genome contains about 18,500 genes , similar to other vertebrates and about two - thirds the size of the human genome .
The platypus shares 82 percent of its genes with the human , mouse , dog , opossum and chicken .
Some repeated elements in the genome , the scientists noted , hold hints as to the chronology of changes in the platypus .
Of particular interest , the researchers reported , the analysis identified families of genes that link the platypus to reptiles ( like those for egg - laying , vision and venom production ) , as well as to mammals ( antibacterial proteins and lactation ) .
The platypus lacks nipples ; the young nurse through the abdominal skin .
One surprise was finding genes responsible for sensitive odor receptors .
As a primarily aquatic animal , the platypus was already known to rely on electrosensory receptors in its bill to detect faint electric fields emitted by underwater prey .
So why the considerable ability to sense odors ?
The scientists speculate that it may involve sexual communication or the use of water - soluble odorants in navigating and hunting underwater .
NEW DELHI : This real - life anti-climax had all the ingredients of a typical masala thriller .
A love triangle , estrangement and a faked suicide by the protagonist to escape the clutches of his wife , with the eventual aim of living happily ever after with his lady love , far from the restrictions of a disciplined Army life .
But it all came to naught following some smart work by military sleuths .
A doctor , a major in the Army Medical Corps , who faked his suicide to elope with a fellow officer���s wife , has now been cashiered from service after a court martial for " desertion " and " stealing the affections of a brother officer���s wife " .
The intriguing story began in June 2007 when the doctor , posted at the military hospital at Dinjan cantonment in Assam���s Tinsukia district , left his car and a " suicide note " on the banks of the Brahmaputra .
The note said he was taking the extreme step since he was unhappy with his life .
The " body " , however , was not found .
Around the same time , the wife of a colonel from the Artillery Regiment , too , went missing from the cantonment .
The Army headquarters launched investigations to get to the bottom of the puzzling matter .
The doctor���s wife , also an Army doctor with the rank of a captain , was serving with a UN peace - keeping mission abroad .
The painstaking Army probe led to the conclusion that it was a love triangle and the major had , in all probability , faked his suicide .
Two persons going missing from the same Army establishment , one after the other , " raised eyebrows " , said a source .
Three months later , in September , " some leads and intercepts " led the military sleuths to Niraj , Sangli , in Maharashtra .
The doctor , who was thought to have committed suicide , was busy at work there , practising as a cancer surgeon at a private hospital , with his lady love living with him as his " wife " .
The doctor , who had begun his life anew in the civilian world , was promptly arrested and taken by the military police to the Kolkata - based Eastern Army Command for " disciplinary action " for desertion and other offences .
He was later court - martialled .
While touring Asian countries this week , Gates gave reporters a bone to chew on : a suggestion that Microsoft will now pursue an " independent " strategy in the wake of the Yahoo deal 's failure .
But independent of what , exactly ?
There may not be many opportunities left in history to draw extrapolated conclusions on something Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates says about the future of his company , or of anything else related to technology .
So a single phrase containing a key word uttered by Gates during a press conference in Tokyo yesterday has once again drawn the wolves into a feeding frenzy .
At issue is whether Gates meant to say that he intends , or would prefer , that Microsoft develop its own online strategy now in - house and independently of anyone else , now that the pairing of his company with Yahoo is off the table , or whether he meant that Microsoft would pursue a course independent of Yahoo .
It 's always nicer when reporters ask follow - up questions during the press conferences themselves ; but if they did that -- and in so doing , actually answer some of these questions -- then we might have less to write about .
Advertisement
Multiple versions of the same Associated Press story , with the same byline , have Gates saying things slightly differently .
However , outlets which typically carry AP stories unaltered quote Gates as first having led up to his point by saying both his company and Yahoo had put significant effort into making a deal , but then saying Microsoft and Yahoo have both now chosen to pursue " independent paths , " and later adding specifically about Microsoft , " Now at this point Microsoft is focused on its independent strategy . "
As to that last citation , many are interpreting that comment to mean that Microsoft will refrain from making any consolation deals , which would probably include with AOL -- a name that has been bandied about as a possible takeover target from Time Warner , ever since Yahoo let it be speculated that it might enter into a pact with AOL to avoid one with Microsoft .
But in the same context as the first Gates citation , quite possibly , he may also have meant " independently of Yahoo . "
And what reporters may have failed to notice that earlier , during Gates ' tour of Asian countries , he stopped over in South Korea , where on Monday he was cited by the Associated Press as having not ruled out near - term deals with others , though leaving it up to CEO Steve Ballmer to make that decision .
" Well , the key decisions on that will be made by Microsoft CEO Steven Ballmer , " the Monday report cites Gates as saying ( although it 's curious that we never typically hear Gates refer to his long - time friend and partner as " Microsoft CEO Steven Ballmer " ) , " who took a look at Yahoo and decided that on our own he likes the stuff that we 're doing ... We need to show the innovation and it's a very competitive space ... I would n't rule out some partnerships but we do n't have anything imminent there . "
In an interview with BetaNews on Monday , Directions on Microsoft lead analyst Matt Rosoff suggested Microsoft take a hard look at the possibility of spending some of that $ 45 billion plus it had allocated for Yahoo , on acquisitions that would bring it closer to its goals .
" The options for Microsoft are , ' Yes , we want to be a big online publisher , ' in which case , they probably do need to make another acquisition or figure out a way to grow their audience on MSN and Windows Live ; or ' No , we do n't want to be an online publisher , ' in which case , they focus on the aQuantive business , " said Rosoff , referring to Microsoft 's May 2007 purchase of the Australia - based ad platform provider .
Rosoff later suggested that Microsoft consider AOL -- not necessarily as a whole , but perhaps its most critical part instead : " Maybe eyeing something like Platform - A , Advertising.com , that 's an option as well . "
In another interview that same day , Jarvis Coffin , CEO of Burst Media -- which competes in the same space as aQuantive and Platform - A -- disagreed , saying he feels now is Microsoft 's best chance to take its existing wealth of assets and come up with its own solution .
" I think Microsoft has other ad - serving assets , ad network assets , and they ought to be thinking about what they can do that is more relevant to what 's taking place in the market today , where the race is still on , " Coffin told BetaNews , " and in the whole area of vertical networks , trying to figure out how to build a Microsoft online ad network that is global and competes with the other ad networks that are out there .

" Welcome aboard , Colin ! " Colin P. gave his boss a firm handshake , excited about his first day on the job .
He'd be a member of the team that worked on an application that ran on a managed information appliance .
" I 'll set you up with Mike , who can show you the ropes . "
Colin 's boss turned him over to Mike , who started describing the system architecture immediately .
" So here 's what we 've got , " he began .
" The core is the email processing module .
It takes in an email , logs a little information , and stores attachments in the file system .
Easy , right ? "
Mike gave him a little more background , but reasoned that Colin should be able to figure it out .
It sounded so simple that Colin could hardly imagine any reason that they had more than one developer actively supporting the application .
That is , until he saw the architecture ( to use the term loosely ) .
Try to follow along :
The core of the application was a system which processed items of incoming email , logging some information to a database and storing attachments in the file system .
A Perl web - app controlled the behavior of the system and allowed access to the results .
Of course , the system had to interact with Microsoft Exchange servers , since that 's where most of the clients stored their email .
It also had to interact with various third - party products which were Windows - only .
So , naturally , as a host operating system for their appliance , they chose Linux .
The web application would run natively under Apache , with the rest of the sytem running inside a virtual Windows XP host in VMWare .
The two would communicate via HTTP , with the Linux host invoking a mixture of Perl and VB scripts under IIS on the XP guest to communicate with the Windows components .
I tried to represent this with a flow chart , but did an embarrassingly terrible job of it and was n't going to include it with the article .
Then after thinking about it some more I realized that the quality of the flow chart is a good metaphor for the quality of the process .
Generally , the squiggly lines represent HTTP requests and my own ineptitude with Visio .
Because the application had to work with Exchange servers , it would stand to reason that they would design the interface using the Exchange SDK .
Instead , the system required an instance of Outlook running on the virtual XP machine to move the emails around .
Colin discovered this on his third day when he got an call from an upset client that their system was hanging .
He had to solve the problem with the following process :
SSH to the customer 's Linux host Open a port to allow VNC or Remote Desktop access Connect via VNC or Remote Desktop Click ' OK ' on whatever dialog in Outlook was awaiting a response
The Perl - based management web application had four routines in it , which represented over 70,000 lines of code .
That count includes comments , but only because there were n't any .
Most of it was un-indented and had been copied and pasted from sources unknown .
The lead developer was notoriously cagey , and meticulous about his code .
So much so that he wanted to keep his code a secret from everybody .
After all , if he checked his code in to source control , that would mean that other developers could * gasp * see it , and perhaps * double gasp * maintain it .
So instead of code , he'd check in compiled assemblies .
Colin butted heads with the lead developer near the end of his first week about a scheme he'd developed for passing hierarchical data in Perl , using a jumble of arrays of values prefixed with period - delimted path names .
Colin 's suggestion that it might be easier to store the hierarchy directly using hashrefs was met with a five - second blank stare , then a suspicious and dismissive " that sounds very clever , " before he returned to his explanation .
Before he'd even finished his first two weeks , Colin knew that he had to move on .
Since Colin had interviewed with the CTO , he intended to catch up with him to discuss his plans .
That morning when Colin came in , he discovered that the CTO had gone on safari , but he had n't gotten around to telling anyone he'd be gone or where he was going .
Instead , Colin sent an email to him , CCing his immediate boss with his intention to leave in two weeks .
Trying to be as polite as possible , he explained the circumstances he had worked under , and appologized for needing to quit so soon .
Colin tried to keep the tone pleasant and professional to avoid angering the CTO .
It did n't work .
In a heated response , without even the slightest hint of the irony of it , the CTO scolded Colin by saying that his level of professionalism was barely suitable for a position at McDonald's , and that he should " just leave right away . "
After that , Colin had to fight with HR and the CTO for several months to squeeze a paycheck out of the company for his few weeks of service .
When they finally agreed to pay , the CTO gave Colin two options .
1 ) Pick up the check in person , get yelled at by the CTO .
2 ) Receive check by regular , un - trackable mail ( as long as Colin signed a statement releasing the company from any responsibility if the check mysteriously did n't turn up at his house ) .
Colin chose the former .
I 'm at the Moscow airport getting ready to fly back to the United States .
Before I leave , however , I figured it would be good to note ( and then bury ) three myths that I heard perpetuated by Microsoft at the Interop Moscow conference .
They 've been largely discredited elsewhere , but it appears Microsoft prefers to keep regurgitating the party line until abject ridicule sets in .
Myth : Open source can't innovate .
Coming from Microsoft , I found this galling in the extreme , especially since the Microsoft representative was using Sharepoint as an example of Microsoft 's innovation , which is a clumsy ripoff of ... ECM systems that my own company 's founder created 15 years ago at Documentum .
I mean , sure , it has Windows , Internet Explorer , Office , and other groundbreaking products ( I 'm being facetious ) .
It also came up with the XBox , SQL Server , and other innovative stuff .
( Still smiling . )
OK , enough .
Microsoft does n't innovate .
Very few companies do in the " Big Bang " theory of innovation .
Rather , most innovation is incremental .
For example , I consider Microsoft innovative for lowering the bar to computing .
Microsoft makes software easier to use .
That 's innovative .
Open source is increasingly innovating in a Big Bangish sense with projects like Ringside and Loopfuse that push the boundaries of what has been done ( or is being done ) in software , and Zimbra has taken email to a new level that Microsoft has dreams of achieving
But what about the Internet , which is largely an open source phenomenon ?
Or Linux in its ability to scale to widely different hardware ?
Or things like Second Life ?
Pretty innovative , if you ask me .
Open source does n't interoperate with other software well , while Microsoft does .
Wow !
The cheekiness of that one was breathtaking .
There is nothing inherent in open source to prevent it from interoperability ; on the contrary , there is much in it that lends itself to interoperability ( open source , open standards , open APIs , etc. ) .
Even worse was Microsoft 's contention that it's an IP issue .
Well , it is for Microsoft , but Microsoft largely stands alone in this .
Microsoft has the keys in its hands to interoperate at an intellectual property level , but chooses not to or , rather , chooses to do so on a highly selective basis that the rest of its proprietary peers do n't do .
Microsoft , not the industry , is responsible for holding back on open - source interoperability .
Even so , we interoperate with Microsoft products , anyway , even without Microsoft 's blessing .
As just one example , which content collaboration / management system integrates most seamlessly with Microsoft Office ?
If you said , " Sharepoint , " you would be wrong .
The answer is Alfresco .
Who has seamlessly integrated the Microsoft CIFS interface into a Java - based CMS ?
If you said , " Sharepoint , " you would again be wrong .
The answer , again , is " Alfresco . "
I 'm biased on this one ( I work for Alfresco ) , but a quick download and five - minute installation will prove my point , if you do n't believe me .
Microsoft 's integration with its own products often leaves much to be desired .
There is no money in open source .
It 's funny to hear Microsoft use this one , as if its customers are desperate to hear it talk about how much money it makes at their expense .
Microsoft 's Russian representative was very proud at his company 's outsized profits .
What he failed to remember is that we 're living in an increasingly efficient software market , with SaaS and open source driving down costs ( and prices ) to rational levels that are consistent with mature markets .
Even so , just as in every other industry known to humankind , there 's plenty of money available for open - source vendors , both pureplays and companies like Google that build on top of open source .
There is no shortage of cash .
There 's just a shortage of creativity .
Perhaps a few more 10 percent drops in net income will convince Microsoft that the world is ( slowly ) changing .
Microsoft has gotten better in its open - source rhetoric .
Now it just needs to make sure its far - flung outposts get the message , too .
Microsoft Russia 's opinion on open source is stuck in the Cold War .
Time to engage in Perestroika and grow up , my comrades .
Inside the Middle Class : Bad Times Hit the Good Life
I. Executive Summary
This report on the attitudes and lives of the American middle class combines results of a new Pew Research Center national public opinion survey with the center ’s analysis of relevant economic and demographic trend data from the Census Bureau .
Among its key findings :
Fewer Americans now than at any time in the past half century believe they ’re moving forward in life .
Americans feel stuck in their tracks .
A majority of survey respondents say that in the past five years , they either have n’t moved forward in life ( 25 % ) or have fallen backward ( 31 % ) .
This is the most downbeat short - term assessment of personal progress in nearly half a century of polling by the Pew Research Center and the Gallup organization .
Americans feel stuck in their tracks .
A majority of survey respondents say that in the past five years , they either have n’t moved forward in life ( 25 % ) or have fallen backward ( 31 % ) .
This is the most downbeat short - term assessment of personal progress in nearly half a century of polling by the Pew Research Center and the Gallup organization .
When asked to measure their progress over a longer time frame , Americans are more upbeat .
Nearly two - thirds say they have a higher standard of living than their parents had when their parents were their age .
For decades , middle income Americans had been making absolute progress while enduring relative decline .
But since 1999 , they have not made economic progress .
As of 2006 ( the last year for which trend data are available ) , real median annual household income had not yet returned to its 1999 peak , making this decade one of the longest downturns ever for this widely - accepted measure of the middle - class standard of living .
Over a longer time period , the picture is much brighter ; since 1970 , median household income has risen by 41 % .
However , this long - term prosperity has not spread evenly .
The upper income tier ( households with annual incomes above 150 % of the median ) has outperformed the middle tier ( households with annual incomes between 75 % and 150 % of the median ) — not just in income gains , but also in wealth accumulation .
From 1983 to 2004 , the median net worth of upper income families grew by 123 % , while the median net worth of middle income families grew by just 29 % .
In effect , those in the middle have been making progress in absolute terms while falling behind in relative terms .
About half of all Americans think of themselves as middle class .
They are a varied lot .
Some 53 % of adults in America say they are middle class .
On key measures of well - being — income , wealth , health , optimism about the future — they tend to fall between those who identify with classes above and below them .
But within this self - defined middle class , there are notable economic and demographic differences .
For example , four - in - ten Americans with incomes below $ 20,000 say they are middle class , as do a third of those with incomes above $ 150,000 .
And about the same percentages of blacks ( 50 % ) , Hispanics ( 54 % ) and whites ( 53 % ) self - identify as middle class , even though members of minority groups who say they are middle class have far less income and wealth than do whites who say they are middle class .
For the past two decades middle income Americans have been spending more and borrowing more .
Housing has been the key driver of both trends .
A new single family house is about 50 % larger and existing houses are nearly 60 % more expensive ( in inflation adjusted dollars ) now than in the mid 1980s .
Goods and services that did n’t exist a few decades ago– such as high definition television , high speed internet , and cable or satellite subscriptions – have become commonplace consumer items .
And the costs of many of the anchors of a middle class lifestyle– not just housing , but medical care and college education– have risen more sharply than inflation .
As expenses have risen , middle income Americans have taken on more debt , often borrowing against homes that , at least until recently , had been rising rapidly in value .
The median debt - to - income ratio for middle income adults increased from 0.45 in 1983 to 1.19 in 2004 .
Ratios have also increased for upper and lower income adults , but not by as much .
At a time when these borrow - and - spend habits have spread , Americans say it has become harder to sustain a middle class lifestyle .
Nearly eight - in - ten ( 79 % ) respondents in the Pew Research Center survey say it is more difficult now than five years ago for people in the middle class to maintain their standard of living .
Back in 1986 , just 65 % of the public felt this way .
Nearly eight - in - ten ( 79 % ) respondents in the Pew Research Center survey say it is more difficult now than five years ago for people in the middle class to maintain their standard of living .
Back in 1986 , just 65 % of the public felt this way .
The current economic slowdown and uptick in prices are taking a bite out of the family budget .
Slightly more than half of middle class respondents say they ’ve had to tighten their belts in the past year .
Roughly the same proportion expect to make more cutbacks in the year ahead , and a quarter say they expect to have trouble paying their bills .
About a quarter of those who are employed worry they could lose their job .
Nonetheless , the American middle class is optimistic about the future .
Most are confident that their quality of life in five years will be better than it is now .
And , gazing farther ahead , most expect their children to do better in life than they themselves have done .
Economic , demographic , technological and sociological changes since 1970 have moved some groups up the income ladder and pushed others down .
Winners include seniors ( ages 65 and older ) , blacks , native - born Hispanics and married adults .
The income status of all of these groups improved from 1970 to 2006 .
Losers include young adults ( ages 18 to 29 ) , the never - married , foreign - born Hispanics and people with a high school diploma or less .
All of these groups have seen their relative income positions decline .
Most middle class adults agree with the old saw that the Republican Party favors the rich while the Democratic Party favors the middle class and the poor .

Agent Provocatuers

For over twenty years now , I 've been writing about and documenting police riots at protests .
It 's always the same story :
Undercover police dress up as protesters and incite , or even engage in , violence .
Uniformed police then take advantage of this to assault legitimate protesters , sometimes brutally .
It 's the oldest trick in the book and the French have a phrase for it : " Agent Provocateur .
Bizarrely , US protesters NEVER seem to get their heads out of their arses and see it coming no matter how many times it gets pulled on them .
In contrast , one labor leader at the Montebello meeting of the so called " Security and Prosperity Summit " in Quebec earned the title LEADER and not only detected this crap as it was talking place , but confronted the government - employed criminals involved and forced them to stand down .
This kind of activity is n't legitimate police work .
It 's thug - for - hire work on behalf of fascists .
Next time you see one of these hulking morons with a mask on his face holding a rock or stick , rip off his mask and photograph him .
Do n't expect a shred of help from the gutless news media exposing these vermin .
They 'll never follow up on the story , but the photographs are a deterrent .
Look for the steroid pumped morons with close - cropped hair , polished shoes , and over the top ass - holic behavior .
Those would be your police masquerading as protesters .
By the way , the so called " Security and Prosperity Summit " will be meeting in New Orleans in April .
( Update : Meeting came and went . )
Brasscheck TV will be there reporting on cop dirty tricks as they happen .
Note : New Orleans police have coincidentally been given a " grant " of assault weapons and riot gear recently .
Also , an article recently appeared in New Orleans Magazine praising the local SWAT team for brutalizing local affordable housing protesters .
How subtle .
How police staged riots at the Seattle at the WTO meeting :

In re-reading and pondering the decision , I keep coming back to this :
In contrast to earlier times , our state now recognizes that an individual ’s capacity to establish a loving and long - term committed relationship with another person and responsibly to care for and raise children does not depend upon the individual ’s sexual orientation , and , more generally , that an individual ’s sexual orientation like a person ’s race or gender does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights .
People can talk about activist liberal judges all they want .
But the simple truth is that what has changed these past twenty years is not the nature of judges , but our collective understanding of what sexual orientation is .
Behind all this is a deep , deep shift in our consciousness from thinking of gay people as defective straight people who perform certain sexual acts to their being the moral equivalent of heterosexuals , capable of forming relationships and building families as well as anyone .
This is at the core of the generational divide : not that young people are more " liberal " or " progressive " than their parents .
On an issue like abortion , they 're not .
It is simply that the next generation has grown up with a different definition of who gay people are .
They see gay people as interchangeable with straight people .
They do n't think we 're inferior to them .
Because they know us .
Once you alter that basic understanding , then re-fitting the law to account for it may , at first blush , look liberal or activist , but in fact , it 's just removing what now appears a massive anachronism and anomaly .
Yes : this means that the court is dong something the first Californians would have regarded as outrageous .
But that goes for so many other issues as well , especially race and gender , where our core definitions have shifted with time and knowledge .
In 1993 a project called Wine was started as a way to run Windows applications on Linux without using an emulator .
Instead Wine serves as a compatibility layer that includes their own implementation of the Dynamic Link Libraries ( DLL ’s ) that make the Windows applications tick , and there has been a lot of reverse engineering done to get it to the current state .
It took over 12 years for the first Beta version of Wine to be released , and after a whopping 15 years Wine 1.0 will be shipping on June 6th , 2008 .
This has got to be one of the longest development cycles to reach version 1.0 !
One of their big goals for Wine 1.0 is to get Adobe Photoshop CS2 fully functional , which is something Google is sponsoring .
With over 1,200 compatible Windows applications adding Photoshop CS2 to the list will definitely be a huge success for the team and the software as a whole .
I ’m definitely excited about Wine 1.0 , but you can bet the bank that Microsoft is n’t jumping up and down in their seats .
Sure it means that they might sell more copies of Office , but as far as I know Microsoft has never exactly gone out of their way to help out Wine .

Doctors are calling for a clinical trial of an experimental drug treatment that it is claimed can reverse the symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease " in minutes " .
U.S. researchers say the treatment allowed an 82 - year - old sufferer to recognise his wife for the first time in years .
In the UK , specialists believe the claims should be properly tested as only a few patients have been treated so far .
The treatment involves injecting a drug called Enbrel - which is normally used to treat arthritis - into the spine at the neck .
Patients are then tilted to encourage blood flow into the brain where the drug is designed to block a chemical responsible for inflammation .
At least one Alzheimer 's patient had his symptoms reversed " in minutes " while others have shown some continuing improvement in problems such as forgetfulness and confusion after weekly injections .
They needed less help from carers during treatment , which appears to reach a plateau at three months .
Around 50 people are being treated by the Institute of Neurological Research , a private clinic in California , with some having had injections for three years .
In one case , the clinic has video evidence of Marvin Miller , 82 , which showed he was unable to answer basic questions by a nurse , or identify - everyday objects like a bracelet and a pencil .
Shortly afterwards he is injected with the drug and it is claimed that five minutes later he could greet his shocked wife , who said he had not recognised her for years .
The experiment follows the discovery that levels of TNF ( tumour necrosis factor ) can be up to 25 times higher in the fluid surrounding the brain in sufferers of Alzheimer 's disease .
Enbrel , a biologic treatment licensed for rheumatoid arthritis , binds to excess TNF in the body and makes it inactivate .
When used by arthritis sufferers , the drug is self - administered by injection and researchers had to develop a way of injecting the drug into the spine in order to get an effect in brain cells .
Enbrel is not approved for treating Alzheimer 's in the U.S. or in the UK and is regarded at this stage as a highly experimental therapy .
Professor Edward Tobinick , of the University of California Los Angeles and director of the Institute for Neurological Research , is leading the research .
He said the latest report was an in - depth account of one patient 's response to treatment .
He said : " It makes practical changes that are significant and perceptible , making a difference to his ability to do activities of daily living such as getting around , accomplishing things and conversing . "
He added : " Some patients have been able to start driving again .
They do n't come back to normal but the change is good enough for patients to want to continue treatment , and some have been doing so for three years .
" We are working with several universities and larger trials are getting under way . "
Dr Susanne Sorensen , head of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " On the surface these results are exciting but we need to treat the study with caution .
" There are large gaps in the research , which only involved a small pilot group and we cannot draw any conclusions until a controlled trial is carried out . "
Rebecca Wood , chief executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said : " It is too early to speak of a miracle cure and we need to do more research into this . "
The post below will only compile on a version of GHC >= 6.9 , since it uses type families .
There has been a lot of posting recently about automatic differentiation in Haskell , and I wanted to try the same thing with functors in the spirit of Conor McBride 's Clowns to the Left of me , Jokers to the Right and The derivative of a regular type is its type of one hole contexts , figuring that a Power Series could fully generalize Christophe Poucet 's Higher Order Zippers , and might provide me with a neat extension to the zipper comonadic automata I 've been aluding to recently .
{-# OPTIONS - fglasgow - exts - fallow-undecidable -instances -fallow - overlapping - instances #-} module Derivatives where import Control .
Monad .
Identity import Control .
Arrow ( ( +++ ) , ( *** ) , ( &&& ) ) import Data .
Monoid infixl 9 :. : infixl 7 :*: infixl 6 :+:
To avoid importing category - extras and keep this post self - contained ( modulo GHC 6.9 ! ) , we 'll define some preliminaries such as Bifunctors :
class Bifunctor f where bimap :: ( a -> c ) -> ( b -> d ) -> f a b -> f c d instance Bifunctor ( , ) where bimap f g ~ ( a , b ) = ( f a , g b ) instance Bifunctor Either where bimap f _ ( Left a ) = Left ( f a ) bimap _ g ( Right b ) = Right ( g b )
Constant functors :
data Void instance Show Void where show _ = " Void " newtype Const k a = Const { runConst :: k } deriving ( Show ) type Zero = Const Void type One = Const ( ) instance Functor ( Const k ) where fmap f = Const .
runConst
and functor products and coproducts :
newtype Lift p f g a = Lift { runLift :: p ( f a ) ( g a ) } type ( :+ : ) = Lift Either type ( :* : ) = Lift ( , ) instance Show ( p ( f a ) ( g a ) ) =>
Show ( Lift p f g a ) where show ( Lift x ) = " ( Lift ( " ++ show x ++ " ) ) " instance ( Bifunctor p , Functor f , Functor g ) =>
Functor ( Lift p f g ) where fmap f =
Lift . bimap ( fmap f ) ( fmap f ) .
runLift
and finally functor composition
newtype ( f :. : g ) a = Comp { runComp :: f ( g a ) } deriving ( Show ) instance ( Functor f , Functor g ) =>
Functor ( f :. : g ) where fmap f = Comp . fmap ( fmap f ) .
runComp
So then , an ideal type for repeated differentiation would look something like the following , for some definition of D .
[ Edit : sigfpe pointed out , quite rightly , that this is just repeated differentiation , and apfelmus pointed out that it not a power series , because I have no division ! ]
newtype AD f a = AD { runAD :: ( f a , AD ( D f ) a ) }
As a first crack at D , you might be tempted to just go with a type family :
{- type family D ( f :: * -> *) :: * -> * type instance D Identity =
One type instance D ( Const k ) =
Zero type instance D ( f :+ : g ) = D f :+ : D g type instance D ( f :*: g ) = f :*: D g :+ : D f :* : g type instance D ( f :. : g ) = ( D f :. : g ) :*: D g -}
This could take you pretty far , but unfortunately does n't adequately provide you with any constraints on the type so that we can treat AD f as a functor .
So , we 'll go with :
class ( Functor ( D f ) , Functor f ) =>
Derivable ( f :: * -> * ) where type D f :: * -> *
and cherry pick the instances necessary to handle the above cases :
instance Derivable Identity where type D Identity = One instance Derivable ( Const k ) where type D ( Const k ) = Zero instance ( Derivable f , Derivable g ) =>
Derivable ( f :+ : g ) where type D ( f :+ : g ) = D f :+ : D g instance ( Derivable f , Derivable g ) =>
Derivable ( f :* : g ) where type D ( f :* : g ) = f :*: D g :+ : D f :* : g instance ( Derivable f , Derivable g ) =>
Derivable ( f :. : g ) where type D ( f :. : g ) = ( D f :. : g ) :*: D g
With those instances in hand , we can define the definition of a Functor for the automatic differentiation of a Functor built out of these primitives :
instance ( Derivable f , Functor ( AD ( D f ) ) ) =>
Functor ( AD f ) where fmap f = Power .
bimap ( fmap f ) ( fmap f ) .
runPower
Unfortunately , here is where I run out of steam , because any attempt to actually use the construct in question blows the context stack because the recursion for Functor ( AD f ) is n't well founded and my attempts to force it to be so through overlapping - instances have thus - far failed .
Thoughts ?

On December 1 , 2006 , one of the eeriest autopsies in the annals of crime was conducted at the Royal London Hospital .
Three British pathologists , covered from head to toe in white protective suits , stood around a radioactive corpse that had been sealed in plastic for nearly a week .
The victim was Alexander Litvinenko , a 44 - year - old ex-KGB officer who had defected from Russia to England in November 2000 and had drawn on his experience to denounce the government of the newly installed President Putin .
What the pathologists found is still a state secret .
Click Image to Enlarge Natasja Weitsz / Getty Alexander Litvinenko in the intensive care unit of University College London Hospital on November 20 , 2006 , three days
before his death from radiation poisoning .
The mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of Litvinenko , apparently from radiation poisoning , spawned an international crisis .
Britain demanded that Russia extradite a Russian citizen allegedly connected to the case .
When it refused , Britain expelled four Russian diplomats from London , in reprisals reminiscent of the Cold War .
The British authorities had told the press , " We are 100 percent sure who administered the poison , where and how , " but they refused to disclose their evidence .
Nonetheless , the consensus that the Russian secret service was behind the poisoning was so powerful that a Washington Post editorial could assert that the poison " dose was almost certainly carried by one or both of the former Russian security operatives  one of them also a KGB alumnus  whom Mr. Litvinenko met at a London hotel Nov. 1 . "
To find out what evidence the British had actually provided to the Russians to back up their extradition request , I went to Moscow to meet with the Russian prosecutors in charge of the case .
My investigation made it clear that far more was involved than the killing of an innocent dissident .
The Berezovsky Connection
Before Vladimir Putin took over the Kremlin in 2000 , Russia 's most powerful oligarch had probably been Boris Berezovsky .
He controlled the country 's largest television channel and a large part of the private economy , and served as deputy secretary of Russia 's National Security Council .
He also had his own protector in Litvinenko , the deputy head of the organized crime unit of the KGB 's successor , the Federal Security Service , or FSB .
But even Litvinenko could not help Mr. Berezovsky when Mr. Putin turned on him and had him investigated for massive fraud .
In late 1999 , Mr. Berezovsky fled to Britain , followed by Litvinenko a year later .
In London , Mr. Berezovsky had an extraordinary agenda , which he himself described as overthrowing the regime of his archenemy , Mr. Putin .
Litvinenko , whom Mr. Berezovsky now supported through his foundation , took a key role in this ambitious enterprise .
He wrote books accusing Mr. Putin's FSB of everything from collaborating with the leadership of al - Qaeda to framing Chechen rebels for bloody acts of terrorism that FSB agents themselves committed , such as the bombing of six apartment houses in which over 300 people died .
In addition , Litvinenko also had less visible employment as a consult for two closely connected security companies housed in Berezovsky 's office building at 25 Grosvenor Square .
The Slow Death
Litvinenko's day of reckoning came on November 1 , 2006 .
First he had lunch at Itsu , a trendy sushi restaurant in Piccadilly , with an Italian associate , Mario Scaramella .
Mr. Scaramella , who had flown in from Naples the night before , had been involved with Litvinenko in , among other things , a Byzantine plot to penetrate the operations of a suspected trafficker in prostitutes , arms , and enriched uranium .
At that lunch , Mr. Scaramella gave Litvinenko some documents .
Litvinenko then proceeded to the Millennium Hotel , where he had an appointment to see Andrei Lugovoi , who had also served in the FSB up until 1999 and who now owned a private security firm in Moscow .
He had been meeting with Mr. Lugovoi on his trips to London for several months , and two weeks earlier had brought him to Erinys International , one of the security companies in Mr. Berezovsky 's building , to discuss a business proposal .
According to Mr. Lugovoi , Litvinenko now wanted to discuss the progress of that venture , and so met him and his business associate Dmitry Kovtun in the crowded Pine Bar for tea .
After leaving the Pine Bar , Litvinenko went to Mr. Berezovsky 's office .
When he returned home , according to his wife Marina , he felt ill .
Two days later , he was admitted to Barnet General Hospital .
During his stay at the hospital , Litvinenko 's condition continually worsened .
The initial diagnosis was that he had been poisoned by Thallium , a non-radioactive toxin used in Russian rat poison .
Since the KGB had reportedly used Thallium as a poison in the Cold War era , the theory gained traction in the press that Litvinenko might have been the victim of the FSB .
As Litvinenko had been denouncing the FSB for six years , it seemed at least plausible that the FSB had sought revenge on him .
The main , if not only , source for the revenge - murder scenario were people funded by Mr. Berezovsky .
A Web site in France , which had received financing from Mr. Berezovsky 's foundation , circulated a report that there was a Russian " hit list " that had Litvinenko 's name on it .
Even though the " hit list " itself never materialized , it helped link the death of Litvinenko in the public mind with that of Anna Politkovskaya , the crusading journalist who had been murdered a month earlier , in October 2006 , and whose name was also on the putative hit list .
Meanwhile , a Chechen website , also supported by Mr. Berezovsky 's foundation , ran stories such as " FSB Attempted to Murder Russian Defector in London . "
At the hospital , Mr. Berezovsky 's PR consultant , Lord Tim Bell , began briefing journalists , arranging interviews , and supplying photographs of an emaciated , hairless Litvinenko .
Meanwhile , Litvinenko was moved to University College Hospital and given massive doses of the cyanide - based antidote for Thallium , which did not work .
As Litvinenko's condition grew critical , Alex Goldfarb , the executive director of Mr. Berezovsky 's foundation , prepared for Litvinenko 's end by writing out his " deathbed " statement , which , according to Mr. Goldfarb , was drawn from statements Litvinenko had dictated to him .
A few hours after Litvinenko died on November 23 , 2006 , Mr. Goldfarb arranged a press conference and released the sensational deathbed statement accusing Mr. Putin of the poisoning .
Giving further weight to this theory , British authorities switched the alleged crime scene from the Itsu restaurant , where Litvinenko had met the Italian Mr. Scaramella , to the Pine Bar , where he had met the Russian Mr. Lugovoi .
Just two hours before Litvinenko died , an unscripted surprise developed in the story :
The hospital discovered that he had not been poisoned with Thallium .
Instead , lab tests showed that he had in his body one of the world 's rarest and most tightly controlled radioactive isotopes , Polonium - 210 .
The Polonium Warning
Polonium - 210 is of great interest to the UN 's nuclear proliferation watchdogs because it is a critical component in early - stage nuclear bombs .
Both America and Russia used it as part of the trigger in their early bombs .
So did most , if not all , countries with clandestine nuclear programs , including Israel , India , Pakistan , South Africa , and North Korea .
To be sure , some of these nuclear powers shifted to more sophisticated triggers after they tested their weapons .
Even so , as a declassified Los Alamos document notes , the detection of Polonium - 210 remains " a key indication of a nuclear weapons program in its early stages . "
So when Polonium - 210 was detected in Iraq in 1991 , Iran in 2004 , and North Korea in October 2006 , the concern was that these countries might be trying to build a nuclear weapon .
When Polonium - 210 was discovered in London in late November 2006 in Litvinenko's body , however , no such proliferation alarm bells went off .
Instead , the police assumed that this component of early - stage nuclear bombs had been smuggled into London solely to commit a murder .
It would be as if a suitcase nuclear bomb had been found next to an irradiated corpse in London , and everyone assumed the bomb had been smuggled into the country solely to murder that person .
Michael Specter , in the New Yorker , for example , called it the " first known case of nuclear terrorism perpetrated against an individual . "
But why would anyone use a nuclear weapon to kill an individual , when a knife , bullet , or conventional poison would do the trick more quickly , efficiently , and certainly ?
Certainly Polonium - 210 is lethal once it gets into the blood stream .
Before Litvinenko's death , six people died of exposure to Polonium - 210  two in a radiation lab in France , three in a nuclear facility in Israel , and one in a nuclear research lab in Russia .
All resulted from accidental leakage of Polonium - 210 .
Because it is unstable , turning into a gas at 55 degrees Celsius , it is extremely difficult to handle .
It is also expensive .
The Mythic Smoking Gun
A scientist by training , Mr. Goldfarb authoritatively asserted in his book " Death of a Dissident , " written with Marina Litvinenko , that " 97 % of the known production of Polonium ... takes place in Russia . "
Since little else had been written about this rare isotope , many commentators assumed it was an established fact .
An article in the New Yorker noted , " Nearly all of it [ Polonium - 210 ] is produced in Russia . "
To make such a determination , it is necessary to know both how much Polonium - 210 is produced in Russia and how much is produced in other countries .
Yet , as Polonium - 210 production is a closely guarded secret , neither quantity is known .
In 2006 , neither Russia nor any other country in the world admitted manufacturing any Polonium - 210 at all .
Russia 's nuclear authority claims that the sole reactor that had been manufacturing its Polonium - 210 had been shut down in 2004 , and the small quantity exported to America in 2005 and 2006  approximately 3 ounces each year  came out of its stockpile .
No doubt Russia could secretly manufacture Polonium - 210 , a process that first requires radiating the metal Bismuth in a nuclear reactor and then extracting from it the Polonium - 210 .
But so could America , Britain , China , France , India , Israel , Pakistan , Taiwan , North Korea , or any other country whose nuclear reactors have not been inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN 's watchdog for Polonium production .
When I asked an IAEA scientist about who had produced any Polonium - 210 in 2006 , he said , " We simply do n't know . "
He added that North Korea might have produced large quantities , " kilograms not grams , " at its Yongbyon reactor for its nuclear tests in October 2006 , but the actual amount is uncertain .
The Polonium - 210 found in London could also have come from stockpiles in many countries , including America .
According to the IAEA 's Illicit Trafficking Data Base , there had been 14 incidents of missing industrial Polonium - 210 since 2004 .
The minute amount found in London  possibly no more than one - millionth of an ounce  could have come from many sources , ranging from the American industrial supply and stockpiles in Russia to the remnants of the A.Q. Khan network in Pakistan and the North Korean surplus .
So news reports , such as the one in the Washington Post that " Polonium is produced and held almost exclusively in Russia , " are at best speculation .
The British Gambit
The British prosecutors aided the flight from reality by filing an extradition request in July 2007 .
Not only was there no extradition treaty between Britain and Russia , but Article 61 of the Russian Constitution prohibited the extradition from Russia of any of its citizens .
Further inflaming matters , Sir Tony Brenton , the British Ambassador to Moscow , suggested that the Putin government should disregard the Russian constitution and " work with us creatively to find a way around this impediment , " since British authorities had " cooperated closely and at length with the Russian Prosecutor General 's Office . "
After Russia rejected the extradition request , Ambassador Brenton objected that its decision was not made " on the basis of the evidence , " which implied that Britain had furnished Russia with compelling evidence to back up its request .
Then Britain expelled four members of the Russian embassy in London , effectively holding the Russian government responsible for Litvinenko's death , and began an international imbroglio .
The suspect named in the extradition request is Andrei Lugovoi , who , according to the British , poisoned Litvinenko's tea in the Pine Bar when they met on November 1 , 2006 .
Mr. Lugovoi admitted to meeting with Litvinenko to discuss a business venture with him , but denied having anything to do with his death .
Mr. Lugovoi also had been contaminated by Polonium - 210 , but so was almost everyone else who had come in contact with Litvinenko around that time .
Since Ambassador Brenton had suggested that the incriminating parts of the case had been given to the Russian authorities to back up the extradition request , I went to Moscow to find out about more about that evidence .
The Moscow Inquiry
The Kremlin is not known to be forthcoming with secret documents , but , in this instance , I was asking to see British , not Russian secrets .
Even so , obtaining access to them was not easy .
By the time I arrived in Moscow in late November 2007 , the Russian Prosecutor General had consigned this ( as well as other high - profile investigations ) to a new unit called the National Investigative Committee .
It was headed by Alexander Bastrykin , a former law professor and a deputy attorney general from St. Petersburg , who was just assembling his staff in a non-descript but well - guarded building across the street from Moscow 's elite Higher Technical University in the district of Lefortovo .
Before I could meet officials in a conference room there to review the British file , my resourceful research associate in Moscow had spent many weeks sending the necessary documents to Mr. Bastrykin and his staff .
There were other bureaucratic requisites , such as my agreeing to indemnify the Russian government for any costs that resulted from disclosing the British evidence , submitting my proposed questions , and agreeing not to identify by name any of the officials working for the Committee and refer to them collectively as the " Russian investigators . "
Then I was told , " The media often reproach the Russian side for its unwillingness to cooperate with the British side , when in reality the situation is reverse . "
As if to demonstrate this point , the Russian investigators provided me with access to the British files .
What immediately caught my attention was that it did not include the basic documents in any murder case , such as the postmortem autopsy report , which would help establish how  and why  Litvinenko died .
In lieu of it , Detective Inspector Robert Lock of the Metropolitan Police Service at the New Scotland Yard wrote that he was " familiar with the autopsy results " and that Litvinenko had died of " Acute Radiation Syndrome . "
Like Sherlock
Holmes 's clue of the dog that did n't bark , this omission was illuminating in itself .
After all , Britain and Russia had embarked on a joint investigation of the Litvinenko case , which , as far the Russians were concerned , involved the Polonium - 210 contamination of the Russian citizens who had contact with Litvinenko .
They needed to determine when , how , and under what circumstances Litvinenko had been exposed to the radioactive nuclear component .
The " when " question required access to the toxicology analysis , which usually is part of the autopsy report .
There had already been a leak to a British newspaper that toxicologists had found two separate " spikes " of Polonium - 210 in Litvinenko 's body , which would indicate that he had been exposed at two different times to Polonium - 210 .
Such a multiple exposure could mean that Litvinenko was in contact with the Polonium - 210 days , or even weeks , before he fatally ingested it .
To answer the " how " question , they wanted to see the postmortem slides of Litvinenko 's lungs , digestive track , and body , which also are part of the autopsy report .
These photos could show if Litvinenko had inhaled , swallowed , or gotten the Polonium - 210 into the blood stream through an open cut .
The Russian investigators also wanted to know why Litvinenko was not given the correct antidote in the hospital and why the radiation had not been correctly diagnosed for more than three weeks .
They said that their repeated requests to speak to the doctors and see their notes were " denied " and that none of the material they received in the " joint investigation " even " touched upon the issue of the change in Litvinenko 's diagnosis from Thallium poisoning to Polonium poisoning . "
They added , " We have no trustworthy data on the cause of death of Litvinenko since the British authorities have refused to provide the necessary documents . "
The only document provided in the British file indicating that a crime had been committed is an affidavit by Rosemary Fernandez , a Crown Prosecutor , stating that the extradition request is " in accordance with the criminal law of England and Wales , as well as with the European Convention on Extradition 1957 . "
The Radiation Trail
The British police summarized their case against Mr. Lugovoi in a report that accompanied the extradition papers .
But instead of citing any conventional evidence , such as eyewitness accounts , surveillance videos of the Pine Bar , fingerprints on a poison container ( or even the existence of a container ) , or Mr. Lugovoi 's possible motive , the report was almost entirely based on a " trail " of Polonium - 210 radiation that had been detected many weeks after they had been in contact with the Polonium - 210 .
From the list of the sites supplied to the Russian investigators , it is clear that a number of them coincide with Mr. Lugovoi 's movements in October and November 2006 , but the direction is less certain .
When Mr. Lugovoi flew from Moscow to London on October 15 on Transaero Airlines , no radiation traces were found on his plane .
It was only after he had met with Litvinenko at Erinys International on October 16 that traces were found on the British Airways planes on which he later flew , suggesting to the Russian investigators that the trail began in London and then went to Moscow .
They also found that in London the trail was inexplicably erratic , with traces that were found , as they noted , " in a place where a person stayed for a few minutes , but were absent in the place where he was staying for several hours , although these events follow one after another . "
When the Russian investigators asked the British for a comprehensive list of all the sites tested , the British refused , saying it was not " in the interest of their investigation . "
This refusal led the Russian investigators to suspect that the British might be truncating the trail to " fit their case . "
Despite its erratic nature , the radioactive trail clearly involved the Millennium Hotel .
Traces were found both in rooms in which Mr. Lugovoi and his family stayed between October 31 and November 2 , and the hotel 's Pine Bar , where Litvinenko met Messrs .
Lugovoi and Kovtun in the early evening of November 1 .
If Litvinenko's tea was indeed poisoned at that Pine Bar meeting , as the British contended , Mr. Lugovoi could be placed at the crime scene .
But other than the radiation , the report cited no witnesses , video surveillance tapes , or other evidence that showed that the poisoning had occurred at the Pine Bar .
It could just as well have occurred early in the day at other sites that also tested positive for radiation .
Litvinenko , who was probably the best witness to that day 's events , initially said he believed that he had been poisoned at his lunch with Mr. Scaramella at the Itsu restaurant .
Even one week after he had been in the hospital , he gave a bedside BBC radio interview in which he still pointed to that meeting , saying Mr. Scaramella " gave me some papers .... after several hours I felt sick with symptoms of poisoning . "
At no time did he even mention his later meeting at the Pine Bar with Mr. Lugovoi .
Not only did the Itsu have traces of Polonium - 210 , but Mr. Scaramella was contaminated .
Since Mr. Scaramella had just arrived from Italy and had not met with either Mr. Lugovoi or Mr. Kovtun , Litvinenko was the only one among those people known to be exposed to Polonium - 210 who could have contaminated him .
Which means that Litvinenko had been tainted by the Polonium - 210 before he met Mr. Lugovoi as the Pine Bar .
Litvinenko certainly could have been contaminated well before his meeting with Mr. Scaramella .
Several nights earlier , he had gone to the Hey Joey club in Mayfair .
According to its manager , Litvinenko was seated in the VIP lap - dancing cubicle that later tested positive for Polonium - 210 .
The most impressive piece of evidence involves the relatively high level of Polonium - 210 in Mr. Lugovoi 's room at the Millennium Hotel .
Although the police report does not divulge the actual level itself ( or any other radiation levels ) , Detective Inspector Lock states that an expert witness called " Scientist A " found that these hotel traces " were at such a high level as to establish a link with the original Polonium source material . "
Since no container for the Polonium - 210 was ever found , " Scientist A " presumably is basing his opinion on a comparison of the radiation level in Mr. Lugovoi 's room and other sites , such as Litvinenko 's home or airplane seats .
Such evidence would only be meaningful if the different sites had been pristine when the measurements were taken .
However , all the sites , including the Millennium hotel rooms , had been compromised by weeks of usage and cleaning .
So the differences in the radiation levels could have resulted from extraneous factors , such as vacuuming , or heating conditions .
The Russian investigators also found these levels had little evidentiary value because the British had provided " no reliable information regarding who else visited the hotel room in the interval between when Lugovoi departed and when the traces of polonium 210 were discovered . "
As a result of this nearly month - long gap , they could not " rule out the possibility that the discovered traces could have originated through cross-contamination by outside parties . "
Hospital tests confirmed that Messrs .
Lugovoi , Kovtun , and Scaramella and Litvinenko's widow , Marina , all had some contact with Polonium - 210 .
But it is less clear who contaminated whom .
The Russian investigators concluded that the all the radiation traces provided in the British report , including the " high level " cited by " Scientist A , " could have emanated from a single event , such as a leak  by design or accident  at the October 16 meeting at the security company in Berezovsky 's building .
But they could not find " a single piece of evidence which would confirm the charge brought against A.K. Lugovoi . "
Britain may have had more incriminating evidence against Mr. Lugovoi than it chose to provide to Russia .
It may not have wanted to share data that would reveal intelligence sources .
But why would it refuse to share such basic evidence as the autopsy report , the medical findings , and radiation data ?
And if Britain wanted to extradite Mr. Lugovoi , why would it send such embarrassingly thin substantiation ?
Mr. Putin blamed British incompetence , saying , " If the people who have sent us this request did not know that the Russian Constitution prohibits extradition of Russian citizens to foreign countries , then , of course , this would make their level of competence questionable . "
But here he may have underestimated the British purpose in staging this gambit .
The End Game
Before the extradition dispute , Russian investigators , in theory , could have questioned relevant witnesses in London .
Their proposed roster of witnesses suggested that Russian interest extended to the Russian expatriate community in Britain , or " Londongrad , " as it is now called .
The Litvinenko case provided the Russians with the opportunity for a fishing expedition , since Litvinenko had at the time of his death worked with many of Russia 's enemies , including Mr. Berezovsky ; his foundation head , Mr. Goldfarb , who dispensed money to a web of anti-Putin websites ; his Chechen ally Akhmed Zakayev , who headed a commission investigating Russian war crimes in Chechnya ( for which Litvinenko acted as an investigator ) , and former owners of the expropriated oil giant Yukos , who were battling in the courts to regain control of billions of dollars in its off - shore bank accounts .
The Russian investigation could also have veered into Litvinenko 's activities in the shadowy world of security consultants , including his dealings with the two security companies in Mr. Berezovsky 's building , Erinys International and Titon International , and his involvement with Mr. Scaramella in an attempt to plant incriminating evidence on a suspected nuclear - component smuggler  a plot for which Mr. Scaramella was jailed after his phone conversations with Litvinenko were intercepted by the Italian national police .
The Russians had asked for more information about radiation traces at the offices of these companies , and Mr. Lugovoi had said that at one of these companies , Erinys , he had been offered large sums of money to provide compromising information about Russian officials .
Mr. Kovtun , who also attended that meeting , backs up Mr. Lugovoi 's story .
Such charges had the potential for embarrassing not only the security companies that had employed Litvinenko and employed former Scotland Yard and British intelligence officers , but the British government , since it had provided Litvinenko with a passport under the alias " Edwin Redwald Carter " to travel to parts of the former Soviet Union .
The British extradition gambit ended the Russian investigation in Londongrad .
It also discredited Mr. Lugovoi 's account by naming him as a murder suspect .
In terms of a public relations tactic , it resulted in a brilliant success by putting the blame on Russian stonewalling for the failure to solve the mystery .
What it obscured is the elephant - in - the - room that haunts the case : the fact that a crucial component for building an early - stage nuke was smuggled into London in 2006 .
Was it brought in merely as a murder weapon or as part of a transaction on the international arms market ?
There is little , if any , possibility , that this question will be answered in the present stalemate .
The Russian prosecutor - general has declared that the British case is baseless ; Mr. Lugovoi , elected to the Russian Parliament in December 2007 , now has immunity from prosecution , and Mr. Scaramella , under house arrest in Naples , has been silenced .
The press , for its part , remains largely fixated on a revenge murder theory that corresponds more closely to the SMERSH villain in James Bond movies than to the reality of the case of the smuggled Polonium - 210 .
After considering all the evidence , my hypothesis is that Litvinenko came in contact with a Polonium - 210 smuggling operation and was , either wittingly or unwittingly , exposed to it .
Litvinenko had been a person of interest to the intelligence services of many countries , including Britain 's MI - 6 , Russia 's FSB , America 's CIA ( which rejected his offer to defect in 2000 ) , and Italy 's SISMI , which was monitoring his phone conversations .
His murky operations , whatever their purpose , involved his seeking contacts in one of the most lawless areas in the former Soviet Union , the Pankisi Gorge , which had become a center for arms smuggling .
He had also dealt with people accused of everything from money laundering to trafficking in nuclear components .
These activities may have brought him , or his associates , in contact with a sample of Polonium - 210 , which then , either by accident or by design , contaminated and killed him .
To unlock the mystery , Britain must make available its secret evidence , including the autopsy report , the comprehensive list of places in which radiation was detected , and the surveillance reports of Litvinenko and his associates .
If Britain considers it too sensitive for public release , it should be turned over to an international commission of inquiry .
The stakes are too high here to leave unresolved the mystery of the smuggled Polonium - 210 .
May 26 , 2008  -- PHOENIX ( AP ) - A rattlesnake strikes .
The victim experiences extreme pain at the location of the bite , nausea , sometimes diarrhea .
Then the mouth and throat swell , making it difficult to breath .
The victim gets lightheaded , collapses and goes into shock -- all within minutes of the strike .
The potentially deadly symptoms used to be fairly rare , but toxicologists in Arizona , Colorado and California say they 're seeing some or all of them more than ever , and that they could be contributing to an increase in fatal rattlesnake bites in Arizona .
At least five people have died from rattlesnake bites in Arizona since 2002 -- three or four of them from the extreme symptoms , said Steve Curry , director of medical toxicology at the Banner Poison Control Center in Phoenix .
Curry could recall just five fatal rattlesnake bites in the two decades before 2002 .
Scientists and toxicologists can take guesses at what 's behind the spike in extreme symptoms , but no one yet knows what 's going on .
Some say it could be a change in snake venom , a change in the snakes themselves , or something altogether different .
" This is a brand new phenomenon , " said Jeffrey Brent , clinical professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center .
" It should spur a considerable amount of research in the area . "
Brent said he had n't seen the extreme symptoms in patients until last year , when there were five .
" They came pretty darn close to dying , " he said .
" They were extremely , extremely sick . "
He said there have n't been any such bites so far this year , but that the season is just getting started .
Rattlesnake bite victims in California began showing symptoms of weakness , breathing trouble and low blood pressure this year , said Richard Clark , director of the division of medical toxicology at the University of California - San Diego .
He said about a dozen people have been affected and one patient has died since January .
In Arizona , Curry said those who have n't died from the extreme symptoms become critically ill and often take months to recover .
" We 're seeing patients now because of the severe shock they 've been in , who have had severe strokes , and who have had loss of some intestines because of impaired blood flow and who have gone into kidney failure , " he said .
" These are things that we did not see at all in years past , but now we see them a few times each summer . "
In each state , the snakes responsible for the bites have been different .
It 's the Southern Pacific Rattlesnake in California , the prairie rattlesnake in Colorado and the Mojave in Arizona .
In letters last week , Arizona authorities notified hundreds of physicians and emergency rooms of the extreme symptoms , which can be mistaken for other ailments and delay the injection of antivenin .
Colorado and California authorities say they 're taking a wait - and - see approach to the situation .
Russ Johnson , president of the Phoenix Herpetological Society , said he 's been bitten twice by rattlers , and one nearly cost him his life .
He said he was handling a Western Diamondback at his home when it struck in 2001 , and because one of the snake 's fangs got caught in his knuckle , he got a full dose of venom .
" She just lit me up , " he said .
" I 've had burns , broken bones , but this is intense and it is unrelenting . "
Johnson said it took 26 vials of antivenin to treat him .
His symptoms included swelling , dizziness , sensitivity to light and nausea , and the middle finger on his right hand turned black .
He still can't bend it .
" It took me six months to hold a paper cup of water without dropping it , and I still can't have road rage on the right - hand side . "

Smoking is the most potent known cause of lung cancer .
The question is :
Why do some longtime smokers come down with the deadly disease whereas others escape it ?
New research points to a genetic culprit that also was fingered as upping a person 's likelihood of becoming hooked on cigarettes .
Two new studies link a variation in a gene residing on chromosome 15 ( of a person 's 23 pairs of chromosomes ) to a heightened risk of developing lung cancer ; a third study suggests that the same mutation affects a person 's tendency to become addicted to smokes and , by extension , develop the dreaded disease .
Lung cancer is diagnosed in some 200,000 Americans and kills more than 150,000 each year .
The new research — published in both Nature and Nature Genetics — suggests that people with this genetic flaw have a 30 percent greater chance of developing the often - fatal illness .
But the studies differ on the potential added risk of addiction .
The findings offer insight into how this particular genetic variation and smoking interact to cause lung cancer .
They provide " new targets for starting to think about how to treat drug addiction and , also , of course , for the prevention or treatment of lung cancer , " says Nora Volkow , director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse ( NIDA ) in Bethesda , Md. , who was not involved in the study .
The research teams scanned a catalog of 300,000 minute changes in the genome in which a base ( unit of genetic material ) was either deleted , duplicated or substituted .
( Such alterations are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms , or SNPs . )
In one study , scientists from Iceland - based biotechnology company deCODE genetics tried to correlate these genetic variants with a person 's smoking habits ; the other research efforts attempted to tie them to lung cancer .
The deCODE group surveyed 50,000 Icelandic smokers about their habits ; using information gleaned from that survey as well as from genomic scans of 40,000 admitted smokers in the bunch , the researchers zeroed in on a variant of the gene CHRNA , which codes for a receptor on nerve cells that can be stimulated by nicotine .
The altered version of the gene was more common in the heaviest smokers than it was in the rest of the population .
" Nonsmokers have a higher frequency of this variant than smokers that smoke between one to 10 cigs per day , " notes neurologist Kári Stefánsson , deCODE 's CEO , " because if you smoke and you have this variant , you tend to smoke more than 10 cigs per day . "
When Stefánsson 's team applied the stats to the incidence of lung cancer , it found that individuals with two copies of the altered gene had a whopping 70 percent greater chance of developing lung cancer ; those with one copy had a 30 percent higher risk .
These findings are virtually identical to those of the other studies — one ( in Nature ) conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) in Lyon , France ( which was based on examinations of some 11,000 volunteers , 7,500 of whom were smokers ) and the other ( in Nature Genetics ) by a team at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston , which examined 9,000 individuals , some 4,000 of whom were smokers .
Paul Brennan , who led the IARC study , says he initially believed that the risk of getting lung cancer was elevated by the genetic predisposition to become addicted .
" The genes made you more likely to smoke , made you likely to smoke more , made you less likely to give up , and therefore more likely to develop lung cancer , " he says .
But his research showed that , in fact , the gene appeared to independently increase a person 's risk of developing the disease — with no link to addiction .
NIDA 's Volkow suggests that the gene variant may lead certain individuals to smoke more due to its effect on the brain 's reward centers ( associated with addictive behavior ) and may increase the risk of cancer , too , because it also plays a role in lung tissue function .
Epidemiologist Christopher Amos , who led the Texas study , notes that the same nicotine receptor implicated in this study was shown in previous research to prompt tumor growth in other areas of the body , most notably the thymus ( an organ located near the lungs that produces immune cells ) .
" Nicotine or its derivatives can stimulate cells to proliferate , participate in new blood vessel development , and also not undergo cell death , " he says , which are all characteristics of tumor formation and growth .
" So that raises the possibility that there 's a direct effect through nicotine in activating cells to go on to become cancerous . "
Brennan says more research is needed before the findings can be put into play .
" There 's not a public health message here that you can find out what version of the gene you have and decide whether to keep on smoking or not , " he says .
" You have to bear in mind that there are so many other disease [s ] that are caused by smoking . "
Recently , more than 100 workers in Pascagoula , Mississippi walked off the job at a Mississippi shipyard to protest conditions similar to slavery .
The workers , were protesting the conditions they have been living and working in since being hired from India after Hurricane Katrina .
According to the lawsuit filed in the workers ’ behalf , the workers were offered jobs , green cards and permanent residency in exchange for as much as $ 20,000 each that they paid to recruiters working for a Northrop Grumman subsidiary in Bombay .
One of the organizers of the march was quoted in a press release put out by the New Orleans Worker Justice Coalition , saying “ They promised us green cards and permanent residency , and instead gave us 10 - month visas and made us live like animals in company trailers , 24 to a room .
We were trapped between an ocean of debt at home and constant threats of deportation from our bosses in Mississippi . ”
When workers attempted to organize against these conditions the organizers were fired .
This is but the tip of the iceberg .
In what can only be termed circumstances similar to those of foreign workers hired by US and British companies to work on the ill - fated reconstruction of Iraq , the litany of abuses against those — both US - born and foreign — hired by various corporations to work in the reconstruction of New Orleans and the rest of the US southern coast hit by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
A recently released report by the New Orleans Worker Justice Coalition is an ongoing litany of corporate corruption , worker abuse and outright illegal and immoral violation of human rights .
Also in Mississippi , beginning July 1st , 2008 it will become a felony for an undocumented worker to hold a job .
Anyone caught working without papers “ shall be subject to imprisonment in the custody of the Department of Corrections for not less than one ( 1 ) year nor more than five ( 5 ) years , a fine of not less than one thousand dollars ( $ 1000 ) nor more than ten thousand dollars ( $ 10,000 ) or both . ”
Furthermore , anyone charged with the crime of working without papers will not be eligible for bail .
In Iowa , federal ICE agents arrested hundreds of workers at the Agriprocessors , Inc. meat packing plant .
The reason given by law enforcement was that the workers were using false social security numbers .
Of course , the facts are that people can’t work without a social security number and cannot get one unless they have been given some kind of legal status by the government — a status becoming more difficult to acquire by the day .
This is but one more Catch - 22 in the life of an immigrant in the US .
Meanwhile , in Danbury , CT a court upheld the use of undercover police acting as day - labor employers to arrest men and women looking for work in that city .
The workers were then deported .
In San Diego County , plans are underway to build two large detention centers that will hold immigrants without papers for indeterminate amounts of time .
Haliburton hopes to get the contract .
In South Carolina , Georgia and some other states , legislators have introduced laws forbidding the use of any language but English in the workplace .
Take a moment and imagine a country where some residents have more rights than others .
These residents can hold almost any job they desire .
They live in neighborhoods away from those of darker skin and lesser means .
The latter cannot hold any job they desire .
Part of the reason for this is because of the law and part of the reason is because of the nature of their education and social status .
Everyone must have identification that also signifies their social status , even though that status is primarily determined by the color of one ’s skin .
If one does not have such identification ( especially if they are not white ) , they are arrested .
If they or their relatives can not produce identification , the arrestees once released are doomed to a life living in the shadows , always wondering if they will be turned in by their employer or enemies .
The country I am talking about was apartheid South Africa .
Now , since the advent of NAFTA and other so - called free trade agreements , the national boundaries between North and South America have been economically erased .
If one stretches their imagination just a bit , it is possible to perceive the southern lands of Mexico and Central America as the equivalent of bantustans with the United States as their Capetown .
Furthermore , the identification legal immigrants to the United States are required to carry can be compared to the passes blacks in South Africa needed to get into different parts of the white - ruled South Africa .
If those passes were not in order or nonexistent , blacks were subject to arrest .
Likewise , if the various documents that the US government requires immigrants to carry and produce at will are not in order or nonexistent , those immigrants will be arrested .
Those immigrants without papers must live their lives in the shadows , always wondering if they will be turned in by their employer or enemies .
If they live in some parts of the United States , the discovery of their lack of documents might occur as the result of a roadblock set up by police to check people ’s identification .
Of course , there are a multitude of ways that these historical instances are not similar , but it is the underlying consciousness of fear is distressingly similar .
It is questionable whether or not most US citizens agree with the efforts listed above that target immigrants .
However , the lack of outcry by those who disagree with these attempts to dehumanize undocumented immigrants provides those invested in destroying immigrants ’ lives with a voice hopefully well beyond their numbers .
So does the willingness of the US public to ignore the family - shattering raids and imprisonment of thousands of immigrants for no other reason than not having the approved documents .
Implicit in this willingness is a sense that those being picked up and thrown in detention centers are not as human as “ real Americans . ”
If the lessons of authoritarian states have taught us anything , they should have taught us that we should be wary of those who would define a human being in ever - narrowing terms .

is n't hiring a massive legal team or working on advanced content snooping or filtering technology .
Those are traditional weapons in the war against armies of anonymous swashbucklers , and they have failed time and again .
Instead , the company wants to distribute music as easy - to - use and DRM - free MP3 files , available for free download with the blessing of the record companies .
In return for truly free music , all you 'd have to do would be to endure a few advertisements and possibly sign in with a Yahoo ID .
Visionaries have been asking for this since time immemorial .
Yahoo ! was champing at the bit a year ago .
That was weeks after Apple ( Nasdaq : AAPL ) CEO Steve Jobs played variations on the same theme , which later became DRM - free downloads in his iTunes music store -- at a premium price .
Heartened by the commotion , Amazon.com ( Nasdaq : AMZN ) rolled out a similar MP3 downloading service -- and the game was on .
Mighty Wal - Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) joined the fray , too .
All those baby steps cleared up one very important issue :
The labels learned that the lack of DRM would n't really increase illegal file sharing -- you can get an unencumbered file right off any old CD , so the piracy instigators just have to work a bit harder to get around most DRM implementations anyway .
But they also did n't make much of a dent in the unauthorized downloading activity , because the criminal method was still cheaper , and in many cases easier .
Intermezzo : adagio
You have to fight fire with fire , and beat the pirates at their own game .
Right now , the legal download services are fighting an uphill battle because a pirated file can move freely between cell phones , computers , iPods , and any other gadget that supports simple MP3 playback .
And trying new music is so much easier when you can do it for free .
Half of the battle is already won thanks to the MP3 tactics reverberating around Download Canyon .
An ad - supported service would knock the pirates ' other peg leg out , leaving no support for downloading music the illicit way anymore .
Some enlightened media executives have promised to treat piracy like any other competitor , beating it with the tools of the trade -- service , selection , and price .
Wrap it up in a pleasant user experience akin to the user - friendly iTunes store , and you 're onto something .
Finale : Alla breve
If Yahoo ! opens the floodgates and spends a couple of quarters ' effort on perfecting its offering , others will surely follow .
Competing media sellers like Amazon and subscription - based services like Napster ( Nasdaq : NAPS ) may be first in line while the studios figure out how to set up a free music store that can make money off converted pirates .
Yes , they will start as skeptics , but dollars and cents will always win them over .
And it does n't take much advertising revenue to keep the wheels of commerce rolling .
After all , the publishers will get to blast ads at eyeballs that used to go elsewhere and give nothing back .
Something is better than nothing ; ergo , the model will work .
For Yahoo ! , as the first mover in this wholesale revolution , it will do wonders for flagging user grabs and visit counts .
Until the nickel drops in everyone else 's slots , the pirate killer can also make plenty of money for the company itself .
There is more to being in the vanguard than just a badge of honor .
So let me thank Yahoo !
right here and now , in case both consumers and record labels forget to later .
It could go down in history as the midwife of a music industry reborn .

An untested production company has secured Christian Bale 's signature for a new trilogy of Terminator films and the coveted rights to the entire estate of Philip K Dick
He did say he would be back , but whether he can combine being the 38th governor of California and a relentless killing machine is another question .
What is certain is that Terminator is back for another three outings .
Producers behind the next trilogy are in Cannes to discuss the return of one of the most successful ever science fiction franchises .
Production began three weeks ago with Christian Bale starring as John Connor , fighting to save humanity against the machines .
But are the rumours true that Arnold Schwarzenegger will return , even briefly , to his " I 'll be back " role ?
" Unfortunately that 's something we can't tell you , " said producer Victor Kubicek .
Does that mean he could be ?
" I can't tell you that either .
Sorry .
I really can't tell you . "
Derek Anderson , co-producer of the trilogy , added : " At the moment we 're keeping everything under lock and key .
We want the fans to be really excited and surprised . "
So the surprise is he will be back ?
Silence .
Kubicek and Anderson are the men behind the Halcyon Company which has not only bought the rights to the Terminator franchise , but has secured first option on filming the still largely untapped works of science fiction writer Philip K Dick .
In a previous life Kubicek was the youngest person to hold a seat on the American stock exchange while Anderson 's background is advertising and marketing .
They both claim to be diehard Terminator anoraks .
" We were both big Terminator fans which is why we acquired the franchise .
We 're approaching it as real fans - what would make us really happy to see in the next Terminator movie ? " said Anderson .
" It 's about it being fresh , exciting and have all the action and intensity everyone expects from a Terminator film with real heart and soul . "
The first movie , Terminator Salvation : The Future Begins , is due to be released this time next year complete with online and offline games .
Kubicek and Anderson said the budget would be around what was spent on Terminator 3 which , given it was reportedly the most expensive independently produced movie ever at $ 187 m , is quite a budget .
The return of Terminator carries on the Hollywood tradition of reviving successful franchises to varying degrees of success - Indiana Jones this week , Rambo , Rocky , Die Hard over the past year - but the producers are adamant that there is fresh life in this particular series .
" If you think of where Terminator 3 left off , there 's still a lot of potential story to be told , " said Anderson .
" This film is all set in the future and a lot of the real fans want to know what happens .
Being huge fans , we wanted to know the rest of the story . "
Anderson and Kubicek met three years ago and set up Halcyon after they realised they shared a love of science fiction and gaming .
Neither man appears to be a stereotypical movie mogul : " We came from the outside in which has allowed us to do things differently , " said Kubicek .
Winning first option on Dick 's writing is certainly eye catching .
His stories have been adapted into movies such as Blade Runner , Minority Report and Total Recall and influenced others including The Matrix , but with 44 novels and more than 120 short stories in the canon , Halcyon believe there is a huge seam left to be exploited .
" It truly is a treasure trove , " said Kubicek .
The early plans include two movies , a major animation and two games based on his work as a direct result of the partnership deal with the Dick estate .
" Philip 's daughters have never allowed anyone this kind of access before , " said Kubicek .
" We 've forged a very trusting relationship with them and we truly share a similar sensibility .
Until we closed the deal we did n't realise how coveted the library was in Hollywood . "
The Terminator 4 director is McG , responsible for the Charlie 's Angels movies , and Bale is signed up for all three instalments of the next trilogy while Australian actor Sam Worthington is playing another lead character called Marcus after being recommended for the role by original Terminator director James Cameron .
Terminator : the story so far
It all started with Schwarzenegger as a cyborg sent back from the future to murder Sarah Connor in order to prevent her unborn son , John , from going on to lead a successful resistance against the robots and saving humanity .
Needless to say , he failed .
Pretty much the same thing happened the next time round , only Schwarzenegger played a good Terminator , sent to protect the sectioned Sarah Connor from a later model .
In the third , Rise of the Machines , an even more souped - up Terminator attempts to kill off John Connor and his future wife Kate .
Now the fourth , fifth and sixth promise to reveal what was going on in the future .
What is it about small , quirky museums that makes them so compelling ?
Perhaps it 's because they can be traced to antiquity , when Greco - Roman temples would display both wondrous artworks and pagan relics — the spear of Achilles , Helen of Troy 's sandal , or " giants ' bones " ( usually petrified mammoth remains ) .
Medieval cathedrals carried on the tradition : tortoise shells or " griffin's eggs " ( actually those of ostriches ) might be placed alongside the relics of saints .
In the Renaissance , Italian princes began assembling cabinets of curiosities , eclectic displays that could include any creation of man or nature : Egyptian mummies , pearls , Classical sculptures , insects , giant seashells or " unicorn horns " ( most often from narwhals ) .
The Italian collecting mania spread , so that by the end of the 18th century , there were thousands of private galleries in affluent homes all over Europe .
On their grand tours of the Continent , travelers could journey from one marvelous living room to the next , surveying beautiful and mystifying objects .
By the mid-1800s , state - funded institutions such as the Louvre , the British Museum and Madrid 's Prado had begun to acquire these private collections , many of which had been inherited by family members who lacked either the finances or the enthusiasm to maintain them .
Yet despite large museums ' financial advantage , small , esoteric museums have held on tenaciously .
In fact , Europe is still full of them , and they induce a devotion that their grander counterparts often do not .
Many of these small collections are still housed in their owners ' original homes and reflect their personalities .
A number of them boast collections that would have pride of place in larger museums , but the domestic settings allow a sense of intimacy hard to find in vast galleries .
And despite their idiosyncrasies , these house museums often provide a rare entree into a city 's history and character .
Here are four favorites :
London
Sir John Soane 's Museum
It was a damp London evening when I crossed the large , leafy square of Lincoln 's Inn Fields toward a tasteful row of dun-colored Georgian town houses .
On closer inspection , the facade of No. 13 announced this was no ordinary house : mortared into the Italian loggia , or veranda , of creamy Portland stone were four Gothic pedestals , while a pair of replicas of ancient Greek caryatids were mounted above .
But these flourishes only hinted at the marvelous world that lies within the former home of Sir John Soane ( 1753 - 1837 ) , one of Britain 's most distinguished architects — and diligent collectors .
Soane not only turned his house into a lavish private museum , he provided that nothing could be altered after his death .
As a result , Sir John Soane 's Museum may be the most eccentric destination in a city that brims with eccentric attractions .
Visiting it , you feel that Soane himself might stride in at any moment to discuss the classics over a brandy .
To preserve the intimacy of the experience , only 50 visitors are allowed inside at a time .
And the evocation of a past time is even more intense if you visit — as I did — on the first Tuesday evening of the month , when the museum is lit almost entirely by candles .
When I rang the bell , the imposing wooden door opened to reveal a gray - haired gentleman who might well have been Soane 's butler .
While I signed the guest ledger , an attendant fussed over my coat and umbrella , taking them for safe - keeping .
I was then ushered into a Pompeian red parlor .
" I hope you enjoy the house , " the attendant whispered .
On every table and mantel , candles blazed in glass cylinders .
As I padded carefully down a passageway , my eyes adjusted to the light and I began to make out arrangements of artifacts and furniture that have barely changed in 170 years .
The house is an intricately designed labyrinth , filled to capacity with art : Classical busts , fragments of columns and Greek friezes , Chinese vases , and statues of Greek and Roman gods , including a cast of the famed Apollo Belvedere .
Scarcely an inch of wall space has been wasted , and yet the effect is not claustrophobic : arches and domes soar upward , convex mirrors provide expansive views and balconies yawn over interior courtyards .
Like any decent cabinet of curiosities , the displays also include such oddities as a " large fungus from the rocks of the island of Sumatra " ( as Soane described it in his own 1835 inventory ) and a peculiar - looking branch of an ash tree .
Adding to the sense of mystery , and in keeping with Soane 's wishes , there are no labels on any of the artifacts , though some information is now provided on hand - held wooden " bats " that sit discreetly on tables in each room .
" People really respond to the candlelit evenings , " says the museum 's director , Tim Knox .
In fact , warders , as the museum 's guards are called , have begun turning off lights during the daylight hours , he tells me , " to enhance the period ambiance .
The half - light makes people really look at the exhibits . "
Soane was Britain 's leading architect for nearly five decades , and his numerous commissions are all around London — the Dulwich Picture Gallery ; the Royal Hospital , Chelsea ; Pitzhanger Manor - House .
( Even Britain 's iconic red telephone booths were inspired by Soane 's design for his wife 's tomb in St. Pancras Gardens . )
But it was in his own home — designed to emphasize what Soane called the " fanciful effects which constitute the poetry of Architecture " — that his creativity was given freest rein .
From 1792 to 1824 , Soane purchased , demolished and rebuilt three town houses along the square , starting with No. 12 and moving on to 13 and 14 .
Initially they were home to himself , his wife and their two sons , but starting in 1806 , when he was appointed professor of architecture at the Royal Academy , he began to use them to display his architectural designs and models .
In time , his growing collection of antiquities became more important , and with endless inventiveness , he redesigned his interiors to show off the artifacts to full effect .
Objects were placed so that every turn offers a discovery .
One minute you are confronting a splendid Roman marble statue of Diana of Ephesus .
The next , you are entering the Picture Room , lined with paintings such as Hogarth 's Rake 's Progress , a series of eight images charting the decline of a hedonistic young aristocrat .
No sooner have you finished admiring an array of Piranesi drawings of Roman ruins than a warder opens a panel in the wall to reveal a group of paintings by Joseph Michael Gandy , Soane 's draftsman .
The gray - templed warder , Peter Collins , sports a carnation in his lapel and a red handkerchief in his top pocket .
He has worked at the museum for ten years and knows his audience .
He pauses for effect before opening yet another panel , this time revealing a balcony that looks out on the Medieval collection — called the Monk 's Par - lour — filled with Gothic fragments and grimacing gargoyles .
In a nearby alcove , a bare - breasted bronze nymph poses coyly at eye level above a scale model of Soane 's most impressive architectural achievement , the Bank of England .
( The bank , which he worked on for 45 years , was demolished in the 1920s as outmoded — a move that many architectural historians regard as a travesty . )
The highlight of the collection is found in the basement , where funerary art clutters around the alabaster sarcophagus of Egyptian Pharaoh Seti I— Soane 's pride and joy , purchased in 1824 for the sum of £ 2,000 ( about $ 263,000 today ) from the Italian adventurer Giovanni Belzoni .
In 1825 Soane held a series of candlelit " sarcophagus parties " to celebrate its arrival .
The social extravaganzas were attended by such luminaries as the Duke of Sussex , the Bishop of London , poet Samuel Cole - ridge and landscape painter J.M.W. Turner .
Barbara Hofland , a guest , would write that at the event figures emerged like ghosts from the " deep masses of shadows " and candles shone " like lustrous halos round marble heads , " creating an effect " as in a dream of the poet 's elysium . "
Among the many statues in the museum , it 's easy to miss the 1829 bust of Soane himself on the first floor , placed above statuettes of Michelangelo and Raphael .
The son of a bricklayer , Soane rose from humble origins ; for his skill at sketching , he won a scholarship to tour Europe , which enabled him to visit Italy and develop a passion for Greco - Roman art .
When he died at the ripe age of 83 , Soane was one of the most distinguished individuals in Britain , a man , as Hofland wrote of the sarcophagus party guests , seemingly " exempt from the common evils of life , but awake to all its generous sensibilities . "
This happy impression is reinforced by a Gandy drawing of the family in 1798 : Soane and his wife , Elizabeth , are eating buttered rolls while their two young sons , John and George , scamper nearby .
Of course , Soane was no more immune to fate 's vagaries than the rest of us .
His fondest ambition had been to found a " dynasty of architects " through his sons , but John was struck down in his 30s by consumption and George grew up to be quite the rake , running up huge debts and even publishing anonymous attacks on his father 's architecture .
Then too , Soane may not have been the easiest father .
" He could be a man of great charm , " says museum archivist Susan Palmer , " but he was also very driven , very touchy and moody , with a real chip on his shoulder about his poor origins . "
Fearing that George would sell his collection when he died , Soane provided for its perpetuation in his will and was able to secure an act of Parliament in 1833 to ensure that his home would remain a venue , as he wrote , for " Amateurs and Students in Painting , Sculpture and Architecture . "
As a result , Soane 's museum is run to this day by the Soane Foundation , although in the 1940s the British government took over the costs of maintenance in order to keep it free to the public , as it has been since Soane 's death in 1837 .
" Thank goodness Mr. Soane did n't get on with young George , " one of the warders observed with a laugh .
" I 'd be out of a job ! "
I shuffled downstairs through the half - light , reclaimed my coat and umbrella and headed for the Ship Tavern , a 16th - century pub around the corner .
As I dug into a shepherd 's pie , I recalled the words of Benjamin Robert Haydon , another sarcophagus party guest : " It was the finest fun imaginable to see the people come into the Library after wandering about below , amidst tombs and capitals , and shafts , and noseless heads , with a sort of expression of delighted relief at finding themselves again among the living , and with coffee and cake . "
Paris
Musée Jacquemart - André
There are dozens of small museums scattered throughout Paris , and their most devoted patrons are Parisians themselves .
Some have substantial collections , like the Musée Carnavalet , which specializes in the city 's dramatic history and displays such items as a bust of Marat , a model of the Bastille and locks of Marie Antoinette 's hair .
Others are the former residences of hallowed French artists and writers — the studio of Delacroix , the apartment of Victor Hugo and the appealingly down - at - the - heels Maison Balzac , whose most illustrious exhibit is the author 's monogrammed coffeepot .
But none inspire such loyalty as the Jacquemart - André .
If Sir John Soane 's Museum distills the eccentric genius of London , the Musée Jacquemart - André is the height of le bon goût , good taste .
More a mansion museum than a house museum , it was nonetheless home to connoisseurs Édouard André and his wife , Nélie Jacquemart , a fabulously wealthy couple who in the 1880s and '90s built their own self - contained world of art and beauty on the Boulevard Haussmann — a fashionable avenue on the Right Bank , not far from the Champs - Élysées — replete with masterpieces that Louvre curators undoubtedly covet to this day .
At first glance , the museum could not be more different from Soane's .
Bursting with color , it exudes a luxuriant sense of space .
But no less than Soane 's , it sweeps visitors back to another era—in this case , the Paris of La Belle Époque , when the city blossomed as Europe 's capital of elegance , and to the even earlier golden age of Louis XV and Louis XVI .
No sooner does one step from the old carriage driveway into a formal courtyard than the sound of Parisian traffic fades away .
Ascending wide stone steps graced by sculpted lions , one feels a flush of privilege , like a guest who has been invited to a private soirée .
Inside , one is met by a three - quarter - length portrait of the master himself , Édouard André — a dashing figure in the uniform of the Imperial Guard under Emperor Napoleon III , complete with gold brocade and scarlet breeches .
A manicured gardienne ushers guests into the Picture Gallery , where the seduction continues .
André had a passion for 18th - century French art , fueled by his nostalgia for pre-Revolutionary days , and the first floor is devoted to it .
On gilt - framed canvases , voluptuous goddesses float naked on clouds and rosy - cheeked children pose with birds and kittens .
A visitor drifts from the gilded Grand Salon to the soaring Music Room , where formally attired guests once gathered for concerts , then on to the glass - roofed Winter Garden , filled with exotic plants and gleaming marble , where an extravagant double staircase spirals up to the second floor .
And so the house unfolds , offering one dazzling gallery after another .
The Library , where Édouard and Nélie pored over art catalogs and plotted their purchases , is home to their world - class array of Dutch paintings , including three Rembrandts and three Van Dycks .
Japanese ceramics and Persian antiquities enliven the Smoking Room , where Édouard would retire after dinner with his male companions to smoke cigars and discuss the issues of the day , while the Tapestry Room , used for business meetings , is lined with scenes of Russian peasant life created by the Beauvais Tapestry factory in 1767 .
As one climbs to the second floor , a playful Tiepolo fresco on the staircase wall depicts the arrival of Henry III in Venice .
The upper level is devoted to the couple 's " Italian Museum " — one room for Renaissance sculpture , a second for Florentine art , including two paintings by Botticelli , and a third room for André 's beloved collection of the art of Venice .
The mansion , which was designed for André by architect Henri Parent , was completed in 1875 , when the Boulevard Haussmann was one of Paris ' chic new addresses and André was one of the city 's most eligible bachelors .
Heir to an enormous banking fortune , he had grown disillusioned with public life and decided to devote himself to collecting art and publishing a fine arts journal .
In 1881 , when he was nearly 50 , he married Nélie Jacquemart , the woman who had painted his portrait nine years earlier .
In many ways , she was an unlikely match for this aristocratic boulevardier .
Nearly 40 herself , Jacquemart was no high - society belle .
She was an independent woman from a humble background — evidently illegitimate — who had supported herself as a portrait artist , quite an unusual achievement for a woman at the time .
It was a marriage based on shared taste .
During their 13 years together , the couple traveled for part of each year , most often to Italy , where they attended auctions with the help of experts from the Louvre , who were motivated to win art for France .
After Édouard died in 1894 , at age 61 , Nélie continued traveling the world , going as far as Burma for her purchases .
On her death at 71 in 1912 , she donated the house to the Institut de France ( an academic organization that manages foundations and museums ) on the condition that the collection remain intact , so that the French public could see , she said in her will , " where a pair of amateur art - lovers lived out a life of enjoyment and luxury . "
Indeed , there is enormous pleasure to be taken from seeing the couple 's paintings and sculptures mixed in with their objets d'art and fine furniture in a domestic setting .
After a while , however , even the finest taste can be a little overbearing .
Visitors can't help but speak in hushed tones so as not to upset the exquisite equilibrium .
But the mansion bursts to exuberant life in the Dining Room — the former heart of the original mansion — which has been converted into one of Paris ' most sumptuous café - restaurants .
In this airy chamber , where the couple entertained friends beneath lavish tapestries , one can now enjoy a salade niçoise and glass of sauvignon blanc .
There is a strange feeling of being watched here , and not just by fellow diners : the ceiling is a marvelous joke , another Tiepolo fresco — this one depicting a crowd of Venetian nobles leaning over a balustrade , pointing and smiling at the diners below .
Perched on the mantelpiece is a bust of Nélie Jacquemart .
She many not have fit in with the city 's fashionable set — later in life , she retired to her rural chateau , Chaalis , today another grand house museum , 30 miles outside the city — but she certainly took a fierce pride in her collection , and one imagines her still basking in the pleasure it creates .
Madrid
Museo Sorolla
Madrid is a city of extravagant facades whose true attractions lie behind closed doors .
Hidden beyond a stone wall in the former working - class district of Chamberí , a ten - minute taxi ride from the bustle of the Plaza Mayor in downtown Madrid , lies the sun-filled Museo Sorolla .
The former home and art studio of one of Spain 's most beloved painters , Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida , it is a succulent garden of tinkling fountains and exuberant flowers , an explosion of Mediterranean color and joie de vivre .
From 1911 to 1923 , this Andalusian - style house was the residence of one of the world 's best - known artists .
Born to a humble family in Valencia in 1863 , Sorolla kept his distance from Europe 's avant - garde movements but won international fame for his subtle technique , evoking the play of sunshine in his scenes of Mediterranean beaches and images of Spanish daily life .
Stepping into the seductive confines of the compound , where Sorolla lived with his wife and three children , is like entering one of the artist 's luminous paintings .
With its Moorish flourishes , tranquil pools and ever - present sound of flowing water , the garden was the place where he most loved to paint .
When I visited , Sorolla 's private Arcadia was filled with earnest art students experimenting with watercolors in shady corners .
Tiled steps lead up to the house , whose first rooms display his works , just as they did 80 years ago for potential buyers .
The home 's living spaces contain the family 's original Art Nouveau furniture and Tiffany lamps .
But the emotional core of the house is Sorolla 's studio , a large vaulted room painted a rosy red and suffused with sunshine .
Sorolla 's easels stand ready , as if he had just left for a siesta ; his palettes , brushes and half - used paint tubes are close by .
A small Turkish bed occupies one corner of the room and a book of 16th - century songs sits open on a stand .
A drawing Sorolla made of Velázquez 's famous portrait of Pope Innocent X presides over all .
Sorolla moved into the house , which he had built , in 1911 , at the high point of his career .
By then he had exhibited his work from London to St. Louis , Missouri , had been showered with international awards , befriended intellectuals and artists , including John Singer Sargent , painted the portrait of Spanish King Alfonso XIII and U.S. President William Howard Taft and , under the patronage of railroad - fortune heir Archer Huntington , had been commissioned to paint a vast mural in the Hispanic Society of America in New York City .
After his death at 60 in 1923 , Sorolla 's international reputation suffered , overshadowed by the work of Post - Impressionists such as Cézanne and Gauguin .
As with his friend Sargent , many critics decided that Sorolla was too conservative and commercial .
But in Madrid , Sorolla 's artistic standing has never been shaken , and since its opening by his widow and son in 1931 , the Museo Sorolla , which also houses the most extensive collection of his works in the world , has enjoyed a steady stream of pilgrims .
Today , their faith is being vindicated ; Sorolla is being reevaluated by critics , who are placing him as a bridge between Spanish old masters such as Velázquez and Goya and the Post - Impressionists .
In 2006 , Madrid 's prestigious Thyssen - Bornemisza Museum hosted " Sargent / Sorolla , " an exhibition tracking the parallel careers of the pair .
At the Museo Sorolla , as in all house museums , a chord of melancholy intrudes : the artist , we learn , was painting a portrait in his beloved garden in 1920 when , at the age of 57 , he suffered a stroke .
Although he lived for another three years , he produced little new work .
But such gloomy meditations do not suit the house , or the sensual spirit of modern Madrid .
The best solution — as Sorolla himself would likely have agreed — is to head to a nearby café to sip a glass of vino blanco and bask in the Spanish sun .
Prague
The Black Madonna House : The Museum of Czech Cubism
Unscathed by two world wars , the heart of Prague feels like a fantasy of Old Europe .
Gothic spires frame Art Nouveau cafés , and on the Medieval Astronomical Clock , next door to Franz Kafka 's childhood home in the Old Town Square , a statue of Death still pulls the bell cord to strike the hour .
But if you turn down a Baroque street called Celetna , you confront a very different aspect of the city — the stark and surprising Black Madonna House , one of the world 's first Cubist buildings and home today to the Museum of Czech Cubism .
Designed by Prague architect Josef Gocar , the House was shockingly modern , even revolutionary , when it opened as a department store in 1912 — and it still seems so today .
The overall shape is appropriately boxlike and predictably austere , but on closer inspection the facade is broken up by the inventive use of angles and planes .
Large bay windows protrude like quartz crystals , and angular ornamentation casts subtle shadows .
The interior is no less unusual , with the city 's first use of reinforced concrete allowing for the construction of generous open spaces .
The House 's peculiar name comes from the 17th - century statue of the Black Madonna and Child rescued from a previous structure on the site and now perched like a figurehead on one corner of the building .
But not even the Madonna could protect the House from the vagaries of Czech history .
Following World War II and the Communists ' rise to power , the department store was gradually gutted and divided into office space .
After the 1989 Velvet Revolution ended Communist rule , the building had a brief life as a cultural center , but it was only in 2003 that it found its logical role in the fabric of Prague — as a shrine to the glories of Czech Cubism .
Most of us think of Cubism as an esoteric avant - garde movement advanced by Parisian artists Pablo Picasso , Georges Braque and others in the years before World War I .
But the movement swept across Europe and was embraced in Russian and Eastern European capitals as well — nowhere more avidly than in Prague , where Cubism was seized upon , if only for an incandescent moment , as a possible key to the future .
" In Paris , Cubism only affected painting and sculpture , " says Tomas Vlcek , director of the Collection of Modern and Contemporary Art at the country 's National Gallery , which oversees the Museum of Czech Cubism .
" Only in Prague was Cubism adapted to all the other branches of the visual arts — furniture , ceramics , architecture , graphic design , photography .
So Cubism in Prague was a grand experiment , a search for an all - encompassing modern style that could be distinctively Czech . "
The coterie of Czech Cubists — principally Gocar , Otto Gutfreund and Bohumil Kubista — first came together in 1911 , founding a magazine called Artistic Monthly and organizing their own exhibitions in the years before World War I .
It was a time of intense optimism and energy in Prague .
This small Eastern European metropolis , one of the wealthiest in the Austro - Hungarian Empire , drew on its vibrant Czech , German and Jewish traditions for a creative explosion .
Expatriate artists were returning from Paris and Vienna to share radical new ideas in the salons ; Kafka was scribbling his first nightmarish stories ; Albert Einstein was lecturing in the city as a professor .
" It was something like paradise , " says Vlcek , looking wistful .
Today , the Museum of Czech Cubism is a shrine to the movement 's heyday ( 1910 - 19 ) , with the building itself as the prime exhibit .
The entryway is an angular study in wrought iron .
Inside , one immediately ascends a staircase of Cubist design .
Unlike the stairs in Marcel Duchamp 's Nude Descending a Staircase , the steps are thankfully even , but the metal balustrade is a complex interplay of geometric forms .
There are three floors of Cubist exhibits , filled with art forms unique to Prague .
Elegant sofas , dressing tables and lounge chairs all share dramatically oblique lines .
There are abstract sculptures and paintings , bold , zigzagging graphics , and cockeyed vases , mirrors and fruit cups .
While this may not be strictly a house museum , it does have a domestic feel .
The many black - and - white portraits of obscure artists in bowler hats and bow ties reveal a thriving , bohemian cast of characters : one sofa , we learn , was " designed for the actor Otto Boleska , " another for " Professor Fr. Zaviska . "
What sounds like a Woody Allen parody of cultural self - absorption captures the idiosyncratic nature of Prague itself , a city that takes pride in its most arcane history .
And like all small museums in touch with their origins , unique features have brought ghosts very much back to life .
Visitors can now retire to the building 's original Cubist eatery , the Grand Café Orient , designed by Gocar in 1912 .
This once - popular artists ' hangout was closed in the 1920s and gutted during the Communist era , but meticulous researchers used the few surviving plans and photographs to recreate it .
Now , after an eight - decade hiatus , a new generation of bohemians can settle in beneath Cubist chandeliers in Cubist chairs ( not as uncomfortable as they sound ) to argue politics over a pint of unpasteurized Pilsener .
Finally , on the ground floor , the museum store has recreated a range of Cubist coffee cups , vases and tea sets from the original designs of architect and artist Pavel Janak , and offers reproductions of Cubist furniture by Gocar and others .
After an afternoon immersed in all those angles , I began to notice subtle Cubist traces in the architectural cornucopia of Prague 's streets — in the doorway of a former labor union headquarters , for example , and on an elegant arch framing a Baroque sculpture next to a church .
Inspired , I decided to track down a Cubist lamppost I had heard about , designed in 1913 by one Emil Kralicek .
It took a little wrestling with Czech street names , but I finally found it in a back alley in the New Town : it looked like a stack of crystals placed on end .
I could imagine Sir John Soane — transported to modern Prague — pausing before it in unabashed admiration .

Young adults at risk : 13.7 million lack health insurance coverage
The number of uninsured young adults in the United States rose to 13.7 million in 2006 — an increase from 13.3 million in 2005 — making the 19 - to - 29 age group one of the largest and fastest - growing segments of the population without health insurance .
According to a newly updated report from The Commonwealth Fund , 38 percent of high school graduates who do not attend college and 34 percent of college graduates will spend some time uninsured in the year after graduation .
According to the report , Rite of Passage ?
Why Young Adults Become Uninsured and How New Policies Can Help , working young adults are much less likely than older workers to have access to health insurance through their employers .
Just over half ( 53 % ) of 19 - to 29 - year - olds were eligible for coverage offered by their employers , compared with about three - quarters ( 74 % ) of 30 - to 64 - year - olds .
Young adults often lose coverage at age 19 , as a result of being dropped from parents ’ policies or from public programs like Medicaid and the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) .
Young adults from low - income households are most at risk : 72 percent of the 13.7 million uninsured young adults live in households with incomes below 200 percent of the poverty level .
As a result of young adults aging off parents ’ policies or public programs , the uninsured rate jumps sharply after age 19 , from 12 percent among children 18 and under to 30 percent among those ages 19 to 29 .
“ Lack of coverage and access to health care services puts the health of young adults at risk , and can subject them , as well as their families , to potentially dire financial consequences , ” said Sara Collins , co-author and assistant vice president at The Commonwealth Fund .
The report found that two - thirds ( 66 % ) of young adults who had a time without insurance coverage in the past year had gone without needed health care because of cost .
One - half reported problems paying medical bills or were paying off medical debt over time .
Nearly 60 percent of employers who offer coverage do not insure dependent children over age 18 or 19 if they do not attend college .
Thirty - nine percent of young adults ages 19 to 23 who either do not attend college or only attend part - time are uninsured , compared with 17 percent of full - time students .
In the face of these challenges , new efforts on both the state and federal level to cover young adults are gaining momentum .
Twenty states have passed legislation requiring insurance companies to extend dependent coverage to young adults older than 18 or 19 .
The new age limits range from 24 in Delaware , Indiana , and South Dakota to 30 in New Jersey .
In addition , a recently introduced congressional bill would extend health insurance to dependent children of federal workers to age 25 .
Because a majority of uninsured young adults have low incomes , extending eligibility for Medicaid and SCHIP beyond age 18 would also be an important policy solution for covering this group , the authors say .
Such an expansion would have the biggest impact in terms of lowering the number of uninsured young adults .
Extending eligibility to age 25 , for example , would cover up to 7.6 million uninsured young adults living in households with incomes below 200 percent of poverty .
“ State - level efforts to cover young adults are very important and will help many young adults as they transition to the labor force , ” said Commonwealth Fund President Karen Davis .
“ However , most uninsured young adults do not have access to affordable private coverage through their parents ’ plans .
Extending Medicaid and SCHIP coverage beyond age 18 has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of young adults and their families . ”
In addition , the authors suggest that states could help extend coverage by ensuring that colleges and universities require health coverage and offer insurance to their full - time and part - time students .
This option could help cover the 1.6 million part - time and full - time uninsured students ages 19 to 23 .
There ’s been a bit of deriliction of duty going on here at The Liberty Papers .
I ’ve been trying to keep track of happenings in Zimbabwe , but we ’re now 25 days into an electoral nightmare in that nation , and I ’ve not had the time to address it .
Zimbabwe has spent most of the last decade as an example of every possible thing that a government can do wrong .
It gone from the “ breadbasket ” of the region to a starving , impoverished nation , with 6 - figure inflation and 80 % + unemployment , and refugees streaming south into South Africa to escape the hopelessness .
It ’s gone from breadbasket to basketcase .
The remaining residents are fed up with their socialist dictator , Robert Mugabe .
Mugabe is known for rigging elections , but political unrest is so severe this time around that many believed that he could n’t win the race even with heavy - handed rigging .
The election was held more than three weeks ago , and most outside of the Mugabe regime believe that – at worst– his challenger has forced a run-off .
Many believe that the challenger , Morgan Tsvangirai , has won outright .
So what has Mugabe done ?
He ’s withheld the results and proposed a national unity government with– you guessed it– Robert Mugabe at the helm !
A unity government led by President Robert Mugabe may be the best way to break Zimbabwe ’s post- election deadlock , state media said Wednesday , as the first result from a recount of votes was declared .
The state - run Herald newspaper — a government mouthpiece — said it was clear that no side won a majority in the presidential election on March 29 and the best way forward was to form a government of national unity . …
The opinion piece in the Herald , a tightly - controlled state newspaper , said the presidential election in which 84 - year - old Mugabe faced off against opposition leader Tsvangirai had produced “ no outright winner . ”
“ It is unlikely the ongoing recount will substantively alter that position .
Accordingly , it stands to reason that the transitional government of national unity … should be led by the incumbent president , ” it said .
The end of the Mugabe regime seemed– only three weeks ago– imminent , and those who have watched this situation from near and afar were ready to breath a sigh of relief .
Yet he remains defiant , and it is becoming ever more clear that he wo n’t leave office voluntarily .
It ’s far better for Zimbabwe that this ends peacefully than through an uprising , but frankly the latter looks like the only way this may be rectified .
The time has come , Mr. Mugabe .
The people have spoken .
For the good of the residents you have often professed to champion , it is time to listen and go .
US Fed Responsible for the Credit Crisis
There has been a lot of talk in the news recently about the Federal Reserve and the actions it has taken over the past few months .
Many media pundits have been bending over backwards to praise the Fed for supposedly restoring stability to the market .
This interpretation of the Fed 's actions could n't be further from the truth .
The current market crisis began because of Federal Reserve monetary policy during the early 2000s in which the Fed lowered the interest rate to a below - market rate .
The artificially low rates led to over investment in housing and other malinvestments .
When the first indications of market trouble began back in August of 2007 , instead of holding back and allowing bad decision - makers to suffer the consequences of their actions , the Federal Reserve took aggressive , inflationary action to ensure that large Wall Street firms would not lose money .
It began by lowering the discount rates , the rates of interest charged to banks who borrow directly from the Fed , and lengthening the terms of such loans .
This eliminated much of the stigma from discount window borrowing and enabled troubled banks to come to the Fed directly for funding , pay only a slightly higher interest rate but also secure these loans for a period longer than just overnight .
After the massive increase in discount window lending proved to be ineffective , the Fed became more and more creative with its funding arrangements .
It has since created the Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) , the Primary Dealer Credit Facility ( PDCF ) , and the Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF ) .
The upshot of all of these new programs is that through auctions of securities or through deposits of collateral , the Fed is pushing hundreds of billions of dollars of funding into the financial system in a misguided attempt to shore up the stability of the system .
The PDCF in particular is a departure from the established pattern of Fed intervention because it targets the primary dealers , the largest investment banks who purchase government securities directly from the New York Fed .
These banks have never before been allowed to borrow from the Fed , but thanks to the Fed Board of Governors , these investment banks can now receive loans from the Fed in exchange for securities which will in all likelihood soon lose much of their value .
The net effect of all this new funding has been to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into the financial system and bail out banks whose poor decision making should have caused them to go out of business .
Instead of being forced to learn their lesson , these poor - performing banks are being rewarded for their financial mismanagement , and the ultimate cost of this bailout will fall on the American taxpayers .
Already this new money flowing into the system is spurring talk of the next speculative bubble , possibly this time in commodities .
Worst of all , the Treasury Department has recently proposed that the Federal Reserve , which was responsible for the housing bubble and subprime crisis in the first place , be rewarded for all its intervention by being turned into a super - regulator .
The Treasury foresees the Fed as the guarantor of market stability , with oversight over any financial institution that could pose a threat to the financial system .
Rewarding poor performing financial institutions is bad enough , but rewarding the institution that enabled the current economic crisis is unconscionable .

Congressman
Paul is not in the news because the truth hurts and most Americans can't handle to truth .
It 's a terrible shame the country has it's head in the sand and will not face the grim reality that is in front of us .
It would rather hear about " bitterness " than taste it .
Well , if Congressman Pauls words do come to pass this entire Republic will still ask , " how did this happen ? " while watching the latest news about Britney Spears or worse , American " Idle " .
The economic crisis is the worst thing for the country but it 's exactly what it deserves !

Why is n't Ron Paul in the news like everyone else ?
Are you kidding ?
Who runs and owns the media companies and everything else ?
Who is benefiting in the US ?
Not the people , not the companies , a select few others become billionaires then there is the international bankers who own and control the Federal Reserve the international bankers own everything and when things calm down , Ron Paul is going to get shot .
Just like Lincoln and just like both Kennedys and the son for that matter .
It 's all planned , were just a bunch of pawns in the game .

The FED and income tax of the IRS are as fare I know ilegal .
Best thing can happen now is the economic crisis get deep enough .
Then we have a change the government will create money and no longer private banks .
When we combinate this with new tax system and few other thing I 've in mind .
We can solve the problem in the US and many other countries .
Can some one connect me with Dr. Ron Paul ?

• Off - duty officer arrested in assault , weapon discharge
An off - duty Detroit Police officer arrested in Canton Township Tuesday was arraigned on seven charges , including torture and assault with intent to murder .
Gary Allen Steele , 42 , is charged with hitting his 37 - year - old girlfriend in the legs with a baseball bat during an argument , then firing three shots .
Police were called to the couple 's home in the area of Pinehurst and Glengarry at about 12:30 p.m. , and Steele surrendered .
The couple had been living together about three months .
The torture and attempted murder charges carry possible sentences of life in prison .
Steele also was charged Thursday with assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder , a 10 - year felony ; two counts of felonious assault and discharging a weapon in a building , four - year felonies ; and using a firearm during a felony , which carries a mandatory two - year prison sentence upon conviction .
Steele was held on 10 percent of a $ 5 million bond and ordered to appear for a preliminary examination March 17 .
The seven - year police veteran has been suspended with pay , Detroit officials said .

Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has badly stumbled in discussing the Bush administration ’s push to create stricter identity systems .
Chertoff was recently in Canada discussing , among other topics , the so - called “ Server in the Sky ” program to share fingerprint databases among the U.S. , Canada , the U.K. , and Australia .
In a recent briefing with Canadian press ( which has yet to be picked up in the U.S. ) , Chertoff made the startling statement that fingerprints are “ not particularly private ” :
QUESTION : Some are raising that the privacy aspects of this thing , you know , sharing of that kind of data , very personal data , among four countries is quite a scary thing .
SECRETARY CHERTOFF :
Well , first of all , a fingerprint is hardly personal data because you leave it on glasses and silverware and articles all over the world , they ’re like footprints .
They ’re not particularly private .
Many of us should rightfully be surprised that our fingerprints are n’t considered “ personal data ” by the head of DHS .
Even more importantly , DHS itself disagrees .
In its definition of “ personally identifiable information ” – the information that triggers a Privacy Impact Assessment when used by government – the Department specifically lists : “ biometric identifiers ( e.g. , fingerprints ) . ”
Chertoff ’s comments have drawn sharp criticism from Jennifer Stoddart , the Canadian official in charge of privacy issues .
“ Fingerprints constitute extremely personal information for which there is clearly a high expectation of privacy , ” Stoddart said .
There are compelling reasons to treat fingerprints as “ extremely personal information . ”
The strongest reason is that fingerprints , if not used carefully , will become the biggest source of identity theft .
Fingerprints shared in databases all over the world wo n’t stay secret for long , and identity thieves will take advantage .
A quick web search on “ fake fingerprints ” turns up cheap and easy methods for do - it - at - home fake fingerprints .
As discussed by noted security expert Bruce Schneier , one technique is available for under $ 10 .
It was tried “ against eleven commercially available fingerprint biometric systems , and was able to reliably fool all of them . ”
Secretary Chertof either does n’t know about these clear results or chooses to ignore them .
He said in Canada : “ It ’s very difficult to fake a fingerprint . ”
Chertoff ’s argument about leaving fingerprints lying around on “ glasses and silverware ” is also beside the point .
Today , we leave our Social Security numbers lying around with every employer and numerous others .
Yet the fact that SSNs ( or fingerprints ) are widely known exposes us to risk .
There have been numerous questions raised about how this Administration is treating our personal information .
Secretary Chertoff ’s comments show a new reason to worry – they do n’t think it ’s “ personal ” at all .

This is the second of three possible backgrounds for the circular slide rule .
This one features a logarithmic scale for multiplication that makes five turns around the rule .
Unlike earlier versions of my circular slide rule , I put it far enough towards the outside that I could graduate it for a 20 inch rule instead of as for a 10 inch rule .
Given the binary capability of the overlay design , it can indeed be used for accurate multiplication .

Spacetime and Spin
The Many Faces of Spin
Many of nature 's deepest mysteries come in threes .
Why does space have three spatial dimensions ( ones that we can see , anyway ) ?
Why are there three fundamental dimensions in physics ( mass M , length L and time T ) ?
Why three fundamental constants in nature ( Newton 's gravitational constant G , the speed of light c and Planck 's constant h ) ?
Why three generations of fundamental particles in the standard model ( e.g. the up / down , charm / strange and top / bottom quarks ) ?
Why do black holes have only three properties — mass , charge and spin ?
Nobody knows the answers to these questions , nor how or whether they may be connected .
But some have sought for clues in the last - named of these properties : spin .
Spacetime is warped and twisted by the
mass and spin of the earth .
We are all familiar with rotation in the macroscopic world of tops , ballet dancers , planets and galaxies .
Spin in the microscopic world is subtler , and obeys rules that are at once familiar ( e.g. conservation of angular momentum ) and bizarrely counter - intuitive ( e.g. quantization and half - integer spin for fermions , which in the macroscopic world would correspond to objects that rotate through 720 rather than 360 degrees before returning to their original states ) .
More abstract still are quantities like " isospin " , which is analogous to ordinary spin in some ways but governs the behavior of the strong and weak nuclear forces ( rotation through 180 degrees of isospin , for instance , converts a proton into a neutron ) , and torsion , a mathematical term related to the intrinsic twist of spacetime ( this appears in some extensions of general relativity , but Einstein himself set it to zero in general relativity for reasons of logical economy ) .
Are there connections between these manifestations of spin in the worlds of the large and small ?
Do they hint at the direction in which Einstein 's theory of gravity might need to be extended in order to unify it with the other forces of nature ?
A generation of physicists since Einstein have thought about these questions , and they are part of the reason what makes Gravity Probe B so important , not just as another test of general relativity , but as a source of new insights about spacetime itself .
Nobel laureate C.N.
Yang wrote in a letter to NASA Administrator James M. Beggs in 1983 that general relativity , " though profoundly beautiful , is likely to be amended ... whatever [ the ] new geometrical symmetry will be , it is likely to entangle with spin and rotation , which are related to a deep geometrical concept called torsion ...
The proposed Stanford experiment [ Gravity Probe B ] is especially interesting since it focuses on the spin .
I would not be surprised at all if it gives a result in disagreement with Einstein 's theory . "
Gravito - Electromagnetism
In general situations , space and time are so inextricably bound together in general relativity that they are hard to separate .
In special cases , however , it becomes feasible to perform a " 3+1 split " and decompose the metric of four - dimensional spacetime into a scalar time - time component , a vector time - space component and a tensor " space - space " component .
When gravitational fields are weak and velocities are low compared to c , then this decomposition takes on a particularly compelling physical interpretation : if we call the scalar component a " gravito - electric potential " and the vector one a " gravito - magnetic potential " , then these quantities are found to obey almost exactly the same laws as their counterparts in ordinary electromagnetism !
( Although little - known nowadays , the idea of parallels between gravity and electromagnetism is not a new one , and goes back to Michael Faraday 's experiments with " gravitational induction " beginning in 1849 . )
One can construct a " gravito - electric field " g and a " gravito - magnetic field H from the divergence and curl of the scalar and vector potentials , and these fields turn out to obey equations that are identical to Maxwell 's equations and the Lorentz force law of ordinary electrodynamics ( modulo a sign here and a factor of two there ; these can be chalked up to the fact that gravity is associated with a spin - 2 field rather than the spin - 1 field of electromagnetism ) .
The " field equations " of gravito - electromagnetism turn out to be of great value in interpreting the predictions of the full theory of general relativity for spinning test bodies in the field of a massive spinning body such as the earth — just as Maxwell 's equations govern the behavior of electric dipoles in an external magnetic field .
From symmetry considerations we can infer that the earth 's gravito - electric field must be radial , and its gravito - magnetic one dipolar , as shown in the diagrams below :
These facts allow one to derive the main predictions of general relativity that are of relevance to Gravity Probe B , simply by replacing the electric and magnetic fields of ordinary electrodynamics by g and H respectively ( for an illuminating discussion see Kip Thorne 's contribution to Near Zero : New Frontiers of Physics , 1988 ) .
Based on this analogy the term " gravito - magnetic effect " is sometimes used interchangeably with " frame - dragging " ( or with " Lense - Thirring effect " ; see below ) .
However any such identification must be treated with care because the distinction between gravito - magnetism and gravito - electricity is frame - dependent , just like its counterpart in Maxwell 's theory .
This means that observers using different coordinate systems ( as , for example , one centered on the earth and another on the barycenter of the solar system ) may disagree on the relative size of the effects they are discussing .
Gravito - electromagnetism has already been indirectly observed in the solar system for some time , since general relativistic corrections are routinely used in , for instance , updating the ephemeris of planetary positions , and gravito - electromagnetic fields are nothing more than a necessary limit of Einstein 's gravitational field in situations where gravity is weak and velocities are low .
This is different from measuring a gravito - electromagnetic phenomenon like frame - dragging directly , which is one of the two primary goals of the Gravity Probe B mission .
Geodetic Effect
The geodetic effect provides us with a sixth test of general relativity ( after the three classical tests plus Shapiro delay and the binary pulsar ) , and it is the first one to involve the spin of the test body .
The effect arises in the way that angular momentum is transported through a gravitational field in Einstein 's theory .
Einstein 's friend and colleague Willem de Sitter ( 1872 -1934 ) , who was instrumental in making general relativity known abroad , began to study this problem when the theory was less than a year old .
He found that the earth - moon system would undergo a precession in the field of the sun , a special case now referred to as the de Sitter or " solar geodetic " effect ( although " heliodetic " might be more descriptive ) .
De Sitter 's calculation was extended to rotating bodies such as the earth by two of his countrymen : in 1918 by the mathematician Jan Schouten ( 1883 -1971 ) and in 1920 by the physicist and musician Adriaan Fokker ( 1887-1972 ) .
In the framework of the gravito - electromagnetic analogy , the geodetic effect arises partly as a spin - orbit interaction between the spin of the test body ( the gyroscope in the case of GP - B ) and the " mass current " of the central body ( the earth ) .
This is the exact analog of Thomas precession in electromagnetism , where the electron experiences an induced magnetic field ( in its rest frame ) due to the apparent motion of the nucleus .
In the gravitomagnetic case , the orbiting gyroscope feels the massive earth whizzing around it ( in its rest frame ) and experiences an induced gravitomagnetic torque , causing its spin vector to precess .
This spin - orbit interaction accounts for one third of the total geodetic precession ; the other two thirds arise due to space curvature alone and cannot be interpreted gravito - electromagnetically .
They can , however , be understood geometrically .
Model flat space as a 2 - dimensional sheet , as shown in the diagram below ( left ) .
A gyroscope 's spin vector ( arrow ) points at right angles to the plane of its motion , and its direction remains constant as the gyroscope completes a circular orbit .
If , however , we fold space into a cone to simulate the effect of the presence of the massive earth ( right ) , then we must remove part of the area of the circle ( shaded ) and the gyroscope 's spin vector no longer lines up with itself after making a complete circuit ( green and red arrows ) .
The difference between these two directions ( per orbit ) makes up the other two thirds of the geodetic effect .
In the case of Gravity Probe B this is sometimes referred to as the " missing inch " argument because space curvature shortens the circumference of the spacecraft 's orbital path around the earth by 1.1 inches .
In polar orbit at an altitude of 642 km the total geodetic effect ( comprising both the spin - orbit and space curvature effects ) causes a precession in the north - south direction of 6606 milliarcsec / yr — an angle so small that it is comparable to the average angular size of the planet Mercury as seen from earth .
Geodetic Effect
Experimental detection ( or non-detection ) of the geodetic effect will place new and independent limits on alternative theories of gravity known as " metric theories " ( loosely speaking , theories that respect Einstein 's equivalence principle ) .
These theories are characterized by the Eddington or Parametrized Post - Newtonian ( PPN ) parameters β and γ , which are both equal to one in general relativity .
The geodetic effect is proportional to ( 1+2 γ ) / 3 , so a confirmation of the Einstein prediction at the level of 0.01 % would translate into comparable constraint on γ — more stringent than all but the most recent Shapiro time - delay test based on data from Cassini .
Gravity Probe B observations of geodetic precession could also impose new constraints on other " generalizations of general relativity " such as the scalar - tensor theories pioneered by Carl Brans and Robert Dicke in 1961 ( see Kamal Nandi et al , 2001 ) .
Another such class of theories incorporates torsion into Einstein 's theory ; examples have been proposed by Kenji Hayashi and Takeshi Shirafuji ( 1979 ) , Leopold Halpern ( 1984 ) and Yi Mao et al. ( 2006 ) .
Another is based on extending the theory to higher dimensions ; constraints on such theories arising from the geodetic effect have been discussed by Dimitri Kalligas et al. ( 1995 ) and Hongya Liu and James Overduin ( 2000 ) .
The most recent kind of generalization involves violations of Lorentz invariance , the conceptual foundation of special relativity ; implications of such theories for Gravity Probe B have been worked out by Quentin Bailey and Alan Kostelecky ( 2006 ) .
Frame - Dragging Effect
Lense
Thirring
The frame - dragging effect , the seventh test of general relativity and the second one to involve the spin of the test body , reveals most clearly the Machian aspect of Einstein 's theory .
In fact , it is curious that Einstein did not work out this effect himself , given that he had obtained explicit frame - dragging effects in all his previous attempts at gravitational field theories , and that he still regarded Mach 's principle as the philosophical pillar of general relativity in 1918 .
Whatever the reason , it was not until that year that the general - relativistic frame - dragging formula was derived by Hans Thirring ( 1888 - 1976 ) and Josef Lense ( 1890 - 1985 ) , after whom the effect is now usually named .
In an ironic twist , Thirring had not intended to do calculations at all ; he had wanted to build a frame - dragging experiment ( a cylindrical version of Föppl 's flywheel experiment ) and only settled for theoretical work after he was unable to arrange the necessary financing ( see Herbert Pfister 's contribution to Mach 's Principle : From Newton 's Bucket to Quantum Gravity , 1995 ) .
Thirring 's initial result described the gravitational field inside a rotating cylinder ; his second calculation ( with Lense ) involved the field outside a slowly rotating solid sphere and forms the basis for experimental tests such as Gravity Probe B. Both results are " Machian " in the sense that the inertial reference frame of a test particle is strongly influenced by the properties of the larger mass ( the cylinder or sphere ) .
This is completely unlike Newtonian dynamics , where a test particle 's inertia is defined only by its motion with respect to " absolute space " and is unaffected by the distribution of matter .
In fact , with the right parameters it is possible for a large mass in general relativity to completely " screen " the background geometry , so that a test particle feels only the reference frame defined by that mass .
This phenomenon is known as " total " or " perfect dragging " of inertial frames ( more on this below ) .
Frame - dragging Effect
Frame - dragging in realistic experimental situations is not nearly that strong and the utmost ingenuity has to be exercised to detect it at all .
Analyzed in terms of the gravito - electromagnetic analogy , the effect arises due to the spin-spin interaction between the gyroscope and rotating central mass , and is perfectly analogous to the interaction of a magnetic dipole μ with a magnetic field B ( the basis of nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI ) .
Just as a torque μ×B acts in the magnetic case , so a gyroscope with spin s experiences a torque proportional to s×H in the gravitational case .
For Gravity Probe B , in polar orbit 642 km above the earth , this torque causes the gyroscope spin axes to precess in the east - west direction by a mere 39 milliarcsec / yr — an angle so tiny that it is equivalent to the average angular width of the dwarf planet Pluto as seen from earth .
Genesis of GP -B
How small is 1/10th of a milliarcsecond ?
As the calculations of de Sitter , Schouten and Fokker became more widely known , particularly through Arthur Eddington 's influential textbook The Mathematical Theory of Relativity ( 1923 ) , experimentalists began to take interest .
P.M.S. Blackett ( 1897 - 1974 ) considered looking for the de Sitter effect with a laboratory gyroscope in the 1930s , but concluded ( rightly ) that the task was hopeless with existing technology .
To see what makes the problem so challenging , consider the gyroscope rotor shown below .
The de Sitter effect and frame - dragging around the earth are both of order ~ 10 milliarcsec / yr , so to measure either of them with 1 % accuracy requires that all unmodeled precessions on this rotor ( known technically as the " drift rate " ) add up to less than 0.1 milliarcsec / yr , or 10 - 18 rad/s .
( See video clip " How smalll is 1/10th of a milliarcsecond ? " at right . )
What does this requirement mean for our gyroscope ?
Precession Ω is related to torque τ by Ω=τ / ( Iω ) where I = ( 2/5 ) mr2 is the moment of inertia and ω=v/r is the angular velocity .
Inhomogeneities of size δr produce torques of order τ=maδr where a is the tangential acceleration .
Combining these expressions gives a drift rate of Ω = ( 5/2 ) ( a / v ) ( δr / r ) .
Assuming a spin speed of v~1000 cm/s and accelerations comparable to those on the surface of the earth ( a~g ) , the rotor must be homogeneous to within ( δr / r ) < 10 - 17 to attain a drift rate less than 10 - 18 rad/s !
Such homogeneities are utterly unattainable on earth .
In space , however , it is possible — just possible , with a great deal of work — to suppress unwanted accelerations on a test body by as much as eleven orders of magnitude , to a ~10 - 11g .
If this can be done , then the gyro rotor need only be homogeneous to one part in 106 , rather than 1017 — a level that can be achieved , with great effort , using the best materials on earth .
Considerations of this kind led two people to take a new look at gyroscopic tests of general relativity shortly after the dawn of the space age .
George E. Pugh and Leonard I. Schiff ( 1915 - 1971 ) hit independently on the key ideas within months of each other .
Pugh was stimulated by a talk given by Huseyin Yilmaz proposing a satellite test to distinguish his alternative theory of gravity from Einstein's , while Schiff was likely inspired at least in part by an advertisement for a new " Cryogenic Gyro ... with the possibility of exceptionally low drift rates " in Physics Today magazine ( see Francis Everitt 's contribution to Near Zero : New Frontiers of Physics , 1988 ) .
Pugh 's paper , published in a Pentagon memorandum in November 1959 , is now recognized as the birth of the concept of drag - free motion .
This is a critical element of the Gravity Probe B mission , whereby any one of the gyroscopes can be isolated from the rest of the experiment and protected from all non-inertial forces ; the rest of the spacecraft is then made to " chase after " the reference gyro by means of helium boiloff vented through a revolutionary porous plug and specially designed thrusters .
In this way unmodeled accelerations on all the gyros , such as those resulting from the effects of solar radiation pressure and atmospheric friction on the spacecraft , can be reduced from a ~10 - 8g to below 10 - 11g as required .
( See animation clip " Drag - Free Motion " below . )
The drag - free control system is only one of the innovations that made Gravity Probe B possible .
The experiment depends on monitoring the precession of near - perfect gyroscopes relative to a fixed reference direction such as the line of sight to a distant guide star .
But how is one to find the spin axis of a perfectly spherical , perfectly homogeneous gyroscope suspended in vacuum ?
This is the " readout problem " ; another , closely related problem is how to spin up such a gyroscope in the first place .
Various possibilities were considered in the early days , until 1962 when Francis Everitt and William Fairbank hit on the idea of exploiting what had until then been a small but annoying source of unwanted torque in magnetically levitated gyroscopes .
Spinning superconductors develop a magnetic moment , known as the London moment , which is proportional to spin speed and always aligned with the spin axis .
If the rotors were levitated electrically instead of magnetically , this tiny effect could be used to tell where their spin axes were pointed .
( Measuring it would of course require magnetic shielding orders of magnitude beyond anything available in 1962 , another story in itself . )
Thus was born the London moment readout , which in its modern incarnation uses SQUIDs ( Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices ) as magnetometers .
So sensitive are these devices that they register a change in spin-axis direction of 1 milliarcsec in five hours of integration time .
( See animation clip " London Moment Readout " below . )
These are only two pieces of an experiment so beautifully intricate that it is as much a work of art as it is science and technology .
Many of its key features reflect a guiding principle of physics experimenters through the ages , namely to turn obstacles into opportunities .
How , for instance , can one meaningfully compare the gyroscope spin-axis direction ( which is read out in volts ) with the position of the guide star ( which comes from an onboard telescope in radians ) ?
The answer is to exploit nature 's own calibration in the form of stellar aberration .
This phenomenon , an apparent back - and - forth motion of the guide star position due to the orbit of the earth around the sun , is entirely Newtonian and inserts " wiggles " into the data whose period and amplitude are exquisitely well known ( to give a sense of the precision of the experiment , the calibration requires terms of second , as well as first order in the earth 's speed v/c ) .
What about the fact that the guide star has an unknown " proper motion " large enough to obscure the predicted relativity signal ?
This allows the experiment to be designed in a classic " double - blind " fashion ; a separate team of astronomers uses VLBI ( Very Long - Baseline radio Interferometry ) to monitor the movements of the guide star itself , relative to even more distant quasars .
Only at the conclusion of the experiment are the two sets of data to be compared ; this helps to prevent the physicists from " finding what they want to see . "
For many more such examples , see the Unique Technology Challenges & Solutions page in the Technology tab .
Gravity Probe B ( or the Stanford Relativity Gyroscope Experiment , as it was known until 1971 ) received its first NASA funding in March 1964 .
The photograph above shows several of the early project leaders with a model of the spacecraft circa 1980 : Dan Debra ( a propulsion expert ) , Fairbank ( the experimental low - temperature physicist par excellence ) , Everitt and Bob Cannon ( a gyroscope specialist ) .

Astrophysical Significance

When Gravity Probe B was originally conceived , frame - dragging was seen as being of more theoretical than practical interest .
To be sure , experimental confirmation of the Einstein ( i.e. Lense - Thirring ) prediction would place another independent constraint on alternative metric theories of gravity .
Frame - dragging precession is proportional to the combination of PPN parameters ( γ+1+α 1 /4 ) / 2 where γ describes the warping of space and α 1 is known as a " preferred - frame " parameter that allows for a possible dependence on motion relative to the rest frame of the universe ( it takes the value zero in general relativity ) .
However , frame - dragging is such a small effect in the solar system that experimental bounds it places on these parameters are not likely to be competitive with those from other tests .
Confirmation of the Einstein ( i.e. Lense - Thirring ) prediction at the 1 % level , for example , would translate into a comparable bound on γ and would not significantly constrain α 1 .
Bardeen - Petterson effect
This situation has changed dramatically since the 1980s .
Physicists now see frame - dragging as the gravitational analog of magnetism , and astrophysicists invoke this gravitomagnetic field as the engine and alignment mechanism for the vast and otherwise incomprehensible jets of gas and magnetic field ejected from quasars and galactic nuclei like the radio source NGC 6251 , as shown above left .
We know that these jets act as power sources for quasars and other strong extragalactic radio sources and that they are generated by compact , supermassive objects ( almost certainly black holes ) inside galactic nuclei , as illustrated above right .
The megaparsec distance scale in the radio image above left implies that these compact objects are capable of holding the jet direction constant over timescale as long as ten million years .
Black holes can only do this by means of their gyroscopic spin , and they can only communicate the direction of that spin to the jet via their gravitomagnetic field H. Such a field will cause an accretion disk to precess around the black hole , and that precession combined with the disk 's viscosity should drive the inner region of the disk into the hole 's equatorial plane , resulting in only two preferred directions for the jets : the north and south poles of the black hole .
This phenomenon , known as the Bardeen - Petterson effect ( diagram at left ) , is widely believed to be the physical mechanism responsible for jet alignment .
Blandford - Znajek effect
Kip
Thorne discusses black holes
in the context of GP - B
Gravitomagnetism is also thought to explain the generation of the astounding energy contained in these jets in the first place .
The event horizon of the black hole acts like a " gravitomagnetic battery " , driving currents around closed loops like that shown in the diagram at left : up the magnetic field lines from the horizon to a region where the magnetic field is weak , across the field lines there , and then back down the field lines to the horizon and through the " battery " where the gravitomagnetic potential of the black hole interacts with the tangential component of the ordinary magnetic field B to produce a drop in electric potential ( see Kip Thorne 's contribution to Near Zero : New Frontiers of Physics , 1988 ) .
This phenomenon , known as the Blandford - Znajek mechanism , effectively draws on the immense gravitomagnetic , rotational energy of the supermassive black hole and converts it into an outgoing stream of ultra-relativistic charged particles .
Gravity Probe B has thus become a crucial test of the mechanism that powers the most violent explosions in the universe .
Cosmological Significance
Star trails at night
Here is a simple experiment that almost anyone can perform on a clear night : pirouette freely around while looking up at the stars .
You will notice two things : one , that the stars seem to spin around in the sky , and two , that your arms are pulled upwards by centrifugal force .
Are these phenomena connected in some physical way ?
Not according to Newton .
For him , centrifugal force is a consequence of accelerating ( i.e. rotating ) with respect to absolute space ; it has no physical origin ( and is therefore often called a " fictitious force " in elementary physics classes ) .
It is , furthermore , a coincidence that the stars above us are at rest with respect to this same absolute space .
We look upward , in effect , from two fundamentally different reference frames : one defined by our local sense of inertia , and the other defined by the global rest frame of the universe at large .
Why should these two reference frames happen to coincide ?
Newton did not try to answer this question .
Kip Thorne discusses the significance
of GP - B for astrophysics & cosmology
We know that the concept of absolute space ( time ) is retained in general relativity , so we might have expected that the same coincidental alignment of our local inertial frame with that of the global matter distribution would carry over to Einstein 's theory as well .
Astonishingly , however , it does not .
If general relativity is correct , then there are strong indications that our local " compass of inertia " has no choice but to be aligned with the rest of the universe — the two are linked by the frame - dragging effect .
These indications do not come from experiment , but from theoretical calculations similar to that performed by Lense and Thirring .
The calculations show that general - relativistic frame - dragging goes over to " perfect dragging " when the dimensions of the large mass ( its size and density ) become cosmological .
In this limit , the distribution of matter in the universe appears sufficient to define the inertial reference frame of observers within it .
For a particularly clear and simple explanation of how and why this happens , see The Unity of the Universe ( 1959 ) by Dennis Sciama .
Had Mach lived 10 years longer , he could have predicted the existence of the extragalactic universe based on observations that the stars in the Milky Way rotate around a common center !
Would the earth still bulge , if it were
standing still and the universe were
rotating around it ?
To put the cosmological significance of frame - dragging in concrete terms , imagine that the earth were standing still and that the rest of the universe were rotating around it : would its equator still bulge ?
Newton would have said " No " .
According to standard textbook physics the equatorial bulge is due to the rotation of the earth with respect to absolute space .
On the basis of Lense and Thirring 's results , however , Einstein would have had to answer " Yes " !
In this respect general relativity is indeed more relativistic than its predecessors : it does not matter whether we choose to regard the earth as rotating and the heavens fixed , or the other way around : the two situations are now dynamically , as well as kinematically equivalent .
The early calculations were flawed in many ways , but the phenomenon of perfect dragging has persisted in most subsequent , more sophisticated treatments , notably those of Helmut Hönl and Heinz Dehnen ( 1962 , 1964 ) , Dieter Brill and Jeffrey Cohen ( 1966 ) and Herbert Pfister and Karlheinz Braun ( 1986 ) .
Pfister sums up current thinking this way in Mach's Principle : From Newton 's Bucket to Quantum Gravity ( 1995 ) : " Although Einstein 's theory of gravity does not , despite its name ' general relativity , ' yet fulfil Mach 's postulate of a description of nature with only relative concepts , it is quite successful in providing an intimate connection between inertial properties and matter , at least in a class of not too unrealistic models for our universe .
Perhaps against majority expectation , this connection is instantaneous in nature .
Furthermore , general relativity has brought us nearer to an understanding of the observational fact that the local inertial compass is fixed relative to the most distant cosmic objects , but there is surely desire for still deeper understanding . "
Thus does direct detection of frame - dragging by Gravity Probe B gain new importance : it will shine experimental light on what has heretofore been a theoretical mystery , namely the origin of inertia .
For some , this is perhaps the most beautiful and profound manifestation of spin in Einstein 's spacetime : it binds us here to the universe out there , in such a way that you , standing at night under the stars on a planet known as earth , cannot turn so much as around without feeling a tug from the rest of the universe .

" 500 Fuß großer Jesus erscheint vor der Uno " , " Abraham Lincoln war eine Frau "  seit 1979 verblüffte das US - Blatt " Weekly World News " seine Leser mit exklusiven Enthüllungen .
Jetzt fällt es der US - Zeitungskrise zum Opfer .
This is a rather huge admission .
Hillary ’s top fundraiser , in what looks to me like an attempt to ( again ) blackmail the party , is now overtly admitting that , if we let the nomination drag out until June , it may be too late to reunify the party and as a result Hillary ’s supporters and fundraisers wo n’t help Obama in the fall .
Unless , of course , she ’s given the VP slot .
Then Her Highness might deign to support the Democratic candidate for president instead of helping the man who plans to overturn Roe v. Wade :
Hillary ’s top campaign fundraising official said in an interview that there ’s a “ risk ” that Hillary ’s political and financial supporters wo n’t get behind Obama in time for him to win in November if she ’s passed over for the veep slot … .
“ But there ’s a risk that if she is n’t invited on the ticket , Hillary ’s political and financial supporters may not feel compelled to be as integrated and involved in the Obama campaign in order to provide the maximum support that he ’ll need to prevail in November . ”
“ We have to recognize that we ’re talking about the month of June , versus a normal process that historically would have begun in the month of March , ” Nemazee said .
“ Time is not your friend .
A dream ticket would be the best way to ensure both unity and full and active support , financially and politically , for the ticket to be in the strongest position to win in the fall . ”
Now , let ’s take a step back to fully appreciate what was just said .
1. Hillary ’s people are now conceding our point that by dragging out the nomination until June they may be jeopardizing Obama ’s chances against McCain .
2. Hillary ’s people are admitting that they know , and do n’t care , that they may be jeopardizing Obama ’s chances against McCain .
Hillary ’s emotional healing is far more important .
3 . And what ’s worse , Hillary ’s people are using the fact that they ’re hurting our chances against McCain as some badge of honor that therefore entitles them to the vice presidency .
How many more times do they need to be blackmailed before Howard Dean , Harry Reid , and Nancy Pelosi tell this emotionally - adolescent basket case to go to hell ?
Honestly , Joe and I almost hope Obama does pick Hillary .
Then we can really vet the Clintons like they ’ve never been vetted before .
Who would n’t like to know all about Bill Clinton ’s travels with Ron Burckle , and just what the two of them were doing on those trips to Vegas together .
And since everything potentially embarrassing is fair game in a vp-vetting , Hillary would have to answer detailed questions as to whether the rumors that were blasted on the front page of a supermarket rag only 6 weeks ago are true .
Then there are the rich foreigners funding Bill Clinton ’s library .
And we ’d of course need to know if there are any more Monicas in Bill Clinton ’s past or present .
The possibilities are endless .
Anybody have any further questions we ’d need answered in a true vetting of Hillary for the vice presidency ?
Post your questions in the comments .

Mr Prasad had saved up for his old age ( Pictures : Prashant Ravi )
A trader in the Indian state of Bihar has lost his life savings after termites infesting his bank 's safe deposit boxes ate them up .
Dwarika Prasad had deposited currency notes and investment papers worth hundreds of thousands of rupees in a bank safe in the state capital Patna .
The bank says it put up a notice warning customers of the termites .
Mr Prasad says he did not see it in time as he did not go to the bank for months after the notice went up .
Bank officials admit they did not inform the customers individually about the termite problem .
' Shattered ' " I 'm shattered .
I do not know what to do as I had kept the money for my old age , " Mr Prasad said .
The trader says he had deposited 450,000 rupees ( $ 11,000 ) in currency notes , investment papers worth 232,000 rupees ( $ 5,660 ) and some gold and silver jewellery in a safe deposit box of the government - owned Central Bank of India .
Mr Prasad says that relations with his wife and children were strained and he wanted to put the money in the safe box to keep it safe from them .
The locker had currency notes and documents worth thousands of dollars
He started using the safe box in September 2005 .
He says when he opened it on 29 January , there was nothing in the safe except termite dust and remains of currency notes and that his investment papers were " badly perforated " .
The white ants did not even spare the ornaments and their sheen has vanished , he says .
" I wrote to the head office of the Central Bank of India and the regional offices of the Reserve Bank of India , " Mr Prasad says .
" Even after two months , I 'm waiting for a response from them . "
' Not liable '
Bank authorities say they put up a notice , dated 8 May 2007 , outside the locker room warning customers about the termite infestation .
They advised customers to remove their documents and papers from their safe .
" We received a few complaints of termites in safe deposit boxes so after putting on the notice , we got pesticides sprayed in the bank , " said bank manager YP Saha .
Mr Saha says the customer cannot blame the bank because he did not find his locker broken or damaged .
" The bank is not liable for the deposits kept inside the safe as it is only when a locker is found broken that the bank is answerable , " he said .
Bank authorities say they have forwarded Mr Prasad 's complaint to higher authorities but they say he is not entitled to any compensation for his loss .

Reports say the ship is carrying millions of rounds of ammunition
The ship carrying weapons to Zimbabwe may return to China after being prevented from unloading in South Africa , a Chinese official has said .
Zambia 's president has called on other African countries not to let the ship enter their waters , in case the arms escalate post-election tensions .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu said the weapons were ordered last year and were " perfectly normal " .
But she said the ship 's owners were considering bringing the ship back .
Ms Jiang said this was because it was proving impossible for Zimbabwe to receive the arms but this has not been confirmed by the Chinese shipping company .
The Chinese vessel was said to be bound for Angola but the US is reported to be pressuring port authorities there and in Namibia not to allow them to dock .
Zambia 's President Levy Mwanawasa said : " I hope this will be the case with all the countries because we do n't want a situation which will escalate the [ tension ] in Zimbabwe more than what it is . "
I do n't understand all this hullabaloo about a lone ship
Patrick Chinamasa
Zimbabwe justice minister
The International Transport Workers Federation says it has asked its members across Africa not to help unload the An Yue Jiang , which is reportedly carrying three million rounds of ammunition , 1,500 rocket - propelled grenades and 2,500 mortar rounds .
The opposition says the weapons could be used to " wage war " on its supporters ahead of a possible run-off in the presidential vote .
This is strongly denied by the government , which has accused the opposition of exaggerating claims of recent political violence .
' Not authorised '
The ship , which had been anchored off the port of Durban for four days , was forced to move on Friday after a South African court refused to allow the weapons on board to be transported across the country to landlocked Zimbabwe .
Despite reports the ship was heading for Angola , an ally of Zimbabwe 's government , the director of the Institute of Angolan Ports said the vessel had not asked for permission to dock in Angola .
" This ship has not sought request to enter Angolan territorial waters and it's not authorised to enter Angolan ports , " Filomeno Mendonca told local radio .
But the agent handling the ship said its next port of call would be the Angolan capital , Luanda , AFP news agency reports .
A South African military spokesman said the ship was no longer in South African waters .
Zimbabwe 's Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa said it was their right to defend themselves and buy weapons from any legitimate source .
" I do n't understand all this hullabaloo about a lone ship , " he told reporters .
The country has yet to publish the results of its 29 March presidential election , which the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) says was won outright by its candidate Morgan Tsvangirai .
' Torture camps '
Meanwhile , the southern African regional body , SADC , rejected Mr Tsvangirai 's calls for South Africa 's Thabo Mbeki to be replaced as the chief mediator for Zimbabwe .
" We have complete faith in President [ Thabo ] Mbeki , " AFP quoted Mauritius Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam as saying .
Mr Tsvangirai wants President Mwanawasa to take over , with some opposition supporters saying Mr Mbeki was close to Mr Mugabe .

Advertisement A recount in 23 out of 210 parliamentary seats , which had been due to end on Monday , has been delayed for an unknown period .
The MDC rejected the recount as illegal and insisted it beat President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party outright in presidential and parliamentary polls .
The leader of the governing African National Congress in South Africa - Jacob Zuma - has again criticised the delays in publishing the election results - further distancing himself from Mr Mbeki .
" It 's not acceptable .
It 's not helping the Zimbabwean people who have gone out to ... elect the kind of party and presidential candidate they want , exercising their constitutional right , " he told Reuters news agency .
He called on African leaders to take action to solve the political deadlock that has set in since last month 's disputed election .
Violence Post- election violence has displaced 3,000 people , injured 500 and left 10 dead , according to MDC secretary general Tendai Biti .
All the signs are that the ruling Zanu - PF party is still deeply split over how to handle the crisis
Robin Lustig
Read Robin 's thoughts in full Human rights groups say they have found camps where people are being tortured for having voted " the wrong way " .
But Mr Chinamasa denied that anyone had died in political violence .
Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said that of the 10 people reported dead , only four names had been supplied and " of these three no basis whatsoever while the fourth is still under investigation and will be concluded soon " , he was reported as saying by the state - owned Herald newspaper .
Zimbabwe 's church leaders are also calling for intervention to prevent the violence reaching genocidal proportions .
" If nothing is done to help the people of Zimbabwe from their predicament , we shall soon be witnessing genocide similar to that experienced in Kenya , Rwanda , Burundi and other hot spots in Africa and elsewhere , " leaders of the main denominations said in a joint statement .
" We appeal to the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , the African Union and the United Nations to work towards arresting the deteriorating political and security situation in Zimbabwe , " a statement said .

What are these ?
The box and some info about the Miracle Fruit came in a USPS Envelope .
You have about 24 - 48 hours to consume / freeze these before they go bad .
Inside the box was a bundle of foil and some papertowels padding it …
In the foil were 6 juicy red Magic Berries !
( It makes me think of the gummi bears and their gummi berri potions )
So i picked up some of the recommended pairings to test with …
Lime , Lemon , Grapefruit , Pomelo , Blue Cheese , Guinness … and had some of the super sour chinese sweet / sour / bitter / salty preserved mandarin peel .
Sliced up the fruit , and figured i’d try a bit of everything BEFORE so i could tell there was a difference after .
Guinness was delicious , blue cheese on crackers not bad ….
and then i grabbed the lime .
UGH .
Apparently i have n’t bit into a slice of lime without a shot of tequila preceding it … ever ?
Inside the fruit … its white , juicy , and fleshy inside that red skin… much like the texture of a custard apple , sapote , mangostein , etc … the flesh clings to the seed quite a bit , so there ’s a bit of work to get it cleaned off
Here is a cleaned seed ~ ready for planting !
( Check back in a year or so to see if i’m growing any fruits of my own )
So what happened ?
First impression ~ confusing .
You still SMELL everything as it was / is .
Although already weary from the first lime experience , i went for it anyways about a minute after sucking the seed clean … and it was like eating limeade .
It was confusing really , my sense / mind did n’t quite get what was going on .
Then i went for the lemon , and it really did taste like lemonade !
Then the grapefruit , which was already pretty sweet … and what little sourness it did have was gone , it was sweeter / waterier tasting .
The bitter bits of the pomelo became rather enjoyable !
The blue cheese - i think the hardest part here was that it smelled the same - it tasted like a far milder form of itself , almost more like brie with small chunks of blue cheese in it .
The chinese mandarin peels … it was not the pseudo - medicinal taste i despised as a kid , but tasted more like candied peels sans crunchy sugary bits on the outside !
Very weird .
As for the Guinness ~ as someone who likes Guinness ~ i must say do NOT waste your Guinness like this … it was so gross .
I ca n’t quite explain it , it was n’t like it became apple cider … more just like bad beer .
blech .
The effects lasted about 20 - 25 minutes for me before a lick of the lime made me make faces again .
There is no coating you feel on your tongue , mouth , etc .
You eat it , and it just kind of does its thing .
I made my mom come try one , and her reaction ?
She dislikes the feeling that your senses are being messed with .
And if you ’re going to ingest something to mess with you , it should be more fun / exciting of a headtrip .
Also , if you ’re trying to diet with this , why not just try to actually restrain yourself , instead of finding a loophole around sugar ?
Bottom line ?
Bizarre .
I can certainly see why the African tribes like eating it before bitter medicines .
Certainly worth experiencing , and while I do feel like it could have been a bit more emotionally satisfying , its really quite bizarre to have your tastebuds messed with so easily .
Definitely a fun crazy party food experiment that will leave guests with that look of surprised bewilderment ~ and the ingredients are cheap !
And if you are a terrible chef , its ok , everything will taste deliciously sweet ?
As for tracking some down ~ visit my friend ’s friend that hooked me up with these juicy magic berries over at Miracle Connect ~ it ’s a work in progress !… and for all your NYers , you can apparently pick them up directly from them .
The 25 - year - old Goffney twins , both of New Jersey , were arrested Feb. 19 .
They were charged with breaking into Moon 's Beauty Shop at 9th and Washington streets in South Philadelphia and the adjoining Wings and More , using only a handsaw and ax to get in through the roofs of the establishments .

När du gör månatliga hypotekslån betalas några av pengarna på lånets principiella balans , medan en annan del av betalningen går mot räntorna på hypotekslånet .
Efter att ha framgångsrikt slutfört ett långsiktigt betalningsschema , äger du huset gratis och klart och tar emot titeln för fastigheten .
På samma sätt kan du behöva finansiera ett bilinköp ( låna 300 000 ) .
Bil lån med låg ränta är tillgängliga från återförsäljare och privata långivare , förlängning av återbetalningsvillkor för ett antal år tills du har betalat hela beloppet .
Även om billån ger ett annat exempel på långfristig finansiering , återbetalas de vanligen inom några år , jämfört med inteckningar , vilket kan ta decennier för att tillfredsställa .
Till skillnad från inteckningar och bilfinansiering tjänar samma dag lån med låg ränta specifikt när det gäller terminsbehov .
De ger perfekta lösningar när du behöver få pengar , men du måste planera att betala tillbaka dem i veckor eller månader , enligt villkoren i ditt låneavtal .

It has become apparent during the last few hours that Comcast , everyone 's favorite ISP ( especially in the BitTorrent world ) has been hacked .
The message on the homepage read : " KRYOGENIKS EBK and DEFIANT RoXed COMCAST . "
When you ’re as large as Comcast , you ca n’t please all of the people , all of the time .
Although it has done so in other ways too , Comcast managed to annoy a large portion of its customer base with its throttling activities , not to mention its misleading statements and ‘ smokescreen ’ attitude when it was discovered to be squirming away from the truth .
Maybe it ’s this that motivated a group of individuals to make the next move ?
This morning many people will be celebrating as reports circulate that in the last few hours Comcast has been the subject of a hacking which defaced its homepage ( mirror here ) .
The hackers appear to have changed the Comcast DNS / WHOIS records which were pointing at a non-Comcast address .
Although back to normal now , for a while the records displayed this data :

A Comcast employee said : “ The servers are fine and are reachable if the DNS server you are using is pointing to the correct place .
As far as we can tell , the hack was a one shot deal , not an ongoing event . ”
There are reports that concerned users telephoning to inform Comcast were summarily disconnected , with a level of panic centered round the security of the Comcast email system with reports that the hackers were picking off Comcast user ’s usernames and passwords .
As yet , this is unconfirmed .
Others claim they were treated politely by Comcast and told to use a temporary site in the meantime , located at http://beta.comcast.net/a/.
The Comcast forums also went down and then started diverting to http://www6.comcast.net/a/.
There are rumors circulating that the group responsible for the hack previously targeted Justin Timberlake and Hilary Duff .

At O'Reilly 's Emerging Technology Conference last week , I hosted a panel on the future of " mind hacks , " from cognitive fitness programs to smart drugs to neuro - implants .
One of the panelists was Timo Hannay , publishing director of Nature.com , who talked about a recent heated debate taking place on the journal 's site around the ethics of using brain drugs for wakefulness , focus , and other cognitive " enhancements . "
Nature is continuing that discussion with a public " brain boosting drugs " survey .
Today 's New York Times " Week In Review " takes a look at the controversy .
From the New York Times :
" Suppose you 're preparing for the SAT , or going for a job interview – in those situations where you have to perform on that day , these drugs will be very attractive , " said Dr. Barbara Sahakian of Cambridge , a co-author with Sharon Morein - Zamir of the recent essay in Nature .
" The desire for cognitive enhancement is very strong , maybe stronger than for beauty , or athletic ability . "
Jeffrey
White , a graduate student in cell biology who has attended several institutions , said that those numbers sounded about right .
" You can usually tell who 's using them because they can be angry , testy , hyperfocused , they do n't want to be bothered , " he said …
One person who posted anonymously on the Chronicle of Higher Education Web site said that a daily regimen of three 20 - milligram doses of Adderall transformed his career : " I 'm not talking about being able to work longer hours without sleep ( although that helps ) , " the posting said .
" I 'm talking about being able to take on twice the responsibility , work twice as fast , write more effectively , manage better , be more attentive , devise better and more creative strategies . "
Researchers at The University of Nottingham have taken some important first steps to creating a synthetic copycat of a living cell , a leading science journal reports .
Dr Cameron Alexander and PhD student George Pasparakis in the University 's School of Pharmacy have used polymers — long - chain molecules — to construct capsule - like structures that have properties mimicking the surfaces of a real cell .
In the new work , they show how in the laboratory they have been able to encourage the capsules to ' talk ' to natural bacteria cells and transfer molecular information .
The breakthrough could have a number of potential medical uses .
Among them could be the development of new targeted drug delivery systems , where the capsules would be used to carry drug molecules to attack specific diseased cells in the body , while leaving healthy cells intact , thereby reducing the number of side affects that can be associated with treatments for life - threatening illnesses such as cancer .
The technology could also be used as an anti-microbial agent , allowing doctors to destroy harmful bacteria , without attacking other health - promoting bacteria in the body , which could offer a new weapon in the fight against superbugs .
Dr Cameron Alexander said : “ These are very primitive steps in the lab , and still a long way from a true synthetic counterpart to a biological cell , but we have demonstrated that we can transfer certain molecules from inside the synthetic capsule to the bacteria when they are in physical contact , which is an exciting development .
“ It 's extremely early stages , but it 's a move closer to the big experiment when we can one day ask whether a natural cell can think a synthetic cell is one of its own . ”
The work has been funded through the IDEAS Factory programme run by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) , which aims to promote blue sky , curiosity - led research .
It comes ahead of the launch of one of the UK's first research networks into synthetic biology , which is led by Nottingham computer scientists and pharmacists with chemists at Oxford and Glasgow universities .
The network , funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BBSRC ) and the EPSRC Life Sciences Interface Programme , involves collaboration across six centres and includes scientific and ethics experts in the emerging field of synthetic biology .
A network of individuals , independent and alternative media activists and organisations , offering grassroots , non-corporate , non-commercial coverage of important social and political issues .

Fair Game .

What in the name of Xenu are they on about ?
To understand Anonymous – what it is and why it exists – it is necessary to understand the Church of Scientology and why it has attracted the attention it has over the last half - century or so .
Scientology was created by L Ron Hubbard , an American science fiction writer .
In 1950 he published the book Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health .
In it , Hubbard claimed that problems facing human beings were the result of engrams , negative experiences stored in an area of the brain called the reactive mind .
Through Dianetics techniques – in particular a form of counselling known as auditing – these engrams could be cleansed from the body , freeing the mind and leaving the person with the status of Clear .
At the time Hubbard 's theories were discredited and dismissed by most critics , on psychological , medical and scientific grounds .
Undeterred , Hubbard continued his work , moving from Dianetics as a theory of the mind to Scientology as a religious philosophy .
Critics have drawn much attention to this , due both to the fact that Scientology did not begin as a religion , and Hubbard 's oft - circulated quote that “ if a man really wants to make a million dollars , the best way would be to start his own religion . "
As Scientology and Dianetics grew , a number of aspects were added .
In particular , a form of recinarnation , in which a person 's soul ( or Thetan ) passed from one body to the next on death , is described in Hubbard 's book Have You Lived Before This Life ?
Engrams were thus described as resulting not only from experiences in the subject 's current existence but also from past lives , some lived on alien worlds over a history spanning trillions of years ( a figure disputed by scientists as longer than the known age of the universe . )
These engrams , much as those incurred during this lifetime , could be cleared through Scientology practices – for a “ nominal fee , ” of course .
Beyond the status of Clear lie “ hidden ” levels known as Operating Thetan .
An Operating Thetan is a person who , having cast off those forces holding them back , is able to function as a Thetan – a spiritual being .
There are a number of Operating Thetan levels ( fifteen in total , of which eight have been used so far ) , each of which reveals another portion of the Church 's teachings , again for a “ nominal fee ” , the cumulative total for OT8 ( that is , Operating Thetan Level Eight ) being approximated as nearly three hundred thousand US dollars .
The Church of Scientology now has centres worldwide and the endorsement of celebrities such as Beck , John Travolta , and – perhaps most prominently – Tom Cruise .
As the Church has grown , however , so has concern over allegations of authoritarian control of its members , harassment and intimidation of its critics , excessive fees for membership , and cult - like behaviour .
2. Fair Game .
One policy of the Church of Scientology to gain the most criticism is known as Fair Game .
L Ron Hubbard , in an internal policy document , described Fair Game as follows :
***
ENEMY — SP Order .
Fair game .
May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist .
May be tricked , sued or lied to or destroyed .
***
SP in the above refers to Suppressive Person , the Church 's term for its critics .
Perhaps the most infamous application of the Fair Game policy was its use against journalist Paulette Cooper .
Cooper wrote an article in 1970 criticising the Church , which was later expanded into a book , the Scandal of Scientology .
In it she condemned several activities of the Church , including its financial exploitation of its members , its authoritarian , cultish structure , and abuse within the Church 's elite sector known as the Sea Org .
In response , the Church launched an attempt to drive Cooper to a mental institution or jail through escalating harassment .
Methods included obscene phone calls , death threats , blackmail , and the staging of two bomb threats in Cooper 's name against the Church .
Attempts were made on her life .
This was to be followed by Operation Freakout , in which fraudulent threats supposed to be from Cooper would be made to foreign consulates and the President and Secretary of State .
3. Operation Snow White and the FBI
This , however , was not to be .
Another Church “ Operation ” , dubbed Snow White , had Church agents carrying out infiltrations of and theft from offices of the US government and other entities , in order to purge documents which were unflattering towards the Church in general and Hubbard in particular .
This has been described as the largest single infiltration of the US government in history .
During the government investigation into Operation Snow White , the FBI conducted a series of raids on Scientology offices .
These raids resulted in the seizure of documents related to other issues , including the plot against Paulette Cooper described above .
Another Church project uncovered as a result of the raids was codenamed Project Normandy , the Church 's plan to take over the town of Clearwater , Florida .
After purchasing the Fort Harrison Hotel under an assumed name the Church has gradually extended its influence throughout the town , hiring police officers as private security and infiltrating local media .
Operation Snow
White was carried out by the Guardian 's Office , an organisation with a mandate to oversee the Church .
Following the FBI raids and subsequent jailing of key members of the GO , the Office was shut down , to be replaced by the Office of Special Affairs which continues today .
4. The Sea Organisation
The Sea Organisation ( or Sea Org ) was founded by Hubbard in 1966 and based on a number of ships located in the Mediterranean Sea .
Hubbard , a former member of the US Navy , pronounced himself Commodore and structured the Sea Org along naval lines , a practice which continues today although the majority of Sea Org bases are now on land ( with the exception of its ship , the Freewinds ) .
Sea
Org staff are required to sign one billion year contracts , pledging to return to work at the Sea Org when their Thetan returns to take control of a body .
Workers for the Sea Org who fail to live up to Scientology standards may be referred to the Rehabilitation Project Force , a series of work camps run by the Org to “ rehabilitate ” troublesome members .
In addition to studying Scientology , residents of the RPF are required to perform gruelling manual labour and live in appalling accomodation .
While the Church compares them to the Boy Scouts or US Marine Boot Camps as projects combining labour with ethical instruction , critics see them as more reminiscent of the gulags of the Soviet Union .
One former Scientologist described the RPF as follows :
***
It was essentially a prison to which crew who were considered nonproducers , security risks , or just wanted to leave the Sea Org , were assigned .
Hubbard 's RPF policies established the conditions .
RPF members were segregated and not allowed to communicate to anyone else .
They had their own spaces and were not allowed in normal crew areas of the ship .
They ate after normal crew had eaten , and only whatever was left over from the crew meal .
Their berthing was the worst on board , in a roach - infested , filthy and unventilated cargo hold .
They wore black boilersuits , even in the hottest weather .
They were required to run everywhere .
Discipline was harsh and bizarre , with running laps of the ship assigned for the slightest infraction like failing to address a senior with " Sir . "
***
Testimony from other ex-members indicates that conditions on land bases are little better .
RPF members , as well as working on Sea Org bases , may be deployed to other Scientology sites , allegedly including a number of the “ Celebrity Centres ” run for the cult 's elite members .
Those who are deemed to have failed to meet the RPF 's standards may be sent to the RPF 's RPF , an even more brutal regime .
5. Lisa McPherson
It is difficult to research Scientology without encountering the tragic story of Lisa McPherson .
Lisa , a 36 year old Scientologist , was involved in a car accident in Clearwater , Florida , in 1995 .
While physically relatively unharmed , her behaviour led hospital staff to believe her to be mentally unstable , and to request that she remain in the hospital for observation .
Due to Scientology 's opposition to psychiatry , she , with the help of other Scientologists , checked herself out of the hospital and was placed under the care of the Church .
This care , in line with Scientology teaching , included regular doses of vitamins , protein supplements , and natural remedies .
As her physical and mental condition continued to deteriorate , the Church eventually consulted a Scientologist doctor who advised that she be taken to the nearest hospital , an option refused by the Church due to fears that she would be placed under psychiatric care .
Instead , she was taken to the doctor in question 's hospital , where she was pronounced dead .
The original coroner 's report on her death concluded that it was the result of an embolism triggered by dehydration , and estimated that she had been without fluids for five to ten days .
It was also estimated that she had been unconscious for up to 48 hours before being admitted to hospital .
A number of marks on her body were identified as consistent with cockroach bites , triggering concerns about the unsanitary conditions in which she was held prior to her death .
6 . The Internet
The Church 's relationship with the internet has been a strained one .
In 1991 , a newsgroup was created named alt .religion .scientology for the purposes of discussion of Scientology and the Church .
The group would quickly become a source of heated debate between Scientologists , former Scientologists , critics and agents of the Office of Special Affairs .
In 1994 , internal Church documents were leaked to the newsgroup detailing the “ secret ” Operating Thetan levels .
Among these was the aspect of Scientology most known to the public : the story of Xenu , which forms part of Operating Thetan Level 3 ( OT3 ) .
This story runs as follows :
***
75 million years ago , the dictator Xenu was ruler of the Galactic Confederacy , an alliance of planets including Earth ( then known as Teegeeack . )
Xenu , with the aid of psychiatrists , herded people from these worlds onto space ships ( which were exact replicas of Douglas DC - 8 aeroplanes , but with the ability to fly through space ) under the pretext of a tax inspection , and took them to Teegeeack , where they were arranged around the outside of volcanoes .
Xenu then detonated hydrogen bombs inside these volcanoes , killing them all .
The souls ( Thetans ) of the murdered aliens were then captured and brainwashed ( “ implanted ” ) with misleading information including all other world religions and a number of other concepts .
These Thetans clustered together in their thousands to form Body Thetans , which attached themselves to then - primitive human beings and continue to this day to cause us problems from depression to sickness to war .
***
As the writers of South Park put it in their episode satirising Scientology , THIS IS WHAT SCIENTOLOGISTS ACTUALLY BELIEVE .
The posting of these documents led to legal action on the part of the Church , who claimed the Xenu story to be copyright and a trade secret – while simultaneously denying its existence .
The Church also attempted to have the alt.religion .
scientology newsgroup removed , a move attacked by advocates of free expression .
Other actions taken by the Church with regard to the Internet include :
* A lawsuit against Arnaldo Lerma , ex-Scientologist and critic , for republishing the story of Xenu .
* Use of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) to force AT&T Worldnet , an internet service provider , to reveal the identity of one of its subscribers who had been posting anonymously to alt.religion.scientology
* Legal action against Google , again using the DMCA , to remove Operation Clambake ( a popular anti-Scientology website ) from its search results .
While Google initially complied , the decision was reversed following mass complaints .
A number of other websites , such as Slashdot.org and YTMND.com , have been the targets of cease - and - desist orders from the Church of Scientology for republishing excerpts of the original Xenu materials .
In 2008 an internal video featuring Tom Cruise was leaked onto the website gawker.com and quickly gained attention due to Cruise 's behaviour , described by many as erratic , bizarre and fanatical .
The video was in turn placed on a number of other websites .
The Church issued cease and desist orders against websites , including YouTube and Gawker , hosting the video , demanding it be removed .
7. We Are Anonymous
Now we come full circle .
As the Church attempted to have the video removed , another video , titled simply “ Message to Scientology ” , was distributed online .
This video , a declaration of war against the Church , coincided with Distributed Denial of Service ( DDOS ) attacks which succeeded in disabling a number of key Scientology websites .
This – later described as an opening salvo to grab the attention of the public and the media – quickly evolved into a movement pushing for global demonstrations against the Church on the 10th of February 2008 .
Demonstrators wore masks resembling those from the film and comic V for Vendetta , to protect their identities from later reprisals from the Church 's Office of Special Affairs , as a symbolic statement against tyranny , and to reinforce the concept of Anonymous : that it is everywhere and nowhere , everyone and no -one .
Described by the church as Nazi-Communist hate criminals in the pay of the German government ( which has refused to grant the Church tax - exempt religious status ) and the psychiatric establishment , and by the media as “ hackers on steroids ” , Anonymous is chaotic , disorganised , organic , viral , confusing , amusing and growing .
It is in this structureless , leaderless , anarchic environment that many find strength when put against an organisation which is based on , and can only understand , the most rigid forms of authority .
8. Conclusions
As I write this , preparations are already underway for the 15th of March , the next round of global demonstrations , timed to take place close to the birthday of L Ron Hubbard .
Critics have come forward to voice their support , ex-members have been given the courage to speak out , and people worldwide are becoming aware that the kooky sect with some strange ideas is the home of a rotten and destructive core .
Only time will tell what effect this will have in the long term , and whether the Church can adapt to face its new challenge , but one thing is clear : the Church is under threat .
We are Anonymous .
Expect us .

The posting of these documents led to legal action on the part of the Church , who claimed the Xenu story to be copyright and a trade secret – while simultaneously denying its existence .
The Church also attempted to have the alt.religion .
scientology newsgroup removed , a move attacked by advocates of free expression .
Other actions taken by the Church with regard to the Internet include : * A lawsuit against Arnaldo Lerma , ex-Scientologist and critic , for republishing the story of Xenu . *
Use of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) to force AT&T Worldnet , an internet service provider , to reveal the identity of one of its subscribers who had been posting anonymously to alt.religion.scientology *
Legal action against Google , again using the DMCA , to remove Operation Clambake ( a popular anti-Scientology website ) from its search results .
While Google initially complied , the decision was reversed following mass complaints .
A number of other websites , such as Slashdot.org and YTMND.com , have been the targets of cease - and - desist orders from the Church of Scientology for republishing excerpts of the original Xenu materials .
In 2008 an internal video featuring Tom Cruise was leaked onto the website gawker.com and quickly gained attention due to Cruise 's behaviour , described by many as erratic , bizarre and fanatical .
The video was in turn placed on a number of other websites .
The Church issued cease and desist orders against websites , including YouTube and Gawker , hosting the video , demanding it be removed .
7 . We Are AnonymousNow we come full circle .
As the Church attempted to have the video removed , another video , titled simply “ Message to Scientology ” , was distributed online .
This video , a declaration of war against the Church , coincided with Distributed Denial of Service ( DDOS ) attacks which succeeded in disabling a number of key Scientology websites .
This – later described as an opening salvo to grab the attention of the public and the media – quickly evolved into a movement pushing for global demonstrations against the Church on the 10th of February 2008 .
Demonstrators wore masks resembling those from the film and comic V for Vendetta , to protect their identities from later reprisals from the Church 's Office of Special Affairs , as a symbolic statement against tyranny , and to reinforce the concept of Anonymous : that it is everywhere and nowhere , everyone and no - one .
Described by the church as Nazi-Communist hate criminals in the pay of the German government ( which has refused to grant the Church tax - exempt religious status ) and the psychiatric establishment , and by the media as “ hackers on steroids ” , Anonymous is chaotic , disorganised , organic , viral , confusing , amusing and growing .
It is in this structureless , leaderless , anarchic environment that many find strength when put against an organisation which is based on , and can only understand , the most rigid forms of authority .
8. ConclusionsAs
I write this , preparations are already underway for the 15th of March , the next round of global demonstrations , timed to take place close to the birthday of L Ron Hubbard .
Critics have come forward to voice their support , ex-members have been given the courage to speak out , and people worldwide are becoming aware that the kooky sect with some strange ideas is the home of a rotten and destructive core .
Only time will tell what effect this will have in the long term , and whether the Church can adapt to face its new challenge , but one thing is clear : the Church is under threat .
We are Anonymous .
Expect us .

Many organizations are plagued with intolerably long , frequent , and ineffective meetings .
Here ’s what I ’ve learned about how to have better , fewer , shorter meetings .
Most of these insights come from working with Freyr Guðmundsson at my start - up ( formerly GoodsCloud , now NewStore ) , and he tells me that many are originally from the book Death by Meeting .
Meeting types
There are three types of meetings :
Strategic : meetings about what we should do .
Tactical : meetings about how we are going to accomplish the strategy we already agreed on .
Reflective : meetings about what went right and wrong and how we can do better next time .
These meeting types should occur in this sequence , in a loop .
Everyone should understand these meeting categories .
Every meeting should fall into only one category .
If a meeting category starts to change , that ’s ok , but the group should be conscious of that when it happens .
Strategic meetings can change into tactical ones : “ we ca n’t choose that strategy until we know how it will work ” or reflective ones : “ we tried that last time and it did n’t work ” .
Tactical meetings can change into strategic ones : “ Well now maybe with these new thoughts we picked the wrong strategy ” or reflective ones : “ we tried that last time and it did n’t work ” .
And reflective meetings can turn into either , as you discover a better strategy or tactic and want to start exploring it .
When a strategic or tactical meeting changes to a different type , it ’s a sign that previous meetings were incomplete , or skipped , an important participant was excluded , or institutional knowledge and experience has not spread to the whole team .
When a reflective meeting changes to a different type , it ’s a sign of the team getting ahead of itself .
When a meeting type is changing , one thing the participants can do is explicitly note that it ’s now a different kind of meeting and agree to the change .
But it ’s often better to put the triggering issue aside and reschedule a new meeting of the new type for that issue , because frequently different people need to be in the meeting now that it ’s a different type .
Controlling meeting lengths
Strategic meetings are the only kind that should be open - ended .
It helps to loosely time - box them , but if they go over , that ’s ok .
Tactical and reflective meetings should be strictly time - boxed and rescheduled , not continued , if they go over time .
Develop zero tolerance for anyone arriving late to meetings .
Being five minutes late for a six person meeting wastes thirty minutes of company time .
There are stories about companies that charge people $ 1 per minute per person that they are late to meetings .
Two minutes late to an eight - person meeting ?
$ 16 off your paycheck .
I ’m not suggesting this ( it probably is illegal in some places ) but it ’s good to make people aware that showing up late has a real cost .
Give a five minute grace time at the end of the meeting for people to take a break , go to the bathroom , get a coffee or a smoke , before their next meeting .
So , schedule them for 11:00 - 11:25 , or 11:00 - 11:55 , not 11:00 - 11:30 , or 11:00 - 12:00 .
This grace period will also help with tardiness .
Meetings tend to expand to their allotted time .
Experiment with five , ten , fifteen minute meetings , do n’t just make everything a half hour or an hour .
Anectdote : I once had a two - day workshop with a client who flew in three people to meet with two from our company .
We spent about an hour understanding the problem , and another hour working out a solution .
Then we spent the remainder of the day and a half mediating a contentious argument between two people from the client company , which was ultimately irrelevant to the solution .
And we could n’t stop it .
These two people were in a power struggle and they suddenly had the free time allocated to pursue it .
At the end of day two , as the client was packing up to go to the airport and get back to work , the two guys agreed to disagree on their contentious point , and we all reiterated our commitment to the solution we ’d come up with in the first two hours the day before .
It had been a huge waste of everyone ’s time , but a great example of how people can fill up left - over meeting time for something else .
Meeting Participants
Meetings should contain only the minimum number of people that are necessary .
The absolute best is to keep the meetings to no more than two or three .
If someone is sitting there , typing / tapping on his / her laptop / phone , and not really listening , that person was not necessary and should n’t have been invited .
Enforcing Meeting Etiquette
The most important point about meeting etiquette is to develop a culture where everyone , not just the boss or meeting leader , is aware of and advocating for the company ’s meeting etiquette and rules .
The person who calls the meeting is responsible for publicizing the meeting type and the allotted time .
If this is not done , then the rest of the team should ask for that information at the beginning of the meeting , or it should be canceled .
It ’s everyone ’s responsibility , not just the boss or meeting leader , to keep an eye on the time , to stick to the meeting type , and to call out when the time is up or when the meeting is changing type .
It ’s also everyone ’s responsibility to speak up when there is too much conflict .
Often it ’s the two most powerful / influential people in the meeting who end up arguing , and the others feel unable to speak up about it , and end up trapped listening to an argument .
Develop a culture where anybody , even the person who just started yesterday , can speak up and say “ calm down ! ” or ask “ can you continue this discussion at a different time ? ”
Examples
I would hold strategic architecture meetings with just two or three of my devs from a nine - person team , and schedule them for an hour , and almost always end them early .
Our nine - person dev team ’s reflective meetings were strictly time - boxed to one hour ( well , 55 minutes ) .
We frequently had more to talk about at the end , but usually they were points that only one or two people really cared about , so we would break out into little groups and talk about those remaining issues informally over the next day or so .
Conclusion
It might seem like a lot of work to stick to all of these guidelines and ideas , but actually it was n’t that hard for us .
I hope it helps you enjoy better , fewer and shorter meetings too .
Technologists have long known about silicon 's limitations as principal ingredient in microchips .
It just so happens they 've just been really good at coming up with workarounds .
Still , as chipmakers continue to shrink down computer circuitry so they can cram all manner of components into smaller and smaller areas , eventually those diminutive circuits come face - to - face with the cold , hard laws of physics .
Put simply , they start to leak current , making them lousy at retaining digital information .
Even Gordon Moore , who is constantly predicting an end to his own law , has expressed perpetual amazement that companies like Intel have come up with temporary solutions to these very real physical limitations for so long .
Well , that 's about to change , according to Suman Datta , a researcher at Pennsylvania State University .
During a talk at Britain 's University of Leeds on Friday , Datta gave a hard deadline for silicon 's remaining usefulness , saying that silicon chips have no more than four years of further miniaturization left .
After that point , chipmakers will need to look elsewhere for their electronic - circuitry needs .
One potential replacement is carbon nanotubes .
These tubes of pure carbon , which are about the width of a typical protein molecule , also happen to conduct electricity .
As such , some researchers have proposed using them as tiny molecular - scale wires for making electronic circuitry .
Unfortunately , they also cost about $ 500 a gram at the moment .
The other solution that will be proposed at the Leeds physics conference in the coming week is superconductors , or materials that conduct electricity with zero electrical resistance .
Researchers will supposedly demonstrate new ways to harness the power of quantum qubits to boost computing power .
To date , there remain very practical difficulties in building a quantum computer , and so far such computers have only been used to solve trivial problems .
Furthermore , even if we do switch conducting materials , Moore says there will remain some very fundamental limitations to microelectronics we can't mess with – namely , the speed of light and the atomic nature of matter .
Looks like we 'll have to revert back to old - fashioned magic to overcome those hurdles .
WASHINGTON , July 28 — Two summers ago , on a Congressional trip to Estonia , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton astonished her traveling companions by suggesting that the group do what one does in the Baltics : hold a vodka - drinking contest .
Delighted , the leader of the delegation , Senator John McCain , quickly agreed .
The after - dinner drinks went so well — memories are a bit hazy on who drank how much — that Mr. McCain , an Arizona Republican , later told people how unexpectedly engaging he found Mrs. Clinton to be .
“ One of the guys ” was the way he described Mrs. Clinton , a New York Democrat , to some Republican colleagues .
Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain went on to develop an amiable if professionally calculated relationship .
They took more official trips together , including to Iraq .
They worked together on the Senate Armed Services Committee and on the issue of global warming .
They made a joint appearance last year on “ Meet the Press , ” interacting so congenially that the moderator , Tim Russert , joked about their forming a “ fusion ticket . ”
Politics being what it is , there is more friction than fusion .
As the 2008 presidential campaign begins to take shape , with Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton at the top of the polls for their parties ’ nominations , they are increasingly underscoring their differences on issues like the war in Iraq and port security .
Advisers to Mr. McCain have put a stop to his inviting Mrs. Clinton on trips .
Donald Rumsfeld is today a discredited and widely reviled figure .
Robert Gates , Rumsfeld ’s successor as Defense secretary , is generally admired for manifesting qualities that Rumsfeld lacked -- a willingness to listen not least among them .
Yet on one crucial point , the two see eye to eye : Both believe that the United States has no alternative but to wage a global war likely to last decades .
In the wake of 9/11 , Rumsfeld wasted no time in telling Americans what to expect .
“ Forget about ‘ exit strategies , ’ ” he said on Sept. 28 , 2001 , “ we ’re looking at a sustained engagement that carries no deadlines . ”
Speaking at West Point last month , Gates echoed his predecessor ’s assessment : “ There are no exit strategies , ” he announced .
Instead , Gates described a “ generational campaign ” entailing “ many years of persistent , engaged combat all around the world . ”
For the United States , the prospect of permanent war now beckons .
Well into the first decade of this generational struggle , Americans remained oddly confused about its purpose .
Is the aim to ensure access to cheap and abundant oil ?
Spread democracy ?
Avert nuclear proliferation ?
Perpetuate the American empire ?
Preserve the American way of life ?
From the outset , the enterprise that Gates now calls the “ Long War ” has been about all of these things and more .
Advertisement
Back in September 2001 , Rumsfeld put it this way : “ We have a choice -- either to change the way we live , which is unacceptable , or to change the way that they live ; and we chose the latter . ”
In this context , “ they ” represent the billion or so Muslims inhabiting the greater Middle East .
When Rumsfeld offered this statement of purpose and President Bush committed the United States to open - ended war , both assumed that U.S. military supremacy was beyond dispute .
At the time , most Americans shared that assumption .
A conviction that “ the troops ” were unstoppable invested the idea of transforming the greater Middle East with a superficial plausibility .
Yet by the time Gates spoke last month , the limits of American military power had long since become apparent .
In Iraq and Afghanistan , the opening rounds of the generational campaign are now well underway .
By historical standards , each qualifies as a fairly small war .
In neither case , however , have U.S. forces been able to achieve decisive victory .
In both cases , barring drastic changes in U.S. policy , fighting will drag on for years to come .
In the meantime , what has the Long War achieved ?
The answer to that question is indisputable : not much .
Counting on military might to change the way they live is n’t working .
If anything , the effort has backfired .

Since 2001 , the price of oil per barrel has quadrupled , adversely affecting all but the wealthiest Americans .
Efforts to spread democracy have either stalled or succeeded only in enhancing the standing of groups like Hamas and Hezbollah .
The much - hyped Iraqi nuclear threat turned out to be illusory .
To sustain the overstretched American imperium , we are accumulating debt at a staggering clip .
And with U.S. soldiers shouldering repetitive combat tours , the strength of our army slowly ebbs away .
Meanwhile , the immediate danger to the American way of life comes not from terrorists but from our own adamant refusal to live within our means .
American profligacy , not Islamic radicals , triggered the mortgage crisis that underlies our current economic distress .
Bluntly , the Long War has proved to be a monumental flop .
Yet Gates , channeling Rumsfeld , would have us believe that perpetual war constitutes the sole option available to the world ’s most powerful nation .
This represents a profound failure of imagination .
It also misreads our own history .
The truth is that the United States , with rare exceptions , has demonstrated little talent for changing the way others live .
We have enjoyed far greater success in making necessary adjustments to our own way of life , preserving and renewing what we value most .
Early in the 20th century , Progressives rounded off the rough edges of the Industrial Revolution , deflecting looming threats to social harmony .
During the Depression , FDR ’s New Deal reformed capitalism and thereby saved it .
Here lies the real genius of American politics .

Rumsfeld got it exactly backward .
Although we do face a choice , it ’s not the one that he described .
The actual choice is this one :
We can either persist in our efforts to change the way they live -- in which case the war of no exits will surely lead to bankruptcy and exhaustion .
Or we can recognize the folly of generational war and choose instead to put our own house in order : curbing our appetites , paying our bills and ending our self - destructive dependency on foreign oil and foreign credit .
Salvation does not lie abroad .
It ’s here at home .
Is there more than meets the eye in the sudden flurry of talk about a world food crisis , asks Eric Walberg
Food protests and riots have swept more than 20 countries in the past few months , including Egypt .
On 2 April , World Bank President Robert Zoellick told a meeting in Washington that there are 33 countries where price hikes could cause widespread social unrest .
The UN World Food Program called the crisis the silent tsunami , with wheat prices almost doubling in the past year alone , and stocks falling to the lowest level since the perilous post - WWII days .
One billion people live on less than $ 1 a day .
Some 850 million are starving .
Meanwhile , world food production increased a mere 1 per cent in 2006 , and with increasing amounts of output going to biofuels , per capita consumption is declining .
The most commonly stated reasons include rising fuel costs , global warming , deterioration of soils , and increased demand in China and India .
So is it all just a case of hard luck and poor planning ?
There is just too much of a pattern , and too many elements all pointing in the same direction .
Anyone following the news will have heard of the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) which first met in 1921 and the group that represents the inner circle within the inner circle , the Bilderberg Club , which first met in 1954 .
The latter , once a highly secretive organization bringing together select world political and business leaders , was exposed to the media spotlight in 1990s and since then has had to endure increasing criticism for its , to say the least , undemocratic role in shaping political leaders ' thinking and actions in accordance with the desires of the world business elite .
The U.S. has never been shy about flaunting world opinion .
A case in point is its sole “ nay ” to multiple UN General Assembly and conference resolutions which declare that “ health care and proper nourishment are human rights ” .
The resolution was approved by a vote of 135 - 1 in 1981 under president Ronald Reagan , and at UN - sponsored food summits by similar margins in 1996 under president Bill Clinton and in 2002 under President Bush , dismissing any “ right to food ” .
Whether Republican or Democrat , Washington instead champions free trade as the key to ending the poverty which it argues is at the root of hunger , and expresses fears that recognition of a right to food could lead to lawsuits from poor nations seeking aid and special trade provisions .
And these are only resolutions by a powerless body which is in any case virtually subservient to the U.S.
We can see at this very moment how this international humanitarian body is not above using starvation of innocent Gazans as a political tool in the interests of the status quo .
Despite loud protestations to the contrary , there is little real international will opposing a future where millions die of starvation while a world elite consolidate their power .
Trying to come to grips with the world food crisis , it 's hard not to subscribe to some version of a conspiracy theory -- that somehow , for some reason , this rush towards widespread world famine is actually a plan by a world clique intent on drastically reducing the world population , accelerating the collapse of national governments , allowing gigantic world corporations effectively to take their place , controlling vast areas of land , leading towards a world governed by these corporations .
Especially with the U.S. so clear in its assumption that indeed widespread famine is in the cards , for which it does not want to be held responsible .
Forget about global warming ( which is of course very real and harmful to food production ) .
Here are a few more red flags .
First , the WB and IMF , set up largely by the U.S. following WWII , are notorious for refusing to advance loans to poor countries unless they agree to Structural Adjustment Programs that require the loan recipients to devalue their currencies , cut taxes , privatize utilities and reduce or eliminate support programs for farmers .
The results are a weakened state , impoverished local farmers and increased economic domination by international corporations .
Combined with this is constant pressure on poor countries to lower tariffs , preventing them from building up their industrial potential , often destituting their farmers who cannot compete with heavily subsidized produce from rich nations .
Second , rich country subsidies , in Canada , for example , allow the federal government to pay farmers $ 225 for each pig killed in an ongoing mass cull of breeding swine , as part of a plan to reduce hog production .
Some of the slaughtered hogs may be given to local Food Banks , but most will be destroyed or made into pet food .
None will go to , say , Haiti .
Third , biofuel programs are now channeling massive quantities of cereal and other crops to produce fuel for the world 's wealthy to run their second and third family cars while close to a billion starve .
Add in GMO products , which are now being forced on poor countries ( and not only ) by large multinationals , protected by copyright laws , effectively enslaving farmers in perpetuity , not to mention their likely dire effects on loss of crop variety .
Last but not least , the current U.S. - sponsored wars in the Middle East , with the resultant sky - rocketing oil prices , are merely accelerating a descent into the abyss , as it and its conjunct , NATO , continue to expand beyond all responsible limits and venture into Asia , threatening more and more recalcitrant countries with loss of sovereignty , subversion and outright invasion .
But you do n't have to believe in a “ Made it Happen On Purpose ” ( MHOP ) conspiracy for either 9/11 or the food crisis .
As political analyst William Blum , famously cited by Osama Bin Laden on one of his video missives , writes , “ we 're speaking of men making decisions , based not on people 's needs but on pseudo - scientific , amoral mechanisms like supply and demand , commodity exchanges , grain futures , selling short , selling long , and other forms of speculation , all fed and multiplied by the proverbial herd mentality -- a system governed by only two things : fear and greed ; not a rational way to feed a world of human beings . ”
Blum subscribes to a “ Let it Happen On Purpose ” ( LHOP ) explanation concerning 9/11 , that whatever conspiracy there is , is loose and unorganized , that a big dose of incompetence mixed with justified anger by the oppressed is producing an explosive concoction , but that it is still possible that leaders will wake up and address the issues sensibly .
This is a much more comforting worldview , but one that looks thinner and thinner as the whirlwind gathers momentum .
While Blum dismisses speculation about the food crisis as conspiracy , the links between the current world upheavals starting with 9/11 are there for all to see , and less and less seems to separate MHOP from LHOP as time marches on .
In fact there has been a food crisis ever since imperialism really got underway three centuries ago .
Perhaps the most extensive famines in history were presided over by Britain in India in the 18 - 20th centuries .
It has merely metamorphosed over time , just as has the “ one world ” movement that imperialism itself launched .
Back then , it was more obvious : burn , rape , dispossess , enslave , create monopolies for trade and production ( plantations ) , talk about “ darkest Africa ” .
Now it is the WTO , WB , IMF , emergency loans , privatization , GMO crops , just possibly , the gathering “ food crisis ” .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez perhaps said it best : “ It is a massacre of the world 's poor .
The problem is not the production of food .
It is the economic , social and political model of the world .
The capitalist model is in crisis . ”
Then what is really going on ?
First of all , let 's get rid of the idea that we are seeing “ impersonal market forces ” at work .
Supply and demand is not a law , it 's a policy , one that clearly cannot solve the problem .
Second , let 's ask the question which any competent investigator should pose when starting out on the trail of a possible crime : “ Who benefits ? ”
Indeed we can even describe the crime as genocide if the events in question are avoidable or planned .
Those who benefit are obviously the ones who finance agricultural operations , those who are charging monopoly prices for the commodities in demand , the various middlemen who bring the products to market , and the owners of the land and other assets used in the production / consumption cycle .
In other words , it 's the financial elite of the world who have gained control of the most basic necessity of life , guided by a long - term strategy by international finance to starve much of the world 's population in order to seize their land and control their natural resources .
In Superclass : The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making ( 2008 ) , David Rothkopf , currently at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , former deputy undersecretary of commerce for international trade under Clinton and managing director of Kissinger and Associates , brazenly outlines the real situation .
As a consummate insider , he is clearly someone who should know .
He argues that a global elite now run the planet and have usurped the power of national governments while ensuring laws constrained by borders are all but obsolete .
“ Each one of them is one in a million .
They number six thousand on a planet of six billion .
They run our governments , our largest corporations , the powerhouses of international finance , the media , world religions , and , from the shadows , the world 's most dangerous criminal and terrorist organizations .
They are the global superclass , and they are shaping the history of our time , ” states the promo for the book .
This elite “ see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite 's global operations .
Their connections to each other have become more significant than their ties to their home nations and governments .
” But why would an insider give the plot away to us plebes , you may well ask .
For one thing , the exposure of the conspirators in the world media -- yes , the Internet and satellite communications work both ways - has meant that there is a pressing need for some soothing PR , showing us that whatever conspiracy there is is benign , for our own good , necessary , if you will .
That 's the only explanation for such a startlingly frank insider 's account as Superclass provides .
Secondly , it seems the time is ripe to move forward on this plan to drastically reduce world population , and increase control of the Earth 's land and resources for a world elite in perpetuity .
One - world government , super imperialism , call it what you will .
The expansion of the U.S. military empire abroad , the Trojan Horse of the conspiracy , comes with the creation of a totalitarian system of surveillance at home and abroad , put into place as part of the “ War on Terror ” .
Human microchip implants for tracking purposes are starting to be used .
The military - industrial complex has become the U.S. 's largest and most successful industry , intent on destroying both foreign and domestic “ enemies ” .
The pieces are now in place for world domination .
The 20th century -- any conspiracy really can only be clearly argued starting from the Great War - to - end - all - war -- surely was the U.S. century , meaning it was able to impose its ideology of markets , consumerism and individualism even to the far reaches of Communist Russia and China , and hence ensure that the global elite it set in motion will subscribe in some form to its agenda - if indeed there is one .
This situation is in fact a perverse form of Kant 's recipe for world peace : countries must be willing to cede sovereignty to prevent war .
His idealistic proposal floundered on the unwillingness of countries to cede meaningful autonomy to a world body , as the experience of the League of Nations and the UN have shown in spades .
However , once the U.S. succeeded in amassing overwhelming economic might in the world and in splitting up the SU , it proceeded to use NATO as just such a world body , successfully tempting the resultant statelets to join it .
The plan was for Russia to be coaxed into the fold as well , though this part of the plan has , as it turns out , hit a snag .
What about foreign aid ?
Yes , Bush just proposed spending an additional $ 770 million , bringing next year 's budget of food assistance to $ 2.6 billion .
But since this is tied aid , forcing countries to import subsidized U.S. produce , less than half the amount actually reaches the starving peasants , and combined with WB / IMF structural adjustment policies such aid really does more to compound the problem than provide any real long - term change for the better .
For skeptics about the possibility of some form of LHOP / MHOP , just consider the following : if indeed 6,000 elite business leaders control the world 's fate , surely such an immensely wealthy and powerful coterie could solve the food crisis in a flash .
The massive expenditures on arms and the wanton destruction they cause every second , could , if stopped , provide the will and resources to restructure the world to end starvation , let alone poverty , leaving lots left over for the elite to wallow in .
There is no organized force of any consequence opposing this world elite .
What 's stopping it ?

A historic village in Dorset is to rename a cul - de- sac after being overrun with lorry drivers finding themselves stranded among the thatched cottages and chestnut - tree - lined lanes , courtesy of their satellite navigation systems .
Residents in Holdenhurst , population approximately 100 , have tired of the daily arrival of confused drivers looking for Holdenhurst Road , Bournemouth .
After a community consultation , Bournemouth borough council has decided to rename Holdenhurst Road as Holdenhurst Village Road to avert the confusion and stem unwanted visitors .
However , the residents of Holdenhurst do not expect it to have an impact for some years to come .
" Eventually , lorries will stop coming here , " said one .
" It seems people are switching off their brains , not looking at road signs and just looking at their satnavs , which are leading them up the garden path . "
I personally am of the opinion that if the tax holiday is passed , there will be no savings that amount to anything .
If oil companies are taxed further , they will simply pass that cost on to us , the consumers .
They 've passed every other cost to us , so it is unclear why this would be any different .
Thus nothing changes and at the end of the summer , we 're back where we started , probably worst .
Oil has n't dropped in price once since the beginning of the year , there is little to suggest it would drop in the ensuing period that the tax holiday will occur in .
Let us not pretend that such a miniscule , temporary concession will help us in the face of rising costs in all aspects of our lives .
HAVANA , Cuba ( CNN ) -- Cuba 's National Assembly convened Sunday to choose a head of state -- and for the first time since the 1950s , it wo n't be longtime leader Fidel Castro .
However , Sunday 's election will likely hold no surprises .
Raul Castro , 76 , Fidel Castro 's younger brother , is expected to be named as the country 's president .
The 614 members of the Cuban parliament are expected also to choose the country 's vice president , assembly secretary and 31 members of the Council of State , which acts on the assembly 's behalf when parliament is not in session .
Castro , 81 , announced his resignation as president earlier this week , citing in a letter published on the online version of the newspaper Granma his " critical health condition . "
" It would be a betrayal to my conscience to accept a responsibility requiring more mobility and dedication than I am physically able to offer , " the letter said .
If chosen as Cuba 's president , Raul Castro 's role will not be a new one .
The former defense minister became Cuba 's acting president in 2006 , when Fidel Castro underwent intestinal surgery and transferred most of his powers to his brother .
" Is there going to be a transition here toward something ? " Raul Castro once said to reporters asking about a post - Fidel Cuba .
" Yes , toward a better form of socialism and -- here 's something you 'll like -- toward a more democratic society . "
As the architect of the Cuban army and its leader for 50 years , Raul Castro has the military firmly behind him .
But as Cuba 's acting president , he has kept a fairly low profile .
Raul Castro helped his brother plan the 1950s uprising that brought about the Cuban revolution , put Fidel Castro in power and gave birth to the first communist nation in the Western Hemisphere .
The elder Castro , in his first communication since announcing his retirement , lashed out in a Friday newspaper column at President Bush , saying Bush 's idea of change for Cuba amounts to annexation of the island nation .

This is an announcement and explanation of the nothunks Haskell package that Edsko has been developing in the context of our work on Cardano for IOHK .
It was originally published on the IOHK blog and is republished here with permission .
There is also a video by Edsko available that was presented at MuniHac 2020 .
Haskell is a lazy language .
The importance of laziness has been widely discussed elsewhere : Why Functional Programming Matters is one of the classic papers on the topic , and A History of Haskell : Being Lazy with Class discusses it at length as well .
For the purposes of this blog we will take it for granted that laziness is something we want .
But laziness comes at a cost , and one of the disadvantages is that laziness can lead to memory leaks that are sometimes difficult to find .
In this post we introduce a new library called nothunks aimed at discovering a large class of such leaks early , and helping to debug them .
This library was developed for our work on the Cardano blockchain , but we believe it will be widely applicable in other projects too .
A motivating example
Consider the tiny application below , which processes incoming characters and reports how many characters there are in total , in addition to some per-character statistics :
The Time Square Ball bringing in 2008 had more than 9,500 LED bulbs displaying 16 million colours while consuming power equivalent to about ten toasters .
This compares to 600 incandescent and halogen bulbs adorning last year 's Ball .
Easy to forget that most mobile devices used by Time Square revelers were behind IPv4 NAT's and that always on applications such as Instant Messaging , Push e-mail , VoIP or location based services tend to be electricity guzzlers .
It so happens that applications that we want always to be reachable have to keep sending periodic keepalive messages to keep the NAT state active .
Why is that so ?
The NAT has an inactivity timer whereby , if no data is sent from your mobile for a certain time interval , the public port will be assigned to another device .
You cannot blame the NAT for this inconvenience , after all , its role in live is to redistribute the same public addresses over and over ; if it detects you stopped using the connection for a little while , too bad , you lose the routable address and it goes to someone else .
And when a next burst of data communication comes , guess what ?
It does n't find you anymore .
Just think of a situation we would loose our cell phone number every time it is not in use and get a new one reassigned each time .
Luckily there 's a way around but it requires a constant stream of keepalive message sent at preset intervals , often 30 second or so .
These dummy messages give the NAT the illusion that the communication is still on and it does n't disturb your address .
Only drawback is that this happens to drain the battery and shorten standby time considerably .
Just try leaving IM off instead of on to see the difference .
How much could this possibly drain the battery ?
In their excellent study [ PDF ] , Nokia 's Haverinen , Siren and Eronen tackled the issue .
In a 3G environment , 20 second interval keepalive messages result in an average current of 34 mA and this goes down to 6.1 mA if no keepalive messages sent .
If we know consider a Lithium Ion battery which is 3.6V and remember that Volt times Ampere gives Watts , this looks like 100.44 milliwatt saved .
Imagine 3 billion 3G phones in 5 years time or so and bingo , roughly 300 megawatt of useless keepalive message .
If we assume that all 3 billion 3G phones would be in use two hours a day on average , this still leaves 275 megawatt wasted .
How many power plants does it take to generate 300 megawatt ?
How many tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to produce 300 megawatt ?
An article in EE Times Europe estimated that mobile networks consume 61 billion kwh and that this could double by 2011 .
Do cell phones in standby draw less power from the base station than if they communicate all he time ?
A higher density of phones per cell site conceivable if inactive phones in standby instead of a quasi permanent state of excitement ?
Who knows , this could maybe save some additional megawatts , this time by the operator .
And while on the power topic , all of us running major networks or content server farms take note of their electricity bills .
Jonathan Koomey of National Livermore Laboratories estimates in his study [ PDF ] that servers worldwide consumed a cool 123 billion kwh in 2005 for a total electricity bill of 7.2 billion dollar !
Did anyone recently voice the opinion that IPv6 and energy saving was just marketing hype ?
The Time Square Ball LED light bulb initiative sure must have had its detractors too .
Happy New Year !

Via Lasse ( in Norwegian ) I discovered TrackMania Nations , a free arcade racing game for Windows .
Partly as a challenge to him and myself , but mostly because it ’s been a while since I took my PC for a spin , I decide to install it on my fresh installation of Ubuntu 8.04 , AKA Hardy Heron .
Below is the procedure I followed , which worked well except for lack of proper sound effects .
Of course , before I did anything , I checked out the Wine AppDB to make sure that my work would n’t be in vain .
If you have n’t done so already , install Wine .
When it works , it ’s a brilliant way to run Windows applications on Linux .
Get it via the Applications / Add / Remove menu , System / Administration / Synaptic Package Manager or open a terminal window and type « sudo apt - get install wine «
Download the Trackmania Nation install file ( its about 500 MB ) .
I could n’t get the website to work properly with my Linux browsers , but from Lasse I got this handy torrent link ( which also is a nice example of legal torrent use , BTW ) .
Install Trackmania by double clicking on the .exe file , or open a terminal window and type « wine tmnationsforever_setup.exe » .
After installation , the files can be found in the directory / home / user/.wine/drive_c/Program Files / TmNationsForever / .
Trackmania also needs DirectX to run .
You ’ll find an excellent installation guide here .
It ’s actually easier than it looks at first sight , and well worth the hassle as so many Windows games depend on DirectX .
( BTW : the two DLL files you are asked to copy to the Wine directory , can be found in C : \WINDOWS\system32 )
If TrackMania failed to install a desktop icon , you can open the folder mentioned above and double click TmForeverLauncher.exe .
This starts the configuration utility , where you set screen resolution , sound , language etc .
Double click TmForever.exe , and follow the instructions on the screen .
With a bit of luck , you ’ll log on to the network and see something like this :
Yes , of course it works full - screen as well .
With full resolution . 🙂
Problems to resolve :
1 . The sound does n’t work on my install
2 . I ca n’t seem to get softlinks to the application to work – no desktop icon , in other words
3 . How to stop playing TracMania – it ’s horribly addictive ! 😉
A 13 - year - old kid in Virginia has backtalked to his mom for the last time .
When he was told to do his chores instead of play Xbox 360 , he went and intentionally broke the vacuum cleaner to get out of it .
What 'd his mom do ?
Well , she 's selling his Xbox and all his games on eBay .
And that was before she found out he was surfing porn sites by checking out his browser 's cookies .

We asked Beth , his mom , what happened , exactly , and here 's what she had to say about what went down .
My 13 year old managed to break the vacuum .... thinking it would release him from that duty .
He also has a list of other chores that were TYPED up for him to do Friday afternoon .... one thing on the list was done ... mind you these are simple things ... empty the trash , clean your room , etc .
Then I go thru the cookies on his computer and find out he has been checking out porn sites .
Now there is a password so he can't even get on and his my - space page has a picture of snoopy on it now .
Apparently I 'm the meanest mom in the world , were his words .
I 'm a single mom .
I can't let them walk over me or I might never get up .

Sorry kid , but we 've gotta get behind your mom on this one .
First of all , we 're guessing she bought you that Xbox , unless you 're the most enterprising 13 - year - old ever , so you can deal with keeping your room tidy .
Second of all , breaking the vacuum ?
That 's weak .
The porn sites thing , well , you should have been more careful about it if you have a mom who knows her way around a computer enough to check out your cookies .
As for the Snoopy pic on your MySpace … well , that 's pretty hilarious .
The score is now Beth - 1 , her kid - 0 .
If you want to increase that score for Beth , go ahead and pick up a slightly used Xbox 360 for $ 250 and all of his games for $ 15 each , with bitterness from a 13 - year - old coming along with them free of charge .

Mother ’s Day Proclamation – 1870
by Julia Ward Howe
Arise then …women of this day !
Arise , all women who have hearts !
Whether your baptism be of water or of tears !
Say firmly :
“ We will not have questions answered by irrelevant agencies ,
Our husbands will not come to us , reeking with carnage ,
For caresses and applause .
Our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn
All that we have been able to teach them of charity , mercy and patience .
We , the women of one country ,
Will be too tender of those of another country
To allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs . ”
From the voice of a devastated Earth a voice goes up with
Our own .
It says : “ Disarm ! Disarm !
The sword of murder is not the balance of justice . ”
Blood does not wipe our dishonor ,
Nor violence indicate possession .
As men have often forsaken the plough and the anvil
At the summons of war ,
Let women now leave all that may be left of home
For a great and earnest day of counsel .
Let them meet first , as women , to bewail and commemorate the dead .
Let them solemnly take counsel with each other as to the means
Whereby the great human family can live in peace …
Each bearing after his own time the sacred impress , not of Caesar ,
But of God –
In the name of womanhood and humanity , I earnestly ask
That a general congress of women without limit of nationality ,
May be appointed and held at someplace deemed most convenient
And the earliest period consistent with its objects ,
To promote the alliance of the different nationalities ,
The amicable settlement of international questions ,
The great and general interests of peace .
Updated Phorm has admitted that it deleted key factual parts of the Wikipedia article about the huge controversy fired by its advertising profiling deals with BT , Virgin Media and Carphone Warehouse .
The tracking and ad targeting firm said in an email : " We wanted to clarify a number of inaccuracies in the Wikipedia entry on Phorm . "
As we reported yesterday , a number of Phorm - friendly edits were made to the page on Friday .
The revisions were quickly reverted by a Wikipedian who argued that they made Phorm out to be " awesome and perfect " .
In a telephone conversation , a spokesman for Phorm refused to comment on why it had tried to censor a quotation from The Guardian 's commercial executives describing the ethical stance they took against its tracking system .
He also refused to talk about the deletion of a passage explaining how BT admitted it misled customers over the 2007 secret trial .
Phorm also deleted a link to the The Register 's report on the 2006 trial , and accompanying reference to BT 's own document .
It said that the aim of the trial was to validate that users were unaware of the presence of the tracking system .
The spokesman said Phorm's PR team had not been aware of Wikipedia 's policy on conflicts of interest .
Among many other rules they violated , it states : " Producing promotional articles for Wikipedia on behalf of clients is strictly prohibited . "
A BT representative meanwhile wrote in an email : " I do n't see anything wrong with correcting Wikipedia articles about your own company or services . "
However , the edits made by Phorm included silencing factual primary information , that has been acknowledged as correct by the parties involved . ®
Update
Following publication of this article , Phorm sent us this email :
Hi Chris
We let you know yesterday that we had proposed amendments to the Phorm entry on Wikipedia – there were several factual inaccuracies that were pointed out to us .
Having reviewed our suggested changes with hindsight , we accept that we were a little over zealous in our efforts to make those corrections and that we erroneously removed some relevant items in the editing process .
These were quickly reinstated by Wikipedia ’s editors .
We will endeavour to make sure that this does not happen in the future .

Rachel Dratch is learning it ’s not funny being an out - of - work comedian .
She left Saturday Night Live two years ago and then was replaced on 30 Rock .
What ’s she up to now ?
“ Maybe you can tell me , ” she said at a Smart People screening on March 31 .
“ I know you ’re supposed to come up with fake stuff you ’re doing .
But honestly , I ’m not doing much . ”
After SNL ’s hectic pace , is n’t downtime nice ?
“ It ’s starting to get old , ” she said .
“ I ’m starting to go crazy .
I ’m ready for a job . ”
The low point came , she said , when last month ’s Vanity Fair arrived with its cover story on women in comedy , featuring a dozen top comediennes — none of whom was Dratch .
“ Dude , that was a dark day , ” she recalled .
“ I was like , Oh , there ’s everyone I worked with . ”
She ’s not picky about her next gig .

From a group of Nottingham residents , concerned students and academics at the University of Nottingham .
For immediate use , 26/05/08 MONDAY
University of Nottingham Graduate and Employee Facing Imminent Deportation Without Hearing
Hicham Yezza , a popular and active member of the academic community at the University of Nottingham , was recently arrested along with another student .
After six days of detention , both were released without charge [ 1 ] .
Hicham was re-arrested on immigration grounds .
He now faces imminent deportation to Algeria wihtout due process [ 2 ] .
There is widespread concern at the proposed , imminent deportation .
Hicham Yezza , know to his many friends as ‘ Hich ’ , has lived , worked and studied in Nottingham for the past 13 years .
He won a scholarship to study for undergraduate and postgraduate degrees , and was later employed by the University of Nottingham [ 3 ] .
During this time , Hicham has built up a broad social network and developed strong links within the University and the local community .
Hicham is the long - time editor of Ceasefire magazine , the political journal of Nottingham Student Peace Movement [ 4 ] .
Hich ’s vision for Ceasefire is a forum for the free exchange of many views , ideas and perspectives ; to work for peace , understanding and progress through dialogue and discussion .
In the Editorial of the latest edition of Ceasefire , Hicham wrote , “ We believe in the power of ideas and we would like you , dear readers , to join us in our quest for a more sustainable , better - run world . ”
Musab Younis , a student and member of the Ceasefire Editorial team said , “ Hich is a wealth of knowledge and understanding .
His perspectives and humanity shine through in his work and all that he does .
His vision and resolve have been integral to the functioning and success of Ceasefire . ”
During his time at Nottingham , Hicham has served as a member of the Student ’s Union Executive Committee , and on the University Senate [ 5 ] .
He was President of the Arabic Society , and was the Editor of the influential Voice magazine for international students .
He was a prominent member of the music and dance group ‘ Al - Zaytouna ’ , and weeks before his arrest performed the leading role in a music and dance performance at Nottingham Arts Theatre .
Ahmed Masoud and Aliaa Naja , directors of Al - Zaytouna said , “ Hicham ’s tremendous contribution to Al Zaytouna group is in his continuous encouragement to the team to promote dancing as a way of cross cultural awareness . ”
Hicham is respected and liked by many at Nottingham and across the UK .
Ben
White , professional journalist , writer and member of the Ceasefire editorial committee , said , “ Hicham has always struck me as a man of profound humanity , humility and gentleness .
Hicham is a man committed to discussion and dialogue .
To deport him would make a mockery of the kinds of principles of fairness and justice the British government is meant to represent . ” [ 6 ]
Hicham was originally arrested for alleged possession of ‘ radical material ’ .
This was in fact a research document , widely accessible on the Internet , which Hicham had agreed to print for Rizwaan Sabir , as the MA student did not have enough printer credit to print the 1,500 page document himself .
Chloe Cheeseman , Environmental and Social Justice Officer of the Students Union Executive said , “ I am outraged that Hicham was arrested and detained , after doing a favour for a friend .
That he now faces such a hurried and unfair deportation is ridiculous . ”
Hicham was prepared to contest immigration charges in a court of law , and had a hearing date set for 16th July .
The immigration services have since announced that they intend to deport him on Sunday 1st June .
Consequently he has been denied the right to a hearing .
Hich ’s MP , Alan Simpson , has written to Liam Byrne Minister of State for Borders and Immigration to express his concerns at what he decribed as an “ arbitrary deportation with no right to a proper hearing . ”
Nick Palmer , MP for Broxtowe said , “ I hope that Mr Yezza will have his case fully and fairly considered without any rush to deport him before all the facts are clear . ”
The growing campaign to halt Hicham ’s deportation , and ensure that he gets the fair hearing to which he is entitled , is testament to his good nature and character , and indicates the high level of respect that his held for him at Nottingham and further a - field .
Supporters have been able to speak with Hicham and he expressed his gratitude for all that had been done for him : “ I thank everyone for their support – it ’s been extremely heartening and humbling .
I ’m grateful to everyone who has come to my aid and stood with me in solidarity , from students to Members of Parliament .
I think this really reflects the spirit of the generous , inclusive Britain we know – and not the faceless , brutal , draconian tactics of the Home Office . ”

Notes for Editors :
[ 1 ] Hicham ’s arrest took place on Wednesday 14th May .
Rizwaan Sabir , an MA Politics research student was also arrested .
Both were released without charge six days later .
It has subsequently become clear that these arrests , which related to so - called “ radical materials ” involved an Al Qaeda manual downloaded by Sabir from an official US Government website , as part of his dissertation research into political Islam , and emailed to Yezza for printing .
[ 2 ]
Hicham was re-arrested under immigration legislation and , due to confusion over his visa documentation , charged with offences relating to his immigration status .
He sought legal advice and representation regarding these matters whilst in custody .
On Friday 23rd May , the Home Office informed his solicitor that he was being removed on Sunday 1st June and Hicham was moved to an immigration detention centre .
[ 3 ]
Hicham is employed as PA to the Head of the School of Modern Languages and Cultures , Professor Lesley Milne .

Notre Dame ( TGW ) – Researchers at Notre Dame have created solar cells made of different sized quantum dots , each capturing a specific wavelength of light .
By arranging these dots in an ordered pattern , the researchers hope to create “ rainbow ” solar cells which efficiently harvest a large part of the visible spectrum of light .
By varying the size of the tiny semiconductor quantum dots , the researchers can tune the solar cells to absorb light of certain wavelengths .
Smaller quantum dots absorb shorter wavelengths of light , while larger quantum dots absorb longer wavelengths .
By combining different sized dots in a solar cell , the researchers can create a cell that absorbs more light and therefore is more efficient .
Two main challenges remain : the first is organizing the nano dots , and the second is the quantum dots should generate multiple charge carriers to be captured to generate photocurrent .
The dots also show promise in developing solar windows , in which the color of the window could be changed while still creating energy .

Statistics Canada confirmed last week the rich are getting richer , the poor are getting poorer , and the middle class has been treading water for a quarter - century .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
The Globe and Mail published a Second Coming headline about those findings .
Pundits chimed in .
Yet , despite all the chatter , we still seem unable to confront this fact :
The wider the income gap in a country , the worse its life expectancy .
For close to a century , public - health researchers have been tracking this strange correlation .
In countries with narrow gaps between richest and poorest , everyone lives longer .
In countries with wide gaps , people die sooner .
Every social class is healthier than the one below it , and sicker than the one above it .
National wealth and medical spending do n't seem to matter .
According to the World Health Organization , Cuba spent $ 230 per capita on health care in 2004 .
The U.S. spent $ 6,096 per capita .
But Cuba has a lower infant - mortality than the U.S. , and Cuban life expectancy , at 78.3 years , is just ahead of the Americans ' 78.2 .
So the U.S. ranks first in health spending and 38th in life expectancy .
Canada spends just half of what the Americans do ( $ 3,038 per capita ) , but we rank 11th in life expectancy at 80.3 .
What 's going on here ?
Public - health researchers are still debating the correlation between inequality and health , and whether inequality is actually a cause of disease and early death .
But most studies seem to confirm the correlation , and most researchers confidently assert that inequality really is bad for your health .
In the decade of World War I , for example , British life expectancy actually went up despite the carnage in the trenches .
During that decade , the rich paid more in taxes than they ever had before , and workers got better pay and working conditions than they had ever enjoyed before .
The famous " Whitehall survey " has tracked the health of 17,000 British civil servants since the 1960s .
In a country with a national health service , the clerks at the bottom of the pay scale have three times the mortality rate of the top mandarins , and die four times as often from heart disease .
Richard G. Wilkinson , a British epidemiologist who 's studied the correlation between income and health , cites this and many other cases in his book Unhealthy Societies : The Afflictions of Inequality .
He notes that in 1965 , Japan had a slightly lower life expectancy than Britain .
Japanese now have a life expectancy of 82 years .
What happened ?
Well , the income range between Japanese workers and top executives stayed fairly narrow .
In Britain , Maggie Thatcher encouraged the enrichment of the richest , and the gap widened .
Improvement in British life expectancy ( currently 78.7 years ) has lagged since then .
Wilkinson has also recorded some alarming U.S. data , where the gap has been widening for decades .
In 1990 , for example , Louisiana had the widest income gap of any American state .
Half the population was living on 17 per cent of the state 's total income .
At the same time , Louisiana had the highest death rates and homicide rates in the U.S .
The Canadian gap : Not so bad ?
A British Medical Journal article in 2000 compared income inequality and mortality in Canada and the U.S. , and found , surprisingly , that while the income gap correlated with U.S. death rates , it did n't correlate so closely in Canada .
The authors speculated that we effectively narrow the gap thanks to our health care system and equal provision of services like education .
Canadian researchers have looked closely at our gap .
Dennis Raphael , editor of the important book Social Determinants of Health , points out in the first chapter that income differences between Canadians are responsible for more premature years of life lost than any other cause except cancer .
We may be better off than the Americans , but not by much .
What , then , is the mechanism for this loss of life ?
Most researchers attribute it to two related causes : psychosocial stress and the loss of social capital .
Psychosocial stress does n't mean feeling sad because Bill Gates is rich and you 're not .
Wilkinson , in his 2005 book The Impact of Inequality , argues that as social animals we need to maintain a certain level of secure status and control over our lives .
We feel stress when our status is threatened and we lose control .
Cortisol , a stress hormone , plays a role in many diseases .
In egalitarian societies where the rich are n't that much richer than the poorest , everyone feels more secure .
But where the gap is wide , the poor feel threatened , and the rich both despise and fear them .
Eroding social capital
Social capital -- the level of trust between people -- also erodes as the gap widens .
In Bowling for Columbine , Michael Moore praised supposedly easygoing Canadians for leaving our front doors unlocked , and not feeling the need for a gun in the house .
But Canadians who once walked to school now tote their own kids to school in SUVs .
Wilkinson argues that stress underlies violent crime , alcoholism , and drug use .
When people can't control much about their own lives , they can at least punch someone else , or smoke , or get drunk .
Wilkinson probably goes too far in blaming stress for almost every social problem we have , but he and Raphael and a host of others have raised some very serious issues about the way we distribute wealth .
Most Canadians accept the income gap as a fact of life .
Responsible individuals , they believe , live with the consequences of their own actions .
The rich are rich because they deserve to be , and the poor can be rich too , if only they 'll get a job and work hard .
Even the poor tend to agree , and blame themselves for their own sorrows .
This is n't surprising after a couple of centuries of North American optimism .
Horatio Alger was a poor boy who got rich writing novels about poor boys who get rich .
But even Alger , in stories like Pluck and Luck , admitted that luck is as important as pluck .
If you could n't rescue a banker 's daughter , you were n't going to get far .
To argue that the gap is a health issue , therefore , makes a lot of us very defensive -- you might even say stressed .
It sounds like income redistribution , taking money away from the deserving rich and giving it to the feckless poor .
Some narrow - gap countries do tax the rich , but it does n't go to the poor in one - time cheques .
In fact , countries like Iceland and Japan do n't seem to have many really poor people .
That 's because taxes support a solid infrastructure of housing , education and health care .
The rich robbing the poor
The problem is not the poor robbing the rich through taxes , but the rich robbing the poor through tax cuts that wreck the infrastructure .
And the rich have to the chutzpah to tell us that this robbery is the way to prosperity for all .
Governments excuse themselves from delivering social services because they do n't have the tax revenues any more .
So private education and health care begin to look good to the affluent , while public education and health care , like public housing and transit , become down - market services for losers .
Because so many people still believe in Horatio Alger , the income - gap debate has stayed away from the health issue .
Even the NDP and the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives define the problem as one of fairness -- as if poverty were simply a needless inconvenience to the poor .
If the Raphaels and Wilkinsons are right , however , the growing income gap in Canada -- as in the U.S. , Britain , Russia , and China -- is literally a matter of life and death .
The poor are dying early to subsidize the rich , who are too stupid to realize they 're dying early too .
Dennis Raphael quotes the 19th - century Prussian physician Rudolf Virchow , who 150 years ago argued that " Medicine is a social science , and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale . "
Virchow was wrong about some things , but he was dead right about that .

Why Tax Cuts Make Us Weak
Taxes are the price of a civilized society .
Support them .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said the number of UK troops in Iraq will fall from the current level of 5,500 to 2,500 by next spring .
Brown had said while in Iraq last week that Britain planned to cut its deployment by 1,000 by Christmas .
Speaking in the House of Commons , Brown said Britain plans to move from leading Iraqi troops into an " overwatch " role in the next two months and then reduce the numbers from 5,500 to 4,500 " immediately after provincial Iraqi control , and then to 4,000 . "
He said that " in the second stage of overwatch in the spring , and guided as always by advice of military commanders " the reduction will be to 2,500 troops -- " with a further decision about the next phase made then . "
" In both stages of ' overwatch ' around 500 logistics and support personnel will be based outside Iraq elsewhere in the region , " Brown said .
British troops have been based in Basra , in the southeast region .
Brown said the recent base handover in Basra city in early September is a good sign of things to come since the " present security situation has been calmer . "
" Indeed in the last month there have been five indirect fire attacks on Basra Air Station compared with 87 in July .
And while the four southern provinces have around 20 percent of the Iraqi people they still account for less than 5 percent of the overall violence in Iraq .
Brown also announced a new policy helping its local Iraqi staffers .
" Existing staff who have been employed by us for more than 12 months and have completed their work will be able to apply for a package of financial payments to aid resettlement in Iraq or elsewhere in the region , or -- in agreed circumstances -- for admission to the UK .
" And professional staff --- including interpreters and translators --- with a similar length of service who have left our employ since the beginning of 2005 will also be able to apply for assistance . "
Brown earlier Monday insisted the move to cut the number of British troops in Iraq was not an " admission of defeat " and that they were in fact winning the security battle in southern Iraq .
CNN 's European Political Editor Robin Oakley noted the controversy over the way Brown announced a troop cut in Basra last week during the opposition Conservative Party conference .
Opposition leader David Cameron accused the PM of playing politics with troops ' lives and said 500 of the troops had previously been announced as coming home .
" This is not double counting of Government spending , this is not just spinning the good bits of a Budget , this is about dealing with people 's lives and the families of our brave servicemen , " Cameron added .
It remains uncertain what role the UK troops will play in Iraq , Oakley said , as troop levels are reduced and Cameron pressed Brown to be more specific .
Cameron also called for an independent inquiry into the war and asked that Parliament should be provided with progress reports on Iraq and Afghanistan at least every three months .
CNN 's Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson , in Basra , confirmed Monday that British troops there had told him violence had gone down significantly since they left the center of Basra in recent weeks to the city 's airport .
Before then 90 percent of violence was focused on them .
" That 's allowing British troops to get involved more in building up Iraqi security forces , as Brown outlined in parliament , but they still can intervene if called upon . "
Do n't Miss Election frenzy : Brown takes blame
Election frenzy : Brown takes blame Brown criticized for vote retreat
Brown criticized for vote retreat Vote rumors as Brown unveils plan
Earlier Monday the PM took questions from reporters on the election frenzy that built up before his weekend announcement that there would be no mid-term poll .
" I will not put blame on anybody else , " he told reporters on Monday at a news briefing .
" Anything that happens in Downing Street is the direct responsibility of me and I will always take that full responsibility myself . "
Brown said he considered holding a snap election but said he wanted " more time to set out my vision for the future of the country . "
The PM said his " first instinct " was always that he needed more time to show voters how he was governing the country before going to the polls .
Following his announcement on Saturday that he would not go to the country this year , Cameron attacked Brown 's decision as a poor choice following weeks of " dithering . "
" We have not seen courage at all .
We have seen weakness and indecision , " he said .
Building on the no-nonsense reputation he established as Blair 's finance minister , Brown has enjoyed early praise for his handling of a major terror attack , an animal disease outbreak , disastrous floods and a banking crisis .
But data from one of the UK's main polling organizations indicated Brown could lose the majority his party currently enjoys in parliament if an election were held in November .

Racism in Germany Family Escapes Small Town Xenophobia
Insulted , spat at and attacked -- by ordinary Germans .
Unable to bear the daily racism , a pastor 's family fled from a small town in eastern Germany back to the their former home in the west .
This is a basic backgrounder for Americans , primarily , who might think Europeans do nothing all day but bitch about Americans .
Do n’t get me wrong — they do love bitching about Americans .
But they also like bitching about each other , as well .
Bordering countries , especially , have complex caricatures of each other , even when an outsider might think they ’re more or less the same .
The following is based on my numerous interactions with Europeans , having lived there for 4 years .
Here ’s a run down :
The French — Disliked by some Spanish ( particularly the Catalonians ) , for being arrogant .
One woman from Barcelona told me , “ Come on , who really likes the French ?
Nobody ! ” The Swiss do n’t like the fact that they have contempt for authority and are lazy .
The Brits , of course , have the most mixed feelings about the French , though .
One half the country hates them , the other half loves them .
Those that hate the French tend to like the Americans , and vice versa .
In the UK , they ’re considered stinky , rude ( they never line / queue up like decent people ) , and a bit yellow , based on their tendency to not fend off invaders like the Nazis .
The French , in turn , dislike the British , look down on Belgians for being stupid , and do n’t have much to say , in my experience , about Spaniards or Germans ( oddly ) .
The Italians —
Most of the stereotypes are positive , but mostly because of the food .
Northern Europeans consider them lazy and flaky , and maybe incapable of managing anything right ( mostly because of the 50 + governments they ’ve had since WW2 ) .
One Dutch professor I had dismissed another Italian one , saying , “ All the Italians care about are pasta and mamma .
” Italians , in turn , do n’t have strong feelings about other Europeans , but within Italy , the north - south divide is pretty strong .
Northern Italians continuously complain that Southerners are lazy and unproductive , while Southerners complain that Northerners are devoid of culture or joie de vivre .
The Germans — Germans are considered industrious but uptight and humorless , by just about all the other Europeans .
They know WW2 is a sore spot for them , so other Europeans will often mercilessly tease them about it .
As much as Germany is considered an economic powerhouse , the vast majority of Europeans do n’t really want to learn German or study there ( or send their kids there to study ) .
The food is considered uninspired , too , and only Berlin has some cachet among younger Europeans for its vibrant underground club scene .
The most anti-German sentiments are among the Dutch and Danish , who just hate them from invading their countries too often .
When German ask for directions in Holland , they ’re usually given directions to the shortest way out of the country , or told “ Give us back our bikes ! ” , a reference to the fact that Germans confiscated Dutch bicycles during WW2 .
Danes hate it when you pronounce their capital as “ ko - pen - HAH - gen ” , because this is the German pronunciation .
Either pronounce it the English way ( with “ HAY ” instead ) , or the Danish way , which is literally impossible to put down here .
Germans tend to like their Western neighbors far more than they are liked by them , but they look down on their Eastern neighbors , particularly Poles .
They , oddly , have some mixed respect for the Czechs , who have resisted German aggression .
The Scandinavians —
Widely respected by most other Europeans , because of their high standard of living … and blond hair and blue eyes .
However , within Scandinavia there are some persistent stereotypes .
The Norwegians , Danes and Finns all think the Swedes are stupid and uptight .
Norwegians are considered racist .
Danes are considered more blunt than the others , maybe a bit more cranky , and the Finns are oddly introverted , even by Scandinavian standards .
Except for the Danes really disliking Germans , and Finns really disliking Russians , they do n’t really have anything against other Europeans .
The Belgians — Considered idiots by both the Dutch and the French .
Belgians , in turn , consider the Dutch to be a bunch of cranky assholes , and French stuck - up .
The Dutch —
The Dutch , like the Scandinavians , have an enviable economy and social order that ’s admired by southern European countries .
However , they do have a reputation of being self - righteous “ know - it- alls ” and very similar to their German cousins in terms of their rigidity .
But they do not like any comparisons to Germans , and if you remind them that the Dutch national anthem makes a reference to the Dutch being “ van Duitse bloed ” ( from German blood ) , you might quickly get the silent treatment .
The Dutch are also disliked for being the biggest misers in Europe , and because of this they incur the wrath of the tourist industry wherever they travel .
The Dutch have been known to stock up on water before they take their campers down to the south of France .
The Dutch , in turn , kind of look down on just about everyone .
Yes , there ’s a bit of a reason for the “ know - it - all ” smart - ass reputation they have .
The Swiss — Considered extremely rigid , even by the Germans .
Blunt to the point of being rude , the Swiss probably have the least likely reputation for being characterized as “ friendly ” or “ warm ” .
Note that there is a big cultural divide between French - speaking Swiss , and the German - speaking Swiss .
The former are almost exactly like the French , except having a blander cuisine and more respect for authority , the latter being more like the Germans except even more stiff , rigid and cranky .
However , everyone knows Switzerland “ works ” so the fact that foreigners comprise 20 % of the population ( mostly from EU member states ) should make this clear .
Note that the German - speaking Swiss also speak their own variant of German , which sounds very strange if you ’ve only been exposed to standard “ hoch - Deutsch ” .
The Spaniards — Honestly , very little antagonism against the Spanish or by the Spanish .
No one really seems to dislike them , and they do n’t seem to really dislike anyone else .
( Yes , some Spaniards near the border to France do n’t like the French very much )
Not entirely sure why .
However , God forbid you speak Spanish with a Latin American accent — there is still a lot of snobbery among Spaniards towards Latin Americans .
Spaniards consider themselves white and European , and would be deeply insulted if you suggested they were Latin American of any kind .
The Greeks —
Only nominally considered European by other Europeans , but the Greeks fiercely identify as European .
Naturally , this is a huge irritant to Greeks .
The Poles —
Not much seems to register about Poland and the Poles except that they ’re quiet .
They are a relatively big country ( 40 million people ) so the supposed scare of being overrun by Eastern Europeans when a bunch of Eastern European countries joined the EU in 2005 focused in on the Poles .
The Germans really do n’t like Poles , and among Germany ’s 9 neighbors , are disliked the most .
Poland is considered a country of car thieves by the Germans .
Really , the relationship between Germany and Poland is similar to that of the United States and Mexico , and often for many of the same reasons ( differences in income , history of war , different languages , etc . ) .
Poles really shore up their hatred for their eastern & southern neighbors , primarily Russia and Ukraine , although they do n’t like Czechs , Slovaks or Lithuanians either .
Oddly , they do n’t really mind the Germans , and probably still fear them a bit — you never , ever hear jokes about Germans in Poland .
The Czechs — Considered a relatively bright spot of Eastern Europe by Western Europeans , but I think primarily because Prague is such a gorgeous city and a popular tourist destination .
Czechs are a bit like Germans , though — a bit rude , blunt , and cold .
Poles do n’t have much good to say about them .
The Austrians — Considered a mix of the best & worst aspects of Germany and the Balkans , Austrians are considered laid - back but very nationalistic and racist .
They ’re said to be the birthplace of Hitler , but never came around to being fully apologetic about the Holocaust ( unlike Germany ) .
Neutral feelings from most of Western Europe , negative feelings from Germans ( who consider them backwards , and not always the representing the best image of German - speaking people ) and admired by Eastern Europeans ( a throwback to the Hapsburgs ) .
The British – About half of the British would be really angry at being called European , so that should provide an apt starting point .
The main beef with the Brits is that they ’re considered the lapdog of the U.S. , and are anti-European because the U.S. tells them to be so .
They are considered polite , but maybe a bit two - faced ( hence “ Janus Britain ” ) and snobby .
The Scots and Welsh are tolerated and liked , inasmuch as that no one really knows too much about them outside the UK , but the English are those that bear the brunt of negative sentiments among other Europeans .
After all , London is in England .
The English also have a poor reputation in tourist traps , such as Amsterdam and Ibiza , for being loud - mouthed , obnoxious drunks .
The English , in turn , really seem to hate everyone .
This is because it ’s pretty hard to find an Englishman that has even , at best , neutral opinions about other Europeans ( or Americans , or other nationalities ) .
Europe is full of English expats , and the longer they live abroad , the more they seem to hate their host country .
And yet they never seem to want to move home .
The Irish — A very small country , despite its exaggerated importance in Americans ’ minds ( just over 4.6 million in the Republic of Ireland ) but considered polite and humble .
They nominally dislike the English , but I have yet to meet an Irishman who really loathes the English .
The sentiments towards the Irish and by the Irish seem to be positive , overall .
I personally do n’t know much about how the Portuguese , Hungarians , Romanians , Bulgarians , and others are perceived , or how they perceive others , but if you have something to add , please do so in the comments below .
I ’ll leave you with this poster I saw in an Italian office years ago , that helps sum it up in some ways :

North America ( TGW ) – U.S. and Canadian researchers have developed a device that effortlessly harvests energy from human movement .
The gadget is a knee brace with special technology , and can power a cellphone for up to 30 minutes from just one minute of walking .
The device generates power from a process known as “ generative - breaking ” , much like the process used in Toyota Prius hybrids .
" Walking is a lot like stop - and - go driving , " explained Dr Max Donelan of Simon Fraser University .
" Within each stride muscles are continuously accelerating and decelerating the body .
Using a series of gears , the knee brace assists the hamstring in slowing the body just before the foot hits the ground , whilst simultaneously generating electricity .
Sensors on the device switch the generator off for the remainder of each step , reducing strain on the individual .
The researchers see potential benefit in not only energy production , but in prosthetic limb use .

The FARC Computer German Left Wing May Have Ties to Colombian Extremists
According to data found on a laptop confiscated by Colombian authorities , the terrorist group FARC may have had ties to left - wing politicians in Germany .
E-mails found on the computer , confiscated after the recent killing of FARC commander Reyes , show that his son visited Berlin .
T hey 're washable .
They 're non -toxic .
So why can't they make them square ?
I 'm talking about children 's markers .
If you 're a parent , you know that when your kids are drawing or colouring , half your time is spent picking up markers and their caps after they 've rolled off the table .
Hence the need for roll - proof markers with square caps and shafts .
My point ?
There 's always room for improvement in the way we do things and in the products we use .
Below are three eye - catching " clean - tech " innovations that are aiming for the same goal .
• Bionic power :
When some people exercise , they often say it gives them more energy .
A Burnaby , B.C. - based start - up called Bionic Power Inc. is making sure it does .
The company , a spinoff from Simon Fraser University , has developed a knee brace that generates electricity when a person walks or runs .
Obviously , this is n't the kind of " bionic " one might associate with Steve Austin and the Six Million Dollar Man .
It does n't give a person superhuman strength .
Rather , the brace harvests kinetic energy that is normally wasted when a person moves .
In fact , it 's not the moving as much as the stopping .
It captures the energy needed to slow down the knee joint at the tail end of a step , kind of like regenerative braking used to recharge the battery in hybrid-electric cars .
Company researchers say the device can so far capture enough energy to power several cellphones .
If you 're someone who exercises with an iPod , it 's easy to imagine eventually having a portable music player that is powered by , well , running .
Military applications are obvious , since soldiers in the field tend to carry a lot of electronics that need power .
Assuming the existence of lightweight , low - cost , high - capacity batteries for storing electricity , one can envision collecting enough energy in a day to power wearable , strength - boosting gear .
Maybe then we 'll see a true bionic man or woman or Bigfoot – though I 'm sure the price tag will be more than $ 6 million .
• Magic paper :
It was n't supposed to happen this way , but in an age of digital everything , the reality is that we use more paper than ever in our " paperless " society .
We like to print documents out , often several pages at a time even if we only need one page or paragraph .
Think Google Maps – do we really need to keep directions after reaching our destination ?
Many times what we print gets tossed into the recycling bin the same day .
Xerox 's Palo Alto Research Center ( PARC ) has developed a new kind of reusable paper that , after being printed on with special light - sensitive chemicals , will fade back to its original state after 24 hours .
The paper can then be reprinted on , potentially hundreds of times over , as long as a special printer is used .
PARC researchers say you do n't even have to wait for text or images to fade .
They are erased automatically when run through the printer .
A good comparison is rewritable CDs and DVDs – it makes sense to pay a little more if you plan on storing information for short periods of time .
Likewise , if you need to print something out only to use it briefly , it might make sense for some workplaces to have special printing areas set up for reusable paper .
It will save trees , and is much more energy efficient than recycling .
• Sunshine online :
We 've seen interactive websites that allow us to show how certain paint colours or furniture might look in our homes .
There are also sites that let us upload pictures of ourselves so we can try on virtual clothes and experiment with new hairstyles .
Now there 's a website , launched by a Berkeley , Calif . - based company called Sungevity Inc. , which does the same for homeowners interested in solar technology .
All you have to do is enter your address on Sungevity 's website .
A few hours later , the company emails back a detailed quote that outlines several options .
There 's no need to send crews to your home to climb the roof and take measurements .
Instead , Sungevity uses satellite imaging and special software to analyze the size , shape and slope of your roof .
It knows if you have a south - facing slope .
It knows how well the sun shines where you live .
The company then takes this data and suggests designs that combine lowest cost and best performance , based on the profile of your home .
The goal is to make solar technology more accessible to the masses .
Actor Cate Blanchett is one of several angel investors in Sungevity , which was founded by a former Greenpeace manager .

Unfortunately , it 's only available at the moment for people living in areas in California , but it 's just a matter of time before it – or something like it – hits a solar hot spot like Ontario .

When I heard that high schools were closing and teenagers were dying because of the MRSA superbug , I felt lucky .
Since the middle of 2006 , I 've had methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus six times and somehow managed to avoid the worst : I 've never been hospitalized and do n't fear for my life .
But , please , take my advice and do everything you can to avoid this dangerous infection .
Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , known as MRSA or the staph " superbug , " can be fatal .
My first episode was in July 2006 .
I live in Boston and was going to visit a friend on Nantucket .
I leaned back in my seat on the plane and felt a dull pain , like someone was pressing really hard on my buttock .
When I arrived I asked my friend to take a look .
That sounds embarrassing , but I could n't see the problem myself .
She said it was just a pimple but really red .
By the third day the irritated area was more than three inches wide and burning sharply .
I was nervous , so I left the island early and went to my doctor .
He gave me an antibiotic called Keflex for a skin infection , but the pimple just got bigger , hotter , harder , and redder .
Sitting was almost impossible .
And soon it was n't just my buttock that ached .
I had developed a second spot -- on my labia !
Health.com :
What are my real risks for MRSA ?
What is it ?
I still did n't know I had MRSA .
Truth is , I hardly knew anything about MRSA .
But I was n't getting better , so while I was at my weekend house in Connecticut , I decided to go to the emergency room .
The doctors there gave me a local anesthetic , then cut open and cleaned out the spot on my buttock .
The abscess underneath was big enough that they had to pack it with absorbent material to soak up pus .
When they cultured the infection , I finally learned it was MRSA .
The doctors changed my antibiotic to Augmentin , because the first one would n't work against the resistant bug .
But they did n't want to touch the spot on my labia .
I 'd have to go to a gynecologist for that .
When I returned to Boston , I went back to my doctor 's office to get the packing changed , but the doc would n't do it because they did n't have the necessary surgical tools .
I had to go to the emergency room .
I went over to the ER in the same hospital complex ; they agreed to change the packing , but did n't want to touch the spot on my labia .
Again they said I needed a gyno .
Argh !
Five doc - tor 's visits for this one infection , and the thing was getting worse .
I was losing it .
Health.com : Do n't worry so much about scary diseases
I walked into the medical building next door and found an OB - GYN 's office .
They agreed to take a look .
The doctor pinpricked the swollen area , got a little pus out , and sent it to be cultured .
It was MRSA .
Again .
Both spots healed up , and for three weeks I was fine .
But then two months later , in September , it happened again : hot , red spots on my perineum and labia .
I was really frustrated .
I could n't believe it had come back .
Before long I was back at the ER for another draining and culture .
More MRSA .
More antibiotics , this time something called Bactrim .
Health.com :
How not to catch MRSA
Is it my fault ?
Eventually , I saw an infectious - disease specialist , who did all kinds of tests ( including diabetes and HIV ) to figure out whether I had a condition that would make me vulnerable .
Everything came up negative .
I was n't surprised .
I used to be a professional dancer , and I 've always been very healthy .
The tests , though , made me feel even more nervous and unsure of myself .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : MRSA
The specialist could n't explain why the outbreaks kept coming back , but the fact that they popped up where I sweat was a clue .
I work out at the gym three times a week and also run .
I 'd come straight from the gym and start working in the garden , changing clothes first but waiting until I was back inside to shower .
Bad idea .
The specialist told me to shower and change clothes right away so that bacteria would n't have a chance to breed , and to wash my workout clothes every day .
She also had me try " decolonization " -- a real hassle .
For five days , I showered with an antibacterial soap called Hibiclens ( my husband , too ) , and for two weeks I put an ointment called Bactroban up my nose ( because staph can live there ) and on my perineum .
I also washed all our sheets and towels every day , in hot water with bleach .
Later , I saw a dermatologist who recommended I switch from spandex to loose cotton just in case the tight outfits were rubbing against my skin and leaving tiny abrasions .
Health.com :
What a MRSA infection looks like
What more can I do ?
I wish I could say that was enough to solve the problem .
But last winter the infection came back -- again !
-- this time under my arm and on my breast .
My belly was next , in June , and again in September .
Most of these spots , like the others , needed to be drained , packed , and treated with Bactrim .
Had I done something wrong ?
My friends kept telling me to change doctors , but the docs say the same things : " We 're seeing this a lot , and we do n't know why it 's back . "
Truth is , I feel I was doing everything right .
I 'm obsessive now about following the specialists ' advice .
I 'm moisturizing in hopes of avoiding cracks in my skin that might be a breeding ground .
I wash my hands all the time .
I use my wrists and the backs of my hands to open doors in public restrooms .
I can't imagine what else I could do about MRSA .
Except warn you .

Advertisement A fossil fish uncovered in Australia is the oldest - known example of a mother giving birth to live young , scientists have reported in the journal Nature .
The 380 million - year - old specimen has been preserved with an embryo still attached by its umbilical cord .
The find , reported in Nature , pushes back the emergence of this reproductive strategy by some 200 million years .
Until now , scientists thought creatures from these times were only able to develop their young inside eggs .
When I looked at it , my jaw dropped .
I said we are onto something big here
Prof John Lane , Museum Victoria
Before this find , the earliest evidence for this form of reproduction came from reptile fossils dating to the Mesozoic Era ( 248 to 65 million years ago )
The team said the latest discovery had a remarkably advanced reproductive biology , similar to modern sharks and rays .
The extremely well - preserved fossil represents a new species of " placoderm " fish .
The placoderms were an incredibly diverse group and are thought to be the most primitive known vertebrates with jaws .
These armoured fish dominated seas , rivers and lakes throughout the Devonian Period ( 420 - 360 million years ago ) .
This latest placoderm specimen , which measures about 25 cm ( 10 in ) in length , was found in the Gogo area of Western Australia in 2005 by a team led by John Long from Museum Victoria .
The fossil was found in Western Australia Close examination revealed that the team had unearthed something unusual .
Professor Lane said : " When I looked at it , my jaw dropped .
I said : ' we are onto something big here ' . "
The team found an embryo and an umbilical cord , which had been exquisitely preserved along with the female fish .
The scientists have named it Materpiscis attenboroughi , in honour of the naturalist Sir David Attenborough , who first drew attention to the Gogo fish fossil sites in the 1970s .
Sir David told the team that he was " very very flattered " to have had his name given to such an " astonishing creature " .
The discovery prompted the researchers to return to another fossil that they had unearthed in 1986 .
Close investigation revealed that this too contained evidence of live births - it contained three embryos .
Professor Lane said : " After we saw this , we realised we had totally nailed it , everyone was convinced that this creature bore live young . "
Until the latest fossil find , scientists thought life forms that existed during these times had only evolved to reproduce using externally fertilised eggs - a primitive version of the way fish spawn today .
Now , however , the team believes this ancient species bore live young through internal fertilisation ( viviparity ) .
Dr Long commented : " This is not only the first time ever that a fossil embryo has been found with an umbilical cord , but it is also the oldest known example of any creature giving birth to live young .
" The existence of the embryo and umbilical cord within the specimen provides scientists with the first ever example of internal fertilisation - or sex - confirming that some placoderms had remarkably advanced reproductive biology .
He added : " This is a world first fossil find , and it opens up a window into the developmental biology of an entire extinct class of organisms . "
Commenting on the paper , Zerina Johanson , a palaeontologist at London 's Natural History Museum , said : " It is extremely rare to find preservation like this in the fossil record .
This new discovery extends the record of viviparity back almost 200 million years in the fossil record .
" Placoderms represent the most primitive group of jawed vertebrates , so this work shows that the capacity for internal fertilisation and giving birth to live young evolved very early during vertebrate history . "

The 19th - century creators of neoclassical economics — the theory that now serves as the basis for coordinating activities in the global market system — are credited with transforming their field into a scientific discipline .
But what is not widely known is that these now legendary economists — William Stanley Jevons , Léon Walras , Maria Edgeworth and Vilfredo Pareto — developed their theories by adapting equations from 19th - century physics that eventually became obsolete .
Unfortunately , it is clear that neoclassical economics has also become outdated .
The theory is based on unscientific assumptions that are hindering the implementation of viable economic solutions for global warming and other menacing environmental problems .
The physical theory that the creators of neoclassical economics used as a template was conceived in response to the inability of Newtonian physics to account for the phenomena of heat , light and electricity .
In 1847 German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz formulated the conservation of energy principle and postulated the existence of a field of conserved energy that fills all space and unifies these phenomena .
Later in the century James Maxwell , Ludwig Boltzmann and other physicists devised better explanations for electromagnetism and thermodynamics , but in the meantime , the economists had borrowed and altered Helmholtz ’s equations .
The strategy the economists used was as simple as it was absurd — they substituted economic variables for physical ones .
Utility ( a measure of economic well - being ) took the place of energy ; the sum of utility and expenditure replaced potential and kinetic energy .
A number of well - known mathematicians and physicists told the economists that there was absolutely no basis for making these substitutions .
But the economists ignored such criticisms and proceeded to claim that they had transformed their field of study into a rigorously mathematical scientific discipline .
Strangely enough , the origins of neoclassical economics in mid-19th century physics were forgotten .
Subsequent generations of mainstream economists accepted the claim that this theory is scientific .
These curious developments explain why the mathematical theories used by mainstream economists are predicated on the following unscientific assumptions :
The market system is a closed circular flow between production and consumption , with no inlets or outlets .
Natural resources exist in a domain that is separate and distinct from a closed market system , and the economic value of these resources can be determined only by the dynamics that operate within this system .
The costs of damage to the external natural environment by economic activities must be treated as costs that lie outside the closed market system or as costs that cannot be included in the pricing mechanisms that operate within the system .
The external resources of nature are largely inexhaustible , and those that are not can be replaced by other resources or by technologies that minimize the use of the exhaustible resources or that rely on other resources .
There are no biophysical limits to the growth of market systems .
If the environmental crisis did not exist , the fact that neoclassical economic theory provides a coherent basis for managing economic activities in market systems could be viewed as sufficient justification for its widespread applications .
But because the crisis does exist , this theory can no longer be regarded as useful even in pragmatic or utilitarian terms because it fails to meet what must now be viewed as a fundamental requirement of any economic theory — the extent to which this theory allows economic activities to be coordinated in environmentally responsible ways on a worldwide scale .
Because neoclassical economics does not even acknowledge the costs of environmental problems and the limits to economic growth , it constitutes one of the greatest barriers to combating climate change and other threats to the planet .
It is imperative that economists devise new theories that will take all the realities of our global system into account .

As should be expected , the NYPD is using the papal visit as an excuse to impose police state measures .
From the WCBS TV website :
“ Mind if we check the train ? ”
That ’s the question NYPD officers will be asking hundreds of train conductors when the pope arrives in NYC on Friday morning .
Over the course of the pontiff ’s three - day visit , the NYPD will have round - the - clock coverage of high - profile MTA stops starting as soon as the pope arrives in the city .
Officers will take a peek inside every train that comes through the station .
“ It ’s probably necessary , ” one passenger said .
“ The pope is a big worldly figure so he needs that kind of security . ”
With hundreds of thousands of people expected to flock to the pope ’s motorcade route through Manhattan on Friday and pack Yankee Stadium for his mass on Sunday , police expect the subway to be extremely busy .
The NYPD ’s presence , cops say , is all about letting the public know they are around .
Police are hoping commuters will stay vigilante .
Video : GOP candidates get nasty with Iowa caucus just days away
With the crucial Iowa caucus looming , Republican White House hopefuls jockeying for position have taken to intense pushing and shoving .
Mike Huckabee and John McCain are firing back at " aggressively negative " campaign ads from fellow GOP presidential aspirant and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney , reports ABC's Jake Tapper .
In one ad , Huckabee is knocked by Romney for his record against crime while governor of Arkansas .
Huckabee responds that the people of Iowa are " hearing things about me that I do n't like , but they 're also hearing things about me that are n't necessarily true . "
Meanwhile , McCain is defending himself against criticism from Romney over the Arizona senator 's vote against President Bush 's tax cuts .
" I know something about tailspins , " McCain says , " and it 's pretty clear Mitt Romney is in one . "
Huckabee spoke to reporters after bird hunting in Iowa .
" Do n't get in my way , " he jested while standing over the body of a pheasant he 'd just shot .
" This is what happens . "
Huckabee went on to pay tribute to Obama for his ability “ to touch at the core of something Americans want ” in seeming to move beyond partisanship .
And , he added , Senator Obama is “ a likable person who has excited people about wanting to vote who have not voted in the past . ”
Huckabee was of course aware that in praising Obama he was recommending himself
I was watching the debate at the home of a savvy , moderately conservative New Hampshire Republican .
It was at this moment that he turned to me and said : “ You know , I ’ve been a huge skeptic about Huckabee .
I ’m still not voting for him Tuesday .
But I ’ve got to say  I like him .
And I wonder  could he be our strongest nominee ? ”
He could be .
After the last two elections , featuring the well - born George Bush and Al Gore and John Kerry , Americans  even Republicans !
 are ready for a likable regular guy .
Huckabee seems to be that .
He came up from modest origins .
He served as governor of Arkansas for more than a decade .
He fought a successful battle against being overweight .
These may not be utterly compelling qualifications for the presidency .
I ’m certainly not ready to sign up .
Still , as the conservative writer Michael Medved put it , “ For the work - hard - to - get - ahead strivers who represent the heart and soul of the G.O.P. , there are obvious , powerful points of identification . ”
And they speak to younger voters who are not yet committed to the G.O.P .
In Iowa , Huckabee did something like what Obama did on the Democratic side , albeit on a smaller scale .
He drew new voters to the caucuses .
And he defeated Mitt Romney by almost two to one , and John McCain by better than four to one , among voters under 45 .
Now it ’s true that many conservatives have serious doubts about Huckabee ’s positions , especially on foreign policy , and his record , particularly on taxes .
The conservative establishment is strikingly hostile to Huckabee  for both good and bad reasons .
But voters seem to be enjoying making up their own minds this year .
And Huckabee is a talented politician .
NASA 's QuikScat satellite detected extensive areas of snow melt , shown in yellow and red , in Antarctica in January 2005 .
Warm temperatures melted an area of western Antarctica that adds up to the size of California in January 2005 , scientists report .
Satellite data collected by the scientists between July 1999 and July 2005 showed clear signs that melting had occurred in multiple distinct regions , including far inland and at high latitudes and elevations , where melt had been considered unlikely .
“ Antarctica has shown little to no warming in the recent past with the exception of the Antarctic Peninsula , ” said Konrad Steffen of the University of Colorado , Boulder .
“ But now large regions are showing the first signs of the impacts of warming as interpreted by this satellite analysis . ”
Changes in the ice mass of Antarctica , Earth 's largest freshwater reservoir , are important to understanding global sea level rise .
Large amounts of Antarctic freshwater flowing into the ocean also could affect ocean salinity , currents and global climate .
NASA ’s QuikScat satellite detected snowmelt by radar pulses that bounce off of ice that formed when snowmelt refroze ( just as ice cream turns to ice when it is refrozen after being left out on the counter too long . )
Maximum high temperatures of 41 degrees Fahrenheit that persisted for about a week in Antarctica caused a melt intense enough to create an extensive ice layer .
Evidence of melting was found up to 560 miles inland from the open ocean , farther than 85 degrees south ( about 310 miles from the South Pole ) and higher than 6,600 feet above sea level .
Water from the melted snow can penetrate cracks and the ice , lubricating the continent ’s ice sheets , sending them toward the ocean faster and raising sea levels , the scientists said .
“ Increases in snowmelt , such as this in 2005 , definitely could have an impact on larger scale melting of Antarctica ’s ice sheets if they were severe or sustained over time , ” Steffen said .
No further melting has been detected through March 2007 .

Debunkers love to claim that the Bilderberg Group is a mere talking shop and has no influence over world events , but it appears as if the secretive organization had some sway in ordering the Dutch Embassy to remove information about where they would be meeting this year from their official website .
Of course the cat is already out of the bag – the alternative media cracked the real scene of the crime this time around – Chantilly , Virginia – after it appeared Bilderberg had pulled a fast one by having Greek newspapers report that they had already met in Athens .
Despite the open knowledge that Bilderberg , which this year will welcome Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende , will meet from June 5 - 8 at the Westfields Marriott hotel , they were seemingly uncomfortable with that information being broadcast by the Dutch Embassy , who have now deep - sixed any mention of it .
Original version with Bilderberg information included .
Edited version with Bilderberg information memory - holed .
In their original press release – cached here – the statement reads , " The Prime Minister will participate in the annual Bilderberg conference , which this year will be held in Chantilly , VA . "
Original version with Bilderberg information included .
The edited version which is currently posted omits any mention of Bilderberg .
Edited version with Bilderberg information memory - holed .
One can speculate in assuming that the reason behind the removal of the information was to discourage mainstream media attention towards the meeting .
Perhaps Bilderberg were hoping that the U.S. corporate press ’ obsession with American Idol or the Obama / Clinton circus might have helped the unveiling of this year ’s location to go unnoticed .
The U.S. corporate media is notorious for being the most blinkered when it comes to Bilderberg coverage , self - censoring every time the group meets in the states .
You can count on one hand the number of mainstream news outlets that report on the conference – a damning indictment of the " free press " in light of the fact that over 100 power brokers are meeting in secret to plot the course of our future .
As we previously reported , there was speculation that the Dutch Embassy deliberately published the information in the first place because they were nonplussed about Bilderberg ’s obsession with secrecy , but if this was the case then someone at Bilderberg cracked the whip and the Embassy duly complied .
Bilderberg sleuth Jim Tucker got direct confirmation over the phone from the Dutch Embassy a few days ago that Bilderberg would be meeting at the Westfields Marriott – so whereas before they were happy to provide the information , now it appears they have been told in no uncertain terms to keep it under wraps .

US admits economy is in downturn
The US Treasury Secretary sees tough times ahead US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has admitted that the US economy is facing a " sharp decline " at the moment but hopes for a recovery later in the year .
The news comes after the US central bank , the Federal Reserve intervened to rescue troubled bank Bear Stearns , providing $ 30bn in emergency support .
Mr Paulson said that he did not believe investors saw the move as a bail - out .
The Fed later slashed its main interest rate by 0.75 percentage points to boost confidence in financial markets .
We know we 're in a sharp downclimb and there 's no doubt that the American people know that the economy has turned down
Hank Paulson , US Treasury Secretary
Readers ' financial woes
The global credit crunch in figures Bank profits Meanwhile , two other leading Wall Street banks reported sharply reduced profits for the first three months of the year .
Goldman Sachs posted earnings of $ 1.5bn , down more than 50 % , while Lehman Brothers , whose shares had fallen sharply on Monday , earned $ 489 m , or 60 % less than in the same period last year .
But the numbers were not as bad as expected , lifting Wall Street shares .
The Dow Jones stock index jumped more than 200 points , or almost 2 % , to 12 , 209.3 .
The wider Standard & Poor 's index and technology - dominated Nasdaq also rose .
Following news of the rate cut , however , share prices lost some of their gains .
More rate cuts Economists had predicted that the main US interest rate would be cut by up to one percentage point from 3 % to 2 % .
However , in its fifth rate cut since the credit crunch started , the Federal Reserve cut back to a rate of 2.25 % .
On Tuesday Mr Paulson had been touring the US breakfast television studios in an attempt to reassure markets and consumers about the economic situation .
" We know we 're in a sharp downclimb and there 's no doubt that the American people know that the economy has turned down , " he said .
He said that policy was focused on calming the financial markets .
" The big focus on the part of all policy makers is to minimise the spillover to the real economy , " he added .
Slowing economy Mr Paulson declined to use the word recession to characterise the US economy , but recent polls of both economists and the public have revealed that they disagree .
The latest economic figures to suggest a sharp slowdown were the industrial production figures , published on Monday , which fell by 0.5 % in February .
US job growth was also negative in February , but Mr Paulson said he expected the economic package and further rate cuts to lead to 500,000 more jobs this year .
But the Fed also faces worrying pressures over inflation .
US producer prices , released on Tuesday , rose by 0.3 % in February compared to the month before , but a key measure of producer core inflation rose by 0.5 % , the fastest pace in well over a year .
Confidence MAIN SUB - PRIME LOSSES SO FAR Citigroup : $ 18bn HSBC : $ 17bn Merrill Lynch : $ 14.1bn UBS : $ 18.4bn Morgan Stanley $ 9.4bn Credit Agricole : $ 5 bn Deutsche Bank : $ 3.2bn Bank of America : $ 3 bn Barclays : $ 2.6 bn Royal Bank of Scotland : $ 2.6bn Freddie Mac : $ 2bn JP Morgan Chase : $ 3.2 bn Credit Suisse : $ 1.8 bn Wachovia : $ 1.1bn IKB : $ 2.6 bn Source : Company reports
Timeline : Sub-prime crisis Q&A : Bear Stearns crisis
The US Federal Reserve has been trying to restore confidence in the banking business .
Before Tuesday it had already cut interest rates from 5.25 % to 3 % .
Banks have been unwilling to lend to each other because they are worried about losses on investments backed by US mortgages .
Those investments have been hit by the slump in the US housing market .
New figures showed that housing starts and building permits fell , the latter to the lowest annual rate since 1991 .
" The housing industry is in a recession , " said Josh Stiles , bond strategist at IDEAGlobal .
" There is no reason for the Fed not to be aggressive , " said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody's Economy.com .
" The economy is in a recession , the financial system is in disarray and inflation is low , " he added .

What are these ?
Some people think that giving their houseplants an occasional talking - to is a good thing .
But how about a little shock treatment ?
Researchers at the University of Arizona and the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation in Oklahoma report that a small electric current applied to certain plants can stimulate the biosynthesis of chemicals with antifungal and other properties , without harming the plants .
The finding , published in the journal Biotechnology Progress , suggests a new route to producing compounds with potential uses in research or in production of pesticides or medicines .
Image Credit ...
Chris Gash
As with animals , plants synthesize higher levels of some chemicals in response to microbial infection .
Researchers have tried to stimulate the controlled production of these chemicals using “ elicitors ”  either biological ones like cells or cell parts , or nonbiological ones like chemicals , ultraviolet light or ultrasound .
The problem with most of these approaches is that they either harm the plants or yield compounds that then must be separated from the elicitor .
” Where is George Bush ’s bedroom ? ”
Oliver Stone is flinging open French doors inside an enormous brick mansion in Shreveport , La. , inspecting locations for his new film about the 43rd President of the United States .
” This one is too small , ” he says .
” This one looks like George Tenet ’s bedroom .
Where did we decide to put Bush ’s bedroom ?
It ’s around here somewhere , is n’t it ? ”
Shooting begins in less than two weeks on W ( or dub - ya , as it ’s spelled out in the initial sketches for the poster ) , but not everything is exactly where it should be , and not only here in the house where the First Family ’s residence will be re-created .
The 32,000 - square - foot soundstage the production is renting across town stands empty , waiting for the Oval Office and Cabinet Room sets to get trucked in from Los Angeles .
The screenplay still needs work too .
It ’s gone through two rewrites since an earlier draft leaked to the press last month ( some skeptics took it as an April Fools ’ joke ) , but Stone would still like one more pass at it ( ” It ’s evolving , ” he says ) .
And while most of the cast has been assembled and outfitted with prosthetic noses and hairpieces — Josh Brolin will play President George W. Bush and Elizabeth Banks will star as Laura — there is one major character still in search of an actor : a heavy named Dick Cheney .
Stone is famous for courting controversy with dramas like JFK ( 1991 ) and Nixon ( 1995 ) .
But with W , the 61 - year - old filmmaker is n’t merely courting it — he ’s grabbing controversy by the lapels and giving it a big wet smacker .
For the first time , he ’s turning his cameras not just on a living president but on one who ’ll still be knocking around the White House when the movie premieres late this year .
As if that were n’t provocative enough , Stone could end up releasing the film as early as October , at the height of a presidential campaign in which one of the major issues will undoubtedly be the legacy of the guy on the screen .
The movie has become a lightning rod before Stone has shot a single frame .
If that bootlegged script is any indication , the film will feature such flag - waving moments as the Commander - in - Chief nearly choking to death on a pretzel while watching football on TV and a flashback of him singing the ” Whiffenpoof ” song as a frat pledge at Yale , not to mention scenes in which he refers to his advisers by dorky nicknames — ” Guru ” for Condoleezza Rice , ” Turdblossom ” for Karl Rove , ” Balloon Foot ” for Colin Powell — while discussing plans for the invasion of Iraq with the coolness of a late - night poker game .
Apple has just finished purchasing little known chip maker P.A. Semi .
The $ 278 million dollar deal ( which recently closed at Steve - O's house ) would undoubtedly be the first step in tasking the boutique chip manufacturer to produce processors that will power future versions of the iPhone — and possibly the iPod .
P.A. Semi apparently has the chops too .
Last year the company announced a 64 - bit dual core processor that it claimed was around 300 % more efficient than its nearest opponent .
Products featuring a P.A. Semi engineered chipset would n't hit shelves for at least a year or so .
Blam over at Giz thinks that Intel and ARM are probably less than thrilled at this news .
He also thinks ( and I do too ) that it 's logical for Apple to work in its own internal hardware in order to produce better devices .
Here 's to speculation .
But for Steve it 's likely this is * all part of the plan* .

You might remember reading this passage just last Tuesday here on AMERICAblog in Cliff ’s Corner :
So , in any case , here is what U.S News & World Report had to say about the book : A new book by liberal writer and political consultant Cliff Schecter lays out a detailed blueprint for how Dems can mine presumed GOP presidential nominee Sen .
John McCain ’s political and personal past — including already well - documented incidents of his temper — to defeat him in the fall .
Not too shabby , for a thirty - something , suburban dad like me .
The problem is that on a few stories I broke , where McCain referred to his wife as something that rhymes with “ runt , ” and let out his inner pugilist by punching Rick Renzi ( in his defense , it was Rick Renzi ) , I did that crazy thing that right - wing bloggers and the MSM never do !
I relied upon thoroughly vetted , 100 % credible , yet anonymous sources .
Today , the Washington Post ran a lengthy article about McCain ’s volatile temper ( any article that honestly examines McCain ’s temper requires a very lengthy article ) , including this tidbit :
Reports recently surfaced of Rep. Rick Renzi , an Arizona Republican , taking offense when McCain called him “ boy ” once too often during a 2006 meeting , a story that McCain aides confirm while playing down its importance .
“ Renzi flared and he was prickly , ” McCain strategist Mark Salter said .
“ But there were no punches thrown or anything . ”
So , the McCain staffer admitted that this incident happened .
Today , on “ This Week ” McCain lied about his temper .
It was disturbing to watch McCain fake a smile as he discussed his own volatility .
McCain tried to dismiss the incidents of his temper flaring as though they were all in his distant past — 15 , 20 even 25 years ago :
Asked how he could insure voters that his temper was under control , Mr. McCain responded , “ Look at my record .
Look at my conduct on the campaign .
Look at —
I mean , look , I am very happy to be a passionate man .
I love this country .
I love what we stand for and believe in , and many times I deal passionately when I find things that are not in the best interests of the American people .
And so , look , 20 , 25 years ago , 15 years ago , that ’s fine , and those stories here are either totally untrue or grossly exaggerated . ’’
The now confirmed incident with Renzi was in 2006 .
McCain has a temper problem that has n’t gone away — and he ’s not being honest about it .
Unlike most of the issues that cause a media frenzy , the stability of the potential president seems important to the safety of our nation — especially when a lot of the concern comes not from McCain ’s political opponents , but people who are on his side of the aisle .
I really am beginning to think that one reason the media is so gentle on McCain is n’t that they like him ( some do and they like riding on the bus with him ) .
I think most of them are afraid of him .
He ’s crazy .
A quest by researchers at the University of Rochester resulted in a 20 - second clarinet solo being compressed into less than a single kilobyte of data – nearly 1,000 times smaller than a standard MP3 representing the same audio .
We obtained permission to post the results .
They 're available as WAV files for easy comparison .
Here 's the what the clarinet solo sounds like as an MP3 .
And here 's the Rochester researchers ' sub -1KB file of the same sound .
In order to get this done , they created a model of the clarinetitself – essentially replicating each aspect of the sound ratherthan creating thousands of digital samples from a performance of it .
The resulting file occupiesless than a kilobyte despite including all of the audio materials .
By comparison , the same clarinet sample would occupy 32KB
as a MIDI file .
This just does n't seem possible .
In addition , the timing of thepress release ( April 1 ) left a few people confused about whether the technology is real .
But it is , as I confirmed with a representative of the University of Rochester on Friday .
" This is essentially a human - scale system of reproducing music , "
said professor Mark Bocko ( electrical and computer engineering ) .
" Humans can manipulate their tongue ,
breath , and fingers only so fast , so in theory we should n't really haveto measure the music many thousands of times a second like we do on aCD . "
The technique could eventually be used to model the human voice , giving device makers an efficient way to include speech engines .
There are countless potential applications for hyper - efficient audio representation , from wireless transmission to talking toys .
It may not be possible to compress a clarinet solo any tighter .
Bocko said , " I think we may have found the absolute least amount ofdata needed to reproduce a piece of music . "
Bocko believes the technology will continue to improve as acoustic measurement and the resulting algorithms become more accurate .
" Maybe the future of music recording lies in reproducing performers and not recording them , " he said .

Richard Gage , AIA , Architect – Member , American Institute of Architects .
A practicing Architect for 20 years who has worked on most types of building construction including numerous fire - proofed steel - framed buildings .
Founding member of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth .
Speech at Sonoma State University 4/20/07 :
" Another 2006 poll by Scripps Howard , Ohio University , which found that a shocking 16 % believe that the World Trade Center 's Twin Towers were brought down by explosives .
Unfortunately , my research has also concluded that this is true .
Tonight I will present to you the very clear evidence that all three World Trade Center high - rise buildings , the Twin Towers and Building 7 were destroyed not by fire as our government has told us , but by controlled demolition with explosives . "

Editor 's note : WTC Building 7 was 610 feet tall , 47 stories .
It would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 , seven hours after the collapses of the Twin Towers .
However , no mention of its collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's " full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . "
Watch the collapse video here .
And six years after 9/11 , the Federal government has yet to publish its promised final report that explains the cause of its collapse .

Signatory : Petition requesting a reinvestigation of 9/11 , signed by more than 1,500 Architects and Engineers :
" On Behalf of the People of the United States of America , the undersigned Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth and affiliates hereby petition for , and demand , a truly independent investigation with subpoena power in order to uncover the full truth surrounding the events of 9/11/01 - specifically the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers and Building 7 .
We believe that there is sufficient doubt about the official story and therefore that the 9/11 investigation must be re-opened and must include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives that may have been the actual cause behind the destruction of the World Trade Center Towers and WTC Building 7 .

Signatory : Petition requesting a reinvestigation of 9/11 , signed by more than 1,500 Architects and Engineers :
" On Behalf of the People of the United States of America , the undersigned Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth and affiliates hereby petition for , and demand , a truly independent investigation with subpoena power in order to uncover the full truth surrounding the events of 9/11/01 - specifically the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers and Building 7 .
We believe that there is sufficient doubt about the official story and therefore that the 9/11 investigation must be re-opened and must include a full inquiry into the possible use of explosives that may have been the actual cause behind the destruction of the World Trade Center Towers and WTC Building 7 . "

Editor 's note : WTC Building 7 was 610 feet tall , 47 stories .
It would have been the tallest building in 33 states .
Although it was not hit by an airplane , it completely collapsed into a pile of rubble in less than 7 seconds at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 , seven hours after the collapses of the Twin Towers .
However , no mention of its collapse appears in the 9/11 Commission 's " full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . "
Watch the collapse video here .
And six years after 9/11 , the Federal government has yet to publish its promised final report that explains the cause of its collapse .

Statement in support of Architects and Engineers petition :
" There appear too many unexplained events and unverified circumstances to be satisfied with the official version of the New York building collapses .
As unthinkable as it is to suspect the United States government or military of willful complicity in these horrendous acts , it is even more heinous to allow such complicity -- if indeed it exists -- to remain undiscovered and unpunished .
Therefore , a thorough and impartial investigation by an independent , well - funded commission is fully merited . "

Statement in support of Architects and Engineers petition :
" I was dubious of the official explanations from the outset .
You see , as a professional city planner in New York , I knew those buildings and their design .
I attended and participated in the hearings at the New York City Hall when the buildings were first proposed .
I argued for the buildings on the basis that the interior core represented a way of internalizing the cost of mass transit , which in our system is almost impossible to finance through public bond issues .
So I was well aware of the strength of the core with its steel columns , surrounding the elevators , and stairwells .
I should also mention that with a degree in architecture and instruction in steel design ( my Yale professor had worked on the Empire State Building ) I was and am no novice in structural design .
When I saw the rapid collapse of the towers , I knew that they could not come down the way they did without explosives and the severing of core columns at the base .
The spewing of debris from the towers where the planes entered also could not have occurred simply with just a structural collapse .
Something else was happening to make this occur .
Moreover , the symmetrical collapse is strong evidence of a controlled demolition .
A building falling from asymmetrical structural failure would not collapse so neatly , nor so rapidly , as you have pointed out .
What we are faced with is a lie of such proportions that even to suggest it makes one subject to ridicule and scorn .
Who could have done such a terrible thing ?
Certainly not our government or military .
Rogue elements in the intelligence agencies ?
I have no idea .
But I do know that the official explanation does n't hold water .
An open , honest re-opening of the case is in order .
A near majority of Americans agrees with this view .
Let us keep pressing for an honest investigation . "

Letter to American Institute of Architects
11/26/06 :
" The primary duty of registered professionals is to protect the public safety .
Professionals ' intelligence , knowledge and experience provide a delicate connection between science and fact .
...
9 -11 was a tragic event for our country , quickly “ solved ” by our government and propagated by our media , leading our country into fear , anguish , anger , war and unrestrained spending .
Have we , as building professionals , been hoodwinked ?
Who should better understand the collapse of the World Trade Towers than those in our profession , possibly with the consultation of demolition experts ?
As I and millions have reviewed the events of that day , it seems much of the cover story is not true and impossible .
As the nation is confused on the reality of that day , have we been making bad decisions ever since ?
My web site collects salient information that isolates the demise of the World Trade Towers – linking many experienced , dedicated and articulate technical analysis that show clearly that the World Trade Towers were destroyed by internal explosives and not " fires from the airlines " .
...
After hundreds of hours of research , and thousands of dollars purchasing materials and information , this letter outlines my most salient , articulate examples of things that architects should investigate .
If I err slightly in any single item , that does not discount this letter .
On the contrary , even if only part of these accusations are true , they should be investigated . "

Endorsement of 9/11 Contradictions : An Open Letter to Congress and the Press by David Ray Griffin : " This book describes in very straightforward and non-technical terms some major inconsistencies in the government 's official story about the events on September 11 , 2001 .
It points out many attempts in the 9/11 Commission 's report to cover up evidence .

As an engineer , I am especially troubled by the cover - up of evidence relevant to the collapse of the three major World Trade Center buildings .

Statement in support of Architects and Engineers petition :
" Without any serious study I had simply accepted that the events of 9/11 were as commonly perceived , although I was not happy with the way the disaster was being used to promote what I felt were illegal and self defeating imperialistic policies in the guise of the War on Terrorism .
It was not until early 2006 that I stumbled upon sufficient information to become suspicious of the " official " and generally accepted 9/11 storyline .
This led me to do my own investigation during which I discovered the demise of WTC 7 , which I was heretofore unaware of .
Obviously it was the result of controlled demolition and scheduled to take place during the confusion surrounding the day ’s events .
I now feel morally obligated to deal with and expose the " politically unthinkable " issues surrounding the 9/11 phenomena by participating in such undertakings as signing this petition . "

Statement to this website
12/14/09 :
" Truth , Ethics and Professionalism are completely lacking in the official aftermath and investigations surrounding the 911 disasters .
Unfortunately we went to war predicated on lies , sustained in lies , and perpetuated in lies .
The quickest way to stop this endless warring is to expose the truth about what and who caused the 911 disaster .
It is clear that the World Trade Center buildings 1 , 2 and 7 were brought down in a contrived and controlled demolition from within .
Where is the investigation ?
Who really benefitted from this ?
In any criminal investigation the first question asked is “ who benefitted ” .
Just follow the money .
Why do we prolong the conflagration through endless war , creating untold misery for men , women and children in the Middle East and for our own young sons and daughters and their families ?
The most disgusting thing I have witnessed in my entire life was the spectacle of the richest and most powerful nations on Earth utterly destroying some of the poorest and most destitute countries .
What corruption lies behind this shame ?
It is time to firmly demand a proper investigation to uncover the truths behind 911 , and set about repairing the damages . "

Actually , I 've seen very few programming jobs where you - could n 't - use perl regularly .
Sure , it is n't going to make up the core of whatever product you are working on , but every project needs little administrative tools & scripts , not to mention the " I need to figure something out from a logfile RIGHT NOW " problem that perl so excels at .
That said , the team I 'm on seems to use python for these purposes .
Perl is getting a bit deprecated because python does basically everything we want from perl and does n't require a language wizard to make it not be write - once .

I think your comment is applicable for very small amount of " regular use . " ;)
Those tools & scripts are done once and for long time .
And I agree that more regularly structured Tcl and , say , Python are just more convenient to use .
And more productive after all .
PS
I once wrote two small Tcl programs to solve our small problem , just two little different algorithms .
I tried them , found nothing interesting in results and deleted them .
Then my colleague came up and said " Here , my Perl oneliner for that problem !

In 1998 I made an implementation of interesting idea ( like one proposed recently by John Carmack - using octree for ray - tracing ) .
I implemented it in C , and thought that C would be not a good language to experiment on my idea .

This is the biggest problem that imprecates all the " admin " scripts !
Why cant we treat those sidekick scripts as 1st class citizens ?
you will be surprised to find that the world has suddenly become a better place once you do it .
just try it !
Every " script " starts its life as a one liner - does not end as a one liner !
it ends its life as a gigantic ball of turd that will elude even the bravest and smartest on your team .
Then it will die a slow and painful death as it gets rewritten from scratch the right way .
Treat every script as though someone else will have to maintain ( someone could be you 24 hours from now )
clean_scripting :
Thats where Python shines
If its a true one liner - do n't ever save it to a file - thats been my strategy .

Python 's a great language , and I 'd very probably be using it if Perl did n't exist ( though I might go for Ruby instead ) .

Re : why does it need to be more than write - once ;-) ?
I was using perl first when i switched to Unix .
Back then i thought it was a great language .
I think perl is _still_ a good language BUT it has weaknesses which I think were never addressed .
People may laugh but actually I found PHP a lot more practical than Perl (! ) soon later for some years .
But PHP actually , from a language 's point of view , is a horrible language .
I stopped writing any php code .
After maybe 2 years of PHP i started playing with ruby .
The decision back then was between python and ruby , and the real difference was a talk matz did back then .
He emphasized the thinking aspect , inside an OOP " world " .
( I already knew how beautiful pure OOP can be as I coded in a LPC mud for a few years too ) .
What shall i say ?
I am using ruby since 5 years now .
I think I know what kind of language would replace ruby _for me_ ( a pure prototyped language that is conceptually easier than ruby , but still very powerful , slightly faster and would include features that are rare to see , like behavioural " code snatching " from other live prototype objects , and cell - oriented prototyping , but i stop now before dreaming )
The thing with Ruby is - I love the elegance .
If I compare my ruby code to my perl code , I cant stand the perl code anymore .
I dont have that problem with python , and I think it is BAD that perl has a " write once , throw away " attitude as far as maintaining source code is concerned .
This is why I recommend python over perl too , also because python seems to have a lot more momentum than perl .
( But of course , I would recommend ruby over python even though python is a tad faster . )
I think new people should choose between python or ruby instead of perl and php .
PHP is not a serious contender because outside the www it was never successful , but perl was around FOR SO LONG and the cool ideas these days simply arent done in perl .

That reminds me of the HURD jokes .

Could n't agree more -- as general - purpose languages those two have a huge amount going for them .

The cool things these days simply arent done in perl .
Not all cool things are famous or spectacular .
I do all my scientific data reduction in perl , including heavy duty image processing work ( well , OK , I use the PDL language extension in CPAN ) .
A few days ago , I was sitting in a panel discussion and , in five minutes of idleness , wrote a little perl script to retrieve , process , and plot all of the published magnetometer data from the Voyager spacecraft -- just by inspecting a few lines of one of the data files .
Cool ?
Very .
Famous ? nope .
I 've written 100,000 line programs in many languages over the years -- C , FORTRAN , Pascal ( yuck ! ) , a monstrosity called " Objective C " , and Perl .
I do n't find Perl to be any harder than anything else to scale big -- it just takes discipline to keep from using bad constructs or breaking object boundaries .
C is just as bad , but without all the nifty stuff to help out .
C++ is an evilness , I do n't know how anyone uses it .
Ruby and Python are both quite elegant and fast to learn , but they do n't seem to be as expressive as Perl in the long run -- like the difference between French and English .
( French is a much smaller , tightly regulated language , so you must work harder to express nuance -- English is a huge , brawling bar - fight of a language , so you must work harder to learn it , but there are bits and pieces to help express whatever subtlety you want ... )
If I compare my ruby code to my perl code , I cant stand the perl code anymore .
It sounds like you may have simply grown as a programmer between your perl and ruby experiences ... it 's possible to write sucky code in any language , yes ?
Given that there has recently been a lot of discussion on this blog about this logic puzzle , I thought I would make a dedicated post for it ( and move all the previous comments to this post ) .

There is an island upon which a tribe resides .
The tribe consists of 1000 people , with various eye colours .
Yet , their religion forbids them to know their own eye color , or even to discuss the topic ; thus , each resident can ( and does ) see the eye colors of all other residents , but has no way of discovering his or her own ( there are no reflective surfaces ) .
If a tribesperson does discover his or her own eye color , then their religion compels them to commit ritual suicide at noon the following day in the village square for all to witness .
All the tribespeople are highly logical and devout , and they all know that each other is also highly logical and devout ( and they all know that they all know that each other is highly logical and devout , and so forth ) .
[ Added , Feb 15 : for the purposes of this logic puzzle , “ highly logical ” means that any conclusion that can logically deduced from the information and observations available to an islander , will automatically be known to that islander . ]
Of the 1000 islanders , it turns out that 100 of them have blue eyes and 900 of them have brown eyes , although the islanders are not initially aware of these statistics ( each of them can of course only see 999 of the 1000 tribespeople ) .
One day , a blue - eyed foreigner visits to the island and wins the complete trust of the tribe .
One evening , he addresses the entire tribe to thank them for their hospitality .
However , not knowing the customs , the foreigner makes the mistake of mentioning eye color in his address , remarking “ how unusual it is to see another blue - eyed person like myself in this region of the world ” .
What effect , if anything , does this faux pas have on the tribe ?
The interesting thing about this puzzle is that there are two quite plausible arguments here , which give opposing conclusions :
[ Note : if you have not seen the puzzle before , I recommend thinking about it first before clicking ahead . ]
Argument 1 .
The foreigner has no effect , because his comments do not tell the tribe anything that they do not already know ( everyone in the tribe can already see that there are several blue - eyed people in their tribe ) .
Argument 2 . 100 days after the address , all the blue eyed people commit suicide .
This is proven as a special case of
Proposition .
Suppose that the tribe had n blue - eyed people for some positive integer n .
Then n days after the traveller ’s address , all n blue - eyed people commit suicide .
Proof :
We induct on n .
When n=1 , the single blue - eyed person realizes that the traveler is referring to him or her , and thus commits suicide on the next day .
Now suppose inductively that n is larger than 1 .
Each blue - eyed person will reason as follows : “ If I am not blue - eyed , then there will only be n- 1 blue - eyed people on this island , and so they will all commit suicide n- 1 days after the traveler ’s address ” .
But when n - 1 days pass , none of the blue - eyed people do so ( because at that stage they have no evidence that they themselves are blue - eyed ) .
After nobody commits suicide on the day , each of the blue eyed people then realizes that they themselves must have blue eyes , and will then commit suicide on the day .
Which argument is valid ?
I wo n’t spoil it in this main post , but readers are welcome to discuss the solution in the comments .
( Again , for those of you who have n’t seen the puzzle before , I recommend thinking about it first before reading the comments below . )
Added , Feb 12 : It is undoubtedly true that the assumptions of this logic puzzle are highly unrealistic , and defy common sense .
This however does not invalidate the above question , which is to resolve the fact that there are two separate and seemingly valid arguments which start with the same hypotheses but yield contradictory conclusions .
This fact requires resolution even if the hypotheses are extremely unlikely to be completely satisfied in any reasonable situation ; it is only when the hypotheses are logically impossible to satisfy completely that there is no need to analyse the situation further .
[ Update , Feb 10 : wording of the puzzle clarified .
( My original version , which did not contain the last parenthetical of the first paragraph , can be found on my web page ; it had an unexpectedly interesting subtlety in its formulation , but was not the puzzle I had actually intended to write .
See also this formulation of the puzzle by xkcd . ) ]
For years , no military program has sparked more fevered speculation from conspiracy theorists than the mysterious High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program , or HAARP .
And for years , the Pentagon has been pooh - poohing speculation that the enormous collection of transmitters , radars , and magnetometers in Alaska was some sort of superweapon .
But , it turns out , the conspiracy theorists may not have been entirely off - base , after all .
Since its inception , there 's been a huge range of opinion on what HAARP actually does : everything from a giant mind control facility to a space nuke countermeasure to a weather controller to an ionosphere - boiling mad science experiment to the mother of all pork projects has been suggested .
But now that the program is actually up an running , military managers say the electronics array has much more benign use .
" HAARP 's main job is to produce radio waves to probe the ionosphere , " an Air Force Research Laboratory officer said in October .
Which is true – up to a point .
A drive by Clifford Stone on the X - Files - esque uber - site Above Top Secret to use the Freedom of Information Act to turn up UFO - related documents has led to the release of a fascinating report , HAARP : Research and Applications .
It 's from the Air Force Research Laboratory and Office of Naval
Research , and it lays out the uses the military see for HAARP .
Turns out the Pentagon wants some military bang for their buck from the program .
HAARP can actually perform a lot of militarily important functions , all involving the interactions of radio waves with the high atmosphere , magnetosphere and ionosphere .
The document points out that " on the higher frequency end ( VHF / UHF )
transionospheric propagation is a ubiquitous element of numerous civilian and military communication systems , surveillance and remote sensing systems . "
In other words , messing with the ionosphere means you can shut down VHF radio , TV and radar signals at will .
As radio hams know , the reflection and refraction effects of the ionosphere make a huge difference to long - range radio reception , and HAARP provides the only means of influencing that .
Another interesting feature is how HAARP can influence the ' auroral electrodynamic circuit ' , a natural flow of electricity with ranges from
100,000 to 1 million megawatts ( " equivalent to 10 to 100 large power plants " ) .
Messing with the electrical properties of the ionosphere means some of this tremendous flow of power can be changed at the flick of a switch .
In effect , the natural flow can be modulated to create a gigantic low - frequency radio transmitter .
Which is extremely interesting to military types .
Extremely low frequency , or ELF , waves can be used for submarine communications and for probing the planet ; because of the way they propagate , HAARP can cover " a significant fraction of the Earth . "
The document says that the waves can be used for " seabed exploration " and even locating mines underwater , not to mention " underground target detection . "
HAARP can also " induce precipitation of energetic particles " in the ionosphere , which " could impact the operation and lifespan of satellites . "
While this is mainly about protecting satellites from particles from solar flares or nuclear explosions , the phrasing suggests that it might be able to have a subtle negative impact on satellites as well .
At the High Frequency range , HAARP also has some useful tricks , including being able to " enhance ground - to - ground and satellite - to - ground links that would otherwise be marginal or absent . "
Its ability to create a radio - reflective layer means it can create new over - the - horizon capabilities for radio and radar systems .
It can even act as a HF radar emitter itself .
The third band is optical and near - optical : HAARP can make lights in the sky .
While we have looked at the effect of creating high - altitude plasmas before ( as possible anti-missile defence ) , the document notes that it can also produce " airglow with megawatt power … in the IR [ infrared ] region of the spectrum . "
This has
" significant military implications for IR detection and countermeasures . "
The picture with this shows the IR glow below a satellite , suggesting that the system may be able to blank out the view of IR satellites selectively .
Given that such satellites are the best way of detecting the launch of ICBMs , this is a significant capability .
All in all , it 's a set - up that can do a lot more than just basic research .
And while this may not seem much compared to weather modification , remember that these are just the capabilities they 're willing to make public ...

But as food prices climb worldwide , there is a fear that development of biofuels could reduce the production of badly - needed basic foodstuffs .
Ethanol production is on course to account for some 30 % of the US maize crop by 2010 , dramatically curtailing the amount of land available for food crops .

The BBC's Daniel Schweimler says this is a clear reference to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , who says his country has enough land to grow food crops as well as plants to produce biofuels .
Last week , he rejected allegations that biofuels were responsible for the recent rise in global food prices .
And on Monday , Brazil announced a major joint venture in Ghana to grow sugar cane for bio-ethanol .
" In Ghana we are developing a project that will result in growing 27,000 hectares ( of sugar cane ) for the production of 150 million litres of ethanol per year that are destined for the Swedish market , " said President Lula , who was in Accra for the occasion .
Industrialised countries want to use a higher percentage of biofuels
For his part , Peru's President Garcia said the demand for biofuels was putting world food production under threat .
Just over 40 % of Peruvians - some 12 million people - live below the poverty line and have been hit hard by the soaring cost of basic foodstuffs .
The global prices of wheat , rice and maize have nearly doubled in the past year , while milk and meat have more than doubled in price in some countries .
Such rises , combined with high oil prices , are causing increasing political instability in less developed countries across the world .
Food riots earlier this month in Haiti , which is highly reliant on imports of food and fuel , led to the deaths of at least six people , including a UN peacekeeper .
There has also been unrest in Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Egypt , Indonesia , Ivory Coast , Mauritania , Mozambique and Senegal .

Solving Rubik's Cube
Prolog In Action
by Dennis Merritt
( Originally published in PC AI magazine )
Introduction
This article describes a Prolog program which solves Rubik 's cube .
The program illustrates many of the knowledge engineering problems encountered in building expert systems , such as knowledge representation , state space manipulation and the codification of expertise .
Performance - that is , speed and efficiency - is a key issue and affects most of the design decisions in the program .
The program is a classic example of a " dumb " expert system .
It unscrambles cubes as fast or faster than a human expert .
However , it does not have the intelligence to discover how to solve Rubik 's cube .
It simply lists , in a form that the machine can follow , a collection of the rules that an expert would use to solve the cube .
The rules are based on the expertise contained in Unscrambling the Cube by Black & Taylor .
Because of the large knowledge base involved in a program like this , a blind search strategy that picks rules at random simply will not work .
For this reason , such programs must use heuristic programming to direct the watch .
Using various heuristic ( intelligent ) rules , the search space can be drastically reduced so that the problem can be solved in a reasonable amount of time .
This problem , like many other AI problems , resolves itself into three main design decisons .
First , we must decide how to represent the current state of the cube .
Then , we must decide how to represent the things that can be done to the cube ; that is , we must represent the rules of manipulation .
Finally , we must decide how to figure out which of the rules to apply in any one given situation .
Each of these factors figures heavily in the program design .
Prolog was chosen as the language in which to code this problem because of its tremendous power and expressiveness .
These will be illustrated in the discussion of the program design .
Like every language , Prolog has its strengths and its weaknesses ; this example will show some of both .
Stating the Problem
Rubik 's cube is a deceptively simple - looking puzzle .
It is a cube with nine tiles on each face .
In its solved state , each of the sides is made up of tiles of the same color , with a different color for each side .
Each of the tiles is actually part of a small cube , called a " cubie . "
Each face of the cube ( made up of nine cubies ) can be rotated .
The mechanical genius of the puzzle is that the same cubie can be rotated from multiple sides .
A corner cubie can move with three sides ; an edge cubie moves with two sides .
The basic goal is to take a cube whose sides have been randomly rotated and figure out how to get it back to the initial solved state .
The problem is , there are an astronomical number of possible ways to manipulate the cube , and only a small proportion of these actually lead to the solved state .
To reach a solution using a blind search algorithm is not feasible ; even on the largest machines it takes a prohibitively large amount of time .
A human expert can unscramble the cube in well less than a minute ; obviously , the human expert does not use blind search .
The difficulty with solving the cube revolves around the fact that if you move one cubie , you have to move seven other cubies as well ( the center one does n't really go anywhere ) .
This is not a big problem in the early stages of unscrambling the cube , but once a number of tiles are positioned correctly , new rotations tend to destroy the solved parts of the cube .
The experienced cube solver knows some complex sequences of moves which can be used to manipulate a small portion of the cube without disturbing the other portions .
For example , this program knows a specific 14 - move sequence that can be used to twist two corner pieces without disturbing any other pieces .
Prolog Predicates Predicates are the basic computational building blocks of prolog programs .
They are called predicates since they simply succeed or fail .
The " :-" symbol is often read as " if . "
Thus , a prolog predicate can be read as : " The first term is true if the following terms are true . "
The arguments are used to pass information between predicates through the magic of unification .
Each predicate can contain multiple clauses .
When one prolog predicate calls another , Prolog finds the clauses that makes the goal statement true , or else fails .
In the case of " move " there are two clauses .
If the calling pattern has a " + M " pattern , then the first clause will be used .
If the calling pattern has a " - M " , then the second clause will be used .
The " move " predicate can be paraphrased as saying : 1 ) A positive move relationship exists between the old and new states if a " mov " relationship exists between them ; or 2 ) similarly , a negative move relationship exists .
Prolog uses unification to match the patterns of " mov " in the predicate " move " with the actual " mov " predicates stored in the program .
If " OldState " has a cube as a value , then " NewState " will have the rotated state of that cube as a value .
Representing the Cube
The core of any AI program is knowledge representation .
In this program , the core is the representation of the cube and its fundamental rotations .
The cube lends itself to at least two obvious representation strategies .
It can either be viewed as 54 separate tiles or as 28 different cubies ( called " pieces " in the program ) .
Eight of the pieces have one tile ( the part of the piece that is visible ) , 12 have two tiles , and 8 have three tiles .
Since much of the intelligence in the program is based on locating pieces and their positions on the cube , a representation which preserves the piece identity is preferred .
However , there are also brute - force search predicates which need a representation which can be manipulated fast .
For these predicates a simple flat structure of tiles is best .
The next decision is whether to use flat Prolog data structures ( terms ) with each tile represented as an argument of the term , or to use Prolog lists with each tile represented as an element of the list .
Lists are much better for any predicates which might want to search for specific pieces , but they are slower to manipulate as a single entity .
Flat data structures ( terms ) are more difficult to tear apart argument by argument , but are much more efficient to handle as a whole .
Based on the conflicting design constraints of speed and accessibility , the program actually uses two different notations .
One is designed for speed , using flat data structures and tiles ; the other is a list of pieces designed for use by the analysis predicates .
The cube is then represented by either the structure :
cube ( X1 , X2 , X3 , X4 , ........ , X53 , X54 )
where each X represents a tile , or by the list :
[ p( X1 ) , p( X2 ) , ... p( X7,X8,X9 ) , ... p(X31,X32 ) , p( X33,X34 ) , ...]
where each p(.. ) represents a piece .
A piece has one , two , or three arguments , representing its visible faces .
Pieces with one argument are center pieces ; pieces with two arguments are edge pieces ; pieces with three arguments are corner pieces .
( Upper case letters signify variables in Prolog ; square brackets signify a list . )
The tiles are each represented by an uppercase letter representing the side of the cube the tile should reside on when the cube is in its solved state .
The six sides are front , back , top , bottom , right , and left .
Quotes are used to indicate that the tiles are constants , not variables .
Using the constants , the solved state ( or goal state of the program ) is stored as the Prolog fact " ghoul " ( " ghoul " is used instead of " goal " due to a long - gone taboo regarding reserved words ) :
ghoul ( cube ( ' F ' , ' R ' , ' U ' , ' B ' , ............ ) )
Unification in Prolog Unification is an extremely powerful feature of prolog , and is used heavily in the Rubik 's cube program .
Unification is basically a pattern matching feature built into the language .
If two patterns containing variables can be matched , it determines the values of the variables that will make the patterns match .
The variables can contain simple or complex Prolog terms .
Unification can be used explicitly by attempting to unify two terms using the " = " operator .
It is more often used implicitly through Prolog 's calling method .
When a predicate is refered to in a Prolog goal ( or query ) , Prolog attempts to unify the arguments of that predicate with arguments of the goal .
A simple example of unification will illustrate how it is used in the program .
The predicate swap ( foo ( X , Y ) , foo( Y , X ) ) .
can be used to swap the arguments of " foo " .
It simply states that the predicate " swap " is true if the arguments of " foo " are reversed .
The scope of the two variables is such that the two X's must be equivalent ( or unify ) , as must the two Y's .
The following interpreter session illustrates how " swap " might be used .
The second line is the interpreters response to the query line .
?- swap ( foo ( 1 , 2 ) , Z ) . Z= foo ( 2 , 1 ) .
By matching the query pattern against the predicate " swap " , Prolog determines that the two unify if the variable Z is equal to the Prolog structure " foo ( 2 , 1 ) . "
In this way we have used the predicate " swap " to generate a " foo " with reversed arguments .
The same predicate can also be used in the opposite direction : ?- swap ( Z , foo ( 3 , 4 ) ) .
Z= foo ( 4 , 3 ) .
Manipulating the Cube
Having decided on two representations , it is necessary to change quickly from one to the other .
Unification has exactly the power we need to transform between one notation of the cube and the other .
A predicate " pieces " takes the flat structure and converts it to a list , or vice versa .
pieces ( cube ( X1 , X2 , ....... X54 ) , [ p ( X1 ) , ...... p( X7 , X8 , X9 ) , ..... ] ) .
If Z is a variable containing a cube in structure notation , then the query
?- pieces ( Z , Y ) .
will bind the variable Y to the same cube in list notation .
It can also be used the other way .
The following query can be used to get the goal state in list notation in the variable PieceState :
?- ghoul ( FlatState ) , pieces ( FlatState , PieceState ) .
FlatState = cube (' F ' , ' R ' , ' V ' , ' B ' , ..... ) .
PieceState = [ p ( ' F ' ) , p ( 'R ' ) , .... p('R ' , ' U ' ) , ...... p(' B' , ' R ' , ' F ' ) , ...... ] .
The first goal unifies " FlatState " with the initial cube we saw earlier .
" pieces " is then used to generate " PieceState " from " FlatState " .
Unification also gives us the most efficient way to rotate a cube .
Each rotation is just a predicate which maps one arrangement of tiles to another .
The first argument is the name of the rotation , while the second and third arguments represent a clockwise turn of the side .
For example , the rotation of the upper side is represented by :
mov(u , cube ( X1 , ...X6 , X7 , X8 , X9 , ... ) , cube ( X1 , ...X6 , X20 , X19 , X21 , ... ) )
We can apply this rotation to the top of the goal cube :
?- ghoul( State ) , mov( u , State , NewState ) .
The variable " NewState " would now have a solved cube with the upper side rotated clockwise .
Since these can be used in either direction , we can write a higher level predicate that will make either type of move based on a sign attached to the move .
move (+M , OldState , NewState ) :- mov( M , OldState , NewState ) .
move(- M , OldState , NewState ) :- mov( M , NewState , OldState ) .
Having now built the basic rotations , it is necessary to represent the complex sequences of moves that unscramble the cube .
In this case the list notation is best .
For example , a sequence which rotates three corner pieces is represented by :
seq ( tc3 , [+r , -u , - l , +u , - r , - u , +l , +u ] ) .
The sequence can be applied to a cube using a recursive list predicate , ' move_list ' :
move_list ( [ ] , X , X ) . move_list ( [ Move|T ] , X , Z ) :- move ( Move , X , Y ) , move_list ( T , Y , Z ) .
At this point we have a very efficient representation of the cube and a means of rotating it .
We next need to apply some expertise to the search for a solution .
Unification with Variables
The use of unification to determine whether or not a cube is in the desired partially solved state is very powerful .
However , it is difficult to understand by just reading the code .
Here is the basic technique for a simple puzzle which might be trying to get some numbers in order .
Suppose the goal of a puzzle was : ghoul ( puzzle ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) ) .
and the state was : state ( puzzle ( 2 , 4 , 1 , 5 , 3 ) ) .
The initial criteria for the puzzle would be : crit ( puzzle ( _ , _ , _ , _ , _ ) ) .
where each of the " _'s " indicates a variable whose value we do n't really care about .
To solve for the first piece in this simple puzzle , the criteria would first be set : crit ( puzzle ( 1 , _ , _ , _ , _ ) ) .
Now , this can be used to test a given solution .
The following unifications are key . ?- puzzle ( 1 , _ , _ , _ , _ ) = puzzle ( 2 , 4 , 1 , 5 , 3 ) .
no
This fails since the first argument is not a 1 . ?- puzzle ( 1 , _ , _ , _ , _ ) = puzzle ( 1 , 4 , 2 , 5 , 3 ) .
yes
This succeeds since the first argument is a 1 .
The other four arguments can be anything , since they are unified with variables .
The next stage would set criteria : crit ( puzzle ( 1 , 2 , _ , _ , _ ) ) .
This would only unify with a state which had the first two peoces in place .
Thus , if State and Crit were two variables bound to " puzzle " data structures , a search routine for solutions to this puzzle could end its search with the test : ... , State = Crit .
Then when the state matches the criteria , the predicate will succeed .
Otherwise , the last unification will fail , causing the predicate to backtrack and resume whatever searching it was doing .
This gives a very rapid way of testing potential solutions .
High Level Rules
The most obvious rule for solving Rubik 's cube is to attack it one piece at a time .
The placing of pieces in the solved cube is done in stages .
In Black & Taylor 's book they recognize six different stages which build the cube up from the left side to the right .
Two examples of stages are , " put the left side edge pieces in place " and " put the right side corner pieces in place . "
The particular knowledge necessary to solve each stage is stored in predicates , which are then used by another predicate , " stage , " to set up and solve each stage .
Each stage has a plan of pieces it tries to solve for .
These are stored in the predicate " pln , " which contains the stage number and a list of pieces .
For example , stage 5 looks for the four edge pieces on the right side :
pln ( 5 , [ p ( ' R ' , ' U ' ) , p ( ' F ' , ' R ' ) , p ( ' R ' , ' D ' ) , p ( ' B ' , ' R ' ) ] ) .
Each stage will also use a search routine which tries various combinations of rotations to position a particular target piece .
Different rotations are useful for different stages , and these are stored in a predicate similar to " pln " .
The predicate is " cnd " which contains the candidate rotations for the stage .
For example , the first stage ( left edge pieces ) can be solved using just the simple rotations of the right , upper , and front faces .
The last stage ( right corner pieces ) requires the use of powerful sequences which exchange and twist corner pieces without disturbing the rest of the cube .
These have names such as corner - twister 3 and tricorner 1 .
They are selected from Black and Taylor 's book .
These two examples are representative :
cnd(l , [ r , u , f ] ) .
cnd ( 6 , [ u , tc1 , tc3 , ct1 , ct3 ] ) .
The " stage " predicate drives each of the stages .
It basically initializes the stage , and then calls a general purpose routine to improve the cube 's state .
The initialization of the stage includes setting up the data structures that hold the plan for the stage and the candidate moves .
" Stage " also reorients the cube to take advantage of symmetries and / or make for better displays .
Improving the State
The predicate " stage " calls the main working predicates which search for the rotations to put a given piece in place , and update all of the appropriate data structures .
The representation of the partially solved cube is a key design issue for this portion of the program .
How do the search routines know when the target piece is successfully in place ?
There are predicates in the program which search through a cube in list - piece notation ( rather than tile notation ) and determine where a piece is , or conversely , which piece is in a given position .
These predicates are useful for many portions of the program but are too slow to be used for testing whether a given search has been successful or not .
This is true since they not only have to check for the new piece being placed , but they also have to insure that none of the previously placed pieces have moved .
Unification is again the answer .
So far , there are two " cube " terms used in the program .
One represents the final solved state of the cube , and the other represents the current state of the cube .
We introduce a third " cube , " referred to as the criteria , which is used to denote which tiles are currently in place , and the tiles of the cubie which is currently being positioned .
Initially all of the arguments of this third cube are variables .
This structure will unify with any cube .
As pieces are put in place , the variables representing tiles of the criteria cube are unified with the corresponding tiles of the solved cube .
In this case , the criteria cube will only unify with a cube that has those corresponding tiles in place .
As the program attempts to place each piece , it binds another piece in the criteria .
For example , as the program attempts to position the sixth piece , the " improve " predicate first binds the sixth piece in the criteria with the solved state .
At this point , the first six pieces will have bound values the same as the solved state .
The remaining tiles will be represented by unbound variables which unify with anything .
The criteria cube will then successfully unify with any cube that has the first six pieces in place .
The Search
Now that we have a plan of attack on the cube , and a means of representing the current state , and the criteria for testing if a given piece is in place , we can institute a very fast search routine .
The core routine to the Rubik 's cube program is a predicate " rotate " .
rotate ( [ ] , State , State ) .
rotate ( Moves , State , Crit ) :- rotate ( PriorMoves , State , NextState ) , get_move ( ThisMove , NextState , Crit ) , append ( PriorMoves , [ This Move ] , Moves ) .
The variable Moves is unbound at calling , and contains the list of moves necessary to position the piece after the search has succeeded .
State is the current state of the cube , and Crit is the criteria for this stage of the solution .
Crit has all of the pieces found so far bound , as well as the one additional piece for this search .
" rotate " searches for a sequence of moves which will put the new piece in place without disturbing the existing pieces .
" rotate " illustrates the tremendous power and compactness of Prolog code .
At the same time it illustrates the difficulty of understanding some Prolog code .
Prolog 's power derives from the built - in backtracking execution and unification .
Both of these features help to eliminate many of the standard programming structures normally used .
Thus , a predicate like " rotate " has a fraction of the code it would take in another language ( and executes fast as well ) , but it requires a good understanding of the underlying execution behavior of Prolog to understand it .
" rotate " does a breadth - first search , as can be seen by the fact that it calls itself recursively before it calls the move generation predicate " get - move " .
Since the application of moves and testing is so fast , and the depth of search is never great , intermediate results are not saved as in a normal breadth - first search .
Instead , they are just recalculated each time .
" append " is a predicate which can be used to build lists .
In this case it takes ThisMove and appends it to the end of the list PriorMoves , generating a new list , Moves .
The candidate moves for a given stage are stored in a predicate " cand " ( the actual program is a little more complex ) which is maintained by the " stage " predicate .
For stage one , it would look like :
cand(r ) .
cand ( u ) . cand (f ) .
" get_move " is called with the Move unbound , and the second and third arguments bound to the current state and a criteria respectively .
If the call to " move " fails ( because it does not rotate the cube into a position which unifies with the criteria ) , then " cand " backtracks , generating another possible move .
When all of the positive moves fail , then " get_move " tries again with negative moves .
get_move ( + Move , State , Crit ) :- cand ( Move ) , mov( Move , State , Crit ) .
get_move (- Move , State , Crit ) :- cand ( Move ) , mov( Move , Crit , State ) .
The efficiencies in " rotate " show the rationale behind the early design decisions of cube representation .
" get_move " is called with the State and the Crit .
If it generates a move which unifies with Crit , it succeeds ; otherwise it fails and backtracks .
All of this testing and analysis is done automatically by Prolog 's pattern - matching call mechanism ( unification ) .
The entire logic of the breadth - first search also happens automatically due to the backtracking behavior of Prolog .
If get - Move fails to find a move which reaches the criteria , " rotate " backtracks into the recursive call to " rotate " .
Since the recursive call to " rotate " uses NextState as the criteria , and NextState is unbound , the recursive call will succeed in generating PriorMoves and a modified state .
Now " get_move " tries again with this new state to see if a single move will reach the criteria .
This process repeats through as many levels of depth as is necessary to find a sequence of moves which reach the criteria .
In practice , any more than a three - deep search begins to get tedious .
' The design of the program is such that it does not require more than a three - deep search to find and position any given piece .
Recursion and Backtracking in Prolog " move_list " is a typical example of a Prolog recursive predicate .
Each time " move_list " is called , the second argument , X , is rotated by " move " into the argument Y .
Y is now recursively fed into " move_list " .
In each level of recursion , the third argument , Z , is passed down unchanged .
In fact , Z is not bound to any value at the call to " move_list " .
When the list is empty , the first clause of move_list takes effect .
It simply equates the second and third argument .
This ripples back up through the layers of recursion , setting Z to the cube after all of the rotations have been applied .
Prolog is unusual among programming languages in that it has bi- directional execution .
This means that after a given statement is executed , control might go to either the next or the previous statement .
This decision is based on whether the call succeeded or failed .
If a predicate has multiple clauses , and it is called from backtracking , it will attempt to find another clause which succeeds .
If it does , then forward execution resumes again .
This mechanism is clear in a predicate such as " get_move " .
Each time it is called on backtracking it generates a new move .
If there are no more new moves it fails and causes the calling statement to pass control to the statement before it .
More Heuristics
The program as described so far almost works .
However , it turns out there are a few situations that will cause the search routines to dig too deep for a solution .
These situations drastically affect the performance .
It was necessary to add more intelligence to the program to recognize situations that will not be easily unscrambled by the search routine , and to correct them before calling " rotate . "
One of the problems occurs when positioning pieces on the left side .
If the piece to be positioned is currently on the right side , then a few simple moves will put it in place on the left side .
However , if the piece is already on the left side , but in the wrong position , then it will have to be moved to the right and back to the left .
This longer sequence of moves takes longer to search for , so one of the extra heuristics looks for this situation .
The heuristics analyze the cube , test for this condition , and blindly move the piece to the right if it occurs .
Then the normal search routine gets it back into its proper place .
There are a couple of situations like this which are covered by the heurisitics .
It is tempting to think of adding more and more of these heuristics to straighten out the cube with less searching .
There is a tradeoff , however , and that is it takes time to apply the heuristics , and the search routine is really fast .
So a heuristic is only worthwhile when the search is slow .
I feel the current program may be improved by additional heuristics , but the search will still be the core of the program .
Do you love watching content on streaming platforms like YouTube or Netflix ?
They ’re all great but they have one major barrier : they require a strong Internet connection .
Would n’t it be nice to simply download these and watch them , uninterrupted , during your free time or when there ’s no Internet ?
Fortunately , you can download a video on Mac .
It ’s not too complicated or different from downloading videos on Windows PC .
Check out our how - to guide below to discover how .
1. Video Converters
One of the most popular options to download video on Mac is to use a video converter .
There are several of these available online .
Here ’s how they work :
First , get the URL of the video you want to download .
Paste this into the converter ’s form and click “ convert ” or “ download . ”
Some online converters give you the option to download the video in different resolutions and file formats .
Keep in mind , you ’ll have to download the file in a format Mac can read and play .
Mac can natively play .mov , mp4 , and .avi files .
These are pretty common , so you ’ll have no issue running these .
FLV files are less common , so you might need a Mac player that can read these .
Which online converters should you try out ?
The most popular ones include KeepVid and OnlineVideoConverter .
You can also try ClipConverter .
Practice caution when using online converters .
Some require you to click on ads that might infect your Mac with malware .
Others are fine but they wo n’t let you download videos with songs .
If you want to know how to download protected videos , check out the other options below .
2. Using Your Browser
Did you know you can download videos to your Mac directly from your browser ?
Open up Safari and play a video .
Pause it as soon as it begins and wait for the progress bar to fill up .
Once the video fully loads , go to the Menu bar and click Activity .
Look for the code that indicates the video file and double - click on it to download .
This is a great way to download videos to your Mac but you have to wait for the video to fully load up first .
For other browsers , you ’ll need a plugin or add - on .
One of the best ones you can use is Folx , which you can get at https://setapp.com/apps/folx.
This one not only allows you to copy streaming videos , but you can use it for torrent files too .
Make sure to check if the plugin / add - on you ’re getting works on Mac .
If it does , then it ’ll download compatible video files .
Always remember that some plugins prioritize Windows users .
3. RealPlayer Downloader
Looking to download a video on Vimeo or any website ?
Sometimes , you might want a video not on YouTube , after all .
The best option is to use the RealPlayer Downloader .
It also allows you to download protected videos .
This is a two - in - one program .
It ’s a downloader that adds a feature into your browsers and it ’s a media player too .
RealPlayer Downloader , once installed and integrated into your browsers , will reveal a small “ download this video ” button whenever a video plays .
It does n’t matter what you ’re watching or on what site , this little plugin tool should appear .
Keep in mind , this software downloads videos as FLV files .
You ’ll need a dedicated player to view these .
The media player that comes with RealPlayer Downloader works well , but you can also use VLC Player if you have the right add - ons .
4. Screen Recorder
When all else fails , use a screen recorder .
There are a few options out there , but the three you can rely on include OBS , QuickTime Player , and the new macOS .
Let ’s start with the new macOS , Mojave .
If you ’re still running macOS Catalina , you ’ll need to upgrade to the new operating system .
Once you have Mojave , simply press Command , Shift , and 5 simultaneously to begin screen recording .
Mojave allows you to record the whole screen or a select portion .
You can also do this with QuickTime Player .
OBS is a different kind of tool , but it can achieve the same results .
It ’s often used for recording video game footage and for arranging assets for streaming on platforms like Twitch or YouTube .
However , it also allows you to record your screen and you can use this to get a copy of a video you want .
5. Downloader Apps
There are also apps you can install on your Mac to download videos for you .
One of the most popular ones is Any Video Converter .
There are three options : the free version , the Pro version , and the Ultimate version .
What are the differences between these versions ?
The paid versions allow you to download videos from more websites , not only YouTube and Vimeo .
Using Any Video Converter is similar to the online video converters listed above .
Simply copy the URL and paste it into the tool .
You can download the video as is or edit the file format to better suit your viewing preferences .
If you do n’t like the UI or options available , you can use JDownloader and VideoDuke .
These work similarly and might have the features you seek .
6. Offline Viewing
All of the listed options focus on downloading videos to view them outside of their respective platforms .
However , you can also save videos on these platforms for offline viewing .
Keep in mind , these methods only work on mobile devices like your iPhone or iPad .
For example , you can download videos directly on YouTube .
Simply click on the video and hit the download button .
YouTube will then save the video so you can watch it later , even when you ’re not connected to the Internet .
Yes , you can only download videos while on mobile but you may access them on your Mac .
This depends entirely on the app you saved the videos on .
Netflix , Hulu , Prime Video , and YouTube all feature this option to some degree .
Download Video on Mac Today !
It ’s fun to stream videos , but you might not have a stable connection to do this all the time .
Fortunately , you can use these methods to download a video on Mac and enjoy the content anytime you want .

Switzerland is famous for its watches and its trains that run on time .
But , asks Imogen Foulkes , can punctuality become too much of a good thing ?
Euro 2008 fans will be able to depend on punctual transport
In the centre of Bern there is an electronic clock which is ticking off the days , hours , minutes and seconds until the start of Euro 2008 - a reminder that Europe 's football championships begin on 7 June and Switzerland is the proud host .
Seeing the clock caused me to reflect on Switzerland and time .
My first job in this country was as a journalist for Swiss Broadcasting 's international service .
Not so different from the BBC World Service in fact , apart from one curious thing .
Every day at exactly nine , 12 and four , the offices were all empty , and the elevators up to the staff restaurant were all full .
Why ?
Morning coffee , lunch and afternoon coffee it turned out .
Always at the same time .
Not because the company ordered it but because the Swiss do it that way .
Electronic timekeepers
One of my first assignments was at the city hospital , but I made the mistake of arranging an interview for 9am .
I wandered through empty corridors , passing wards where patients lay quietly , not a doctor or nurse in sight .
I finally found my neurologist in , of course , the canteen , coffee at his elbow .
There are new daily timesheets , in which all work activity must be recorded at 15 minute intervals
" But what if you do n't want coffee at nine ? " I finally asked a colleague .
" What if you fancy a cup at 10 ?
Or what if you 're hungry at two ? "
I was greeted with a puzzled frown .
" Well , " came the reply , " I 'd be on my own , because everyone goes at nine .
I 'd have no - one to talk to . "
But despite the national enthusiasm for punctuality , Swiss companies are now trying to formalise the timekeeping of their employees and there is currently a boom in time management software .
Bureaucratic insanity I know a woman who works as a translator .
It is a quiet office , everyone works individually and phone calls are rare .
This woman likes to swim for an hour at lunchtime and because - yes , you have guessed it - everyone takes lunch at the same time , her local pool is full at midday .
So she took the revolutionary step of going for lunch at 1330 .
The school timetables are not just strict , they are Byzantine in their complexity
The pool was almost empty , it was bliss - until she got back to work and found an email from her boss saying that under the new system , lunch after two o'clock was not possible .
I have another friend who works part - time , in theory every morning from eight until noon .
But sometimes it gets very busy and he works on until two .
Or he did until the newly - installed electronic timekeeper began deducting an hour 's wage as soon as it got to one , because of course he could not possibly be at his desk , he had to be at lunch .
The most bizarre system of all is about to be imposed on my former colleagues at Swiss Broadcasting : a new daily timesheet , in which all work activity must be recorded at 15 - minute intervals .
Imagine , if you will , racing to get a television report edited in time for the evening news and having to stop every quarter of an hour to explain what you are doing .
Management claim it will allow them to compare the cost effectiveness of programmes .
Journalists say it is a bureaucratic insanity .
School timetables
And then there are the schools .
Punctuality is prized in the classroom too .
Children who are late can expect punishment .
But the school timetables are not just strict , they are Byzantine in their complexity .
A regular nine - to - four day is unheard of .
Instead children come and go throughout the day .
It will be interesting to see how the Swiss adapt to the different habits of all these visitors
Here , for example , is a snapshot of my two sons ' timetable .
On Monday , one starts school at 0730 , the other at 0820 .
One comes home at 11 , the other at 12 , one goes back at two , the other is home for the afternoon .
It goes on like that all week but not in the same way , of course .
Each day is cleverly different .
The only thing that is sacrosanct is the two - hour lunch break .
Forget about school dinners .
Switzerland still operates on the principle that Mum is at home , so children are always home for lunch .
I have a friend with three children who tried for years to get a job but never succeeded because - and she worked it out precisely - given the school timetable , she could never be out of the house for more than an hour and 43 minutes .
Transport system
But there is one glorious , positive side to this obsession with timekeeping : the trains .
They really do run - nearly always - on time .
So the hundreds of thousands of football fans who are about to descend on Switzerland for Euro 2008 need not worry about missing the kick - off .
An intricate and integrated transport system is already in place , with extra trams and trains laid on in all the host cities .
What will be interesting , though , is to see how the Swiss adapt to the different habits of all these visitors .
The Italians are going to Zurich and may well want their cappuccino at 11 , not nine .
The French are coming to Bern .
What if they want a five - course lunch at two ?
Perhaps it is just as well for punctilious Swiss restaurant managers that the Spanish team is playing in neighbouring Austria , since their fans tend to enjoy dinner at 10 .
Still , I am sure it will all go smoothly , as long as there is no extra time .

Brian Wilson ( the famous Slimjim100 Blogger ) attended BlackHat 2008 DC and heard the news of Cisco routers getting hijacked due to poor ACL's and SNMP traffic being sent over public networks in plain - text .
Slimjim100 ( i.e. Brian Wilson )
Blogs :
It is important to keep your router locked down and protected .
If your router got accessed and changed by an unauthorized person the first thing they might do is to lock you out .
I have heard of reports where this is happened to a large multi-site company and they where blackmailed for money to get access back to there routers .
With networks expanding over many miles , cities , and countries it 's important to keep you network safe .
In the case of this reported company , the cost of sending people out to password recover the routers was a lot more than the blackmailer 's offer so the company paid them and then locked down the devices after they regained access .
This could of been avoided and the skills needed to lock down a router is not CCIE level stuff !
Just using ACL's and a understanding of how the network is designed can prevent this kind of attack .
Other issues with unauthorized access is even if you can regain access it 's best to reload the IOS and review you config's .
I say this since I have learned from Felix 's presentation at BlackHat that some attackers load non-Cisco patches to the IOS .
If an unauthorized IOS patch was made to your devices it is very difficult to identify the malicious code .
With infected IOS code your routers you risk them becoming members of bot-nets , reset unexpectedly , or relay / hide unwanted traffic or tunnels .
My recommendation is to only trust IOS code you get directly from Cisco .
In the end of the day it does pay to keep your Cisco contracts up to date so when you need that clean IOS fix your CCO login can save the day .
--------------------
David Davis - Cisco CCIE and the Expert Cisco Columnist for TechRepublic , suggests that you review his top five best practices to secure your routers , your network , and your company from malicious attacks : Fundamentals :
Five ways to secure your Cisco routers and switches
Whitepaper covering Cisco IOS forensic developments , released at BlackHat Briefings Washington DC 2008 : Developments in Cisco IOS Forensics Cisco IOS is still the prevalent router operating system in today ’s networks .
Its architecture and consequently the procedures to debug and analyze it are not suited well for detecting and thoroughly inspecting crash causes , especially intentional attacks .
Cisco Systems recently started to distribute the successor , IOS -XR , which features process separation and the QNX commercial microkernel .
However , the extremely large population of IOS devices and the significantly higher hardware requirements of the new IOSXR limit the impact it has on the currently deployed routing platforms .
Generally , networking engineers are reluctant to move from one image version to another , despite the frequent updates by Cisco Systems .
Most production networks stay with two or three minor versions behind the most recent releases , since only older versions provide the reliability they need to operate stable networks .
All the discussed factors lead to a large part of the network infrastructure being vulnerable to attacks and malicious modification , without the appropriate tools to detect and analyze it .

Have YOU too ever heard of a company being locked out of their Cisco routers by malicious intruders seeking blackmail money ?

As one of the leading critics of Washington ’s quid pro quo culture , John McCain has not just denounced the influence lobbyists have over policy and the legislators who make it .
He has repeatedly bashed the “ revolving door ” through which government officials move from federal jobs overseeing an industry to high - paying private positions repping for that same sector — and vice versa .
He has supported legislation that would strengthen lobbying restrictions on former members of the Executive Branch , former Members of Congress , and former congressional staff .
On his campaign website , McCain declares that he “ has fought the ‘ revolving door ’ by which lawmakers and other influential officials leave their posts and become lobbyists for the special interests they have aided . ”
Yet , McCain ’s offices have been part of the revolving door culture .
Mother Jones conducted a review of lobbying disclosure forms and publicly available information at OpenSecrets.org and Legistorm.com .
The records show that since the Keating Five scandal , which by McCain ’s own account turned the Arizona senator into a crusader for reform , at least 20 McCain staffers — working for McCain ’s personal Senate office or for one of the committees he has chaired — either came to McCain ’s employ from a lobby shop or joined one after leaving the congressional payroll .
It is common practice for congressional aides from both parties to head to lucrative lobbying positions after working on Capitol Hill .
And often lawmakers themselves leave Congress and return to lobby their former colleagues .
But McCain has a special lobbyist problem .
It ’s not just that his presidential campaign has been managed by former lobbyists for corporations and foreign governments .
( Though several lobbyists have recently left his campaign , McCain ’s two closest aides — Charlie Black and Rick Davis — used to be top - tier lobbyists . )
McCain has surrounded himself with lobbyists and lobbyists - to - be , all while positioning himself as the revolving door ’s top critic .
McCain vows that if he ’s elected he ’ll change the revolving door culture of Washington .
But if he ca n’t do so in his own outfit , how can he do so for the entire town ?
Below are several case studies demonstrating how the revolving door has worked at McCain ’s Capitol Hill offices :
Currently the head of John McCain ’s Senate office , Mark Buse started working as one of McCain ’s legislative assistants in 1987 .
He went on the serve as staff director for the Senate Commerce Committee from 1997 to 2001 , when McCain was the committee ’s chairman .
From there , Buse decamped to the law firm Mintz Levin and its affiliate ML Strategies , where he spent six years lobbying for financial services companies , pharmaceutical firms , telecoms , oil and gas interests , and other corporate clients .
Apparently , Buse ’s trip through the revolving door did n’t taint him in McCain ’s eyes .
In 2007 , McCain hired him to be his Senate chief of staff .
Buse was n’t the first McCain chief of staff to take this route .
Christopher Koch headed McCain ’s office from 1987 to 1990 .
He then spent three years as the chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission , an independent federal agency that regulates America ’s ocean - based commerce .
He left the commission to spend the majority of the ’90s lobbying for the shipping industry and in 2000 became the president of the World Shipping Council , the industry ’s trade group in Washington .
Early this month he announced that he would be taking a temporary leave of absence to work as the policy coordinator for the McCain campaign .
Paul Martino took over as Republican counsel for the Senate Commerce Committee in June 2001 .
In 2005 , when the committee chairmanship transferred from McCain to Senator Ted Stevens , Martino left to lobby for Alston & Byrd , where he now advances the agendas of clients as diverse as Goodyear and the Coalition Against Domain Name Abuse .
Martino touts his connection to McCain on Alston & Byrd ’s website , and he currently serves as a fundraiser for McCain ’s presidential campaign .
Then there ’s former McCain staffer Mary Phillips , currently an official at the Federal Highway Administration .
Prior to arriving in Washington , Phillips held a number of positions within the railroad industry .
From 2002 to 2004 , Phillips served on McCain ’s commerce committee staff , advising him “ on surface transportation matters , including Amtrak policy , ” according to her bio on FHWA ’s website .
She left McCain ’s staff to become vice president for legislative affairs for the American Trucking Association , lobbying for the trucking industry on Capitol Hill .
Now that she ’s back on the government payroll , she currently helps to make federal policy that effects the same industry she until recently represented .
In these instances McCain staffers left the Arizona senator ’s office or committee staff to become lobbyists .
Sometimes the process happened in reverse .
McCain has employed staffers who had previously lobbied on the same issues they would be overseeing on his staff .
For example , lobbyist John Tahsuda was general counsel and legislative director for the National Indian Gaming Association from 1999 - 2000 .
From there , he switched to First Nations Strategies and Hobbs Straus Dean & Walker , where he lobbied for Indian tribes .
In 2002 , he was hired by the Senate Indian Affairs committee and served as Majority Staff Director during McCain ’s tenure as chairman .
A call requesting comment from the McCain campaign was not returned .
McCain certainly cannot be blamed for the actions of his staff .
But it is clear that McCain ’s passion for ending the access and power of lobbyists did not influence his staff aides .
Many of them practiced Washington ’s business as usual even as their boss was condemning it .
The portal of US communications giant Comcast was hacked on Wednesday night in an assault that left subscribers unable to access their emails for several hours .
The comcast . net front page was replaced by a greeting from hackers on Wednesday night ( 28 May ) .
The defacement was removed around two hours later .
Users were then confronted by a " page under construction " message before the site was restored in the early hours of Thursday morning .
The site remained intermittently unavailable even after this time .
The defacement was claimed by hackers calling themselves KRYOGENIKS Defiant and EBK .
As a result of the attack Comcast subscribers were unable to access their email or other services through the portal for more than two hours .
Comcast is the second biggest ISP in the US and a major provider of cable TV services .
Comcast.net runs using unknown web server software on a Linux platform , Netcraft reports .
The exact mechanism of the attack is unclear , though an injected iFrame that served up content from sites under the control of hackers is suspected .
Some form of DNS redirection attack may also have been involved .
A Comcast spokeswomen said she was looking in to the matter .
Normally defacement attacks simply involve the spraying of digital graffiti on a website .
However , in the case of the Comcast attack it seems some attempt may have been made to snoop on its users ' login credentials .
" There is still a lot of speculation about the details of this and why this happened , " said Comcast user and Reg reader Chris , who first brought the attack to our attention .
" But it is clear now that a group of people ( according to the hacker 's message ) somehow rerouted the IP and DNS values of Comcast to an off site .
( http://www.freewebs.com/kryogeniks911/). "
" It appears there was no malicious codes or script being run but a lot of people are saying that ports were being ' listened ' to which could have led to the compromising of username / passwords , " he added . ®
Vector Math for 3D Computer Graphics Fourth Revision , July 2009
This is a tutorial on vector algebra and matrix algebra from the viewpoint of computer graphics .
It covers most vector and matrix topics needed to read college - level computer graphics text books .
Most graphics texts cover these subjects in an appendix , but it is often too short .
This tutorial covers the same material at greater length , and with many examples .
A mirror site that contains this material is : Mirror Site
Computer graphics requires more math than is covered here .
The purpose of these notes is to expand on the mathematical appendix included with most graphics books , not to teach the mathematical material in the main text of those books .
Although primarily aimed at university computer science students , this tutorial is useful to any programmer interested in 3D computer graphics or 3D computer game programming .
In spite of their appealing blood - and - gore covers , mass trade books on game programming require the same understanding of vectors and matrices as college text books ( and usually defer these topics to the same skimpy mathematical appendix ) .
This tutorial is useful for more than computer graphics .
Vectors and matrices are used in all scientific and engineering fields , and any other field that uses computers ( are there any that do n't ? )
In many fields , the vocabulary used for vectors and matrices does not match that used in computer graphics .
But the ideas are the same , and reading these notes will take only a slight mental adjustment .
These notes assume that you have studied plane geometry and trigonometry sometime in the past .
Notions such as point , line , plane , and angle should be familiar to you .
Other notions such as sine , cosine , determinant , real number , and the common trig identities should at least be a distant memory .
These pages were designed at 800 by 600 resolution .
They have been ( somewhat ) tested with not - too - old versions of Firefox and Internet Explorer .
Many pages require Javascript , and some pages require Java .
If you lack these ( or are behind a firewall that blocks these ) you will be able to read most pages , but the interactive features will be lost .
Some sections are years old and have been used in class many times ( and hence are " classroom tested " and likely to be technically correct and readable ) .
Other sections are more recent and might fall short of both goals .

The book itself practices what it preaches - it was printed on post - consumer - waste recycled paper using soy - based inks .
And while some of the suggestions are challenging , like getting your family and friends to have simpler , less wasteful gatherings , the book concentrates on more obvious , small tips like skipping bottled water , taking shorter showers , and obeying the speed limit ( gas mileage goes down at speeds over 60 m.p.h. , so keeping speed under control will not only save drivers from being pulled over , but also will save money and the environment ) .
Google Maps has integrated Wikipedia articles and geotagged photos so you can see points of interest and images of any geotagged photo on a Google Map .
The data , accessible through a new More dropdown button next to Traffic , can be toggled on or off by simply ticking the check box .
Once turned on , Wikipedia points of interest show up on the map as a " W " and images show up as small thumbnails .
Clicking either will give you a closer look at the object .
Both tools promise to bring an excellent layer of information to the already impressive Google Maps , and who knows — soon Street View may be overshadowed by a wealth of geotagged pics .

The vast majority of malware is written for wide audience appeal .
The social engineering tactics used to spread any given software package may be quite advanced , and the malware itself may give your average anti-malware suite a case of the collywobbles , but the hooks themselves are usually blunt instruments aimed at a very broad group of people .
Every now and then , however , an enterprising thief decides to break the mold .
In this case , the SANS Internet Storm Center is tracking a highly targeted campaign aimed directly at the CEOs of various companies .
According to the Storm Center , a number of CEOs have received an e-mail claiming to be a federal subpoena requiring that they testify in a particular case .
The e-mail then requests that the targeted CEO click to download the relevant case history .
Amazingly , the link in question leads not to an actual case document , but to a malware - infected CAB file containing a toxic version of acrobat.exe .
Once installed , the bug dials its home command and control server ( currently located in Singapore ) , and steals copies of any security certificates installed on the system .
Antivirus coverage on this particular infection is still weak , but the usual updates should roll in short order since the bug was first picked up a couple of days ago .
The fact that the malware authors went to the trouble of targeting specific people makes the attack vector unusual , but their decision to use a federal subpoena notification as a hook has problems of its own , since e-mail is not considered a valid method for delivering such documents .
The good news is , this Trojan behaves like most any other after installation — once AV scanners are up to date , neutralization should be no problem .
This is n't the first time we 've seen this type of tightly targeted attack .
In July , 2007 , MessageLabs picked up a malware attack specifically aimed at CEOs in the energy sector .
In that case , the attackers went even farther in their attempts to personally target individuals , and sent infected e-mails to the spouses of some of the targets as well as to the execs themselves .
We may see more malware aimed at specific targets as the business continues to commercialize , but the illicit market will have a hard time finding the proper balance between the size of the target group and the amount of effort required to hand - tailor an attack vector towards it .
Hopefully such balance will be a long time coming .
On October 16 , 2006 , 13 - year - old Megan Meier fled from her family 's computer , distraught over the cutting comments of her supposed " friends " on MySpace .
Twenty minutes later , the troubled teen was dead ; she had hung herself in her closet .
The story , widely reported , garnered the girl 's family widespread sympathy on the Internet .
The twist that Lori Drew , a 47 - year - old neighbor and mother of a former friend of Megan's , had allegedly created the fake persona of a 16 - year - old boy to befriend and later torment the girl brought outrage .
Yet , state investigators could not find a law under which Drew could be charged .
More than a year and a half later , federal prosecutors finally have their case .
On Thursday , the US Attorney for the Central District of California announced that Lori Drew , now 49 years old , was indicted on conspiracy and hacking charges .
The indictment charges Drew , a resident of O'Fallon , Missouri , with three counts of unauthorized access by violation of MySpace 's terms of service and one count of conspiracy .
" This adult woman allegedly used the Internet to target a young teenage girl , with horrendous ramifications , " US Attorney Thomas P. O' Brien said in a statement announcing the indictment .
" After a thorough investigation , we have charged Ms. Drew with criminally accessing MySpace and violating rules established to protect young , vulnerable people .
Any adult who uses the Internet or a social gathering website to bully or harass another person , particularly a young teenage girl , needs to realize that their actions can have serious consequences . "
Yet , legal experts argue that charging a person for violating computer - crime statutes because they broke the terms - of - service agreement of an online site could lead to the ability to charge nearly anyone with computer crime .
Using residential broadband for business purposes ?
A violation of the terms of service and , thus , potentially a crime .
Checking sports sites while at work ?
A violation of corporate policy and , thus , potentially a crime .
" ' Hard cases make bad law ' is an axiom in the legal world , " said Mark Rasch , managing director of enterprise - services firm FTI Consulting and a former U.S. prosecutor .
" This is a case where people have seen bad conduct and have said there must be something we can do , but if prosecution of this case is successful , every pseudonym and every minor violation of the terms of service becomes a computer crime . "
According to the indictment , Drew and others allegedly conspired to violate MySpace 's terms of service and intentionally inflict emotional distress on Megan , identified only as MTM in the court documents .
The indictment alleges that Drew obtained a MySpace account under a fictitious name , used the account to garner information from a juvenile , and used that information to torment , humiliate and harass that member -- all violations of the social - networking site 's terms of service .
While the US Attorney 's office refused interview requests , a spokesperson said that the harm done to Megan is key to the case .
Known as a " tortious act , " the legal argument is generally the basis for civil lawsuits , but can be used as the basis of criminal prosecution .
In this case , the tortious act elevates the unauthorized access charges from misdemeanors to felonies , FTI 's Rasch said .
3. MapReduce is not novel
The MapReduce community seems to feel that they have discovered an
entirely new paradigm for processing large data sets .
In
actuality , the techniques employed by MapReduce are more than 20
years old .
The idea of partitioning a large data set into smaller
partitions was first proposed in " Application of Hash to Data Base
Machine and Its Architecture " [ 11 ] as the basis for a new type of
join algorithm .

Microsoft ... have compiled an entire system built upon antifeatures .
This antifeature platform is integrated into their Windows Media software and forms the basis of their Windows Vista operating system , and they are working hard to convince companies like NBC , that Microsoft can be in control of how and when you get to watch television .
As creepy and as ridiculous as it may sound , this is their business strategy , and by getting this control , both the television and movie industry and computer users will be tied to Microsoft software .
Recently , I discussed how Windows Vista Media Center on purpose does not follow your orders under some circumstances .
If certain broadcasters set a special bit in their transmission , the software simply refuses to record the program .
That 's DRM for you .
It 's your computer and your software , but you are not in control .
Following up on this , there are now two timely articles from the FSF ( Free Software Foundation ) that ended up in my RSS reader today .
The first one ( a bit older already ) describes the concept of Antifieatures .
An antifeature is a ' feature ' of the software that the user does n't want , which is actually bad for the user , but that the vendor implemented anyway , often with great effort .
These antifeatures are usually restrictions of various kinds , so that the simpler , non-restricted versions of the same software can be sold for more money .
The user ends up paying for NOT having those features , bizarre as this may sound .
Several examples are listed , such as DRM in media ( which you do n't want , and which is difficult to develop ) .
Some times you can get the version without DRM if you are willing to pay more , for example .
Another case presented in the article is the difference between Windows NT Workstation and NT Server .
The latter had an $ 800 higher price tag , yet the only difference was a setting in a config file , which restricted the number of concurrent TCP connections to 10 in the case of the Workstation ' version ' .
$ 800 for a setting in a config file .
Nice business if you can get it .
An important point here is that generally , open source software cannot have antifeatures .
If there were any antifeatures in the code , someone would just fork , remove the antifeatures and share a version without those ' bugs ' .
Open source vendors therefore typically rely on service based business models , or on proprietary extensions to a free community version - extensions that actually enable additional functionality .
As a consequence , open source business models tend to be more transparent and focused on the customer benefits than proprietary models , which are based on restricting rather than enabling functionality .
The second article then talks about the specific antifeatures in Windows Vista Media Center .
All the things that you as the user end up paying for , but that you really , really do n't want :
It is entirely beyond me why anyone would vountarily install software like this , let alone pay for it ?
The mind boggles ... Do n't let anyone take control away from you over what you do with your own computer and data .
With proprietary software you will never know what happens .
But free software is the antidote to this .

Yet with Mrs. Clinton raising $ 21 million in March compared with Mr. Obama ’s $ 42 million , her advisers said they realized they had tough challenges ahead .
Chief among them , besides paying bills and financing new advertising , was persuading impatient Democratic superdelegates  party leaders and elected officials  to remain neutral in the contest and let the remaining primaries play out through early June .
The Pennsylvania Democrats who cast their ballots in Tuesday ’s primary did so with the economy weighing heavily on their minds , according to surveys of voters leaving polling places .
Those surveys showed that more than half the voters questioned believe that the worsening state of the American economy is the most important issue confronting the country , with about 90 percent saying the United States has already slipped into a recession .
Half of those polled also said that they were looking for a candidate who could bring about change , which has been the main theme of Mr. Obama ’s campaign .
Mr. Obama leads in delegates , but has consistently trailed Mrs. Clinton in polls taken in Pennsylvania , though the gap had been closing in recent days .

About one - quarter of those who participated in the exit polling , conducted by Edison / Mitofsky for five television networks and The Associated Press , endorsed the idea that experience , which Mrs. Clinton has emphasized in her campaign , is the most important quality to be sought in a candidate .
For the polling , the margin of sampling error in the sample of 40 precincts across the state was plus or minus four percentage points .
Both candidates performed strongly among the same constituencies that have supported them in other primary states .
Mr. Obama was backed overwhelmingly by black voters and also scored well among voters younger than 45 and college graduates , the results show .
Geographically , he performed strongest in Philadelphia and its suburbs , which has the largest concentration of population in Pennsylvania , with Mrs. Clinton winning the majority of the vote in the rest of the state .
As an architect of the legendary Talking Heads , David Byrne once offered up an album called More Songs About Buildings and Food .

Starting May 31 , visitors to New York ’s Battery Maritime Building will be able to take part in Byrne ’s interactive music installation called simply " Playing the Building . "
Like its self - explanatory title implies , the Battery will be fitted with devices that will allow visitors to make music off of the piping , pillars and more .
It ’s an interesting way to view the structures we take for granted in everyday life .
According to Byrne , it could be the future of music itself .
" I ’d like to say that in a small way it turns consumers into creative producers , " Byrne explains on his official site , " but that might be a bit too much to claim .
However , even if one does n’t play the thing , it points toward a less mediated kind of cultural experience .
It might be an experience in which one begins to reexamine one ’s surroundings and to realize that culture — of which sound and music are parts — does n’t always have to be produced by professionals and packaged in a consumable form .
" I ’m not suggesting people abandon musical instruments and start playing their cars and apartments , " he adds , " but I do think the reign of music as a commodity made only by professionals might be winding down .
The imminent demise of the large record companies as gatekeepers of the world ’s popular music is a good thing , for the most part . "

Over the next few weeks , hundreds of people will crowd into halls across Britain to see a film that has been grabbing the headlines in the US .
Called The Business of Being Born , it 's a documentary by chatshow host Ricki Lake , about birth and specifically why pregnant women need to reclaim the right to give birth without unnecessary intervention .
In the US , birth rights are pitiful , with home birth banned in 10 states and the caesarean section rate standing at one in three .
Only 8 % of women are able to use midwives , who specialise in natural birth , and instead have to see obstetricians , whose metier is highly interventionist hospital delivery .
The Lake film has led to a campaign in America called The Big Push for Midwives , and the ambition is to enable more women to use the services of a midwife and to overturn a culture in which intervention is overwhelmingly the norm .
Over here , the film 's effect could be equally significant .
It is being screened at venues across the country by the Independent Midwives Association ( IMA ) , and when the lights go up the audience will be urged to bombard the chief executives of their primary care trusts with letters and emails asking for better facilities for home birth .
" We 're at the tipping point , " says midwife Annie Francis of the IMA .
" We 've been fighting for decades for home birth to be available in Britain again and now our moment has come .
Home birth is already on the increase - up from around 1 % 15 years ago to around 3 % today .
And last year a government report , Maternity Matters , said women who want a home birth should be able to get one .
The tide really is turning . "
The campaigners ' main aim is to ensure that the government sticks to its promises .
It is a big turnaround when you consider that for many years it was government policy that all births should happen in hospital .
The Peel Report of 1970 made that its central ambition .
Maternity Matters , in contrast , promises mothers - to - be a " full range of birthing choices " : a home birth , birth with midwife care or birth in the care of a consultant .
And there 's plenty of evidence that where home birth is well supported , it 's popular : areas such as West Somerset and Mid Suffolk , for instance , boast well above average rates ( 14.2 % and 11.6 % respectively ) .
All of which is great news for the grassroots activists who have been fighting for years for a woman 's right to labour upright , without unnecessary machines , in her own home .
Ricki
Lake exemplifies such women , having been inspired to speak out by her own experiences .
In her film , she describes how disempowered she felt as a result of the hi-tech arrival of her first child , and how fired up she was after the birth of her second child at home .
Spreading the gospel that birth could be low - tech and without drugs or machines became what she calls her " passion project " .
Other campaigners have been more modest but equally effective .
Civil servant Michelle Barnes , who organised a conference on this subject last month in her home town of Sheffield , says : " Things changed for me after I had a home birth two years ago .
My first child had been born in hospital after a heavily medicalised labour that led to a caesarean .
I might have had a home birth the first time round if I 'd known anything about it , but I did n't .
After I had a home birth , I wanted to inspire and encourage others who might be interested . "
Her conference brought together 170 people .
" Home birth is already above average here in Sheffield , at around 4 % , and now we 've got a head of steam it 's going to go up and up , " she says .
After her first experience of home birth 10 years ago , Angela Horn set up homebirth.org.uk to debunk the myths about how unsafe home birth was .
The research she summarises on her website includes the 1997 National Birthday Trust report , probably the most comprehensive study of UK home birth to date , which found that it halves the chance of needing an assisted or caesarean delivery and that babies born at home are less likely to need resuscitation .
Another British report found that the perinatal mortality rate in planned home birth was less than half the average for all births .
" In my first pregnancy I started reading the medical research , " says Horn , " expecting to find that home birth provided a more pleasant experience but had a pay - off in terms of higher mortality rates - only to find that there was a growing body of evidence showing that home birth for healthy women was remarkably safe .
After I had my first baby , I felt 10 ft high .
It 's incredible how a good birth can change a woman .
You 've brought new life into the world , and you 've done it yourself rather than , as happens to so many women , finding yourself at the heart of a crisis that you need to be rescued from . "
Horn realised that women who might be interested in a home delivery were often put off by the lack of unbiased research that challenged the status quo - in other words , no one was publicising the studies that challenged the assumption that hospital birth was safest .
" Sure , there will be babies who die at home who would n't have died in hospital , " says Horn , " but the other side of that is there are babies who die in hospital who would n't have died at home - the ones who get MRSA among them .
It 's very difficult to say in absolute terms whether home or hospital is less likely to end with a death , because , thankfully , birth is in general very , very safe in the UK .
But what 's clear is that there 's no big difference between the two . "
Some women have gone into midwifery after becoming passionate about home birth as a result of their own experience .
Annie Francis says her life was changed when she had a hands - off delivery with a breech baby - her first - after being told a caesarean section or assisted delivery were her only options .
" Three babies on , aged 40 , I retrained as a midwife , " she says .
" I thought I could provide one - to - one care through a career with the NHS - but I found that was n't possible because of the way the maternity services are organised , so I became an independent midwife working outside the health service .
" I feel I 've been able to pioneer a model of care that 's truly women - centred , and the exciting thing is that the government is now beginning to recognise that .
The new health and social care bill contains a clause to allow primary care trusts to contract independent midwifery services in , which means that instead of paying £ 2,000 or so for the sort of individual , tailored service I provide , in the future women will be able to get my services on the NHS . "
Other campaigners have been fired into action not by a happy childbirth experience , but by a terrible one .
Mary Newburn , head of policy research at the National Childbirth Trust , decided that conditions for women had to be improved after the hospital delivery of her first baby when she was 18 , three decades ago .
" What happened to me was brutal , " she says .
" I was left all alone , lying on a bed with an oxytocin drip in my arm , which made an already painful labour sheer agony .
I thought I was going to die there ; the horror of it , and the horror that any woman in labour could ever be treated that way , has never left me . "
Afterwards , Newburn dedicated herself to researching childbirth .
She went on to have three happier births , two at home , but it is the fear and isolation she felt during her first delivery that has spurred her on .
For many women who are interested in home birth , the biggest stumbling block up until now has been the absence of someone to talk to who has experienced it .
As the culture shifts hopefully all that will change .
Sounds like that rumor about a new , smaller Xbox 360 coming next year might have a shorter life than a red-ringing console .
Specifying the release of " slimmed down SKU in 2009 " , Microsoft representative let us know today that " While we do n't normally comment on rumors like this , we can tell you that we have no plans to release a new console in 2009 " .
Yep , rumor assassinated , just like that .
Of course , there still exists the possibility that Microsoft 's just playing coy to prevent a little bit of Osborne effect from creeping in during their heated battle with the PS3 -- but they did go out of their way to directly comment on the rumor , so take it as you will .

PARIS April 15 , 2008  --
Shortly after we moved to Paris , my son , Luke , cut his lip in a fall at school .
I rushed him to the emergency room of a suburban Paris hospital , where a nurse asked my name and address and a doctor quickly stitched up his cut .
When I tried to pay , the cashier asked me to call the following week because the " computer is slow . "
A bill eventually arrived in the mail for the equivalent of $ 60 .
The same week I took Luke to have his stitches removed at a clinic where a doctor spent nearly an hour with him first softening a scab on the cut .
This time , the clerk was apologetic as she handed me the bill , explaining she was sure my American health insurance would reimburse some of the cost .
The total bill : $ 7.50 .
As presidential candidates hammer out proposals to deal with the increasing millions of uninsured Americans , I know which health plan I 'll choose : the French one .
The World Health Organization has named the French health care system the best in the world .
( The U.S. ranked 37th ) .
It 's physician - rich , boasting one doctor for approximately every 430 people , compared with a doctor for every 1,230 residents in the U.S. ( and French docs tend to charge significantly less ) .
The average life expectancy is two years longer than the U.S.
And while the system is one of the most expensive in the world , costing $ 3,500 per person , it 's far less than the $ 6,100 spend per capita in the U.S .
I 've had a unique opportunity to see both systems up close and personal : I had breast cancer in California nine years ago and a recurrence in Paris this year .
I received excellent care in both places , though looking back now my California oncologist 's office was a bit of a meat market — always packed with patients , from the seemingly not - so - sick to some a step from the grave — a time - consuming disadvantage of living in a much larger country with a lower doctor - to - patient ratio .
My French doctors and nurses have been sensitive , skillful , caring — and not so harried .
But the biggest difference has been money .
My top - level health insurance paid for most of my U.S. care , but it was often a struggle to shake loose the money .
I was frequently stuck in the middle of disputes between the company and my hospital and doctors over " agreed to fees . "
Continually dunned by the hospital for fees and facing multiple complaining phone calls to my insurance company , I sometimes simply caved in and wrote checks to cover bills that I knew were the insurance company 's responsibility — part of a wearing - down strategy I was convinced was deliberate .
Here in France I have a green carte vitale — literally a " life card " or social security card that provides entree to the system .
It 's funded by worker contributions and other taxes .
My husband ( and our family ) is covered through his work with a French subsidiary of a U.S. company , and so is everyone else ; coverage is universal .
The French are responsible for co-pays , but some 80 % of them have supplemental private insurance to cover the co-pay .
People least able to pay and those with chronic or serious illnesses often have the best coverage .
Because I 'm being treated for cancer , I 'm cent pour cent — 100 % — covered .
The effect of a system where hospitals and doctors do n't worry about getting stiffed by a patient or an insurance company seems to be a far more relaxed , generous system .
When my surgeon discussed breast surgery here , he suggested that I stay in the hospital five days .
" Of course I can do it the American way , kind of an outpatient situation , " he told me , apparently not wanting to sound unsophisticated .
" But I do n't like pain . "
Maternity stays for a normal delivery are a minimum of five days , not the 48 hours mandated by U.S. federal legislation in 1998 after many insurance companies insisted stays be even shorter .
I 've always had health insurance in the U.S.
And yet the few times I 'd had to walk into an American emergency room I 've always felt a thief who seems to be expected to sign over all worldly goods before any medical care can begin , regardless of the state of agony someone might be in .
French doctors address problems immediately and are n't constrained by approvals from some medical decision maker in a distant insurance office .
Years ago , my husband had to wait several hours in Manhattan emergency room as administrators tracked down someone in our out - of - state insurance company who would approve ( and therefore agree to cover the bill for ) antibiotic treatment for a horrifying infection in his face that doctors were concerned could have been flesh - eating strep .
There 's no question you 'll be treated in France .
Everyone is .
The nation pays the bills and the hospitals do n't get stiffed .
It 's an all - encompassing cradle - to - grave system .
My fear now is that I wo n't be able to even get insurance when and if I return to the states , much less be able to afford it .
" The French health care system has a lot of lessons for the U.S. , " said Northern Arizona University Professor Paul V. Dutton , who has studied both extensively for his book " Differential Diagnoses : A Comparative History of Health Care Problems and Solutions in the U.S. and France . "
" There seems to be a feeling that Britain 's socialized health system is the only one we can look at because it 's English , it 's the mother country .
But in fact , the French share many of the same values that American consumers seek , like choice of physician and freedom from insurance company authorization of medical decisions .
The French system is already far more similar to the American ideal , " Dutton said .
Except it works .

TODAY 's Case - Shiller home price index release has inspired a wave of bearish commentary on housing markets , much of it fairly compelling .
But at least one observer sees light at the end of the tunnel , and a surprisingly short tunnel .
Whom , you ask ?
Why , Karl Case , the Case in Case - Shiller .
" I think we 're going to see some signs of life in the next few months , " Case , an economics professor at Wellesley College in Wellesley , Massachusetts , said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio .
" The market is beginning to clear somewhat .
There is some good news in this . "
It seems to me that the chorus of experts pegging the American housing collapse as half over at best has grown in recent weeks , so to see a dissenting opinion from Mr Case is quite interesting .

For all you wannabe dictators , a list of ancient torture and execution devices that you would not want to find yourself in .
Brazen Bull - Designed in Ancient Greece , this device was a hollow bull made entirely of brass .
Criminals were sealed inside .
The bull was then heated up over a fire .
The conductive metal would literally roast the victim alive .
As if that were n't enough , a series of valves in the bull 's snout would muffle the screams of the victim , creating a sound like an angry bull .
Crocodile Shears -
A medieval torture device that consisted of two blades .
When clamped together , the blades formed a tube .
Inside the tube were several sharp spikes .
The crocodile shears were clamped down on an an erect penis and after enough force was exerted , the penis was torn from the body .
Reserved for those who attempted to assasinate members of the royal family .
Instep Borer -
A device of German engineering , that was essentially a metal boot that was worn by the victim .
A crank on the boot dug a blade into the victim 's instep .
Iron Maiden -
An awesome metal band that when listened to would literally " rock your socks off " .
Not exactly a good torture , but the cause of many lost socks .
Scavenger 's Daughter - Using the opposite principle of the boring - old - stretching rack , this device compressed the victim .
Shaped like an " A " the victim was strapped to the device and the head was swung down to the knees causing blood to pour out of the ears and nose .
Shrew 's Fiddle - Used against woman caught nagging and bickering .
This version of a yoke , strapped around the woman 's neck , the hands both locked in in front of her face .
Primarily used to parade the woman throughout town .
Spanish Tickler -
Not to be confused with the French Tickler , this claw - like device strapped to the torturer 's hand and tore strips of flesh from the victim .
Vega from Street Fighter wore a version of the Spanish Tickler , which made him look like a " vicious gay man " .
Wooden Horse -
This saw - horse shaped device had a pointed edge across that top .
The victim was forced to " ride the horse " putting full body weight on the genitals .
Used on both men and women .
Current Healthcare Situation
Healthcare in the U.S. is far from equilibrium , with hyper - inflated costs in response to insane insurance costs .
This causes healthcare to be unattainable by most lower class and an increasing number of middle class families .
Healthcare should be an inalienable right but people avoid visiting the doctor because to them , the impending financial situation is worse than health risks .
Still , the U.S. ’s healthcare system is one of the best in the world in terms of quality and speed .
The looming threat of being sued helps keep us safe though it ’s grown so large from being unchecked that it ’s too costly for both parties : the healthcare providers and the patients .
Insurance Issues
A free market is a market in which prices of goods and services are arranged completely by the mutual consent of sellers and buyers .
By definition , in a free market environment buyers and sellers do not coerce or mislead each other nor are they coerced by a third party .
— Wikipedia
Healthcare is another story .
Insurance companies are the “ third party ” behind both sides , the buyers ( patients ) and the sellers ( healthcare providers ) , and are not working for the “ mutual consent of buyers and sellers . ”
Furthermore , most healthcare is not actually paid for by the patients directly , but instead by patients ’ employers who are , by law , not allowed to know about the employees ’ health issues .
This dichotomy is what has enabled healthcare costs to grow so wildly out of control .
Google Health ’s Fix
Eric Schmidt ’s keynote speech at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society Conference directly addressed what Google sees as “ the problem ” with U.S. healthcare and how Google could help fix it .
In short , put information in the hands of patients to enable informed buying decisions and to rebuild the “ mutual consent . ”
Currently , when a patient needs a medical procedure , say a surgery , they do n’t shop around for the best price .
The patient goes where their insurance company tells them ;
Where the insurance company has business affiliations .
So informing patients will theoretically break the “ employer / insurance payment ” dichotomy , disarming the “ third party coercers . ”
Other benefits of Google Health are clear from a computer science standpoint .
Technically it will serve three purposes :
Cloud storage —
Let the IT professionals deal with data backup and retrieval instead of local medical staff .
— Let the IT professionals deal with data backup and retrieval instead of local medical staff .
Information channel — Directly connect patient information to patients and healthcare provider .
— Directly connect patient information to patients and healthcare provider .
Privacy —
Take sensitive information out of the clear - text paper world of office workers and into the human - free , automated , and encrypted world of cloud computing .
Privacy Issues
Clearly potential Google Health uses will have privacy concerns regarding Google obtaining access to medical records as well as having records available online .
IT specialism in general has some clear benefits over the paper trail world :
Reduce human interaction —
When paper information is being sent around , it passes though many hands in clear text .
Most hands are simply staff members intended to help organize office work and should not have access to the sensitive content .
Computerized health record retrieval and storage would minimize and automate the amount of human interaction needed , reducing the amount of human mistakes as well as accidental ( or intentional ) security leaks .
Catch Me If You Can illustrates the 1960s banking industry ’s similar situation to today ’s healthcare industry .
Today , all banking is computerized and online .
Paper trail security is a myth .
For example , George Clooney recently had his hospital records leaked to the press and something like 27 employees were facing repercussions .
There were probably many more people that had seen his records as well .

Google already knows everything about us —
Between searching and emails , Google knows what its users are thinking .
They are data mining experts and easily have the ability to learn about most users ’ health issues already .
There is no hiding form large corporations and laws are in place to protect against intentional misuse of healthcare information .

Breaking into an office is easier than hacking into Google —
Hacking requires a much higher level of knowledge and is many times more traceable than breaking into an office .
If employers wanted access to medical records , it would be safer for them to stage a break - in physically rather than virtually .
Local offices also store records in computers and probably gave access to IT consultants as well .
Google Health gives the IT side some accountability .

Companies are companies —
Whether it ’s a hospital or an IT company , it ’s still private firms charged with keeping our data private .
The office paper trails will probably be around for quite some time but Google is providing a layer beneath it : secure storage , access , and transfer for medical records .
From a technical standpoint , our data only stands to be more secure and the small risk of this being false is worth it for what we stand to gain :
The free market that was intended by the private healthcare design .
Informing patients means educated and mutual consent on healthcare costs .

Churchill once said “ The Germans are either at your throat or at your feet . ”
( He actually said “ The Hun is either at your throat or at your feet , ” but ( a ) some folks might not know “ Hun ” was a common epithet for “ German ” , and ( b ) no need to use old insults , even though this post will hardly be kind to the current German leadership . )
At present , Germany is firmly planted at Russia ’s feet , doing its bidding at the NATO meetings by opposing Ukraine ’s and Georgia ’s Membership Action Plans ( MAPs ) .
The German arguments are disingenuous at best .
Moreover , as this article by Klaus - Helge Donath ( translated on Robert Amsterdam ’s blog ) says , Gemany ’s prokynesis will earn it nothing but scorn from the Kremlin :
Behind the Kremlin walls officials are smirking over German Foreign Minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier ’s appeasement .
That ’s why Moscow also does not take the European Union and Berlin seriously .
The way Russians understand things making concessions , approaching the rival is a sign of weakness and European softness .
. .
Even if Russia talks about a “ multi- polar world order and “ respect ” in the international arena that applies exclusively to the respect of others for Russia , not the other way around .
Why does Germany grovel ?
Gas , gas , and gas .
Did I mention gas ?
But is appeasement on NATO enlargement an effective way of obtaining future Russian forebearance on gas pricing , access , or shutoffs ?
Will its carrying Putin ’s water ensure Russia ’s future goodwill and the steady , reliable flow of gas at reasonably competitive prices ?
Not bloody likely .
Russia will take Germany ’s gift today , and do exactly what is in its economic and political interest tomorrow .
So Germany has sold out NATO , stiffed Ukraine and Georgia , and handed Russia a victory , and will be lucky to get a mess of pottage–or borscht–in return .
And the Kremlin will figure it rolled Germany once , so it might as well try it again .
And again .
And again .
Donath also makes a point I ’ve emphasized at SWP ; Russia ’s fears about NATO ’s military threat are fantastical .
( Stephen Blank has made a similar point . )
( One can debate whether they are the result of paranoid delusions , or whether the expressed fears are merely intended to manipulate Russian public opinion . )
So why does Russia protest so much ?
If NATO expansion does not threaten Russian territory in the slightest , it does sharply constrain Russian freedom of action in Ukraine and Georgia .
That is , Russia does not oppose NATO expansion because it legitimately fears that this would threaten the territorial integrity or political independence of Russia ; instead it fears NATO expansion because that jeopardizes Russia ’s ability to threaten the territorial integrity and political independence of the countries in the near abroad , Ukraine prominent among them .
Russia portrays NATO as aggressively absorbing new states .
Its characterization of NATO is analogous to Sparta ’s description of the Athenian empire .
But NATO does not collect tribute from its members under the threat of force .
Georgia , and to a lesser degree Ukraine want to join .
Earlier joiners from the old East Bloc–such as the Baltic states , the Czech Republic , Bulgaria , and Romania–also wanted to join .
They volunteered–and in some cases clamored –to join NATO .
NATO did not force them to join .
This should raise the question in Russian minds : why are our former satellites so eager to join what we consider an aggressive alliance ?
Perhaps the answer lay in centuries of history and very long memories of suffering–and at times , suffering quite cruelly –under Russian domination .
The irony of the situation is that current Russian behavior only reinforces the desire of Eastern European states to deepen their NATO ties , and for Ukraine and Georgia to enter the alliance .
The Russians have apparently not learned that ( as my grandfather used to say ) you catch more flies with sugar than gall .
Blustering , bullying , manipulating , supporting breakway provinces , using gas as a political weapon , poisoning presidential candidates etc. , is no way to win friends and influence people .
But that ’s the kind of things the Russians have done consistently in the near abroad , and continue to do today .
Like an abusive husband driven to rage by his wife ’s attempt to leave home , the chekists ’ thuggery only further alienates those it wants to control .
This reflects an attitude that noted American scholar of Russia , James Billington , describes in his book Russia in Search of Itself :
Seeking to preserve unity and maintain control over a vast and exposed territory , the Russian empire was frequently at war with its neighbors .
The Russian ’s basic understanding of all this recurrent conflict has been diametrically opposite to that of their principal neighbors .
Russians have generally seen themselves as perpetual victims of foreign predators , building on the fact that rival empires have invaded their lands from the Mongols and Teutonic Knights to Napoleon and Hitler .
Most of Russia ’s immediate neighbors however have seen themselves as victims threatened with conquest by the relentless expansion of a much larger power armed with unlimited ideological justification for extending its empire .
The eagerness of former satellites to join NATO provides ample evidence that Russia is still perceived as an aggressive power .
Russia ’s actions only justify this perception .
To turn around Putin ’s insult of the US , the Russian wolf is just doing what wolves do .
Its behavior is of a piece with its actions over centuries .
The sad thing is that Germany enables this behavior , and like most codependents , will gain nothing for its current humiliation but more humiliation in the future .
Do Tax Cuts Cost the Government Money ?
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
Whenever tax cuts are discussed in Washington , the media and most politicians use the phrase , cost to government . 
 How much will this tax cut cost the government ? we are asked , as though some crime is being contemplated when we consider reducing taxes .
The American people have every right to fund the federal government at whatever level they deem acceptable , and if they choose — through their elected representatives — to reduce that funding level , they are not somehow injuring the government .
If Congresses passes a new law that results in you paying $ 1000 less in taxes next year , have you taken something from the government that rightfully belongs to it ?
Or has the government simply taken less from you ?
You do n’t cost the government money , the government costs you money !
Of course it ’s reasonable to demand that politicians cut spending when they cut taxes .
That ’s the definition of real fiscal conservatism : government should not take too much from the private economy in taxes , but neither should it spend too much and run up deficits .
That ’s why I vote against the wasteful appropriations bills that relentlessly increase federal spending year after year .
I reject the notion that tax cuts harm the economy .
The economy suffers when government takes money from your paycheck that you otherwise would spend , save , or invest .
Taxes never create prosperity .
Private - sector innovation and productivity are the engines that drive our economy , regardless of what politicians tell us .
Tax reduction is my first priority in Congress .
The reality is that most working Americans lose about half of their incomes to federal , state , and local taxes .
 Tax Freedom Day ,  representing the portion of the year you must work to pay for government at all levels , is roughly June 1st for most Americans .
Imagine all of your hard work this year between January and the end of May going to the government !
One tax in particular should be eliminated as soon as possible — the tax on Social Security benefits .
Those benefits were never taxed between the 1930s and 1984 .
Treating them as taxable income represents nothing more than a trick to reduce Social Security benefits by stealth .
I supported legislation that successfully repealed a 1993 tax increase on benefits , and my own bill , HR 180 , would go further and eliminate all taxes on Social Security .
Our seniors paid taxes throughout their working lives to fund the Social Security system , and it is immoral to tax them again on their benefits .
Various other taxes also must be reduced .
Capital gains taxes are terribly counterproductive , punishing those who save and invest .
Payroll taxes impose a tremendous compliance burden on businesses , especially smaller entrepreneurs who cannot hire an accounting department .
Federal gas taxes should be slashed to provide taxpayers relief at the pump .
Most importantly , federal spending must be dramatically reduced so that all Americans can go back to working for themselves instead of working to pay their taxes .

Hillary :
No intention of running for president
Memoir due out Monday
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Former first lady Hillary Clinton says she has no plans to launch a bid to become the country 's first woman president in the next two elections .
It has often been speculated the former first lady would make a bid for the White House , but in two interviews Sunday , she said she had " no intention " to run for president in 2008 -- and would turn down invitations to run in 2004 .
Clinton said she is enjoying her current political role as a senator for New York .
" I do n't have any intentions or plans for running , " Clinton told ABC 's Barbara Walters .
" I 'm flattered the question gets asked .
I hope that it will lead to a woman running for president . "
Asked what she would say if Democrats asked her to run in 2004 , she said , " Absolutely , I would say no . "
Clinton told Time magazine , in an interview published Sunday , that she intends to run for re-election as senator in 2006 .
AOL - Time Warner is the parent company of CNN.com .
Hillary Clinton 's interviews came on the eve of the release of her memoir , " Living History , " in which she discusses everything from Bill Clinton 's sex scandals to her childhood in Illinois .
" Living History " hits bookstores Monday , and the former first lady - turned - U.S. senator will kick off a book - signing tour in New York City .
" I am a private person , and it was difficult to write the book , but I wanted to give a complete account of my eight years in the White House with my husband , " Clinton , 55 , said in an interview Wednesday aired by NY1 .
She promised that the book would cover the " very many high points and good times as well as the more difficult ones . "
Already , " Living History " has drummed up considerable interest in political circles , thanks largely to leaks of extracts , reported by The Associated Press , in which Clinton talks about her sense of betrayal and hurt over President Clinton 's affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky .
The publisher , Simon & Schuster , has ordered 1 million copies for its first printing , an unusually high number for a work of political nonfiction .
Clinton was paid a $ 2.85 million advance on the book , part of an $ 8 million deal .
Critics and fans
The buildup to the book 's release has prompted a new look at Clinton 's role in the public limelight , her political ambitions , her marriage and her policies .
That review comes complete with a disharmonious chorus of supporters who see her as a modern role model for women , and detractors who see a power - hungry and manipulative politician .
" The fact is she comes into public life during a time of change , " said Ann Lewis , White House communications director during the Clinton administration .
" She speaks openly about issues and the interests she has in them . "
Her style , Lewis said on CNN's " Crossfire , " elicited strong responses .
" People reacted to it differently , " Lewis said .
That may be an understatement .
On radio talk shows and news programs , discussions of Clinton and her book were often visceral and heated , a reminder that the former first lady remains a divisive figure .
" I think she is power - hungry , " said Sandy Rios , president of Concerned Women for America , a conservative public policy organization .
" I do n't think it 's a healthy emotion ... that Hillary brings to the stage . "
Said Victoria Jones , a radio talk show host in the nation 's capital and a Clinton supporter : " She has presence .
She has leadership .
She just has to blink and the press comes running . "
The book figures to revisit familiar terrain : Clinton 's botched effort at reforming health care , controversies over Whitewater and her stock investments , the suicide of White House aide Vince Foster , her many travels abroad in which she promoted the rights of women and children , her successful efforts as a Democratic fund - raiser , and , of course , her sometimes enigmatic marriage to Bill Clinton .
What does Clinton hope people will take away from her book ?
" I hope that they will , you know , get a better understanding of , you know , my background , my beliefs and certainly then , I think , people will be able to make judgments based on the entirety of the book , " she said .

As kids , most of us spent time laying in the grass , watching clouds roll by and imagining the shapes we could see in the fluffy white masses .
Now , one company aims to indulge those flights of fancy by actually making " clouds " in the shapes of , well , anything , from the Atlanta Braves ' tomahawk to Mickey Mouse 's iconic head .
These clouds are actually a mixture of soap - based foams and lighter - than - air gases such as helium , something like what you 'd get if you married helium balloons with the solutions that kids use to blow bubbles from plastic wands .
The company uses re-purposed artificial snow machines to generate the floating ads and messages , dubbed Flogos .
The machines can pop one Flogo out every 15 seconds , flooding the air with foamy peace signs or whatever shape a client desires .
Renting the machine for a day starts out at a cost of about $ 2,500 .
Designers use computer software to make a stencil that when placed into the snow machine , " cuts the foam in the exact right shape , " said Flogo inventor Francisco Guerra .
The Flogos are about two feet long and nearly a foot wide , and generally last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour , depending on conditions in the atmosphere , according to the company .
" They will fly for miles , " Guerra said .
" They are durable so they last a while . "
They generally bob to heights of 300 to 500 feet ( 90 to 150 meters ) , the inventors say , though they can rise up to 20,000 feet ( 6,100 meters ) in the air .
Guerra says that Flogos are environmentally friendly as the soaps that make up the foamy shapes are derived from plants , and that eventually a Flogo " just evaporates in the air . "
" It does not pollute the skies , " he told LiveScience .
Guerra also says the floating ads are not a danger to airplanes , because flying through one is " like going through a cloud . "
Nothing from the Flogo sticks to the surface of a plane , even if it goes through the aircraft 's jet engine , he said .

Three prominent academic publishers are suing Georgia State University , contending that the school is violating copyright laws by providing course reading material to students in digital format without seeking permission from the publishers or paying licensing fees .
In a complaint filed Tuesday in United States District Court in Atlanta , the publishers  Cambridge University Press , Oxford University Press and Sage Publications  sued four university officials , asserting “ systematic , widespread and unauthorized copying and distribution of a vast amount of copyrighted works ” by Georgia State , which the university distributes through its
Web site .
The lawsuit , which may be the first of its kind , raises questions about digital rights , which are confronting many media companies , but also about core issues like the future of the business model for academic publishers .
Indeed , as the printed word is put in digital form , holding onto rights seems to many like climbing up the slippery sides of a glass .
The case centers on so - called course packs , compilations of reading materials from various books and journals .
The lawsuit contends that in many cases , professors are providing students with multiple chapters of a given work , in violation of the " fair use " provision of copyright law .
The publishers are seeking an order that the defendants secure permissions and pay licensing fees to the copyright owners .
It 's hardly the only one working on making lithium - ion batteries a little less likely to blow up in your face , but the prolific folks at Fraunhofer Institute seem to think that they 've come up with a solid contender for your future laptop or cellphone , and they 're now set to take the wraps off it at the Hannover Messe conference later this month .
The key to their solution , it seems , is the use of a non-flammable polymer electrolyte instead of the liquid electrolyte now commonly used in lithium - ion batteries .
While that switch cuts down on the explosiveness , it also introduced a fair number of challenges , not the least of which is the fact that polymer becomes less conductive as it gets more solid .
Fraunhofer 's apparently made some significant progress on that front , however , and while they 're still not completely satisfied with the conductivity , they say the batteries could be ready for commercial use in three to five years .
They also , not surprisingly , see no end to the uses for 'em , saying that they could not only wind up in laptops and cellphones , but power tools , lawnmowers , and potentially even cars .

Copies of The Profit , a 2001 film blocked from distribution in the United States due to a court injunction won by the Church of Scientology , appeared on the Internet Friday on peer - to - peer file - sharing websites and on the video sharing site YouTube .
Directed by former film executive Peter N. Alexander , the movie has been characterized by critics as a parody of Scientology and of its founder L. Ron Hubbard .
Alexander was a Scientologist for twenty years , and left the organization in 1997 .
The film was funded by Bob Minton , a former critic of Scientology who later signed an agreement with the Church of Scientology and has attempted to stop distribution of the film .
Alexander has stated that the movie is based on his research into cults , and when asked by the St. Petersburg Times about parallels to Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard said : " I 'll let you draw that conclusion ... I say it 's entirely fictional . "
The film was released in August 2001 , and was shown at a movie theatre in Clearwater , Florida and at a premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in France .
A Scientology spokesman gave a statement at the time saying " the movie is fiction and has nothing to do with Scientology " .
The Church of Scientology later took legal action in an attempt to stop further distribution of the film .
The Church of Scientology claimed that the film was intended to influence the jury pool in the wrongful death case of Scientologist Lisa McPherson , who died under Scientology care in Clearwater , Florida .
In April 2002 , a Pinellas County , Florida judge issued a court order enjoining The Profit from worldwide distribution for an indefinite period .
According to the original court injunction received by Wikinews , the movie was originally banned because the court found that it could be seen as a parody of Scientology .
In his April 20 , 2002 ruling on the injunction , Judge Robert E. Beach of the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court in Pinellas County , Florida wrote : " ... an average person viewing the film entitled The Profit could perceive that it is a parody of the Church of Scientology " .
" To the extent that any person considered as a potential juror in evaluating any issues involving the Church of Scientology , the process of voir dire provides a fair and complete remedy to eliminate any potential juror that may possibly have been influenced to be less than fair and impartial , " added Beach .
Luke Lirot , the attorney for the film 's production company , announced on the film 's website on April 7 , 2007 that " We have absolutely no exposure for any repercussions from the court order , " but that the film was still blocked from distribution due to an ongoing legal battle .
Lirot wrote : " all that 's stopping the release of the movie is the legal battle with the partner who was compromised by Scientology ( Robert Minton ) and is currently using his power as partner to stop the release of the film . "
In an October 2007 article , The Times described the film as " banned in the US because of a lawsuit taken out against it by The Church of Scientology , " and Russ Kick 's The Disinformation Book of Lists included the film in his " List of 16 Movies Banned in the U.S. " .
An 8 - minute teaser segment from The Profit appeared on the film 's website and on the video sharing site YouTube in February 2008 , and an attorney representing Bob Minton sent a letter to Luke Lirot requesting that the film clip be taken down .
In a response letter , Lirot wrote that " Rather than damage any asset of the LLC , the short clip merely keeps the film in the public eye , and in a positive way . "
On Friday , copies of the film began to circulate on peer - to - peer file - sharing websites and on YouTube .
A link related to the film 's appearance on the Internet on the community - based link aggregator website Digg.com had 3,638 " Diggs " - and hit the front page of the site 's Entertainment section on Saturday .
I had nothing to do with this release at all .
But I 'm happy it 's out there .
— Mark Bunker
On Saturday , Scientology critic and Emmy award - winning journalist Mark Bunker put a streaming version of the film on his website , www.xenutv.com, and encouraged others to watch and discuss the film on a real - time chat channel .
In a video posting to YouTube Saturday , Bunker said " I did not do it .
I had nothing to do with it ... I had nothing to do with this release at all .
But I 'm happy it 's out there ... people are finally having a chance to see it .
A lot of people have been curious over the years and there 's been a lot of interest in seeing the film , so finally you can . "
We have all wanted to see this movie that scientology kept hidden away from us .
We have all wondered just how damning could this story be that we were banned from watching it .
— Blogsreel
On the newsgroup alt.religion .
scientology , a poster by the username " Alexia Death " commented on the film 's appearance on the Internet in the context of censorship : " It is out !
And so it is a WIN if many people review it even if they say it SUCKS ! ...
Being bad is no cause to allow censorship ...
And being censored is no cause to assume its good " .
A post to the blog Blogsreel commented : " We have all wanted to see this movie that scientology kept hidden away from us .
We have all wondered just how damning could this story be that we were banned from watching it . "
In a post on Sunday to the message board attached to the official website for the film , attorney Luke Lirot asked that individuals stop distributing copies of The Profit over the Internet .
Lirot wrote : " It has been brought to my attention that several unauthorized transmissions and downloads of this protected work have taken place over the last 72 hours .
Such actions are copyright violations and are unlawful .
I request that any further distribution and / or dissemination of this important work cease immediately and any copies of the work that have been downloaded please be deleted . "
In his statement , Lirot recognized the rights of individuals under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , but also said that unauthorized distribution of the film " will only serve to harm the goal of vast distribution " .
Blog postings have attributed the film 's appearance on the Internet as part of the anti-Scientology movement Project Chanology organized by the Internet - based group Anonymous , but this has not been confirmed .
Wikinews previously reported on international protests against Scientology which took place as part of Project Chanology on February 10 and March 15 .
A third international protest by Anonymous is scheduled for April 12 .
Titled " Operation Reconnect " , the third international protest will focus on highlighting Scientology 's practice of disconnection .

But , if it's the Democrat ( let 's say Obama , for the sake of argument ) , then I do n't believe they will wait .
They know that Obama has no intention of striking Iran .
Therefore , they will launch that strike between Nov. 4th and Jan. 20th .
But , maybe I 'm just paranoid .
Is everyone willing to risk that , though ?
As Descartes once said , " I thought not . "
Okay , maybe it was someone else .

Russia will likely side with Iran , as will most of the Middle East , and possibly so will China .
But , even if China stays neutral , we are in a mess .
This mess could be the " disaster " that allows Shrub and his band of scary men to suspend leaving office , but I do n't think they 'll do that .
They 'll just leave Obama a mess from which he 's likely to not escape .
Certainly , it would put a serious crimp in his ability to deal with other things -- like Healthcare , Renewable Energy , Education , NAFTA the Economy or putting Dick / Shrub in jail .
He 'd have to declare a cease fire , on our part , and thus immediatly become tagged with our first surrender .
So , there 's only two solutions which could stop this nightmare scenario .
One is Impeachment .
This would have been preferrable but Pelosi has successfully blocked it .
Option two might not be legal , but I 'd like to explore it .
Is there a law that The Oval Office must change hands on January 20th ?
Can it be done on November 5th , without a big ceremony ?
Is that legal ?
If so , then I would propose we make that happen .
Due to uncertainty of this Administration 's good faith , disrespect for voter 's desires , and lack of Constitutional concern it might be a good idea to remove them as soon as the President Elect is known .
Even if that 's McLame .
That 's my idea .
Now for the discussion .

US student held in solitary confinement on terrorism charges
By Tom Eley
24 April 2008
In a chilling example of the expanding prosecution of individuals on trumped - up charges of “ terrorism , ” Syed Hashmi , a 27 - year - old US citizen and former student at Brooklyn College in New York City and at London Metropolitan University , is being held in solitary confinement in a federal prison on trumped - up charges of providing material support to Al Qaida .
He could face as much as 70 years in prison .
In June 2006 , Hashmi was arrested by British security personnel at Heathrow Airport , where he was waiting for a flight to Pakistan where he was to visit relatives .
Eleven months later , Hashmi was extradited to the US , where he was placed in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan under conditions of extreme isolation .
Hashmi grew up in a Pakistani - American family living in Queens , New York City .
He majored in political science at Brooklyn College , graduating in 2003 .
He then studied international relations at London Metropolitan University , earning a Masters Degree in 2005 .
The evidence against Hashmi is based on the plea bargain of Mohammed Junaid Babar , another US citizen arrested on five counts of aiding Al Qaida .
In exchange for testimony against Hashmi and other cases pending in Canada and the UK , Babar stands to receive a substantially reduced sentence .
According to Babar , he stayed at Hashmi ’s London apartment in 2004 en route to Pakistan to deliver items such as raincoats and waterproof socks to an Al Qaida representative .
He claimed that Hashmi served as a conduit in this alleged pipeline of non-lethal material , by virtue of the fact that Babar kept the items in the student ’s apartment .
Hashmi is also accused of allowing Babar to use his cellular phone .
While the offenses Hashmi is alleged to have committed occurred in Britain , he became the first person ever extradited by the British government to the US on terrorism charges , while never being charged in Britain itself .
Under US law , any American citizen accused of aiding terrorism abroad may be charged in the US .
The extradition strongly suggests that British authorities did not believe the evidence strong enough to support a prosecution there .
Hashmi’s former professors at Brooklyn College have recently circulated a “ statement of concern ” via e-mail .
According to Jeanne Theoharis , Hashmi ’s senior thesis advisor , “ the statement makes no presumption about Syed ’s guilt or innocence but focuses on the constitutional issues raised by his case and the ways his civil rights and liberties have been abridged . ”
Theoharis intends to present the petition to members of Congress , the Justice Department , and the media .
Hashmi faces severe isolation in prison , conditions imposed by the office of the US Attorney General under its so - called “ special administrative measures ” or “ SAMs . ”
Theoharis described these medieval regulations :
“ Hashmi must be held in solitary confinement and may not communicate with anyone inside the prison other than prison officials .
Family visits are limited to one person every other week for one and a half hours and cannot involve physical contact .
While his correspondence to members of Congress and other government officials is not restricted , he may write only one letter ( of no more than three pieces of paper ) per week to one family member .
He may not communicate , either directly or through his attorneys , with the news media .
He may read only designated portions of newspapers — and not until thirty days after their publication — and his access to other reading material is restricted .
He may not listen to or watch news - oriented radio stations and television channels .
He may not participate in group prayer .
He is subject to 24 - hour electronic monitoring and 23 - hour lockdown , has no access to fresh air , and must take his one hour of daily recreation — when it is given — inside a cage .
“ Other factors compromise Hashmi ’s right to a fair trial : the government may withhold evidence from his attorneys yet share that evidence with the judge ; the government may share evidence with his attorneys but not allow Hashmi to see it [...] and the conditions of Hashmi ’s detention may impair his mental state and ability to testify on his own behalf . ”
Additionally , Hashmi ’s attorneys have been required to submit to invasive personal interrogations in order to communicate with their client .
Among other things , the lawyers are required to reveal their psychiatric and drug use history over the past ten years .
Hashmi’s lead attorney , Sean Maher , has protested these requirements , arguing that they lay the basis for creating a separate class of government - approved terrorism defense attorneys .
Were the government ’s case against Hashmi based solely on the limited accusations and threadbare evidence exacted from Babar ’s plea deal , this would already demonstrate the despotic and quasi-legal character of arrests , prosecutions , and punishment in the so - called “ war on terror . ”
But additional evidence seems to suggest that Hashmi has been singled out for his political activity as a student .
Theoharis has pointed out that Hashmi had written his senior thesis “ on the treatment of Muslim groups in the United States post - 9/11 . ”
As a student at Brooklyn College , Hashmi was also a member of a student group called Al Muhajiroun , which may have been related to an Islamic fundamentalist movement of the same name operating out of Britain .
Babar , who has now turned state ’s witness against Hashmi , once spoke as guest lecturer at one of Hashmi ’s student organization events .
Hashmi’s case has been virtually ignored by the US and British media after a few celebratory accounts of his 2004 arrest .
The case of Syed Hashmi serve as a stark that the “ war on terror ” — which both Democrats and Republicans promise will continue indefinitely — can be increasingly used for the suppression of American students and political opposition at home .

May 17 , 2008 , 10:27 PM *** In recent years the fabulously wealthy Moon has not been playing up his Unification Church with its mass weddings as he did in earlier years , or his role as the Messiah .
Lately he 's been presenting himself as a world peacemaker , staging conferences and " summits " around the globe under the auspices of a group called Universal Peace Federation .
The group held a " summit " in Washington April 28 to May 2 , featuring a number of former high government officials from Latin America and Spain , as well as a representative from the U.S. State Department .
The event also included a " field trip " in which conference participants loaded onto a chartered jumbo jet for a session at the Bush Library featuring both Bush and Moon .
Although a few blogs picked up the story , no newspaper or television station this side of Paraguay did .
So we have no record of what Bush said , but the Universal Peace Federation Web site ( www.upf.org) provides Moon 's remarks .
Here 's a teaser for you :
When it comes to PEPFAR , is Speaker Nancy Pelosi better for women and girls , or is President Bush 's Global AIDS Coordinator , Dr. Mark Dybul ?
The Democratic Majority seems to be ignoring the pleas of public health experts .
This presidential primary season is serving as a national teach - in on race and gender issues as America confronts , once again , its history of struggling with the notion that all of us are created equal .
The hope of many progressives is that by electing more women and people of color to higher offices , our government will better reflect the sensibilities of the diverse nation we are .
So it is disappointing when a staff member of Speaker Nancy Pelosi , discussing the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) , compares the bill now before Congress to the recently passed economic stimulus package .
PEPFAR has the potential to save millions of lives , the economic stimulus package is intended for American consumers to go buy new gadgets .
Public health experts and economists have their doubts about both efforts , due to politics as usual .
The comparison intended by the Pelosi staffer is that PEPFAR , like the stimulus package , will be marked - up , compromised , voted on and passed before any real debate occurs .
According to sexual and reproductive health advocates who heard the comment , the comparison indicated that while their concerns about the bill had been noted , nothing would change .
Assuming the staff member reflects the Speaker 's views on PEPFAR , it appears she is more interested in passing a bill quickly than making sure PEPFAR achieves its goals .
Recent action in the House Foreign Affairs Committee , which compromised vital aspects of the bill before mark - up , is more evidence of the Speaker 's plan to rush PEPFAR .
This is particularly upsetting given changes to early drafts of PEPFAR that have been compromised by the Democrats , jeopardizing the lives of millions of women and girls .

Compare the attitude of the Speaker 's office to that of Ambassador Mark Dybul , M.D. , U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator , as expressed in a letter to the International Planned Parenthood Federation in 2006 .
The letter clarified PEPFAR 's complex ideological restrictions ( three years after it first passed ) :
President Bush has stated that the conditions of the Mexico City Policy " shall not apply to foreign assistance furnished pursuant to [ PEPFAR ] . "
Accordingly , all U.S. Government funding solely for HIV / AIDS activities is exempt from the Mexico City Policy .
But the new Democratic Majority 's compromise plan , implemented by the staff of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , applies the Mexico City Policy , also known as the Global Gag Rule , to PEPFAR .
PEPFAR has nothing to do with abortion , which is what the Global Gag Rule deals with .
Democrats did not remove onerous ideological restrictions , they added another one , and on abstinence - only shifted one set of confusing rules to another , just to placate social conservatives .
Amb .
Dybul 's 2006 letter continues ,
… there are numerous reasons why the linkages between voluntary family - planning and HIV prevention and care are important , particularly as we reach out to women who are vulnerable and can face tremendous stigma and barriers in accessing care .
Programs supported by the U.S. Government to prevent mother - to - child transmission include linkages with voluntary family planning to ensure quality care , with goals that include prevention of unintended pregnancy among HIV - positive women , in keeping with the World Health Organization guidelines .
Evidence also shows that , particularly in high - HIV prevalence settings , voluntary family planning and antenatal care clinics can be important venues for reaching women with HIV prevention , treatment , counseling and testing , and other interventions or referrals .
We have made our staff aware that voluntary family - planning clinics and programs are an important HIV / AIDS care delivery point , and play a key role in reducing morbidity and mortality from HIV / AIDS .
But the Democratic Majority 's plan , being marked up in the Senate next week and scheduled for a House vote soon , missed the opportunity to apply World Health Organization guidelines with respect to women and girls .
Their plan to pass the bill quickly , just like the economic stimulus package , ignored the advice of the Institute of Medicine , Government Accounting Office and Center for Public Integrity that suggested PEPFAR should be streamlined , its ideological restrictions removed , to help more people .
Letters now in circulation from researchers , sexual and reproductive health advocates , public health experts and people who have been on the ground working to implement PEPFAR with its existing ideological restrictions , urge Congress to take a different path .
From one letter ,
… 75 percent of persons living with HIV still lack access to anti-retroviral therapies ( ARVs ) needed to ensure they can live long and productive lives .
However , there are also seven new infections for every person accessing treatment .
Today , we have the benefit of five years of lessons learned and of a strong and growing body of evidence that underscores an immutable fact :
We cannot end the global AIDS epidemic without concurrent and dramatically increased support for robust , evidence - based prevention strategies .
To achieve our goals , the US must put evidence ahead of ideology in its effort to reauthorize PEPFAR , ensuring the maximum benefit from the resources invested .
Political expediency — avoiding a fight with a dwindling minority of social conservatives — seems more important to Democrats than making sure PEPFAR works .
Political expediency seems more important than efficiently distributing the generous $ 50 billion to NGO 's working in Africa , with less bureaucracy so they can focus on their life - saving work .
From another letter signed by experts and advocates urging the Democratic Majority to change course ,
… mis-characterizations and untruths were used to remove from the draft , language supporting expanded access to contraceptives for HIV positive women receiving prevention of maternal - to - child transmission ( PMTCT ) services .
We are simply mystified at the failure to support the World Health Organization ’s ( WHO ) standards for these programs .
WHO recommends that family planning services be provided to women in PMTCT services should they choose to prevent another pregnancy .
Sound health practice appears to have fallen prey to those program implementers who simply do not believe in contraception – putting their own wishes above the health and well being of those they are charged with serving .
The 2003 legislation created barriers to sound health programming and HIV prevention work with sex workers .
These men and women are often disenfranchised and without social and health support systems – and US law has put additional barriers in place , rather than paving the way for undertaking more health care interventions with them .
Because this community is deeply affected by HIV / AIDS , now is the time to remove these barriers and promote best practices in working with these communities
To President Bush 's credit , PEPFAR has helped prevent mother - to - child transmission in Africa in more than three million cases .
PEPFAR provided counseling and testing to more than nine million people , 69 percent of whom were women .
Sixty percent of the people getting treatment for AIDS from PEPFAR are women .
But the reality is that this year , 2.5 million more men , women and children will become infected with HIV .
Some of those women and girls will be infected by husbands who have visited sex workers .
Sex workers forced into this work because of poverty , many trying to support children of their own .
Sex workers made more vulnerable by President Bush 's requirement effectively restricting public health outreach to them .
The Democratic Majority is now complicit in this failure of leadership , by compromising the Global Gag Rule and the Anti-Prostitution Pledge , thus making this program more complex .
We cannot hope to catch up to , let alone get ahead of , infection rates , if we continue to compromise sound public health strategies for the sake of political expedience .
Do people supporting the compromised bill really think we 'll have a different conversation five years from now without more courageous leadership ?
Senator Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) has a chance to help improve the bill , as do other concerned Representatives and Senators .
But it appears they will have to do it over the objection of Speaker Pelosi .
The question is , will they , or will Congress once again prove how tone deaf it can be to voters demanding more accountability , more solutions , more reality and less ideology .
If ever there was a moment for women and men to demonstrate leadership in Congress and stand up for women and girls in Africa , this is that moment .
If ever there was a moment to ignore the far - right ideologues and make a principled stand for sound public health strategies , literally the difference between life and death for many women and girls , this is that moment .
If ever there was a moment to prove that electing and elevating more women and people of color really can change our politics , and not just on the surface , this , Madame Speaker , is that moment .

When we first ran Geraldo 's original story , SV - 40 , A Deadly Cure ?
we thought it was a bit on the conspiratory side , but it seemed well researched .
We were pleased that many other journalists also investigated the material , proving the sad truth that Geraldo reported in ViewZone .
Research has now firmly linked many of today 's cancers with tainted virus vaccinations given in the early 1950s .
Could there be any more shocking and horrific revelations like this ?
We did n't think so -- but we were wrong .
The latest horror story is posted HERE : SV40 Part Two for you to ponder .
As you read it , also do not forget the Black Americans that were knowingly infected with Syphilis or the soldiers made to march through the fallout of our nuclear bomb tests ...
But first , read Geraldo Fuentes original story .
Also , important new information is at the end of this story .
If you received a polio vaccination in the 50's , you may have received something deadly in the mix ...
Watch this !: Interview with Dr. Maurice Hilleman from Merck Pharmaceuticals on how they introduced SV - 40 cancer virus in their vaccines and also how AIDs was introduced to the public from Africa !
This is the smoking gun of cancer and AIDs !
My story ...
It was 1956 .
I was only six years old and attended grade school in Springfield , Massachusetts .
I was too young to recollect the first round of polio vaccinations , but I have a few memories .
I remember that my first grade class was escorted to the school gymnasium .
There was a peculiar smell in the air .
I think it was probably rubbing alcohol .
And some of the other kids were crying .
The shot itself was n't so bad .
I did n't cry , but my best friend did .
At the end of the ordeal we all got a lollipop .
A few years later , when we marched again to the gymnasium it was different .
There was no crying and no alcohol odor .
Instead , there were long tables bearing neat rows of small paper cups , filled about half way with a liquid that tasted like bitter orange juice .
White clad Nurses watched as each child drank the vaccine .
There was no lollipop and , after we handed back the cup , we simply returned to class .
The government had initiated the mandatory polio vaccination programs in 1955 .
Prior to this , polio had killed or crippled thousands of children and adults all over the world .
Attacking the central nervous system , this viral infection was transmitted by human contact , sewage and even by contaminated milk .
Victims who contracted polio would incubate the virus in their intestines , where it would multiply and enter the lymphatic system .
Eventually the virus would penetrate the nerves and travel along nerve paths , destroying neurons and rendering the muscles connected to them paralyzed .
The polio epidemic reached its height in 1952 .
It turned thousands of victims into cripples and confined countless children to large pressure chambers called " iron lungs , " which helped them to breath when their diaphragm muscles were stilled .
There was and still is no treatment for polio .
Aside from attempts to maintain life functions , the disease must run its course .
And so , in 1955 , just one year before I received it , Jonas Salk had performed no small miracle when he successfully mass - produced an effective polio vaccine by growing a form of the virus on the kidneys of rhesus monkeys .
This virus would be harvested , killed , and given to healthy children like me , who would then develop antibodies which would kill any future invasion of the body by the polio virus .
This happy story of medical marvel has a deadly glitch .
And it is especially deadly if , like me , you received your vaccinations in the 1950s , in certain states like Massachusetts .
In 1960 , researchers discovered that the polio vaccine distributed to certain states was infected with another virus called " Simian Virus 40 . "
SV - 40 is a monkey virus that is not normally found in humans .
Unknown at the time , it was present in hundreds of rhesus monkeys that were used to grow and harvest the polio vaccine .
Injected into research animals , the SV - 40 virus causes brain and lung cancers .
Now , some forty years later , its effect on humans is just being investigated .
" SV - 40 has appeared in 61 % of all new cancer patients -- patients too young to have received the contaminated vaccine being administered forty years ago ! "
Michele Carbone , Assistant Professor of Pathology at Loyola University in Chicago , has recently isolated fragments of the SV - 40 virus in human bone cancers and in a lethal form of lung cancer called mesothelioma .
He found SV - 40 in 33 % of the osteosarcoma bone cancers studied , in 40 % of other bone cancers , and in 60 % of the mesotheliomas lung cancers .
Dr. Carbone believes this study explains why 50 % of the current mesotheliomas being treated were no longer occurring in association with asbestos exposure , their traditional cause .
Whether you are filing a mesothelioma lawsuit because of SV - 40 or Asbestos , you should keep up with the most current information .
Researchers from the Institute of Histology and General Embryology of the University of Ferrara , lead by Dr. Fernanda Martini , discovered SV - 40's presence in a variety other tumors .
They found the rhesus monkey virus in 83 % of choriod plexus papillomas , in 73 % of ependymomas , in 47 % of astrocytomas , in 50 % of glioblastomas , and in 14 % of meningiomas .
SV - 40 also has been found in 23 % of blood samples and 45 % of sperm fluids taken from normal individuals !
Researchers have determined the SV - 40 virus can be transmitted sexually and through blood transfusions .
Even more shocking , SV - 40 has appeared in 61 % of all new cancer patients -- patients even too young to have received the contaminated vaccine being administered forty years ago !
How could this happen ?
My second vaccination was from a cup .
This was the brainstorm of the FDA .
Instead of getting the " dead " virus in an injection , the Federal vaccination policy mandated that children should be given the new live " oral polio vaccine " ( OPV ) .
This decision was based upon the belief that the OPV recipient would " shed " the virus through body contact with other non-vaccinated children and adults , thereby spreading the " live " virus throughout the population .
Since the infection was extremely small , it would produce the desired antibodies while posing no threat of contracting polio .
This , it was thought , would assure the total immunization of America and the eradication of the disease .
The public was never informed that this national health strategy was being implemented , despite several cases of polio which were directly attributed to the vaccine .
By 1963 , the estimated number of tainted polio vaccinations was estimated to be upwards of 98 - million !
The SV - 40 virus that contaminated the oral polio vaccine quickly spread from child to child and from child to adult , crossing state lines and national boundaries .
By 1960 , when the virus was first detected , it was already too late to prevent its dissemination throughout the population .
The FDA quietly and gradually instituted a program to eliminate rhesus monkeys , who harbor the SV - 40 , and replace them with African Green monkeys that are free of the virus .
By 1963 the monkeys had been replaced but the estimated number of tainted polio vaccinations was estimated to be 98 - million !
According to the National Institutes of Health , high levels of SV - 40 were identified in polio vaccines in Washington , Oregon , Wyoming , Utah , Minnesota , Iowa , Wisconsin , Illinois , Michigan , Pennsylvania , Washington DC , Maryland , Delaware , New York , Connecticut , Rhode Island , Massachusetts , Vermont and New Hampshire .
Low levels of SV - 40 were found in California , Arizona , New Mexico , Colorado , Texas , Kansas , Nebraska , North Dakota , Missouri , Louisiana , Georgia , Tennessee , Kentucky , Ohio , and West Virginia .
Polio vaccines in the other states show no SV - 40 present .
This revelation has only recently come to public attention .
Many people , like myself , were unaware that a potential for cancer had been implanted in their body .
Researchers say that , by age fifteen , the virus stops shedding to others .
I cannot but wonder how many people I contacted between the age of eight and fifteen ...
Did I shed the SV - 40 virus to my mother , who eventually died of brain cancer ?
Will I contract brain , lung or bone cancer ?
Many other people in my age group are asking similar questions .
A number of public statements have been made by the National Cancer Institute in the past few months , attempting to put their spin on these disturbing revelations .
In an statement published in the January ( 1999 ) New England Journal of Medicine , the institute states that there is no evidence of an increase in humans of the types of cancers found in laboratory animals that have been injected with SV - 40 .
But other researchers remind us that SV - 40 has already been found in a wide variety of other tumors .
It has been shown that individuals who received the tainted oral vaccine demonstrate a higher occurrence of these cancers .
For example : people who lived in Massachusetts and Illinois in the 1950s , and received identified lot numbers of the contaminated oral vaccine , are now contracting osteosarcoma bone tumors at a rate of ten times more than those who received the vaccine free of the SV - 40 .
But the National Cancer Institute has been silent about these facts .
But the National Cancer Institute has been silent about these facts .
There needs to be more demographic studies to explore the relationship of SV - 40 to adult onset cancers .
Not surprisingly , the US government and its agencies are reluctant to pursue this matter .
In fact , requests to the National Institute for Health for grants to study the SIV and simian cyto-megalovirus ( SCMV ) were recently denied .
Microbiologist Howard Urnovitz , Ph.D. , may have an explanation as he stated in the Boston Globe : " That almost 100 million Americans were exposed ( to SV - 40 ) through a government sponsored program , but for over 30 years , there has been virtually no government effort to see if anyone 's been harmed by the exposure . "
He added , " The government will not fund science that makes it look culpable . "
Another method used by the National Cancer Institute to divert public concern is to issue statements that " many of the cancers under suspicion were contracted by people who are too young to have received the tainted vaccine in the 1950s . "
This argument , although true , ignores the potential of spreading the live SV - 40 by " shedding " through personal contact .
The oral polio vaccine was designed to be transmitted to non-vaccinated individuals by this very method .
In fact , this was the reason that OPV was preferred over injection .
If SV - 40 is still being spread by contact today it is not surprising that these cancers are now affecting younger people .
Regardless of blame , severe damage to world health has already been done by the unsavory practice of growing vaccination products in animals .
An example of these horrors was presented by Dr. Urnovitz at the Eighth Annual Houston Conference on AIDS .
Dr. Urnovitz revealed significant evidence that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) is a monkey hybrid virus which was produced when 320,000 Africans were injected with polio virus contaminated with live simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) in the late 1950's .
Apparently , viral fragments combine easily with other viruses to produce these hybrids called " chimeras . "
Prior to this revelation , health officials were blaming AIDS on the habit of certain Africans to consume monkey flesh .
Apparently , viral fragments combine easily with other viruses to produce these hybrids called " chimeras . "
Prior to this revelation , health officials were blaming AIDS on the habit of certain Africans to consume monkey flesh .
What can be done now ?
" Make it in anything but animals , " said Barbara Loe Fisher of the National Vaccine Information Center , which criticizes vaccine safety .
" We have the technology to make vaccines in human cell lines that are clean , " said Dr. Michele Carbone of Loyola University Medical Center , one of the first to discover SV - 40 inside human tumors .
Until then we can only hope that researchers continue their work , regardless of the repercussions .
Millions of people are already infected with SV - 40 and are in danger .
Many cancers do not develop until mid-life .
Future generations must be protected .
We must prohibit any future contamination of the world population , whether for our own good or not , by well - meaning governmental agencies .
UPDATE : October - November 2002
The following article appeared in the NY Times on October 22 , 2002 , partially quoted as follows : Monkey Virus -- Cancer Link Debated ( THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ) WASHINGTON ( AP ) --
Despite years of study , there remains too little evidence to conclude a monkey virus that once tainted some polio vaccine can cause cancer in humans .
Still , the Institute of Medicine said Tuesday , although studies of people who received the vaccine have not shown increased cancer rates , a connection cannot be completely ruled out .
The institute , an arm of the National Academy of Sciences , recommended development of a federal response plan for dealing with contaminated vaccines and better tests for the monkey virus to determine how widespread it is .
The test described in this article was to compare the group of people who got the original " live " virus in the 1950's , in school immunization programs , with the cancer rates of the general population .
But , remember , the whole purpose of the mandatory " live " virus immunization program was to make sure that EVERYONE was exposed to the new batches of vaccine .
This was done by having innoculated children " shed " the virus to others -- their parents , other children and virtually anyone that had contact with them after they were vaccinated .
In other words , the entire American population was subjected to the SV - 40 in either the original innoculation or from the shedding .
So it is natural that the rates of cancer would be no different between the school children and anyone else that they infected .
On the whole , cancer rates have sky - rocketed , especially those rare forms related to the SV40 , yet this type of misleading ( i.e. lies ) is typical of what the current administration and Federal offices are attempting to do with everything from the threat of Iraq to the infecting of its own population in the past .
If you want to get involved in a potential class action suit , you might want to contact a woman whose daughter contracted one of these rare forms of cancer ( medulloblastoma ) , attributed to the SV40 contamination .
Not only does she suffer from having her child impacted by this horrible governmental error , but she also has the uncertain guilt of possibly infecting her daughter from her own exposure to the live virus back in the 1950s .
UPDATE ON VACCINE MISTAKES Rotarix rotavirus vaccine contaminated , officials say !
( CNN ) ( March 2010 ) Federal health authorities recommended Monday that doctors suspend using Rotarix , one of two vaccines licensed in the United States against rotavirus , saying the vaccine is contaminated with material from a pig virus .
" There is no evidence at this time that this material poses a safety risk , " Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg told reporters in a conference call .
Rotarix , made by GlaxoSmithKline , was approved by the FDA in 2008 .
The contaminant material is DNA from porcine circovirus 1 , a virus from pigs that is not known to cause disease in humans or animals , Hamburg said .
About 1 million children in the United States and about 30 million worldwide have gotten Rotarix vaccine , she said .
Rotavirus disease kills more than 500,000 infants around the world each year , primarily in low - and middle - income countries , she said .
Before rotavirus vaccine became available , the disease was blamed for more than 50,000 hospitalizations and several dozen deaths per year in the United States , she said .
The FDA learned about the contamination after an academic research team using a novel technique to look for viruses in a range of vaccines found the material in GlaxoSmithKline 's product and told the company , Hamburg said .
The drug maker confirmed its presence in both the cell bank and the seed from which the vaccine is derived , suggesting its presence from the early stages of vaccine development , she said .
The FDA then confirmed the drug maker 's findings .
GlaxoSmithKline emphasized Monday that the pig virus is not known to cause illness in humans , saying " it is found in everyday meat products and is frequently eaten with no resulting disease or illness . "
" No safety issue has been identified by external agencies or GSK , " Thomas Breuer , the drug maker 's chief medical officer , said in a written statement .
" GSK is committed to patient safety and to the highest manufacturing standards for all our vaccines and medicines .
We are already working closely and discussing this finding with regulatory agencies around the world . "
Another vaccine , RotaTeq , is made by Merck and was approved in 2006 .
There is no evidence that the Merck product is affected , Hamburg said .
Both vaccines are given by mouth to infants to prevent rotavirus disease , which is marked by severe diarrhea and dehydration .
Asked whether Merck would be able to meet the nation 's demand , Merck spokeswoman Pam Eisele said , " Obviously , we will work with the ... FDA to evaluate supply needs . "
In the next four to six weeks , the drug agency will convene an advisory committee to make recommendations and seek input on the use of new techniques for identifying viruses in vaccine , Hamburg said .
" We 're not pulling it from the market , we 're just suspending its use during this period while we 're collecting more information , " she said .
" It should not be in this vaccine product and we want to understand how it got there .
It 's not an easy call and we spent many long hours debating the pros and cons but , because we have an alternative product and because the background rates of this disease are not so severe in this country , we felt that the judicious thing to do was to take a pause , to really ask the critical questions about what this material was doing in the vaccine , how it got there . "
Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health , said " a substantial amount " of the DNA was found in the vaccine .
But , he stressed , " there is no evidence that it causes any disease .
...
There is no evidence that it ever does anything . "
The research group that discovered the contamination has asked not to be identified pending its paper 's publication in a scientific journal , Hamburg said .
Anyone who has already received a dose of Rotarix should switch to the Merck product for the next two doses , Hamburg said .
Preliminary testing of the Merck product has found no evidence of the porcine circovirus 1 DNA , she said .
Doctors should be able to tell parents which of the two products their children received , she said .
Hamburg stressed that the suspension applies only to the United States .
Public health officials in countries where the incidence of rotavirus is more severe may decide that the benefits of continuing to use the vaccine outweigh any concerns raised by the contamination , she said .
" Such a decision would be very understandable , " she added .
A similar virus , porcine circovirus 2 , also does not cause disease in humans , but it does cause disease in its pig host , Hamburg said .

The U.S. media has paid a good deal of attention recently to the burial of Emperor Hirohito — known posthumously as Emperor Showa , recorded as history ’s longest - reigning Japanese sovereign .
Star reporter Diane Buerger did her part ( Feb. 27 ) by bringing to light some of the current issues surrounding the U.S. - Japan relationship .
In quoting me , however , some misperceptions were conveyed which should be clarified .
First , Japan , while not a threat , is a challenge .
The vitality of the economic partnership cannot be taken for granted .
Both countries are adjusting to new realities which demand global leadership from the Japanese .
Second , Japan ( not the U.S. ) is the free world ’s leading creditor nation , making us and other countries dependent upon her financial strength .
Finally , to elaborate on the cost of living and living standards in both countries , what we consider staple or essential consumer products are often purchased as luxury items in Japan .
Real estate , homes , and autos in Japan are so expensive that most consumers can’t afford them .
The money they have , therefore , is devoted to conspicuous consumption of clothes , food , entertainment , and travel .
This leads many to view every Japanese as wealthy , even though per capital income is only slightly higher than in the U.S .

May 12 , 2008  --
The public will get its first chance Monday to test a search engine from start - up Powerset that eschews conventional keyword technology and instead is designed to understand the meaning of Web pages .
As such , Powerset 's search engine holds the promise of fundamentally changing people 's expectations for search engines by , in theory , offering a smarter , more efficient experience .
However , Powerset 's beta version , while delivering impressive results , has a limited scope and index , leaving unanswered questions about its ability to work its magic at the massive scale of Google 's keyword - based search engine .
" We 're changing the way information is searched by doing a much deeper analysis of the pages we index , " said Scott Prevost , Powerset 's product director .
Keyword engines treat pages as word bags , indexing their content without grasping its meaning , he said .
Meanwhile , Powerset 's engine , applying technology developed in - house as well as licensed from Xerox 's PARC subsidiary , creates a semantic representation by parsing each sentence and extracting its meaning .
" Meaning is what we index , " he said .
In an interview in October with IDG News Service , Marissa Mayer , Google 's vice president of Search Products & User Experience , acknowledged that the company 's search engine should -- and will -- overcome its keyword dependence in time .
" People should be able to ask questions and we should understand their meaning , or they should be able to talk about things at a conceptual level .
We see a lot of concept - based questions -- not about what words will appear on the page but more like ' what is this about ? ' .
A lot of people will turn to things like the semantic Web as a possible answer to that , " she said .
But she added that Google 's search engine acts smart thanks to the humongous amount of data it crunches .
" With a lot of data , you ultimately see things that seem intelligent even though they 're done through brute force , " she said .
As examples , she cited a query like " GM , " which the engine interprets as " General Motors " but if the query is " GM foods , " it delivers results for " genetically - modified foods . "
" Because we 're processing so much data , we have a lot of context around things like acronyms .
Suddenly , the search engine seems smart , like it achieved that semantic understanding , but it has n't really , " she said .
For now , Powerset 's index is very limited , consisting only of millions of pages from Wikipedia and Metaweb Technologies '
Freebase , a Web - based structured database of information .
However , Prevost vows that the index will begin growing within a month after its launch and eventually rival in size those of Google , Yahoo and others .
" Our technology fully scales , " he said .
Still , it 's impressive to see Powerset 's search engine in action and the promise it holds .
Instead of returning the proverbial 10 blue links for search results , Powerset can do more , such as assembling a collection of facts related to the query , as well as summarize the found information .
It can also provide direct answers to factual questions .
Because the content from Wikipedia and Freebase can be re-published , Powerset can remain relevant after a user clicks on over to a search result , by providing an outline to navigate through the page and a summary of facts .
This , of course , is n't something that Powerset could do with copyrighted content , but the company will seek partnerships with publishers to obtain permission , Prevost said .
" We think it 'll be a situation where publishers will want their content to be served up in this way , " he said .
Industry analyst Greg Sterling of Sterling Market Intelligence calls Powerset 's capabilities " impressive " and particularly likes its search results interface .
" What they 've created is both a better search engine for Wikipedia and a massive ' proof of concept ' for their algorithm and technology , " he said in an e-mail interview .
Now Powerset has to prove that its search engine can scale and deliver against an index of billions upon billions of Web pages and serving millions of concurrent end users .
" There 's certainly potential there to build a better mousetrap , it would appear .
But bringing what Powerset has done for Wikipedia to the entire Internet seems an enormous challenge that will take both time and lots of additional resources , " Sterling said .
Prevost acknowledges that to do this type of deep processing takes a lot of computational power , although once indexed , retrieving pages ' information does n't pose any special challenge .
Powerset also faces the challenges of a start - up technology company , such as generating revenue and going through growing pains .
The company has already had some management upheaval , announcing in November the departure of co-founder and Chief Operating Officer Steve Newcomb and its search for a CEO , as co-founder Barney Pell gave up that post to become chief technology officer .
" The CEO search is still in process , but we have a strong internal management structure and board of directors , " he said .
Prevost said the company 's investors are committed to the company and to seeing that it has the resources necessary to scale up the search engine to the level of those with indexes of 20 billion pages .
Powerset 's business model is based on advertising , although the search engine will not serve up ads from the beginning .
" There 's a lot of cool stuff we can do in the ad space by matching the meaning of queries to the relevance of ads , but that 's much more longer term , " he said .
The search engine will be limited to Web search at first , although Powerset has contemplated adding specialty engines for things like images and video later , as well as targeting verticals such as health , product reviews and travel , he said .
" We 've only shown the tip of the iceberg in language analysis , " he said .
The Rev Pfleger apologised for his sermon , given at Mr Obama 's church US Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama has said he is " deeply disappointed " at a supporter 's sermon that mocked rival Hillary Clinton .
Rev Michael Pfleger said Mrs Clinton felt " entitled " to win because she was white and was forced to realise there was " a black man stealing my show " .
Mr Obama said the sermon was " divisive , backward - looking rhetoric " .
Meanwhile Mr Obama has told the BBC he expects to be his party 's nominee when primary elections end next week .
Rev Pfleger has apologised for his sermon at Mr Obama 's Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago .
According to Associated Press news agency , Rev Pfleger said in the sermon : " [ Hillary Clinton ] just always thought that , ' This is mine .
I 'm Bill 's wife .
I 'm white . '
These words are inconsistent with Senator Obama 's life and message and I am deeply sorry if they offended Senator Clinton or anyone else who saw them
Rev Michael Pfleger
" And then , out of nowhere , came ' Hey , I'm Barack Obama . '
And she said , ' Oh damn , where did you come from ?
I 'm white .
I 'm entitled .
There 's a black man stealing my show . ' "
He added : " She was n't the only one crying .
There was a whole lot of white people crying . "
In response , Mr Obama said in a statement : " As I have travelled this country , I 've been impressed not by what divides us , but by all that unites us .
" That is why I am deeply disappointed in Father Pfleger 's divisive , backward - looking rhetoric , which does n't reflect the country I see or the desire of people across America to come together in common cause . "
Rev Pfleger said the words in his sermon were " inconsistent with Senator Obama 's life and message and I am deeply sorry if they offended Senator Clinton or anyone else who saw them " .
Mr Obama has had other problems with a clergyman during the nomination campaign .
He denounced the claim by Rev Jeremiah Wright , who officiated at his wedding and baptised his daughters , that the 9/11 attacks were an example of " America 's chickens coming home to roost " .
Convention
In an interview with the BBC's Katty Kay , Mr Obama said the general election campaign - against Republican John McCain - would begin in earnest after the primaries end next week .

Mr Obama is ahead in delegates won and is confident he will pick up enough of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination .
Mrs Clinton could still win , by persuading enough " super - delegates " , or senior party officials , to back her .
The delegates will choose the party 's nominee at a nominating convention in August and the candidate with the most delegates will win .
Some delegates are " pledged " to vote according to the results of elections - the primaries - held in their state , while others - the unelected " super - delegates " - are free to vote for whoever they like .
Only three more contests remain : the Puerto Rico primary on Sunday and the South Dakota and Montana primaries on Tuesday .
Meanwhile , the doctor who has treated Mr Obama for the past two decades said he was in excellent health , with good blood pressure , low cholesterol and no signs of heart disease .
The 46 - year - old has a family history of cancer and a smoking habit he has tried to break , his doctor said , but Mr Obama also jogs regularly and has no excess body fat .
Medical records released last week by Mr McCain , 71 , said he was also fit to run for the presidency .
He takes medicine to control his cholesterol and has been treated successfully for skin cancer .
Are you in South Dakota or Montana ?
Will you be voting on Tuesday ?

What are these ?
How did a notoriously - troubled Coast Guard ship suddenly pass a rigorous Navy inspection , and get approval to sail ?
It 's a mystery I could use your help unraveling .
A couple months ago , allegations surfaced the Coast Guard 's new flagship cutter , Bertholf ( pictured ) , had problems with its unsecured communications systems – problems that would delay that ship 's entry into service .
The Coast Guard responded by blasting the reporters who raised the issues .
Then , three months later , the service proudly announced that * Bertholf * had passed a rigorous Navy inspection – and would be accepted .
But the circumstances surrounding the over - budget vessel 's handover are ... well , a little odd , to say the least .
Nothing is definite .
But , from what I can tell , it appears that Coast
Guard or contractor engineers engaged in some under - the - cover - of - darkness shenanigans to make sure the ship was ready for the Navy inspectors .
The first clue that something was amiss came when Defense News reported this little nugget in the wake of Bertholf 's May 8 acceptance :
*[ Admiral
Gary ]
Blore took pains to point out that systems testing , grouped under the heading of " information assurance , " is continuing on the * Bertholf and that , while progress is being made , the work wo n't be completed for some time .
If the communications problems are ongoing , then why did the notoriously - strict Navy " InSurv " inspection board give * Bertholf * a pass ?
Navy
Times came up with a possible answer :
* Much of the information systems gear was not yet installed when InSurv came onboard , according to the [ Coast Guard 's acceptance ] report , nor did
Navy inspectors conduct full tests on the ship ’s radios ...
Aha !
So the ship was n't even complete at the time of the inspection .
That 's shady enough .
But what if the ship had been
complete ... and then the Coast Guard realized that it would never pass in its current state ?
If that were the case , it would take some serious misdirection to avoid the inspectors ' sharp eyes .
Unless , of course , the faulty comms systems somehow disappeared on the eve of the inspection , leaving the ship admittedly incomplete , but otherwise mostly flawless .
That 's exactly what happened , according to an anonymous tip relayed to me last week .
The tipster , who left me no way to contact them , said that Bertholf 's communications systems had been fully installed as of this spring , but were yanked out of the ship in the weeks preceding InSurv 's visit ...
and then apparently re-installed after the inspectors had left .
In other words , the Coast Guard might have cheated on their biggest ship 's final exam , leaving us taxpayers owning a flawed , half - billion - dollar vessel .
(* If * the tipster is dead - on , that is – a major , major if . )
I want to know :
1 ) What were the circumstances surrounding the " un-installation " of Bertholf 's communications systems ?
2 ) Who exactly yanked the systems , and when ?
3 ) Who ordered the cheat , and what was their rationale ?
I 've asked the Coast Guard and the Navy , and both declined comment the Coast Guard now denies the accusations .
So I 'm putting out a call to all Coasties , Navy inspectors , shipyard workers and industry types who have any knowledge of the Bertholf
inspections .
Can anyone help me answer any of the questions outlined above ?
Better still , does anybody have documents or other proof to confirm the cheats ?
If so , contact me at david_axe - at - hotmail.com .
I promise total protection and anonymity to any source .
It 's a mystery exactly how Bertholf went from hopelessly flawed to passing a Navy inspection with flying colors .
Together we can solve it .

Many of the birds that migrate to Britain and Europe from Africa every spring , from the willow warbler to the cuckoo , are undergoing alarming declines , new research shows .
The falls in numbers are so sharp and widespread that ornithologists are waking up to a major new environmental problem – the possibility that the whole system of bird migration between Africa and Europe is running into trouble .
It is estimated that , each spring , 16 million birds of nearly 50 species pour into Britain to breed from their African winter quarters , and as many as five billion into Europe as a whole , before returning south in the autumn .
Many are songbirds weighing next to nothing , and their journeys of thousands of miles , including crossing the Sahara desert each way , have long been recognised as one of the world 's most magnificent natural phenomena on the scale of the Gulf Stream or the Indian monsoon .
But now their numbers are tumbling precipitately .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Well - loved migrants such as the spotted flycatcher , the garden warbler and the turtle dove are increasingly failing to reappear in the spring in places where they have long been familiar .
Across Britain , many people who used to look forward each year to hearing the first cuckoo – just about now , in the third week of April – no longer have the chance to do so .
If fewer and fewer birds are returning to their breeding grounds , the inevitable consequence is that their populations will shrink ever more rapidly , ultimately , towards extinction .
That may still be a long way off for the global populations of many migrants , but in Britain , several species are heading towards disappearance .
This worrying prospect is outlined in the first full statistical account put together by experts seeking to understand what is happening and why .
Figures in an unpublished survey produced by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds paints a startling picture of plunging populations .
Of the 36 British - African migrant species for which there is long - term population data ( going back to 1967 ) , 21 have declined significantly .
These include the two species which have become extinct in Britain in the same period – the red - backed shrike and the wryneck , the only migratory woodpecker – and another 11 which have suffered declines of more than 50 per cent .
This " 50 per cent plus " group includes both the willow warbler and the cuckoo , with declines of 60 and 59 per cent , while at the top end of the scale , the spotted flycatcher , the tree pipit and the turtle dove have suffered declines of 84 , 83 and 82 per cent respectively .
For the 42 migrants for which there are short - term population trends available ( going back only to 1995 ) , 23 have declined – 55 per cent of the total .
This includes a 30 per cent decline of the cuckoo , a 43 per cent decline of the pied flycatcher , and a 60 per cent decline of the wood warbler , just in the past 13 years .
The study , compiled by the RSPB research biologist Steven Ewing and likely to be published later this year , goes on to show that this pattern is not confined to Britain .
It is being repeated across Europe as a whole , from Spain to Finland , with 27 out of 37 European - African migratory species for which there is reliable long - term population data – 72 per cent of the total – undergoing declines .
These include species such as the nightingale , which is showing one of the severest declines with a 63 per cent drop in numbers across Europe between 1980 and 2005 .
In Britain , the nightingale is now such a rare bird that it is not picked up in standard monitoring schemes , meaning there is no reliable population data for the species .
But there is no doubt that it is also declining here .
No one knows the reasons for these disappearances , which may be many and complex , although theories being discussed include habitat degradation in Africa and climate change .
But they are pointing firmly to the possibility that , after millions of years the Afro- European bird migration system is going fundamentally wrong .
The problem may be on the birds ' journeys , which are full of hazards , or on their wintering grounds south of the Sahara .
Ornithologists from all over Europe will meet in Germany next month to discuss both the vanishing migrants , and the possibility of setting up a network of research stations in Africa to investigate what is happening .
The meeting , at the Radolfzell bird observatory on Lake Constance , has been organised by two scientists , Volker Salewski from Radolfzell and Will Cresswell from the University of St Andrews .
" With a large number of our migrant species which are suffering declines , you do n't have to look all that far into the future for when the lines on the graph cross zero , " Dr Cresswell said .
In Britain , the RSPB and the British Trust for Ornithology are switching their attention from farmland birds , whose declines because of intensive agriculture have long been a major concern , to focus on the startling fall - off in migratory bird numbers .
Both are actively planning new research programmes concentrating on migrants .
" We are seeing some very marked declines in migrants , which are giving us real cause for concern , " said Dr David Gibbons , the RSPB 's head of conservation science .
" These birds form a huge part of our native avifauna and we need to help them before they disappear from the British and European countryside . "
In recent weeks , Clinton advisers have been challenging Mr. Obama ’s electability in a general election , and her victories in Ohio and Pennsylvania are perhaps her best evidence yet to argue that she is better suited to build a coalition across income , education and racial lines in closely contested states .

But the Pennsylvania exit polls , conducted by Edison / Mitofsky for five television networks and The Associated Press , underscore a point that political analysts made on Wednesday : that state primary results do not necessarily translate into general election victories .
“ I think it differs state to state , and I think either Democrat will have a good chance of appealing to many Democrats who did n’t vote for them the first time , ” said Peter Hart , a Democratic pollster not affiliated with either campaign .
“ Take Michigan .
It has a Democratic governor , two Democratic senators , and many Democratic congressmen , so it ’s probably going to be a pretty good state for the Democrats in a recession year . ”
Mr. Hart , as well as Obama advisers , also say that Mr. Obama appears better poised than Mrs. Clinton to pick up states that Democrats struggle to carry , or rarely do , in a general election , like Colorado , Iowa , Missouri and Virginia , all of which he carried in the primaries .
Obama advisers say their polling indicates he is more popular with independents , and far less divisive than Mrs. Clinton , in those states .
“ Hillary goes deeper and stronger in the Democratic base than Obama , but her challenge is that she does n’t go as wide , ” Mr. Hart said .
“ Obama goes much further reaching into the independent and Republican vote , and has a greater chance of creating a new electoral map for the Democrats . ”
Indeed , if Mr. Obama does become the first African - American nominee of a major party , the electoral landscape of the South could be transformed with the likelihood of strong turnout of black voters in Republican - leaning states like Georgia and Louisiana , which Mr. Obama carried this winter .
( Mrs. Clinton has also argued that , given the Clinton roots , she could put at least Arkansas in play in the fall . )
Obama advisers have also argued that swing states like Ohio are winnable this fall because they have been increasingly leaning Democratic and have been struggling economically under President Bush .
Indeed , some Obama allies hope he will pick Ohio ’s popular governor , Ted Strickland , as his running mate if he wins the nomination , both to help carry Ohio and to unify the party ( Mr. Strickland is supporting Mrs. Clinton ) .

If you want to see why the damned government is continually raising your taxes , spending more and more money , growing bigger and bigger all the damned time and locking up a full one percent of the population in prison , part of the answer is in the Pinellas Park Beacon newspaper , which reported that federal search warrants were executed at three local pharmacies as part of an investigation into healthcare fraud .
So far , so good .
The funny part is that " the agencies involved in the investigation are representatives of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement , Pinellas County Sheriff 's Office , Florida Attorney General 's Office - Medicaid Fraud Control Unit , Health and Human Services - OIG , United States Office of Personnel Management - OIG , Drug Enforcement Administration , Defense Criminal Investigative Service , United States Attorney 's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation . "
It 's like when there is a simple , everyday accident on the road , and suddenly the whole highway is completely shut down because there are police everywhere , police cars all over the place , hazardous materials handling people trundling around in their bulky suits testing for dangerous substances , bomb disposal people trundling around in THEIR bulky suits , SWAT teams taking up positions in the surrounding area , fire trucks , ambulances , police helicopters and even K - 9 units swarming all over the highway !
I mean , it 's amazing how many government employees are seemingly standing around looking for something to do with their latest equipment upgrades , and itching for a chance to put all that expensive training to work , to ( I assume ) hopefully show how all of those huge departmental expenses are " proving " to be of compelling value during the upcoming city / county / state budget reviews .
In fact , this has inspired my latest poem , which does n't have a title yet , but the opening stanza is :
The governments have firepower out the wazoo , Looking for something to do .
One of these days , in dozens of ways , They 'll be coming after you , too , and you 'll be in deep doo - doo .
Well , those who have any familiarity with poetry whatsoever recognize right away that I have absolutely no talent , and it is obvious that I spent less than twenty seconds writing it , including thinking up the original idea , writing it , re-writing it , then editing it before giving it that final polish that turns it into a shining gem of literature .
With it being so damned easy to write crap like that , the reason that I have not already published an anthology of my Immortal Mogambo Poetry ( IMP ) , of which the above is but a small sample , is that I am not sure that it is exactly true that the levels of governments will always have such firepower .
I mean , the whole economy is based on the stupid idea that the government only exists to do more and more things and give money to more and more people , which it has faithfully done for half a century , all built on the nominal gains of all that new Federal Reserve money cascading through the economy like anabolic steroids in otherwise mediocre athletes .
But now , with all these losses in every freaking thing , there will ( horrors ! ) necessarily be a sharp reduction in profits , and thus ( horrors of horrors ! ) a sharp reduction in taxes paid on those profits and , thus ( horror of horrors of horrors ! ) a sharp reduction in spending and a downward spiral in the economy , as the government spending IS the economy nowadays !
In short , the lifeblood of governments is going to be choked off unless taxes are raised , which would , unfortunately , make everything even worse , all of which means there is no painless way out , and which always reminds me of the phrase " We 're freaking doomed ! "
Alas and alack , it is not just the governments around here that are full of do - gooder spenders , and if you want proof that the International Monetary Fund is a disgusting collection of morons , quacks and politically connected halfwits , too , then page 13 of last Monday 's Financial Times newspaper is all you need .
To start with , Wolfgang Munchau again makes the point that Milton Friedman was exactly right when he said , " inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon . "
By this he means that prices rise in a general inflation after the money is created , and thus if you create too much money , then prices are going to rise too much .
The big difference this time is that the inflation monster is now everywhere , not just in stocks , bonds , houses and size of government anymore , but now in consumer staples such as food and energy , where governments everywhere are aghast that , as Mr. Munchau notes , " The global rate of headline inflation is 4.5 % and rising . "
Yikes !
I was right :
We 're freaking doomed !
The funny part is right next to Mr. Munchau 's column , and actually touching it , is a piece by Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the managing director of the International Monetary Fund .
The laughable screed penned by this nitwit is titled " A Global Approach Is Required To Tackle High Food Prices . "
If you are like me , you are delighted that now , after all of these many , many dozens of centuries of the world 's people having to periodically endure higher food prices because of environmental mishaps or governmental stupidity ( or both ) , now there is a solution to the problem of high food and energy prices !
So what is this " global approach " to " tackle high food prices " that is going to be so wonderful ?
Huh ?
You wanna know ?
Huh ?
Do you ?
Huh ?
Hahaha !
Well , you 're going to love this :
The idea is to let the IMF start giving money away to pay the higher prices !
The IMF , glorying as ever in its failures , just like the Federal Reserve , now promotes the laughable idea to " tackle " rising food prices by having donor economies give other people money to pay higher food prices !
Hahaha !
THAT is the " global approach " to " tackle " higher food prices ?
Hahaha !
And if you think that government throwing money at a problem , especially one as big as this , is going to be successful , and that buying gold , silver and oil is therefore unnecessary and old - fashioned , then my lip curls into a sneer and I laugh with Utter Mogambo Disdain ( UMD ) " Hahahahaha ! " at you , and wish only to be there to see the look on your face at the instant that you realize , to your own terrifying horror , how wrong you were !
Hell , I 'm laughing just thinking about it !
Hahahaha !

Listen to Ventura describe the WTC buildings as " white elephants . "
Howard Stern was incredulous .
“ It was an insurance job ? ” he asked when Jesse Ventura postulated that the WTC buildings were brought down because WTC 1 and 2 were “ white elephants , ” that is to say the cost of the buildings exceeded their usefulness .
“ They were losing money , they had asbestos in them , and they were required by law to do over a billion dollars worth of asbestos removal . ”
“ It was an insurance job ? ” asked Stern .
Ventura continued .
Larry Silverstein had insured the buildings against terrorist attacks for $ 7 billion dollars , “ of which he settled for four . ”
Again , Stern and crew were incredulous , although Stern said he would have to read Ventura ’s book , Do n’t Start the Revolution Without Me. Jesse urged him to do so .
It may have been a near perfect crime , at least in the beginning , so perfect Allianz Group , the company that carried a significant portion of the insurance coverage on the WTC , did n’t put two and two together .
However , one company stockholder , publisher John Leonard , did put two and two together , suggesting demolition .
Allianz , however , would have nothing of it , as the insurer relied on the official 9/11 fairy tale as an explanation .
It apparently did not occur to the German company that Silverstein had over - insured the buildings .
“ The WTC catastrophe was doubtless one of the biggest insurance incidents in history .
A significant portion of the multi-billion dollar loss is expected to be borne by Allianz , ” Leonard wrote in a letter to shareholders .
“ Numerous observers and researchers find the WTC case very suspicious . ”
Noting that a staggering 49.3 % of respondents to a survey conducted in New York City “ agreed that ‘ some of our leaders knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11 , 2001 , and that they consciously failed to act , ' ” Leonard was taken aback that Allianz had not “ asked whether perhaps the US Government instead of the insurers is responsible for the damages , or whether the possibility of insurance fraud has been investigated . ”
Allianz eventually balked at paying out and in stepped Brooklyn - Queens Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner , who threatened to punish the insurer with fines or operating restrictions if they did not cough up the cash .
“ Silverstein is determined to rake in every last penny possible from 9/11 and has already secured billions from other insurers without a blink of an eye over the fact that he leased the property just six weeks before the attacks and has since been caught in an admission that he ordered at least one of the buildings , WTC 7 , ‘ pulled ’ on 9/11 , ” writes Steve Watson .
It is indeed strange , Watson notes , that any “ building that was not owned by Silverstein Properties that day strangely remained upright , despite being a lot closer to the two towers that collapsed onto them , ” leading no shortage of people to smell something rotten in Brooklyn – or rather on Manhattan .
Considering the amount of insurance fraud , corruption , and rampant malfeasance in the corporate world , the possibility that Silverstein was involved in a plot to bring down the buildings — as they were excessively expensive “ white elephants , ” as Ventura notes – it is a possibility that cannot be discounted out of hand , although Howard Stern and his crew , like millions of other gullible Americans , are incapable of believing ruthless business interests would do such a thing .
Of course , insurance fraud alone cannot explain the events of September 11 , 2001 .
In fact , such an event would be impossible without the complicity of government and — as Ventura recently stated on the Alex Jones Show — the government had reason enough to plan and orchestrate such an event , from scheming a pretext to invade Afghanistan and Iraq to providing an excuse to erect a military police state at home .
Unfortunately , far too many people naively believe the government — and for that matter , ruthless business interests — would not do such a thing , and that includes Howard Stern .
Jess Ventura credits Loose Change with waking him up to 9/11 .

What is the Investor Concierge ?
In a nutshell , the Investor Concierge is a private website for the Nouveau Riche community members offering real estate investment deals with supposed positive cash flow .
These deals are found by franchises called The Real Market Experts and are fixed up and placed on the Investor Concierge website .
Each deal gets its own page filled with pictures , numbers and a breakdown analysis of how they arrived at the positive cash flow figure .
Let ’s take a deeper look at the Investor Concierge to see if the deals are really any good .
If you are like me , then you might have read other blogs that have made assumptions and claims saying the deals were overpriced , used interest only loans , and after the subsidies had expired that the deal will no longer cashflow .
Probably the most popular blog promoting these claims is nouveauscam.blogspot.com ( read quotations below ) .
So let ’s break apart “ Nouveau Scam ‘s ” article about the Investor Concierge to see how close he / she truly is with their claims :
“ Upon closer examination , the flaws in the deal begin to surface : that $ 2400 a year in annual pre-tax cash flow is only $ 200 per month , and does n’t include any maintenance or allowance for any vacancy of the property .
As long as you do n’t have any big maintenance needs , you might possibly break even– and all the while , you ’re building equity while your tenants pay the mortgage , right ? ”
He / she is correct that the investor concierge deals did not include any vacancy or maintenance factors in their listings .
Most real estate investors usually factor in 5 % - 10 % for vacancy / maintenance depending on their specific strategy .
Without an official company statement on this , it would be difficult to know for sure , but the obvious factor that stood out to me was that many of the properties were newly built homes with a recommended strategy of a lease option ( lease with option to purchase ) tenant .
In this scenario the maintenance fees can be significantly lower because the home is new construction , and a lease option tenant contract often passes on the repairs and maintenance to the tenant rather than the landlord .
The flipside is if the house is older , and the investor chooses a traditional renter rather than a lease option tenant .
Then there would be a greater need to factor in maintenance and vacancy .
Summary :
It makes sense that the Investor Concierge does NOT factor in vacancy and maintenance because the investment strategy of choice on many of the properties is a lease option tenant that covers those costs .
Perhaps in the future the Investor Concierge can feature a calculator right on their deals that allows users to factor in percentages based on their investment strategy .
“ Wrong .
The deal Nouveau Riche shows to you invariably is built around an interest only mortgage– you wo n’t build any equity at all for the first 10 years , after which your mortgage payment will jump up to a much higher amount .
If the deals were structured with conventional principle and interest loans , none of these deals would have any positive cash flow at all . ”
Now this is where I started to question this person ’s credibility and motives .
This paragraph starts making an overall assumption that every deal on the investor concierge is the same and the writer illustrates his lack of mortgage knowledge .
A quick search on the Investor Concierge pulled up several deals that did not fit in the claim above .
In fact , I wonder if the writer just totally made it up !
First of all , it is a never - ending debate in itself to decide which type of mortgage is right for which type of deal .
I have had very successful investors all arguing this exact topic in a room and none of them could agree on it .
A more conservative investor will choose the approach of a 15 or 30 year fixed loan with a large cash down payment and a goal to own the home free and clear in the shortest time frame possible .
A more aggressive investor will choose a leveraged approach where they strip the home of its equity when possible , and reinvest into more properties to build a bigger portfolio .
Regardless of your preferred investing strategy , I think it is safe to say that every deal is unique and there is not ONE magic mortgage product to fit everyone ’s needs .
So let ’s address the writer ’s specific claim that all the deals used Interest Only Loans .
Did they ?
No !
I am curious how the writer even came to that conclusion !
Each deal featured on the Investor Concierge had an EXAMPLE loan that the borrower could potentially get if they met the example requirements ( credit score , doc requirement , reserve requirement , debt to income ratio ) .
The example loan types would vary on each deal that I looked at , thus PROVING that not every deal used an interest only loan .
But I decided to take it one step further .
I called my loan officer and had her run a few scenarios for me on a potential deal to see if it would still cashflow .
I had a 720 credit score , full doc , enough reserves , a reasonable debt to income ratio and a 10 % down payment .
I factored in an additional 5 % for vacancy and maintenance , and I also factored in closing costs and a tenant placement fee into the down payment since the property would need a tenant .
I gave her 3 different types of loan scenarios :
Neg -am loan Interest - only loan 30yr fixed loan
All three loans got me positive cashflow !
So I had her run two more properties to get a more rounded perspective , and sure enough , one of the other two deals would not cashflow in my specific situation with a 30 yr fixed loan .
She said if my credit score was higher I would be able to get a better interest rate and would cashflow .
Summary :
The writer made a very bold accusation and was proven wrong !
Not every deal is an interest - only loan , and it is up to the investor to choose a loan product that is right for them .
They have the freedom to use their own loan officer , or they can go through a mortgage company that is partnered with Nouveau Riche .
The other accusation was that the deals would not cash flow with traditional principle and interest loans , but in fact there was positive cash flow in two of the three scenarios that I ran .
Basically each deal on the investor concierge is unique and is an example only .
It is up to the Investor to determine a loan product and run their own numbers .
“ ‘ But I still have instant equity , right ? ’
Probably not .
The “ Estimated Market Value ” is not an appraisal , but rather just someone ’s guess at what the property might be worth .
And if it is worth that , why is n’t it being sold for that ?
Can you really buy these properties and immediately sell them for 10 % more ?
I doubt it . ”
At this point I think it is pretty obvious that the writer has gone beyond logic and turned to uneducated opinion .
I spent 15 minutes searching through deals trying to find at least one that met the description above and I could n’t !
100 % of the deals that I viewed , including deals visible in the “ guest ” view , all had documentation of the estimated market value .
Now we all know that nobody can ever claim to know the market value of real estate for sure , which is why the Investor Concierge clearly claimed an “ estimated market value ” .
What I found interesting was that the writer suggested that the Investor Concierge would just “ guess ” the market value and that they did n’t use appraisals .
The majority of the deals that I viewed documentation for showed comps by a licensed real estate agent ( comparable real estate deals recently sold ) .
A few of the deals offered a BPO ( Real Estate Broker Price Opinion ) to determine market value , and 2 of the deals used real estate appraisals !
So what on earth was this writer talking about ?
Are comps , bpo’s and real estate appraisals considered valid ?
Of course !
There is not one successful real estate investor that I personally know that would argue that .
However , depending on how skeptical / cautious you are on your deals , you may want to analyze the potential market value from several angles .
But again , now we are talking about individual real estate investing strategy rather than the specific claims by the author of the Investor Concierge article .
He / she was clearly false in their claims and any novice researcher would have easily proven that .
“ ‘ Okay , but the market will go up , and I ’ll be rich ! ’
If the market continues to skyrocket , it ’s true , you will be rich .
But across the country , in nearly every housing market , this is not what is happening .
The correction has begun .
The real estate “ bubble ” will deflate , and then likely stay constant for a while .
All the while you ’ll be paying interest only on a property that is slowly becoming worth less than your loan is for– a loan you have to pay off if you want to sell . ”
This writer holds a strong personal opinion of the national real estate market and it ’s future .
Given the author ’s track record so far with their investigation of the Investor Concierge , I really only took this paragraph with a grain of salt .
There is not much need to debate this paragraph , but this writer has obviously shown that they feel real estate is a bad investment right now .
I wonder what investment strategy they would recommend ?
Mutual funds ?
Play the stock market ?
Personal savings account in a bank ?
A safe at home full of money ?
Of course there is risk with any investment , and there is also reward .
Generally , the greater the risk , the greater the reward .
I have had the privilege of networking with many successful investors , and every single one of them is in favor of investing in real estate .
One of the main benefits of positive cash flow is that it allows you to ride the up and down waves of appreciation without as many stressful moments .
It is people who purchase on speculation alone that are hit the hardest if the market turns on them .
With a lease option tenant , there is already a set purchase price that they are agreeing to purchase the property for .
If they do not purchase the property , then you can keep the lease option fee , and lease the house back to them again for another year or two , or simply find a new lease option tenant .
Many investors feel that this is a great hedge against an unstable market .
I just read a statistic recently through the NAR showing that over the past year 2/3rds of markets in the united states showed appreciation .
I wonder sometimes if it is just the media that always reports the doom and gloom to us filling our heads .
So what exactly is the current appreciation in our country ?
According to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO ) , several states saw great appreciation , while several other states had declines :
The states with the greatest rates of appreciation between the third quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of 2007 were : Utah ( 12.9 % ) , Wyoming ( 11.8 % ) , Montana ( 7.7 % ) , New Mexico ( 7.4 % ) , and Washington ( 7.0 % ) .
The states with the largest depreciation for the same period were : Michigan ( - 3.7 % ) , California ( - 3.6 % ) , Nevada ( - 2.4 % ) , Massachusetts ( - 2.3 % ) , and Rhode Island ( - 2.2 % ) .
– OFHEO , 11/29/2007
A savvy investor knows how to read market trends and analyze deals to add to their portfolio , but many of us are not that savvy and require some education to learn this process .
Of course we could always get our education through Nouveau Riche , or through some quality Books from the bookstore , or perhaps we are lucky enough to know a successful investor that would be willing to take us under their wing .
The fact is that money can be made in an up market , a flat market , and a down market .
The only thing that changes is the strategy .
The final statement the writer leaves us with is this one :
“ After all , if these were truly good deals , why would the founders of Nouveau Riche want to train you to take advantage of them ?
Why not just invest in the properties themselves ?
The sales presentation claims that the founders made their fortune and now altruistically want to help others make theirs .
If altruism is the motivation , then why charge $ 16,000 ? ”
Now this is a question that I can relate with because I asked it myself when I first looked into the investor concierge .
I asked a very wealthy friend what he thought about it .
He asked me if I understood Wholesaling from a real estate perspective , and then explained why wholesaling real estate is so popular among investors .
Here was the question asked to me :
Would you rather make a fast nickel or a slow dollar ?
When an investor comes across a deal , and puts it under contract , they have several options available to them .
They can hold on to the property long term , or they can fix it up and flip it , or they can turn it over to another investor for a quick turnaround , and any potential strategy in between .
A wholesaler is someone who prefers the fast nickel over the slow dollar .
A rehabber might prefer to hold on to the property and fix it up and then try to sell it closer to a retail market value , choosing the slow dollar .
Nouveau Riche is using The Real Market Experts to find properties and feature them on the Investor Concierge to wholesale them to the Nouveau Riche community members .
At the end of the day , all parties involved should be happy with the process .
The Real Market experts earn a portion for finding the deal , fixing it up and managing it .
Nouveau Riche earns a portion by providing the community of investors as potential buyers for each deal .
And the community earns a portion by purchasing the deals for positive cash flow and potential appreciation .
There are still going to be some readers that are skeptical of this process no matter what , and that is ok !
Skeptics add a great value to our country , and so do optimists .
We have balance and harmony through a variety of opinions and personalities .
I am simply offering my perspective as an individual who enjoys real estate investing and is not turned off by today ’s national market .
I wrote this article in an attempt to give a fair look at the Investor Concierge from a critical standpoint .
I hope that some readers have found value in this and hopefully it has helped you in your investigation of this company .
By the way , Nouveau Riche teaches 30 + classes , each on unique real estate investing strategies .
Only one of those classes teaches students how to purchase homes off the Investor Concierge .
And that class is FREE !
The majority of education offered at Nouveau Riche is towards teaching individuals how to find and locate their own deals , analyze their own markets , and use the right investing strategy to execute the transaction .
The Investor Concierge is primarily for investors who have good credit and money to put down , but do n’t have the time or do n’t want the headache of finding and managing these deals themselves .
So I find it interesting for people to be so critical of a service tailored towards a specific niche market .
There is obviously a need for a service like this , and Nouveau Riche does a pretty good job at putting it together for their investors .
My friends at Andrews McMeel Publishing will do anything to make me happy , apparently .
Or maybe they just think “ Ozy and Millie ” is good !
One way or the other , tomorrow , August 28 , a new “ Ozy and Millie ” book will be out , available wherever books are to be found .
It ’s full color , and the same format as the “ Phoebe and Her Unicorn ” books .
I chose strips that I thought would be a good introduction to the strip and what it is for new readers , but I hope longtime readers will have just as much fun with these .
I had fun collecting them –I actually laughed out loud , rereading these .
Good job , young me !
Linear Logical Algorithms , Robert J. Simmons and Frank Pfenning , 2008 .
Bottom - up logic programming can be used to declaratively specify many algorithms in a succinct and natural way , and McAllester and Ganzinger have shown that it is possible to define a cost semantics that enables reasoning about the running time of algorithms written as inference rules .
Previous work with the programming language Lollimon demonstrates the expressive power of logic programming with linear logic in describing algorithms that have imperative elements or that must repeatedly make mutually exclusive choices .
In this paper , we identify a bottom - up logic programming language based on linear logic that is amenable to efficient execution and describe a novel cost semantics that can be used for complexity analysis of algorithms expressed in linear logic .
In my last post , I linked to a paper by Ganzinger and McAllester about specifying algorithms as logic programs , and a ) admired how concise and natural the programs were , and b ) was sad that the logic programs used some " non-logical " operations , such as deletion .
So , what does it mean for an operation to be " non-logical " , and why is it a bad thing ?
Roughly speaking , you can think of the analogy : non-logical operations are to logic programs what impure operations are to functional programs -- they are features which break some parts of the equational theory of the language .
Now , the Curry - Howard correspondence for functional programs says that types are propositions , and programs are proofs .
It turns out that a different version of this correspondence holds for logic programs : in logic programming , a set of propositions is a program , and the execution of a program corresponds to a process of proof search -- you get a success when execution finds a proof of the goal .
When you have nonlogical operations in your logic programming language , you 've introduced operators that do n't correspond to valid rules of inference , so even if your logic program succeeds , the success might not correspond to a real proof .
Deletion of facts from a database is a good example of a nonlogical operation .
Regular intuitionistic and classical logic is monotonic : deduction from premises can only learn new facts , it can never disprove things you already knew to be true .
Since deletion removes facts from the set of things you know , it can't have a logical interpretation in classical / intuitionistic logic .
However , it turns out that not all logics are monotonic , and in this paper Simmons and Pfenning show that if you take the language of propositions to be a fragment of linear logic , then all of the operations that Ganzinger and McAllester use actually do have a nice logical interpretation .

ROBSTOWN , Tex. —
Leon Little ’s farm here near Corpus Christi would not be seized for Texas ’s proposed $ 184 - billion - plus superhighway project for 5 or 10 years , if ever .
But Mr. Little was alarmed enough to show up Wednesday night with hundreds of his South Texas coastal neighbors to do what the Texas Department of Transportation has been urging : “ Go ahead , do n’t hold back . ”
Do n’t worry .
Texans have gotten the message , swamping hearings and town meetings across the state to grill and often excoriate agency officials about a colossal traffic makeover known as the Trans - Texas Corridor , a public - private partnership unrivaled in the state ’s — or probably any state ’s — history , that would stretch well into the century and , if completed in full , end up costing around $ 200 billion .
“ Is your road more important than the foodstuffs we put together for you ? ” asked Mr. Little , glaring at transportation officials at the town meeting .
The plan envisions a 4,000 - mile network of new toll roads , with car and truck lanes , rail lines , and pipeline and utilities zones , to bypass congested cities and speed freight to and from Mexico .
Critics abound , but experts say Texas is addressing a problem certain to worsen nationally in coming decades : the price of gasoline may be rising but revenue from gasoline taxes is not , and with the rise of more fuel - efficient vehicles , less money is being raised for highway projects , even as traffic grows .
So transportation planners are increasingly looking to the private sector to put up construction money for toll roads in return for revenue from motorists .
“ We ’re relying on 1993 income for 2008 output , ” said Robert Harrison , deputy director of the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Texas in Austin .
“ It ’s unsustainable . ”
Texas has been a victim of its own success , officials say .
From July 2006 to July 2007 it added more people than any other state — nearly half a million , beating California by nearly 200,000 .
In the past quarter century , they say , the state ’s population has grown by nearly 60 percent while road use has doubled .
“ They make fun of us , but a whole bunch of people want to be Texans , ” said Phillip E. Russell , assistant executive director of the Texas Transportation Department , who presided over the meeting here at the Nueces County Fairgrounds , along with the agency ’s executive director , Amadeo Saenz .
Mr. Saenz said that Texas highways averaged 46 years of age and that the state was running out of money to maintain them , let alone build new roads .
“ The problem is our needs far outweigh the money available , ” he said .
At particular issue in South Texas is a stretch of federal Highways 77 and 59 designated part of a proposed new segment of the federal highway system , I - 69 .
But what was to have been a new interstate long sought by some businessmen and local officials is now listed as TTC - 69 , or part of the Trans - Texas Corridor .
“ I do n’t think people realize it has morphed into a toll road , ” said Linda Stall , founder of a opposition group called Corridor Watch .
Ms. Stall said the project was backed by “ the guys who build , financiers and the suits . ”
“ The only person who loses is the citizen , ” she said .
“ We ’re paying everyone ’s profit . ”
She also said investors would “ cherry pick ” the most lucrative toll routes , leaving other sections unfinanced .
Mr. Saenz said some routes might not require bypassing .
“ The no-build alternative is still an alternative , ” he said .
The corridor project grew out of the 2002 governor ’s race when Rick Perry , the former Republican lieutenant governor who had completed George W. Bush ’s unfinished term , surprised transportation experts by taking ideas they had discussed a decade earlier , to little interest , and “ supersizing them , ” as one recalled .
The project grew to consist of four “ priority segments : ” new multimodal toll roads up to 1,200 feet wide paralleling Interstates 35 and 37 from Denison in North Texas to the Rio Grande Valley ; a proposed I - 69 from Texarkana to Houston and Laredo ; I - 45 from Dallas - Fort Worth to Houston ; and I - 10 from El Paso to Orange on the Louisiana border .
But the exact routes are years away from being designated .
With construction , land acquisition and other expenses , the cost was estimated in 2002 at up to $ 183.5 billion , all of it to be put up by private investors , state officials say .
No existing roads would gain tolls .
The first planning contract , for a segment paralleling I - 35 , was awarded in 2004 to a partnership of Cintra , a publicly traded transportation giant based in Madrid , and the Zachary Construction Corporation of San Antonio .
But lawmakers , concerned over the public outcry , put the brakes on additional contracts until next year .
Legislators also asked transportation officials last week to explain why they were complaining of budget shortfalls while failing to use $ 9 billion in voter - approved bonding authority .
Now that 12 town meetings have concluded and the agency this month began the first of 46 public hearings to run through next month , Mr. Saenz said , “ We have now gotten to first base . ”
Once the Federal Highway Administration signed off on the plans , he said , the agency , perhaps next year , could begin a second phase of four to six years to select actual routes .
But meanwhile , people here complained , they were being left hanging .
“ Six to 15 years puts us in limbo forever , ” said John Floyd , whose antiques shop is the only business in San Patricio , a historic crossroads dating from 1828 and on the map as a possible corridor route .
David Helpenstell , himself a soon - to - retire employee of the transportation department , also felt threatened .
“ Your proposed alternate passes through the middle of my house , ” he said .
Now even if he wanted to sell , he said , “ nobody would buy it . ”
At least Texas could share the road wealth , said John Coggin of Bluntzer , suggesting that displaced landowners get a percentage of toll revenues , just as they would for mineral rights .
On his nearby farm , where he was turning over the soil for sunflowers , Dean Nesloney climbed out of his tractor to show where he feared TTC - 69 could go .
“ It ’s kind of like this , ” Mr. Nesloney said extending his arms diagonally across his field .
“ They ’d probably take it all up , ” he said .
“ Maybe leave me some little bitty corners . ”

The World From Berlin Olympic Flame Now ' Symbolizes Repressive Regime '
The global Olympic torch run has descended into chaos and China has only itself to blame , write German media commentators .
The protests have even created a new sport -- " Flame Extinguishing . "
And you did n’t think she had it in her .
Here is CNN ’s transcript :
Blitzer : The House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is sounding more determined than ever to try to make sure the Democrats do n’t take their presidential fight all the way to the Denver Convention .
In fact , she ’s now threatening to take matters into her own hands .
Let ’s go to CNN ’s Kate Bolduan .
She ’s following this story for us .
You ’re learning Pelosi ’s actually starting to take some specific action .
Tell us what she ’s doing .
Reporter : Exactly , we ’ve just learned that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now calling uncommitted superdelegates , urging them to pick a candidate between now and next week opinion clearly it ’s crunch time for the Democratic Party and they know it .
A blunt warning from Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi telling the San Francisco Chronicle that the Democratic nomination fight must be resolved soon or else .
[ AUDIO – NANCY PELOSI : Earlier than that I will step in .
Because we cannot take this fight to the convention .
It must be over before then .
I believe it will be over in two weeks . ]
Reporter : Stepping in , according to to a Pelosi spokesman means she ’ll pressure undeclared superdelegates to publicly endorse either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama .
Those declarations are key because it ’s unlikely either candidate will clinch the nomination after next week ’s final primaries .
Right now , excluding Florida and Michigan whose delegations are being contested , there are 271 superdelegates in Congress. 92 of them support Clinton .
114 support Obama .
That leaves 65 lawmakers still undeclared .
One of those is congressman Jason Altmire of Pennsylvania .
[ VIDEO – JASON ALTMIRE :
If we allow this to fester , to drag out over the next three months into the national convention which is at the end of August , then we may not have time to put the pieces back together . ]
Reporter : While Speaker Pelosi plans on pushing superdelegates to declare their picks , she insists she ’ll remain neutral because of her role chairing the Democratic Convention in August .
But in the past Pelosi has said superdelegates should follow one guiding principle .
[ VIDEO – SPEAKER PELOSI :
It will do great harm to the Democratic party if it is perceived that the superdelegates overturn the will of the people . ]
Reporter : Now , we ’ve also learned that Pelosi is coordinating with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to bring this fight to an end for superdelegates to make a public choice by next week .
In a radio interview Reid said he spoke to Pelosi just this morning .
Blitzer : Kate , thanks very much .
Good update .
DIGG THIS
The most stringent curb that ever legislation imposed on tyranny .
Thus wrote Thomas Babington Macaulay , commenting on the importance of habeas corpus in his first volume of History of England , in 1848 .
That makes sense .
After all , freedom of speech , press , petition , religion and assembly are meaningless if the government is able to lock up someone and throw away the key .
And all of those wonderful ideas about a fair and timely trial are meaningless if the government is not compelled to " produce the body " in court .
That may be obvious to most of us , but apparently when one becomes recognized as a " constitutional expert , " all rules are off .
This was demonstrated on November 5 , 2007 when Professor Daniel A. Farber was given an opportunity to comment on Pakistan President General Pervez Musharraf 's justification of the imposition of emergency powers in his country .
Musharraf had referred to Lincoln 's similar actions during our War between the States and Farber was commenting on National Public Radio's All Things Considered .
Farber 's defense of Lincoln included the following statement :
( Lincoln's ) most controversial action was suspending habeas corpus at the outset of the war .
While the Constitution does not speak directly to this point , many legal scholars think only Congress could suspend habeas .
This was a shocking statement for anybody familiar with the Constitution , but even more shocking coming from a Professor of Law at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of Lincoln 's Constitution .
I brought the following to the attention of NPR management through its ombudsman , Lisa Shepard , December 6 , 2007 , and when I received no response , to the 17 board members of NPR :
The phrase , due process of law , is referenced in both Amendment 5 and Amendment 14 of the Constitution .
Habeas corpus is generally considered to be associated with due process .
Many believe it is the keystone to due process since without it , the other parts of due process ( right to speedy trial , presumption of innocence , et cetera ) are meaningless if the executive authority has the power to arbitrarily seize a person and incarcerate him or her ( see Brown v. Vasquez and Jacob Hornberger ) .
Article I , Section 9 of the Constitution specifically states :
The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it .
I further commented in that letter to the NPR Board members ,
Lincoln supporters will rush to claim that his suspension of habeas corpus was consistent with the Constitution because the South was " in rebellion . "
They miss the point .
Suspension of habeas corpus is NEVER within the authority of the executive branch of the federal government .
Article I was intended to describe the powers and responsibilities of the legislative branch .
Article II , on the other hand , describes powers and responsibilities of the executive branch .
This is no minor technicality , but the essence of the Constitution which is based upon five themes ( see Introduction by Garry Wills to The Federalist Papers ) — ( 1 ) Federalism , ( 2 ) Checks and Balances , ( 3 ) Separated Powers , ( 4 ) Pluralism , and ( 5 ) Representation .
The theme of separated powers applies to the question of suspension of habeas corpus by the executive branch .
The effect of Professor Farber 's comment was to presume that " experts " were divided on the question of the legitimacy of the executive suspending habeas corpus , thus justifying Lincoln 's actions .
In doing so , he was rationalizing the suspension of what Thomas Babington Macaulay believed was the most fundamental individual right and the most severe constraint on tyranny .
NPR 's actions ( or lack of action , to be more precise ) superficially appear to be unexplainable .
We are led then to speculate about the motives , first of Professor Farber and then NPR management and its directors .
Certainly ignorance must be discarded in all cases .
One can suspect that Professor Farber 's enthusiasm for Lincoln at least temporarily overwhelmed his love of the truth .
We are all human , and that could easily have been excused with a quick retraction .
NPR , however , consciously chose to avoid that path , and has demonstrated , once again , that the initial infraction is often minor by comparison with the magnitude of the cover-up .
Why would NPR become complicit when getting to the source of the truth was so easy ?
One could suspect that the culprit is culture .
NPR is a child of Big Government .
According to Wikipedia it was " created in 1970 , following congressional passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 , signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson . "
Today only 2 % of NPR 's funding comes from governmental sources .
However , while the umbilical cord with Big Government has been severed , the DNA remains .
Culturally NPR is overawed with the credentials of " experts , " and it finds it difficult to independently search for the truth .
Perpetuating the myth that Lincoln did no wrong is essential to maintaining the respectability of Big Government .
When a certifiable bad guy like Musharraf questions the Lincoln myth , he must be countered at all cost , even the truth .
Perhaps this explains Professor Farber 's bizarre comments on the Constitution , and NPR 's unquestioning acceptance of them on All Things Considered , but once Farber had " misspoken " and been detected , why circle the wagons around his indefensible statement ?
Never underestimate the power of culture .
There still was hope that by stonewalling an ordinary listener , this issue would go away quietly .
This incident reminds us that we must be eternally vigilant , not just of our liberties , but of the information we receive from sources that we believe are respectable .
The best that could be observed of Professor Farber and NPR in this matter is that NPR has been used as a propaganda transmission belt .
The incident teaches us the importance of critical thinking exercised by well - informed individuals .

Covert Surveillance Agenda Attached to Mandatory HD TV Conversion ?
( April 12 , 2008 )
Subject : Coupons for HDTV conversion
From : Fran F .

Dear Ken ,
I was wondering if you have any info about why the gub'ment is providing $ 40 coupons to help people buy conversion boxes to upgrade older TVs to receive HDTV signals ?
Our government does n't HELP us do ANYTHING .
Why this ?
Are those conversion boxes some sort of surveillance device ?
Just wondered if you know why they are doing this -- and , by the way -- where is all this money coming from ?
Thanks ,
Fran F .

Hi Fran ,
Yes , the forced conversion to High Definition TV means we will only be able to receive a digital TV signal instead of an analog TV signal starting in 2009 .
They will then have the ability to manipulate that digital signal in any direction desired , for any purpose desired .
In addition , there is little doubt in my mind that all of the newer wide - screen High Definition TVs you find in retail outlets today have both tiny cameras and audio detection devices covertly installed within them so the NSA can both SEE and HEAR everything that goes on in your home .
The conversion boxes that they are offering with those free government coupons will surely have the same detection and surveillance devices which I assume are being installed in the newer HD TVs .
Do I have proof ?
No , but common sense tells me this is where it 's going and it fits with the escalating evidence of the Big Brother , police state controlled society which we are being forced into .
I 'm EQUALLY confident that covert monitoring / tracking chips have been installed in all automobiles manufactured since perhaps 1990 ( maybe even beginning in the late 80s ) .
How to get around it ?
I have n't thought it out much , but here 's a few ideas off the top of my head :
1 . Do n't buy the newer HD TVs and do n't get their conversion box .
Forget getting TV from broadcast or cable or satellite directly .
One idea is to watch TV shows from your older computer with currently availabe TV reception hardware / software ( newer computers probably have the surveillance devices installed ) or send the video and audio from the computer into the AV jacks on your TV or VCR .
2. Watch TV shows from programs previously recorded on VHS tapes or from DVDs using your older TV and VCR equipment .
This could become a cottage industry overnight if enough people become aware of the covert surveillance agenda riding along on the coattails of the forced conversion to High Definition digital television .
3 . You can listen to only television audio from many inexpensive radios that include the TV audio bands from channel 2 - 13
In most cases , audio is good enough for me .
I 'm mainly looking for those few comedy offerings here and there that will provide a laugh .
Most sitcoms are just awful : ' boring ' or ' banal ' would be complimentary descriptions .
It 's also possible that some bright boys out there will be able to find and neutralize the camera and audio detection devices being installed and render them useless .
Time will tell .
I 'm certainly not going to buy a HD TV or get that conversion box .
95 % of what you see on broadcast TV is total garbage anyway .
It 's intentionally designed to turn a person into an intimidated , dumbed - down , brainwashed zombie .
So who needs it ?
Regards ,
Ken

Thank you , Ken .
I guess the best choice for me is to not do anything with my old TV and just let go of TV entirely -- no great loss , actually , except I do like to see what spin the network news is putting on stuff .
Do you have any reference to articles about the nefarious nature of this forced conversion ?
All TV will now be microwave transmission , right ?
Just what we need more of ... if that 's part of the reason for all the honeybee deaths .
I 've thought the thought , but am not aware of an effort to educate people on this issue .
( If you have something on your site , I apologize that I have n't read it there already , but point me in the right direction , please . )
Best wishes ,

Comments ( oldest comments at the top , most recent near the bottom )
[ I had expected to receive more skeptical and disbelieving comments from this article than supportive comments and that seems to be the case .
What technicians in the field fail to take into account is that we are not referring to conventional state - of - the - art electronics .
We are talking about classified government - eyes - only advanced nanotechnology that has been seamlessly inserted into HD TVs or conversion boxes so as not to be detectable by ordinary means .
The only people who would be even slightly aware of this covert insert would be the highest echelon of the corporate structure and even then , they would have been required by Homeland Security , for instance , to sign a non-disclosure , secrecy agreement .
It 's not news to me that government agents have been planting cameras and listening devices inside the TV sets of targeted individuals like former FBI bureau chief Ted L. Gunderson .
That 's old hat , but now , because of the illogical and unjustified mandatory statutory edict forcing conversion over to digital , we now realize that they want to ramp up the surveillance to include every household .
The new TV surveillance monitoring , just like current telephone monitoring , will be performed by high speed computers , not human beings .
The idea is personal dossier data storage .
When they want to look at you , they run a computer program to detect key words or phrases and then zero in on you more closely to find something incriminating to use against you .
Think of the former East German secret police , the Stasi , and you get an idea where we are heading .
People who dismiss this development as paranoia on my part are simply living in a fool 's paradise .
Total 24/7 Big Brother surveillance is closing in on us much faster than most people realize .
I try to warn people of what my intuition tells me in order to help them prepare or deflect the takeover agenda .
I warned readers on Sep. 23 , 2001 that 911 was an inside job and that it would herald greater police state encroachment and loss of Constitutional guarantees , besides being stuck with the bill to pay for our glorious transformation into a Nazi - style police state . .
At the time , I got tons of e-mails accusing me of being crazy to think that the government was behind the destruction of the World Trade centers .
Seven years later , I wonder how many of those accusers would write me again saying the same thing ?

Ken ,
So I read that bit from Fran with your answer , and I 'm thinking perhaps someone who does n't y'know love their dumb box , would be able to get their mitts on the conversion box and perhaps a HD TV and disect those suckers for some forensics and whatnot , I 'd love to do so but unfortunatly like most americans these days my fundage is of a deplorable state .
However if I can get my hands on either of these things , I will open them up and examine them to the best of my ability , and let you know the results ; THusfar I can already tell you that the cells within the so - called " hi - def " TVs are simply halved , making more and smaller cells , it'd be horribly easy to put many small cameras every few cells or so .
Sorry if this mail wasted your time man .

Ken ,
What the Gov will be able to do is use the speakers in your HD TV as a listening device .
People will be looking for a microphone and wo n't find one .
The spook organizations can use equipment that will allow them to use your speakers as microphones .
They can listen in even if the power to your TV is turned off .
The only way to stop it is unplug the TV and disconnect it from the cable feed .
Not sure yet how they will " see " into your house unless they have a camera in the TV .
Perhaps they can see through the optical elements of the screen just like they can use the speakers as a microphone .

Are you serious Ken ?
Lets forget for a minute that HDTV is years old , and also that set - top boxes of many varieties are decades old , how do you propose the video and audio signals from these ' devices ' would be transmitted ' back - to - base ' in a discrete fashion ?
For MATV ( Master Antenna TeleVision ) systems , that is , Free - to - air television , there is absolutely no way to get these ' signals ' back to anywhere as the system is completely passive .
Cable on the other hand could very well have an infrastructure set up to ' capture ' surveillance footage , I think I even recall seeing an American cable companies patent on a recording device inside set - top boxes for marketing purposes .
In any case , as a computer and electronics technician , I have never seen any such device inside a set - top box or television , HD or otherwise , and believe me even if well concealed it would stand out like a sore thumb .
Lets stop with the wild paranoid ideas about Orwellian style TV's , and focus on the REAL issues facing society today , i.e. the growing international police state , and the many related issues ( which do n't include Big Brother staring at us through our new 50 " Plasma screens ) ...

Subject : HD Forced Conversion

Having worked with television now for 10 + years I feel somewhat qualified to comment on this topic section .
NTSC-c was launched on my birthday , providing me over 54 years to consider the current parallels to those original problems they experienced in converting us from Black & White to tri-color .
Your instinctive grasp of the process , particularly the use of any digital - to - analog ( down - conversion in quality ) adapters for your older equipment , SHOULD protect you from said surveillance .
However , I fully believe that these particular ' tuners , ' as they are currently being shipped , are not of much use at supplying an A / V - back channel .
They would have to include an all - too disarm able camera and a mic. to work .
They really are for attaching plain old ' F ' connectors to older sets .
{ BTW , the actual cost to the taxpayers , according to the 2006 - mandate was to have been $ 17 . ,
not $ 40.}
You bring - up another much more threatening reality which is that we can literally trace the colony - collapse of our bees by the number and specific distribution of cell towers .
You should note also that the Government took back the 900MHz spectrum for Satellite Radio , offering 3.5GHz residential phones as a replacement .
Without the aid of a mm-ruler , it should be relatively easy for you to see how a horizontal Microwave beam - pattern wreaks havoc on these little fella 's nervous systems .
At either end they are shaped like tiny satellite dishes , and owing to their semi-crustaceous exoskeleton physical form , they appear to make the ideal microwave collector .
Additionally , we know that Bees are dying from the lack of aroma in the flowers and the soils .
I would also not rule out the persistent effects of Chemtrails , as I frequently awake with the distinct taste of a hydrochloric nature in my mouth , especially on cloudy days which appear to be their preference for spraying of late .

Subject : Re : The HDTV Conversion / " Covert " Surveillance thread
From : Michael
Date : Sun , April 13 , 2008
To : Editor
What I am going to tell you is neither opinion , nor is it a secret - I have learned it from years of industry experience .
In a thread between yourself and a Ms. Fran F. , you state that you believe the following postulates to be true : 1 . " there is little doubt in my mind that all of the newer wide - screen High Definition TVs you find in retail outlets today have both tiny cameras and audio detection devices covertly installed within them so the NSA can both SEE and HEAR everything that goes on in your home . "
2 . " The conversion boxes that they are offering with those free government coupons will surely have the same detection and surveillance devices which I assume are being installed in the newer HD TVs . "
I do not intend to debate whether or not the potential of surveillance is increased by the conversion to HDTV - that is evident by the fact that it will be based on a digital signal .
I do intend to inform you as to the method through which Americans will be monitored , due to this mandatory change .
The conversion of all American household televisions from an analog signal to a digital signal creates many opportunities for surveillance .
The fundamental difference is that , even for people that may receive free television service ( assuming that free airwave television stays active ) , their television will need to request individual stations ACTIVELY from a host in a similar fashion to how one requests websites from internet hosts .
There is simply not enough bandwidth , nor are consumers going to pay for the electrical power of transmitting a video and audio feed of themselves back to television stations , even unwillingly - they WOULD see the difference on their electrical bill .
Not only that , but it is quite improbable that anyone would take the job of watching people in their household living rooms .
As such , I have a new postulate for you , from experience with statistical analysis of Internet usage and activity : 1 . Since Digital HDTV service requires a request to receive ANY broadcast , it will be similar to cable television service in the amount of statistics that can be gathered from it .
2 . My best professional guess is that each " conversion box " or piece of hardware that can receive an HDTV signal is equipped with something similar to your network card 's MAC address - a unique address for your card that identifies you on the overall network .
3 . Once stations begin to use this information to better contextualize advertising to things you 'll actually buy ( ever notice how many online ads are SOOOOO well targetted to what you 've been looking for ? ) , that information will then be able to be subpoena'd by the government , as evidence in a court of law , or evidence for a warrant if necessary , in a similar fashion to internet access logs from your ISP .
4. Television stations and others will then try to introduce digital rights management ( DRM ) schemes to attempt to stop anybody from receiving unauthorized television broadcasts .
As such , you will NOT be able to listen to the audio from television stations any longer on a regular radio , because not only will you have to make a request to the service provider / station to do so , but you will need to have the proper decryption scheme installed into your radio ( essentially , you 'd need to hardwire a conversion box directly into your radio ) .
5 . With the level of statistics that your own requests to view television provide , there is no need to have a camera or microphone watch or listen in on you .
Using the same algorithms that websites employ to determine the effectiveness and visibility of their advertising , stations can figure out details about you from your activity OR your inactivity .
With those statistics , a service provider can see sooo effectively into your daily life , that they will be able to deduce , from your activity or inactivity , exactly what times you use the bathroom , if they really feel like it .
6 . This will be installed in 300 Million homes , and the tools to capture , analyze and report statistics will not need to be done by hand .
Instead of creating " night watch , " there will be a group of people whose only job it is , is to figure out ways to better analyze those statistics .
EVENTUALLY , those algorithms will get as advanced , or better than , what is currently used on the Internet .
When that happens , one can be labelled " suspicious " if they only fall outside of the patterns that those algorithms have predicted them to maintain .
This is already being done all over the Internet , on most every single MSM website .

Hey Ken ,
It 's Liz in South Carolina with a little story for ya .
About 12 years ago , a friend who is a legit psychic told me two things that are indeed coming to pass .
She first said " Mexico will be a part of the US but probably not a state " ... voila`
She also said the government would be able to see and hear you in your homes , through the tv .
I recently asked another friend about the digital conversion and he told me digital was necessary to send and receive messages on tv so I agree that we are now at least set up for this invasion .
That same psychic told me one other thing I had trouble visualizing at the time .
She said the state of " Florida would go away and be no more in my lifetime " .
Considering the storms we have been having lately , that does indeed seem possible .
Add to that that the " COM " running the war in the middle east is in Tampa and bingo .....
Thought I would share this with you and let you know how much I appreciate your website .

Dear Ken ,
About three years ago my daughter and I were staying with a friend who has a flat screen T.V .
While my daughter and her boyfriend were watching program one night a black box appeared on the screen ( monitor ) and the words " Oh but I 'm watching them " showed up in this box .
I personally saw the box appear , but not the words at a different time .
I had heard about the surveillance equipment being added to flat screens so to say the least this was creepy .
I am sure this was a T.V. that passed inspection but had an undetected flaw .
I believe there are many people waking up to BIG BROTHER , but as this happens Big Brother is ramping up the agenda .
Keep up the good work and THANK YOU for being out there .
I am considered CRAZY by most of my family and aquaintances .
But every once in a while I receive validation when what I have shared comes to pass .
It does n't take a psychic to see what is happening .
Kindest Regards ,

Ken Adachi ,
It would be extremely easy to add a camera ( without resorting to nanotech ) AND have it centered perfectly all the time :
Infrared receivers for remote controls need to have a direct angle to work properly , they could easily be replaced by a camera .
Digital cameras of all varieties have an infrared range that 's blocked by a filter ( http://geektechnique.org/index.php?id=254) and adding one could still pick up the RC 's signal .
In fact , I 'm willing to bet there 's a lot already in place on older equipment as well .
Some salvaged cable boxes might elaborate further .
Also , an actual camera is n't necessary to spy on PC monitors and TVs themselves :
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking
As for mics , I 've got one smaller than a pin built into an MP3 player that runs on 1 AAA battery ( made in China , of course , $ 25 ) .

Hi Ken !
In a recent job hunt in Phoenix , AZ , I found a disturbing opportunity targeted at college age people to earn $ 500 - $ 2500 and more a week , paid weekly .
There are many , many ads for security system companies , one that even advertised as a homeland security program , that are offering approximately $ 2000 worth of state - of - the - art , " On - Star like " monitoring systems for home use free of charge - the homeowner simply
pays for the monitoring service at a discount .
These sales programs are spreading across the country - ads on Craigslist are now recruiting college age people to travel for the summer and earn $ 25,000 or more while offering these systems door - to - door .
The pitch is that it's and " advertising discount " , and the equipment is being offered for free for the purpose of " advertisement " .
Naturally I was incredulous that a company like HONEYWELL would need to resort to such expensive " advertising " .
While attending orientation / training for one of these opportunities , we were informed that the equipment has 9 times the capacity of the human ear to listen to activity within the home , EVEN WHEN IT'S OFF .
This is presented as a feature to foil an in - home assailant .
Another disturbing aspect is that the top monitoring companies in the country ( ADT and MONITRONICS ) are attached to these programs , offering discounted monitoring services in a package with this expensive equipment .
I wanted to mention this to you , particularly after reading the articles on mandatory HD TV conversion and highway surveillance .
There are literally thousands of young adults being recruited for this program , to spread these systems into as many homes as possible !
FREE state - of - the - art equipment offered to as many homes as possible ... Feels like Big Brother 's hot breath on my neck !
Respectfully ,
Anna in AZ

" Watch TV shows from programs previously recorded on VHS tapes or from DVDs using your older TV and VCR equipment .
This could become a cottage industry overnight if enough people become aware of the covert surveillance agenda riding along on the coattails of the forced conversion to High Definition digital television .
You can listen to only television audio from many inexpensive radios that include the TV audio bands from channel 2 - 13
In most cases , audio is good enough for me .
I 'm mainly looking for those few comedy offerings here and there that will provide a laugh .
Most sitcoms are just awful : ' boring ' or ' banal ' would be complimentary descriptions .
Great advice -- listening to audio only assists in using our imaginations to generate visual pictures in our minds .
My mom would sometimes provide a pad of paper and pencil , and ask me to write stories , something I derived a great deal of enjoyment from .
This generates creativity and critical thought , and is something I did with my daughter and she is planning to do with my grandson .

Hi Ken ,
Thank you for the reply , I did n't think about unplugging the phone .
I will start doing that .
But moving onto the tv issue , can you tell me if you think we 're safe with only using dvd pre-recorded shows ?
I mean , they can't get a surveillance signal from the power outlet can they ?
This is the only thing that is making the connection between the outside world and in my home .
Also , I read the letter from the lady who 's daughter saw the box saying " we are watching them " .
You know something , I always thought " I " was crazy but in 1998 I was traveling and staying in a hotel .
One night I heard someone say , " I ca n't believe you 're doing that " .
I looked around and for a fraction of a second I saw someone on the TV looking at me ( and the tv was n't on ) .
To say the least , that was the beginning of me questioning everything , and whether or not it can actually be done technologically .
Thank you for all information and your website .
It appears that you are the only one who discusses most of these issue .
I can't find any other site discuss the in - home surveillance .

I just read the letters regarding in - home surveillance and the converting

never understood why everyone here is rushing out to get all of these new

Plus I have always questioned this government

I have a question , most likely a stupid
one though .
Three years ago I turned off all of our broad band internet

My
primary reason is due to having little children in the house , and I did n't
like the way TV and internet was going down hill .
So I now only buy DVD's
and play them on my widescreen projection TV , bought in 2001 .
If I never
plug back into cable , satillite , broadband , free TV via antenna , etc ; and
only watch TV shows via a DVD recording are we protected from this new
surveillance ?
PS .
I only use dial - up for my computer and unplug when I'm
done .
I do this mostly for virus protection , but in the back of my mind I
have wondered about an open port being used for other means .

re : Covert Surveillance Agenda Attached to Mandatory HD TV Conversion ?
http://educate-yourself.org/lte/HDtvcovertsurveillanceagenda12apr08.shtml
Mr. Ken Adachi ;
Having read your input on " Covert Surveillance Agenda Attached to Mandatory HD TV Conversion " : I 've posted comments regarding the very same subject matter on several sites ( www.Thothweb.com for one ) and only manage to receive negative feedback , attempting to dispute and divert away from my insights .
I am inclined to believe most of these sites serve at the whim of " OTHERS " as disinfo more so than info .
But I digress ...
I have noted that when placed side by side , that is a HDTV and an Analog TV , there is a delay in the signals coming from the HDTV .
There appears to be a two to three second drag , thereby creating a sort of echo effect from the analog TV .
It is apparent to me the ANALOG TV is operating in real time while the HDTV is operating on delayed time , much like they sometimes do on TV shows with so called explicit material which would allow them to beep out parts if necessary .
I was wondering if anyone else noticed the same and if so , what would be the cause to the signal delay coming from the HDTV ?
If you have infor on such , please email me back with the info and or post my question and or answer at your site .
Thanks for you time and consideration .

Hello L. Warren Bullard ,

I 'm assuming - only a guess - that they want to filter out On - Air SHAPESHIFTING - which many YouTube videos of Fox reporters , Bush daughter , etc. have been posted .
I feel there 's a mind control agenda involved and a MONITORING / SURVEILLANCE agenda .

Things Called Books - Normal Gets You Nowhere
EVERETT --
It 's a fad that 's picking up steam in Snoho­mish County 's hyper - competitive coffee market .
Espresso drive - through stands with bikini - and lingerie - sporting baristas are popping up from Monroe to Edmonds .
In the past year , at least six of these java joints employing provocatively dressed young women have opened in the county .
A few owners of these roadside stands say business is so brisk , they 're hiring more employees and have plans to open new locations .
" I brought a touch of Vegas back to Washington , " said Bill Wheeler , who opened Grab ' N ' Go Espresso on Highway 99 just south of Everett last year .
Wheeler says he aims to soon operate a dozen stands in Washington and Nevada , including one with male baristas in tight Speedos and bowties .
Sometimes wearing little more than pasties and bikini bottoms , the scantily clad baristas at Wheeler 's stands have scores of well - tipping customers .
While customers are expressing support with their pocketbooks , some people are complaining that these new businesses are pushing boundaries too far .
They 've told law enforcement officers and elected officials that they think the stands should be more tightly regulated .
" I 'm not against people making money , " said Kimberly Gainza , 37 , of Everett .
" What I 'm against is how they 're going about doing it .
It 's not right -- on a road where everybody can see . "
Gainza got a jolt a few weeks ago while stuck in traffic on Highway 99 .
She spotted a barista with bright blue stickers strategically placed on her chest standing at a stand 's drive - up window .
As long as genitals and nipples are covered , police say the stands do not violate indecent exposure laws .
Health officials and state Labor and Industries officials say there are no clothing requirements for baristas .
Gainza said she wants to change that and is hoping she can persuade policymakers to clamp down .
Wheeler , who said he employs his own 17 - year - old daughter at a stand , does n't understand what the fuss is about .
He said people wear more revealing outfits on beaches in the county .
Some competing businesses say " sexpresso " stands are changing the marketplace .
" In my opinion , it 's the end of our business , " said Tina Taylor , who has owned Giddy Up ' N ' Go Espresso south of Everett for eight years .
Since more racy stands opened north and south of her business , she 's seen traffic dip .
At times she 'll go an hour without a customer , she said .
Meanwhile , her competitors almost always seem to have cars lined up .
Ruth Oliver , who has owned R & R Espresso in Bothell for 17 years , said she is disturbed by the trend , especially the more risque businesses .
" I 'm not turning my place into a strip club because business is down , " she said .
" I 'd rather close down . "
Some stands are trying to cash in on the backlash .
They are displaying family - friendly signs and other messages including " We Make it Hot with our Tops On , " " R- rated Coffee ; PG - rated Girls " and " Known 4 Coffee Not Cleavage ! "
And there 's plenty of trash talking across the coffee divide .
Sara Barnfather , 22 , a barista with Stars and Stripes Espresso in Everett , said she 's " proud to be classy , not trashy . "
" If you like nipples and third - degree burns , go for it , " she said .
" But it 's not my cup of tea . "
Stars and Stripes owner Dale Fischer said he does n't plan on changing his business model .
" Do we really need scantily clad women to sell coffee ? " he said .
" Good grief .
I tell my girls , I 'm just not for it .
You get a different kind of customer altogether that go into those places . "
Still , the competition is cutthroat and there is immense pressure to stand out .
In Snohomish County alone , there are 150 businesses that have espresso as part of their name , according to the Snohomish Health District .
Add in Starbucks and McDonald 's recent venture into the gourmet coffee market , then factor in the price of milk and coffee being on the rise and it's a tough business .
John Ferguson , who owns an espresso stand in Edmonds , said the combination of corporate outlets and bikini stands along the Highway 99 corridor forced him three months to adopt a " sexy espresso " theme or go out of business .
" We saw our male clientele dwindle to next to nothing , " he said .
" It 's an ' If - you - ca n 't - beat - 'em , - join - 'em kind of thing . ' "
Jessica Bustare , 21 , Everett , sat on a bench and waited for a job interview outside the Grab ' N '
Go on a chilly afternoon early this week .
An athletic - looking 19 - year - old barista with blonde hair wearing a bikini and flip - flops took a bag of trash out of the shack and tossed it into a garbage bin .
" I do n't really consider this too sexual , " Bustare said .
" I think it 's fun and cute . "
Leslie Preskitt , 21 , a trim , upbeat barista at Cowgirls Espresso near downtown Everett , wore a pink - and - white striped bikini as she worked a silver espresso machine Wednesday afternoon .
She 's been working at the stand for three months and said she gets twice as much in tips in a day than she did in a full week when she worked at a coffee chain store .
Baristas at similar stands say they consistently fetch more than $ 100 a day in tips .
Preskitt , an Edmonds Community College student studying to be a paralegal , said she has had a few men say inappropriate things to her .
But that can happen anywhere , she said , and she 's learned to deflect those comments .
Cowgirls , a Seattle - based chain with three locations in Snohomish County , has a theme for every day of the week , including military Mondays , bikini Wednesdays and fantasy Fridays .
Company Chief Executive Scott Arbuckle said franchisees who operate 14 Cowgirls locations in Washington are told to follow specific decency rules aimed at protecting the brand name .
He said he admires the success of Hooters , an Atlanta - based restaurant chain , that has thrived in spite of vocal critics .
" We 're going to treat our employees with respect , " Arbuckle said .
" We 're never going to push the button and go over the edge . "
Carrie Smith , owner of the Mocha Boat in Lynnwood , said she switched themes six months ago after a competing stand hired young women to stand on the corner with pasties and tight shorts .
Business tripled after her employees started wearing more revealing outfits , she said .
" We had to close the stand or roll with it , " Smith said .
" I sold my soul for a dollar . "

The definition of what constitutes art now apparently contains giant roving robots , terrifying autonomous skeletons and flaming metal snakes .
These five pieces of art may sound awesome , until they 're killing you and everyone you love .
Most Fine
Arts majors will tell you , while serving your Double - Tall Latte , that all true artwork is dangerous .
What they will not tell you , however , is that in some cases it could also win a war single - handedly .
The Fire Shower
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The Fire Shower is one of the many interactive exhibits that combine audience participation , home - brew technology , and intense bodily harm by the San Francisco art collective known as SEEMEN .
The Fire Shower is a small , enclosed cage whose bars are equipped with high velocity rotors that spew flame at increasingly insane speeds until the volunteer is engulfed in a miniature fire tornado aimed solely at their exposed flesh .
Why , you might ask ?
Because art is awesome .
That 's why .
The artist claims :
Kal Spelitech , the creator of the fire shower explains , " Working with fire is like playing with a wild animal .
It is quite mesmerizing , but at any second it can turn on us .
Using fire as an art medium always has a certain unpredictability and risk involved .
On the highest level , my artwork involves pushing the envelope between terror and play and seeing how much I can involve audiences with a medium that may kill them ...
I began to think about my work and what I could do there that would bring people closer to fire as an art or existential / transcendent experience ...
Fear of death has always been a major cause of social change , and challenging people 's fear of fire is always interesting . "
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Our explanation :
We have to admit , Kal is pretty plain in what he 's trying to do here : Light people on fire .
He even admits freely that burning is a hilarious game to him , and that he really enjoys people 's fear of death .
Nobody can blame Kal for misleading us about exactly what his horrifying machines do .
Indeed , it seems as if he 's actually trying to warn you away .
Instead , blame the art crowd for interpreting these statements as the main thesis points of a revolutionary performance piece and not , more accurately , as a sociopath 's description of a " flamethrower prison for the innocent . "
Danger level :
The Fire shower is built to a set specification .
If you are n't grown to the exact proportions it was intended to hold , there are no safety precautions .
If you 're too fat , hey , no problem !
It 'll burn those unsightly pounds right off of you in a frighteningly literal fashion .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
That may seem like a joke , but seriously , burns are not actually that uncommon .
People frequently emerge from the shower " missing hair and smoking . "
Although to be fair , the Fire Shower does rely solely on volunteers -- you have to actually walk up to it and step inside , even after it 's explained to you that it is a walk - in barbecue for fat people .
It 's not exactly going to sneak into your home and replace your normal bathing station with its desperate , fiery embrace .
Well , not that 's been proven anyway .
The price of wheat , as well as that of rice , corn and other crops , has dramatically risen in recent times .
Scientists are pondering a new " green revolution , " half a century after the first one , to solve a growing food shortage that has reached crisis proportions in some countries .
American consumers are experiencing the trickle - down effects of the lack of food .
People in Haiti , Mexico , Guinea , Mauritania , Morocco , Senegal , Uzbekistan , Yemen and other countries have taken to the streets in recent weeks and months to protest the rising costs of food .
An official with the World Food Program yesterday called it a " silent tsunami " of world hunger .
The causes are many , including rising fuel prices , the diversion of land to grow biofuel instead of food crops and droughts in Australia , one of the world 's main producers of wheat .
Additionally , the global population is growing , notably in places such as India and China , where increasing prosperity has allowed more people to buy more and finer food .
Many people look to science to ease the pinch — after all , it worked once before .
Between the 1940s and 1970s , major advances in food technology — such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides , improved seed varieties , better irrigation and farm technology — led to huge gains in the amount of food the world 's farmers were able to grow .
This " green revolution " caused crop yields in Mexico , Asia and other areas of the world to shoot up , protecting many people from starvation .
Although some of these technologies were found to have drawbacks — for example , chemical fertilizer can deplete the soil of nutrients and pollute water — the green revolution undeniably saved lives .
The question is : Can science do it again ?
Another green revolution
" Absolutely , science is going to play a key role , " said Kent Bradford , director of the Seed Biotechnology Center at the University of California , Davis .
" The fact is that the reason we have been able to have food and [ have ] not had these shortages for the last 40 years is in fact the green revolution and the technologies that went with it .
If we are really going to make a quantum leap , raise the yield thresholds significantly , then probably biotechnology is going to help . "
Researchers around the world at sites like the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center ( CIMMYT ) in Mexico are studying how to improve crops and farming techniques to address worldwide hunger .
By breeding staple crops such as wheat , rice , maize , and soy to be more pest - and weed - resistant , more nutrient - rich and high - yielding , they hope to offer more nutrition per acre of farmed land .
Science can also provide new tools to increase crop production , such as an optical sensor to scan crops in order to customize fertilizer to plants ' needs .
" I can't ask a plant how it feels , but I can sense it with optical sensors , " said CIMMYT researcher Bram Govaerts .
" This is a perfect example of how instead of throwing away the green revolution techniques , we can rationally apply them .
That technology already exists . "
Other tools , such as a multi-use , multi-crop machine , could also make a huge difference , Govaerts said .
The technology allows farmers to plant many different crops under many different conditions .
The result would not only increase the variety of nutrients farmers eat , but would allow them to farm more sustainably , since land growing a single crop is more susceptible to disease and soil degradation than land on which different crops rotate .
In addition to new technologies , experts say simple changes in agricultural practices could also accomplish a lot .
" In my opinion , if we have another green revolution it 's going to be because people very seriously address the issue of soil management , " said Matthew Reynolds , a CIMMYT wheat physiologist .
" That could really give a quantum leap in productivity . "
Conventional farming techniques , such as plowing , which is traditionally used to disrupt the growth of weeds , break down soil 's healthy structure and biological processes , he said .
By reducing plowing , and keeping the straw residue on fields after crops are harvested , the soil could support much larger yields .
Battle over biotechnology
Some scientists think the key to truly ending world hunger lies in genetically manipulating crops to provide boons that nature cannot match .
Already crops such as
Bt corn , which produces its own insecticide , and Roundup Ready crops , which are resistant to the commonly - used herbicide Roundup , are sold by the U.S. company Monsanto on the domestic market , though they are banned in Europe .
Golden Rice is a type of rice engineered by Ingo Potrykus of the Institute of Plant Sciences at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg to produce beta- carotene , a source of vitamin A .
The scientists intended to distribute the rice seeds free to subsistence farmers in vitamin A - deficient areas , but this plan was opposed by critics of genetically - engineered crops such as Greenpeace .
The crop is not yet available .
Proponents of genetically - modified ( GM ) organisms say that in order to solve the world 's hunger issues , we must embrace these kinds of scientific interventions into nature .
" If we are really going to raise the yield thresholds significantly then probably biotechnology is going to help .
For example , if we can make wheat and rice more like corn , the plants could be more productive , " UC - Davis 's Bradford said .
The photosynthesis process in corn allows the crop to thrive with less water .
" It would be very complicated to do , but it may be possible . "
Or , he suggested , scientists may be able to engineer plants so they are more nutritious for humans .
" Grain sorghum is a very important crop in Africa , " Bradford said .
" Unfortunately , its protein is relatively undigestible — the nutrient is inefficiently metabolized .
There is work in trying to modify sorghum so the protein is more digestible .
That would be a huge bonus . "
But many people question the wisdom of dabbling in complicated natural processes that we do n't fully understand .
" I think using genetically - engineered crops would not only not solve the situation , but it would continue to put the food supply at risk , " said Ryan Zinn , campaign coordinator for the Organic Consumers Association , a non-profit organization .
" When you 're messing with the crop 's genome , you run the risk of opening Pandora 's box .
What people do n't realize is that the FDA does not test these crops .
They 've been out on the market , they 're not labeled , and they 've got some potentially significant human health consequences . "
These consequences may include a reduction in nutrients or inclusions of harmful pesticides , he said .
Defenders of GM crops say many of these fears are unfounded .
" Nobody can point to a single thing to say there 's been unintended health consequences , " Bradford told LiveScience .
" While it 's always possible , it 's also possible that breeding crops could have unintended health consequences .
It 's a matter of balancing risks and benefits .
The risks are exceedingly small , but the benefits are tangible . "
Superfood
Even some of biotechnology 's biggest fans are skeptical that scientists could ever create a superfood to cure all the world 's hunger problems , such as a daily pill with all the nutrients a person needs .
" I do n't really see getting your complete nutrition from some kind of single food , " Bradford said .
" Why would anybody want to ?
It would be boring to just eat a pill . "
Science is closer than you may think to some radical solutions , though .
Researchers are hard at work on animal - free meat .
Scientists , such as Henk Haagsman , a professor of meat science at Utrecht University in the Netherlands , are growing synthetic meat with the help of animal stem cells .
When fed with glucose , amino acids , minerals and growth factors , the stem cells can grow into muscle tissue , which the researchers say tastes a lot like ground meat .
Though it may sound far - fetched , proponents of so - called cultivated meat say this could be a key to solving world hunger problems .
" The benefits could be enormous , " said Jason Matheny , the director of New Harvest , a non-profit organization that funds research on in vitro meat .
" The demand for meat is increasing worldwide … With a single cell , you could theoretically produce the world 's annual meat supply .
And you could do it in a way that 's better for the environment and human health .
In the long term , this is a very feasible idea . "
Long - term solutions
This week United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon announced the formation of a U.N. task force to address the problem of mass hunger and food shortages .
The Secretary - General stressed the importance of economic aid in the short term to deal with the crisis , but discussed the need for scientific advances in the long term .
" Whatever the factors are , the overall amount of food consumption has gone up , relative to the amount of supply , and we need to find a way to deal with that , " said Farhan Haq , a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon .
" What 's needed is trade and investment being used to bring about a green revolution — technologies that can improve agricultural productivity , particularly across Africa , but in general as well . "
Texture Synthesis
Efros & Leung 's Algorithm
Matlab source : synth.m
Efros & Leung 's algorithm is remarkably simple .
First , initialize a synthesized texture with a 3x3 pixel " seed " from the source texture .
For every unfilled pixel which borders some filled pixels ( I think of this as a pixel on the ' frontier ' ) , find a set of patches in the source image that most resemble the unfilled pixel 's filled neighbors .
Choose one of those patches at random and assign to the unfilled pixel a color value from the center of the chosen patch .
Do this a few thousand times , and you 're done .
The only crucial parameter is how large of a neighborhood you consider when searching for similar patches .
As you can see in the examples below , as the " window size " increases , the resulting textures capture larger structures of the source image .
If you want to implement this algorithm , there are some finer details you should read about in the paper linked below .
I implemented this as a homework for Rob Fergus ' Computational Photography class .
If you 're interested in this sort of thing , check out the course website , which has many more interesting papers .
Reference : Texture Synthesis by Non-parametric Sampling
Source 3 x 3 window 5 x 5 window 7 x 7 window 11 x 11 window 15 x 15 window 19 x 19 window
Parametric Synthesis : Not So Great
Matlab source : synth_gmm.m , EM_GM.m
I started from Efros & Leung 's algorithm and rewrote it to use an explicit patch density model .
Instead of measuring the distance from the current synthesized patch to every patch in the original image , I sample a few patches from a Gaussian mixture model and use the sample with lowest distance .
This trades a terrible start - up cost ( waiting for EM to converge ) for a much quicker per-pixel running time .
If the visual performance were comparable , this scheme would be well - suited for synthesizing large textures .
Unfortunately , the results from the mixture model do n't look so great .
When I have time , I 'm hoping to try this with a Restricted Boltzmann Machine .
When I read James Howard Kunstler 's ( JHK ) book The Long Emergency , it had a profound impact on me .
I had been aware for many years that " running out of oil " was a serious matter .
After all , I took on the challenge of peak oil in my graduate thesis in 1995 .
But my focus was more on finding a source that could replace oil as it ran out .
Reading
The Long Emergency was the first time it really hit me that I was missing a lot of key pieces of the picture .
The impact of The Long Emergency was n't necessarily because I thought JHK 's vision of the future was correct , but it made me think about possibilities .
It caused me to look at the suburbs in a new light , and to really appreciate how vulnerable the U.S. is to oil shocks .
It made me realize that problems will start to crop up – not when we run out of oil – but simply when supplies can't meet demand .
In the U.S. , we built a society based on cheap oil , in which one can live 40 miles from work and drive a gas guzzler to and from work each day .
As I read his book , it sank in that this model was likely to come to an end sooner rather than later .
And just as soon as I finished reading it , I got a copy of Matt Simmons ' Twilight in the Desert and read it .
Those two books helped me decide that I needed to start trying to educate people about energy issues .
In JHK 's latest book – World Made by Hand – he shares his vision of life after oil .
It 's a far cry from the future I imagined as a child ; a future in which man was conquering the galaxy and we were all flying around like the Jetsons .
The future JHK evokes resembles the Wild West of 150 years ago – except with a few modern touches surviving .
The book is set in upstate New York ( JHK 's home state ) in the fictional town of Union Grove .
In this world , life is very hard .
There are no cars , electricity is rarely on , wars have wiped out major U.S. cities ( Washington D.C. was wiped out on my birthday , 12/21 ) , religion has made a resurgence , warlords carve out territory , and lawlessness is rampant .
But communities are much tighter , the food is healthier , neighbors lend a helping hand , and people have to be a lot more self sufficient .
I believe these latter aspects of the future world represents a future that JHK would like to see .
As with his previous book , this one caused me to think about possibilities I had not previously considered .
I spent a lot of my time pausing to evaluate whether I felt like a particular scenario was likely .
I think if you accept the key premise – that no more oil is available – then the future he envisions is probably pretty close to the mark .
Oil provides all kinds of conveniences that we take for granted , and I doubt the average person realizes how different their world would be if the taps dried up .
Yet that is the world that JHK has produced in this novel .
But that 's not the way I think things will play out .
If you read between the lines , the book is set no more than 15 years into the future .
The date is never given , but there is a mention of a woman in her 90's who was a nurse in WWII .
Assuming 20 as a minimum age , then the setting of the book is some time between now and maybe 2025 at the latest .
I simply do n't believe we will lose our mechanized transport options in that time frame .
On my recent trip to India , I saw a lot of people who were using very little fuel , but were still getting around by motorized transport .
We have such a tremendous amount of fat that we can cut from our fuel consumption .
It may be that by 2020 we do have a lot less oil available , but oil will still be available .
And some countries – Brazil for instance – are not likely to run into supply issues for many years .
It is hard to envision a world in which the U.S. has no more access to oil , but Brazil is motoring happily along .
Even though there is n't much mention about the rest of the world in the book – mainly because there is little communication with the rest of the world – I could n't help but imagine that in JHK 's world there were a lot of countries that would have been able to maintain their fuel supplies .
The book touched upon a lot of themes that I have thought about over the years .
Long before I was involved in writing about energy , I was a student of evolutionary biology .
One of the things that my studies made me appreciate is that modern medicine has allowed many genes to persist in the gene pool that centuries ago would have been cruelly weeded out by evolution .
What that means is that most of us are carrying around genes that are only mildly deleterious in the age of modern medicine , but could quickly shorten our life spans without modern medicine .
And in this book , JHK pulled modern medicine out from under the population .
The result is as I would expect – vast numbers of people died out .
I have speculated before that without modern medicine , more than 90 % of the population would likely be dead within 10 years from conditions that today do n't trouble us too much .
Consider your own health .
Have you been hospitalized for appendicitis ?
How many times have you required antibiotics to treat something common like strep throat ?
Have you required surgery ?
These are all things that can kill without modern medicine .
So I have a great appreciation for modern medicine .
When I go to a developing country like India that 's one of the first things I think about :
Do the people have access to modern medicine ?
Without modern mecicine , I shudder to think about having a serious , painful injury or illness .
Another theme that I have thought a lot about – and that JHK tackled in the book – was mining of the municipal dumps .
I have often thought about the amount of metals , useful plastics , and just various odds and ends that would be of enormous benefit in a resource - depleted world .
I have no doubt that regardless of how the future plays out , there will come a time that we are mining the dumps regularly .
One thing that I have n't discussed yet is the story itself .
I really did n't expect much from the story .
The real story for me was what a world without oil might look like .
But the underlying story was actually pretty good .
The characters are really interesting , he makes the relationships interesting , and he throws a few surprises into the mix .
I have to hand it to JHK – he tells a good tale .
Some of the characters ( and names ) seemed a bit over the top , but otherwise I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen next .
So I got a bonus in that aspect .
If you are like me , and you enjoy thinking about possibilities ( good or bad ) , then this book is definitely food for thought .
If you want to remain oblivious to the threat of peak oil , or are otherwise convinced that technology will enable the status quo to remain , then you probably wo n't care for it ( although again the book is worth a read for the story itself ) .
Footnote : JHK responded to this review via e-mail .
He thanked me for the review , said he felt that it was " goldurn fair " , and added " Of course any thinking person can come up with alternate valid scenarios that differ from mine in particulars ( of what the future may actually be like ) .
I took some ' literary liberties '...
Mainly I compressed the time scale of ' Long Emergency ' conditions gaining traction ....
News and information on the rapidly unfolding economic crisis is pouring forth on a daily basis .
" Prominent investment bank announces $ 10 Billion write - down and records first quarterly loss in years ;
Stocks tumble as fallout from housing crisis spreads ; Rating agencies criticized for role in credit crunch " represent a small cross-section of headlines .
Unfortunately , most of the reporting speaks to the crisis itself and its ultimate causes , rather than to what the near future holds and to what can be done to prevent a complete collapse .
Too much ink has been spilled trying to understand whether the crisis was inevitable and by extension , whether more or less financial regulation would have produced a different outcome .
Perhaps , there exist more important questions , such as " What can be done now ? " and " Is recession inevitable ? "
This paper aims to explore - if not answer - these questions , through the prism of US monetary policy .
In short , what can the Federal Reserve Bank do to forestall economic recession , or is it already too late ?
Housing Bubble : From 2001 to 2005 , millions of mortgages were extended to unqualified borrowers , enabling a record run-up in housing prices .
As the Fed raised interest rates to cool the economy , many of these homeowners suddenly found themselves unable to make payments on their mortgages , especially those of the adjustable rate variety .
Since the inception of the credit crunch , a sudden aversion to risk and the foreclosure on millions of properties has led to a tremendous supply / demand imbalance in the housing market .
As a result , prices have certainly stopped rising and even started falling in certain regional markets .
The National Association of Realtors recently announced that 2007 saw the largest drop in existing home sales in 25 years , and " the first price decline in many , many years and possibly going back to the Great Depression . "
All of this data presents an economic problem of catastrophic proportions because most of the average American family ’s equity is tied up in its home .
During the boom , many families refinanced or borrowed using home equity loans , which was used to fuel corresponding booms in spending and in the stock market .
The situation has since reversed itself .
According to Merrill Lynch , " Nearly 9 million households now have upside - down mortgages , and for the first time ever , aggregate mortgage debt is bigger than the total value of homeowner equity by $ 836 billion . "
In short , says US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , the " housing decline is the most significant risk to our economy . "
Wall Street :
On a related note , the second area of economic concern is Wall Street , which both packaged the mortgage securities in question and invested heavily in them .
In February 2007 , HSBC became the first investment bank to acknowledge losses ( $ 10.5 Billion ) on subprime investments , kicking off the credit crunch .
Since then , virtually every financial institution - with the notable exception of Goldman Sachs - has announced massive write - downs on subprime investments .
Estimates are hard to come by , but at least $ 160 Billion in losses have already been accounted for .
How much worthless debt remains on the books is anyone ’s guess .
The low estimate , $ 285 Billion , was offered by S&P ( rating agency ) and the high estimate of $ 600 Billion is claimed by UBS ( investment bank ) , which recently wrote down $ 20 Billion of its own investments .
These write - downs are driven by a widespread default rate on subprime mortgages , estimated by one analyst at 30 - 40 % .
As a result of the defaults , several prominent hedge funds have collapsed , scattering debris to the four corners of the financial universe .
Of more significance is the breakdown of financial institutions , themselves .
Bear Stearns , an investment bank , collapsed suddenly and spectacularly , such that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had to cobble together an 11th hour sale of the firm to JP Morgan in order for Bear to avoid declaring bankruptcy and risk destabilizing the entire financial system .
Then there are the companies that insure the mortgage securities , and the lending institutions that originated them , which are also in trouble .
Finally , the quasi - governmental organizations FANNIE MAE and FREDDIE MAC , which provide the system with liquidity by acting as buyers of last resort for mortgages , have capped their exposure due to mounting losses .
In short , any assessment of the likelihood of recession must first estimate the risk of further unanticipated subprime write - downs and consequent bankruptcies in the financial sector .
Inflation : Shifting gears for a moment , the second item of concern is inflation .
While not technically germane to the discussion of economic weakness , inflation is important because it limits the Fed ’s ability to loosen its monetary policy .
While the Fed ’s mandate is not specifically to facilitate price stability ( as compared to most Central Banks ) , it is still an important factor in its monetary policy .
The current situation is unique because inflation is rising while economic growth is falling , threatening to return the US to the " stagflation " of the 1970s .
The prices of commodities have risen dramatically over the last year .
Gold and oil recently breached the psychologically important thresholds of $ 1000 / ounce and $ 100 / barrel , respectively , though they have since retreated .
Prices of certain food staples , such as rice and corn , have doubled , due to surging demand in emerging markets and shortages caused by a shifting of farmland to the production of biofuels .
In addition , the value of the USD has eroded the purchasing power of US consumers .
[ The Dollar has fallen by 70 % against the Euro over the last five years ] .
The US is on pace to import nearly $ 2.5 Trillion worth of goods and services in 2008 , which means every 1 % in currency depreciation costs the US $ 25 Billion !
As a result , the US consumer price index ( CPI ) is growing at an annualized clip of 4 % , well above the stated comfort zone of 2 % .
This could inhibit the Fed from cutting rates further .
No Confidence : Connected to inflation is the loss of confidence among consumers .
According to Merrill Lynch , " By the end of 2007 , 36 percent of consumers ’ disposable income went to food , energy and medical care , a bigger chunk than at any time since records were first kept in 1960 . "
The same article also noted that more families are eating meals at home , a sign that discretionary spending is being curtailed .
Consumption represents the backbone of the US economy .
Thus , it bodes ill that consumer confidence is at its lowest level since the early 90’s , having dipped below the trough it reached during the 2001 recession .
Even Starbucks has admitted feeling nervous ; during a recent press conference , it suggested that the ailing consumer could interfere with its corporate restructuring plan .
In addition , unemployment is slowly creeping up , recently breaching the 5 % mark for the first time in two years .
Since unemployment is a lagging economic indicator , it wo n’t peak until one to two years after the height of the economic downturn .
It should be noted that financial institutions are leading the way in job cuts , by trimming their own staff .
Credit Spreads : Credit Spreads refer to the cost of capital , for both debt and equity , which lenders and shareholders receive in compensation for risk .
The spread is basically a percentage tacked onto the risk - free rate ( yield on US Treasury Securities ) .
One of the main symptoms of the credit crunch is widening credit spreads , in which investors demand higher interest rates to compensate them for higher perceived risks .
As a result , many bond and equity issues have been delayed , as companies wait for more favorable conditions to emerge .
In addition , hedge funds and private equity funds are finding it increasingly difficult to raise funds to support their activities , which is negatively impacting stock market valuations .
From an economic perspective , credit spreads are problematic because companies are either unable or unwilling to secure the capital required for massive projects and consequently from hiring workers to develop and staff those projects .
Underlying the widening of credit spreads is a collapse in trust .
An unnaturally large percentage of securities that were rated AAA ( very unlikely to default ) and that were recommended by investment banks , now run the risk of default , which makes investors reluctant to lend and invest further .
In fact , " global first - quarter underwriting volume tumbled 45 % from a year earlier to $ 1.27 trillion , and fees collected by Wall Street investment banks fell 47 % to $ 5.8 billion , " according to the Wall Street Journal .
From the standpoint of the Fed , widening credit spreads are problematic because even if it cuts rates , investors may still demand the same return , and net liquidity wo n’t change .
Sagging Stock Market : Since peaking in early October , all of the major US stock market indices have declined .
The S&P 500 , the broadest measure of US stock market performance , is down 16 % .
In fact , the first quarter of 2008 marked the worst start of a year ever for US equities .
That ’s EVER .
These numbers are significant because the stock market is considered a reliable leading indicator for the economy .
Thus , the collapse in stock market prices - which may not yet have bottomed out - signify that investors are bearish on the economy ’s near - term prospects for recovery .
In addition , the downward trend in stocks has been accompanied by a surge in volatility .
According to the Wall Street Journal , " the S&P 500 moved more than 1 % on 51 % of the trading days in the first quarter , the biggest percentage since 1934 and the fifth - largest percentage in the index ’s history . "
Moreover , the Fed ’s interest rate cuts , which were intended to create liquidity in the various financial markets , failed to lift stocks and reinforced the notion that the wounds inflicted by the credit crunch are too deep to be healed by monetary policy alone .
Monetary Policy : The Fed , itself , represents the next reason why it may be too late for the Fed to act to prevent recession .
Interest rates have already been cut by a total of 300 basis points , capped by a massive 75 basis point cut on March 18 .
As a result , the benchmark Federal Funds Rate now stands at 2.25 % , which is actually negative when adjusted for inflation .
Speaking of inflation , the Fed will likely hesitate to lower rates further because doing so would come at the expense of price stability .
Furthermore , monetary policy is not the only area where the Fed has been active ; it has also announced that it will set aside up to $ 400 Billion for lending to financial institutions and banks .
The Fed will offer both short - term loans and longer - term loans collateralized by illiquid mortgage - backed securities in an effort to increase lending activity .
" The Federal Reserve …is trying to ease an acute credit squeeze by agreeing to hold large volumes of mortgage - backed bonds that Wall Street firms are struggling to sell and providing them with … cash . "
Finally , the Fed will take on a larger regulatory and oversight role of the financial sector .
The unregulated origination and subsequent repackaging and collateralizing of mortgages is considered one of the prime causes of the current crisis .
In short , the Fed may have hamstrung itself by acting too quickly and exhausting the tools in its arsenal .
Fiscal Policy :
When monetary policy is n’t enough , the next best alternative is fiscal policy .
Unfortunately for the Fed , Washington lawmakers have already acted , unveiling a $ 150 Billion economic stimulus package .
The plan is supposed to ignite the economy through tax cuts to individuals , families and small businesses .
President Bush has personally insisted that the stimulus plan is all that is needed to return the economy to solid footing , but the government ’s track record suggests that the outcome is far from certain .
Taxpayers behaving rationally would save , rather than spend their tax rebates , in anticipation of future , offsetting tax increases .
Either way , it will be three to six months before economists can begin to measure the effects of the tax rebates .
Based on the grim situation outlined above , it appears the Fed ’s hands ARE tied .
All of the leading indicators , namely those which measure confidence and stock market performance , suggest that the prospects for averting recession are bleak .
In addition , both the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Government have already unveiled massive initiatives to prime the pump of the economy and stimulate lending and consumption , respectively .
The Fed is constrained from lowering rates further because of inflation , and the government is loath to spend more because of the fiscal deficit .
Thus , both entities may be relegated to the sidelines for the duration of the crisis , watching with baited breath to see if their actions were sufficient to prevent a complete economic collapse .
Railway turns to feline ' stationmaster ' for help
( Agencies )

KINOKAWA , Japan --
In times of need , Japanese say they can even ask the cat for help .
In this town in western Japan , people look to Tama , a nine - year - old cat working as master of an unmanned train station .
The tortoiseshell coloured creature , born and raised at Kishi Station on the provincial Kishigawa Line , wears a formal uniform cap of Wakayama Electric Railway and calmly watches passing passengers who greet her .
There are 10 train stations on the 14.3 - kilometre ( 8.9 - mile ) line .
Wearing a stationmaster 's cap of Wakayama Electric Railway , the nine - year - old female tortoiseshell cat named " Tama " sits on a ticket gate at Kishi station on the Kishigawa line in the city of Kinokawa , in Wakayama prefecture , on May 22 .
[ Agencies ]
" Tama is the only stationmaster as we have to reduce personnel costs .
You say you could ask for the cat 's help , but she is actually bringing luck to us , " Wakayama Electric spokeswoman Keiko Yamaki said .
The company feeds her in lieu of salary .
Tama was born from a stray cat brought to the station by a cleaner and kept by Toshiko Koyama , a local who runs a grocery store next door .
The station went unmanned in April 2006 as the line was losing money .
But Tama stuck around .
She rose to national stardom in January 2007 as the railway company formally appointed her as " stationmaster " .
Her appointment had an immediately positive effect , boosting the number of passengers using the line in January by 17 percent from a year earlier .
For the year to March 2007 , the number of passengers rose to 2.1 million , up 10 percent from the previous 12 months , according to Yamaki .
Happy with her successful job as stationmaster , the company promoted Tama to " super- stationmaster " in January this year , making her " the only female in a managerial position " in the company 's 36 - strong workforce .
" She now holds the fifth highest position in the company , " Yamaki joked .
In reward for the promotion , Tama got a new " office " .
The stationmaster 's office , a renovated former ticket booth at the station , opened in April with the attendance of Kinokawa Mayor Shinji Nakamura and Wakayama Electric president Mitsunobu Kojima .
The office guarantees her some privacy .
" She declines to relieve herself when passengers are looking .
We set the toilet where passengers can't see , " Yamaki said .
Those who want to greet her must be careful so as not to miss her .
" She works nine to five and takes Sundays off , " Yamaki said .
Tama commutes with Koyama , the grocery store operator , from a shed next to the station .
As Koyama tells her , " Ms Stationmaster , it 's time to work , " Tama comes along to the station , Yamaki said .
The stationmaster is set to appear in a French documentary film , being directed by Myriam Tonelotto , about wonder cats from around the world .
On Wednesday , a McCain campaign spokesperson outlined a surprisingly reasonable position on whether to hold telcos accountable for illegally spying on millions of Americans .
EFF applauded his position at the time .
But earlier today , the McCain campaign claimed that they had made a mistake , saying the report " incorrectly represented " his position , which now is that " companies who assist the government " should be granted amnesty in the pending FISA legislation .
The revised position is difficult to reconcile with McCain 's previous positions on the NSA warrantless wiretapping program .
Right after the New York Times revealed the Bush Administration 's warrantless wiretapping program , McCain expressed his doubts about the program , telling MSNBC “ Theoretically , I obviously would n’t like it . "
When interviewed by CBS News , McCain was asked how he would feel if subjected to surveillance :
CBS : Well Senator , how do you personally feel about it .
Not only are you a lawmaker , you 're also a citizen .
If you are on a phone call to somewhere overseas , and you found out the government was listening in , how would you feel about that ?
MCCAIN : In my case , or any other innocent American 's case , obviously I would n't like that , just because of the privacy concerns ....
In the telecom litigation , we are suing on behalf of these innocent Americans , all of whom have no connection to terrorism .
And they do not like it any more than McCain does .
Speaking to Matt Lauer on the Today show that same month , McCain agreed with that " it is up to a court of law to find out if someone broke the law here and if punishment should be handed out . "
Immunity for the telecommunications companies , however , would prevent the court from ruling on the legality of the President 's program .
More recently , McCain clarified his position on the underlying legal issues with the Boston Globe :
Does the president have inherent powers under the Constitution to conduct surveillance for national security purposes without judicial warrants , regardless of federal statutes ?
There are some areas where the statutes do n’t apply , such as in the surveillance of overseas communications .
Where they do apply , however , I think that presidents have the obligation to obey and enforce laws that are passed by Congress and signed into law by the president , no matter what the situation is .
Okay , so is that a no , in other words , federal statute trumps inherent power in that case , warrantless surveillance ?
I do n't think the president has the right to disobey any law .
In short , despite the ire of the conservative pundits like Andrew McCarthy , McCain has previously rejected the Bush Administration 's legal rationale for the warrantless surveillance program , sympathized with the millions of innocent Americans caught up in the NSA spying , and opined that the Courts should have the chance to determine whether the law was broken .
Given these statements , it is surprising and disappointing that McCain so strongly supports the Bush Administration 's efforts to prevent the courts from ruling on the claims of innocent Americans in the telecom litigation .
Senator , it 's time to straighten your talk : please match your actions with your words , and stand up to defend the rights of Americans to be free from warrantless surveillance .

Not specifically , no .
I looked at the original series as mythos and the way it dealt with religion as sort of a global sense .
I was aware that Glen had used Mormon influences and how he had created the cosmology , but I 'm not that familiar with Mormon belief or practice .
To me there were things that were sort of obvious , the twelve tribes , the twelve tribes of Israel .
At the beginning , I sort of assumed that the Colonials -- the human beings -- would have a belief system , probably polytheistic .
In the original , the " Lords of Kobol " were referred to several times .
But it was n't until the development of the miniseries when I sort of randomly gave the Cylons a belief system .
I was creating the characters and working on some lines for Number 6 and I thought it was interesting if she professed a belief in a single God .
I had really given her a belief in a singular God almost by accident .
I compared that with the polytheistic religion of the colonials , I started to realize that an interesting pattern was developing -- the Cylons believing in the one true God and the Colonials having an older , multifaceted system of deities that was obviously patterned on the Romans .
As the series went on , I started to believe that the Cylon belief was going to be a guiding principal .
People are really noticing the dichotomy between the Pagan and the monotheistic themes .
It strongly parallels the rise of Christianity and the demise of paganism in the Western world .
That 's true .
There was a book that I started reading about the one god driving out the many -- the rise of monotheism in the Western world and how it came to displace pagan religion .
Those themes were interesting to play with in the show :
The dynamic whereby the pagan religious practices tended to be tolerant and tended to allow monotheistic beliefs within their own culture .
That 's true .

Those themes were interesting to play with in the show :
The dynamic whereby the pagan religious practices tended to be tolerant and tended to allow monotheistic beliefs within their own culture .
And then there came this came this notion of this outside monotheistic belief , of the one true God that could not tolerate others , that started to drive out pagan worship and that fit very nicely with what we were doing with the show .
Because you had this apocalyptic moment of genocide which kicked off the entire series , of this Cylon culture that has this belief system in one god that is literally wiping out this pagan belief system and then is pursuing them across the galaxy .
There was a certain resonance in history .
Some viewers say the show stereotypes fundamentalist Christians as kind of robotic , while others are saying , " This is great ... pagans are finally the good guys ! "
The parallels between the Cylon beliefs and fundamentalist Christian beliefs , yeah , there are certain aspects of it there , but there 's also the roots of the drama , also contains things such as Al Qaeda 's use of its religious practice to justify what it does .
That 's part of who the Cylons are too , they are n't just really stalking horses for fundamentalist Christianity .
There also seem to be elements of Eastern religions in the show with Leoben Conoy , another Cylon , talking about consciousness and reincarnation .
Does each of the different models of Cylons represent a different religious point of view ?
I think that 's true .
Part of the idea of Leobon was to separate it from easy stereotypes of Christian beliefs .
There was n't really a hierarchical church , there was n't an easy notion of heaven and hell .
Leoben was starting to talk about things that were more Buddhist -- consciousness , enlightenment and reincarnation .
I thought it was interesting to marry those notions to the idea of one deity .
The Cylon named Number 6 seems to be suffering from a Madonna / whore complex , talking about sin and redemption while leading Dr. Baltar to bed .
Part of that is who those characters are within the Cylon pantheon .
We 've said that there are only 12 models of Cylons , because the Cylons look at humanity and say there 's only 12 different kinds of human , when you get right down to it .

Six 's belief system and the way she practices it is very specific to her character and her model of Cylon .
She is sort of a Madonna / whore made real and has a very strict , if odd , sense of God and what God wants .
Leobon is more of a thinker and has a more esoteric idea of how things work in the universe .
But they both proceed from the same root , that they both believe there is one God who sets everything in motion and has a real sort of impact and interaction with the universe .
Why focus so heavily on the Cylon religion and not the human beliefs ?
Because the Cylons are the engine that drives the entire series .
The Cylons come back with a vengeance and have this belief system in place .

The Cylons come back with a vengeance and have this belief system in place .
The interest in the Cylons is this notion of " why are our enemies doing this ?
What is it they believe , why would anybody behave like this , what kind of monsters would carry out something like that ? "
It 's not just that they 're space Nazis , it 's that they have an intricate belief system that leads them to this horrific answer .
The show is paralleling today 's political climate and reflecting world events ...
Absolutely .
The show is really supposed to be about our society and political structure , the conversations we have today in the culture .
Hopefully , the show is able to examine those things from a different perspective without making it as simple as the Cylons are Al Qaeda and Laura Roslin ( the President ) is George Bush .
I do n't think the show offers you easy answers on why Al Qaeda does what Al Qaeda does , but I think it gives you an easy reference into how an entire culture , or entire group of people can believe something so fervently that seems so unfathomable at the beginning .

Many of the episodes deal with religion very heavily .
Why do you think people will watch a sci - fi show that involves a lot of religious themes , but might not watch a " Joan of Arcadia " type show ?
I think it 's like a lot of things in science fiction .
People are a lot more comfortable allowing us to go into areas that are controversial or charged .
People put in this automatic filter .
It 's why the original Star Trek series was able to deal with things like racism in the middle of the 1960's on primetime television .

It 's all pretend and it gives people permission not to get pissed off .
Do your own religious views shape the story lines ?
I 'm an Irish Catholic , not practicing .
It probably just reflects my interest in my movement from Catholicism to atheism to agnosticism to interest in Eastern religions .
I think the show is a reflection of my acknowledgement that faith and religion are a part of the human experience , even if I 'm not quite clear on exactly what it all means and what I truly believe .
The most direct reflection of me in the show is this idea that when the Cylons became self - aware , when they became sentient , when they became people , they began to ask themselves the existential questions : " Why am I here ?
What is this all about ?
Is this all that I am ?
Is there something more ? "

My view is that that 's fundamental to a thinking person .
And that inevitably leads you to questions of faith and religion and " what will happen to me when I die ? "
In " Galactica 1980 , " we actually meet the " Imperious Commander " of the Cylons who turns out to be the Devil in the guise of a humanoid .
Will we ever meet the maker of the Cylons in this version ?
I think if we ever found an answer to why the Cylons have a god or who the god is -- you know , the guy steps out from behind the curtain -- I think you'd be disappointed .
They 're in an interesting place in that their faith is as legitimate as the human faith .
Human beings have souls given by the gods , and Cylons have a soul given by their one true god and that has to be just as valid .
That means there is a plan for their soul and something for them after they die too .
It 's a fundamental element of their faith .

From time to time at Nobel Intent we cover science topics that can be , well , fractious .
Evolution is one , climate change another .
Some people take offense at dark matter .
But the one that consistently draws the biggest mailbag would be vaccinations and autism .
To refresh your memories , a doctor in the UK , Andrew Wakefield , hit the headlines a few years back with reports that the MMR vaccine was responsible for causing autism in some patients .
This was seized upon by a sensationalist press , with the result that measles , mumps and rubella are becoming serious problems in some affluent areas of the US and UK .
It later turned out that Dr. Wakefield was in the pockets of a group of lawyers who were suing vaccine manufacturers .
Wakefield began receiving money from these lawyers two years prior to publishing his findings , and his publication was subsequently retracted by the journal .
Lawsuits against vaccine makers are n't particularly new .
In the US , the phenomenon was common enough in the 1970s and 1980s that pharmaceutical companies simply left the market , prompting the passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act , which provided compensation for children that were harmed as a result of vaccination .
This Vaccine Injury Compensation Program ( VCIP ) was in the news recently , following a successful lawsuit by the parents of Hannah Poling , a young girl who was diagnosed with a mitochondrial deficiency that caused neurological symptoms consistent with some of those present in autism spectrum disorders .
The current New England Journal of Medicine features a perspective on the case and , for a normally staid and reserved publication , it 's quite fiery .
The author , Dr Paul Offit , gives voice to the thoughts of many in the medical community over this decision , namely that it was thoroughly flawed , and that the VCIP has been somewhat less than scientific in its decisions , not just in the Hannah Poling case , but several others , unrelated to autism .
Despite absolutely no scientific evidence to support the claims that vaccination causes autism , this meme keeps propagating , and has even made appearances on the Presidential campaign trail .
In the meantime , scientists and medical professionals will have to redouble their efforts to more effectively communicate with the greater public .

What is the most profitable industry in America ?
Weapons , oil and computer technology all offer high rates of return , but there is probably no sector of the economy so abloom with money as the privately run prison industry .
Consider the growth of the Corrections Corporation of America , the industry leader whose stock price has climbed from $ 8 a share in 1992 to about $ 30 today and whose revenue rose by 81 per cent in 1995 alone .
Investors in Wackenhut Corrections Corp. have enjoyed an average return of 18 per cent during the past five years and the company is rated by Forbes as one of the top 200 small businesses in the country .
At Esmor , another big private prison contractor , revenues have soared from $ 4.6 million in 1990 to more than $ 25 million in 1995 .
Ten years ago there were just five privately - run prisons in the country , housing a population of 2,000 .
Today nearly a score of private firms run more than 100 prisons with about 62,000 beds .
That 's still less than five per cent of the total market but the industry is expanding fast , with the number of private prison beds expected to grow to 360,000 during the next decade .
The exhilaration among leaders and observers of the private prison sector was cheerfully summed up by a headline in USA Today : " Everybody 's doin ' the jailhouse stock " .
An equally upbeat mood imbued a conference on private prisons held last December at the Four Seasons Resort in Dallas .
The brochure for the conference , organized by the World Research Group , a New York - based investment firm , called the corporate takeover of correctional facilities the " newest trend in the area of privatizing previously government - run programs ...
While arrests and convictions are steadily on the rise , profits are to be made -- profits from crime .
Get in on the ground floor of this booming industry now ! "
A hundred years ago private prisons were a familiar feature of American life , with disastrous consequences .
Prisoners were farmed out as slave labor .
They were routinely beaten and abused , fed slop and kept in horribly overcrowded cells .
Conditions were so wretched that by the end of the nineteenth century private prisons were outlawed in most states .
During the past decade , private prisons have made a comeback .
Already 28 states have passed legislation making it legal for private contractors to run correctional facilities and many more states are expected to follow suit .
The reasons for the rapid expansion include the 1990's free - market ideological fervor , large budget deficits for the federal and state governments and the discovery and creation of vast new reserves of " raw materials " -- prisoners .
The rate for most serious crimes has been dropping or stagnant for the past 15 years , but during the same period severe repeat offender provisions and a racist " get - tough " policy on drugs have helped push the US prison population up from 300,000 to around 1.5 million during the same period .
This has produced a corresponding boom in prison construction and costs , with the federal government 's annual expenditures in the area , now $ 17 billion .
In California , passage of the infamous " three strikes " bill will result in the construction of an additional 20 prisons during the next few years .
The private prison business is most entrenched at the state level but is expanding into the federal prison system as well .
Last year Attorney General Janet Reno announced that five of seven new federal prisons being built will be run by the private sector .
Almost all of the prisons run by private firms are low or medium security , but the companies are trying to break into the high - security field .
They have also begun taking charge of management at INS detention centers , boot camps for juvenile offenders and substance abuse programs .
The Players
Roughly half of the industry is controlled by the Nashville - based Corrections Corporation of America , which runs 46 penal institutions in 11 states .
It took ten years for the company to reach 10,000 beds ; it is now growing by that same number every year .
CCA 's chief competitor is Wackenhut , which was founded in 1954 by George Wackenhut , a former FBI official .
Over the years its board and staff have included such veterans of the US national security state as Frank Carlucci , Bobby Ray Inman and William Casey , as well as Jorge Mas Canosa , leader of the fanatic Cuban American National Foundation .
The company also provides security services to private corporations .
It has provided strikebreakers at the Pittston mine strike in Kentucky , hired unlicensed investigators to ferret out whistle blowers at Alyeska , the company that controls the Alaskan Oil pipeline , and beaten anti-nuclear demonstrators at facilities it guards for the Department of Energy .
Esmor , the number three firm in the field , was founded only a few years ago and already operates ten corrections or detention facilities .
The company 's board includes William Barrett , a director of Frederick's of Hollywood , and company CEO James Slattery , whose previous experience was investing in and managing hotels .
US companies also have been expanding abroad .
The big three have facilities in Australia , England and Puerto Rico and are now looking at opportunities in Europe , Canada , Brazil , Mexico and China .
Greasing the Wheels of Power to Keep Jails Full
To be profitable , private prison firms must ensure that prisons are not only built but also filled .
Industry experts say a 90 - 95 per cent capacity rate is needed to guarantee the hefty rates of return needed to lure investors .
Prudential Securities issued a wildly bullish report on CCA a few years ago but cautioned , " It takes time to bring inmate population levels up to where they cover costs .
Low occupancy is a drag on profits . "
Still , said the report , company earnings would be strong if CCA succeeded in ramp ( ing ) up population levels in its new facilities at an acceptable rate " .
" ( There is a ) basic philosophical problem when you begin turning over administration of prisons to people who have an interest in keeping people locked up " notes Jenni Gainsborough of the ACLU 's National Prison Project .
Private prison companies have also begun to push , even if discreetly , for the type of get - tough policies needed to ensure their continued growth .
All the major firms in the field have hired big - time lobbyists .
When it was seeking a contract to run a halfway house in New York City , Esmor hired a onetime aide to State Representative Edolphus Towns to lobby on its behalf .
The aide succeeded in winning the contract and also the vote of his former boss , who had been an opponent of the project .
In 1995 , Wackenhut Chairman Tim Cole testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee to urge support for amendments to the Violent Crime Control Act -- which subsequently passed -- that authorized the expenditure of $ 10 billion to construct and repair state prisons .
CCA has been especially adept at expansion via political payoffs .
The first prison the company managed was the Silverdale Workhouse in Hamilton County , Tennessee .
After commissioner Bob Long voted to accept CCA 's bid for the project , the company awarded Long 's pest control firm a lucrative contract .
When Long decided the time was right to quit public life , CCA hired him to lobby on its behalf .
CCA has been a major financial supporter of Lamar Alexander , the former Tennessee governor and failed presidential candidate .
In one of a number of sweetheart deals , Lamar 's wife , Honey Alexander , made more than $ 130,000 on a $ 5,000 investment in CCA .
Tennessee Governor Ned McWherter is another CCA stockholder and is quoted in the company 's 1995 annual report as saying that " the federal government would be well served to privatize all of their corrections . "
In another ominous development , the revolving door between the public and private sector has led to the type of company boards that are typical of those found in the military - industrial complex .
CCA co-founders were T. Don Hutto , an ex-corrections commissioner in Virginia , and Tom Beasley , a former chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party .
A top company official is Michael Quinlan , once director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons .
The board of Wackenhut is graced by a former Marine Corps commander , two retired Air Force generals and a former under secretary of the Air Force , as well as James Thompson , ex-governer of Illinois , Stuart Gerson , a former assistant US attorney general and Richard Staley , who previously worked with the INS .
Leaner and Meaner ?
The companies that dominate the private prison business claim that they offer the taxpayers a bargain because they operate far more cheaply than do state firms .
As one industry report put it , " CEOs of privatized companies ... are leaner and more motivated than their public - sector counterparts . "
Because they are private firms that answer to shareholders , prison companies have been predictably vigorous in seeking ways to cut costs .
In 1985 , a private firm tried to site a prison on a toxic waste dump in Pennsylvania , which it had bought at the bargain rate of $ 1 .
Fortunately , that plan was rejected .
Many states pay private contractors a per diem rate , as low as $ 31 a prisoner in Texas .
A federal investigation traced a 1994 riot at an Esmor immigration detention center to the company 's having skimped on food , building repairs and guard salaries .
At an Esmor - run halfway house in Manhattan , inspectors turned up leaky plumbing , exposed electrical wires , vermin and inadequate food .
To rachet up profit margins , companies have cut corners on drug rehabilitation , counseling and literacy programs .
In 1995 , Wackenhut was investigated for diverting $ 700,000 intended for drug treatment programs at a Texas prison .
In Florida the US Corrections Corporation was found to be in violation of a provision in its state contract that requires prisoners to be placed in meaningful work or educational assignments .
The company had assigned 235 prisoners as dorm orderlies when no more than 48 were needed and enrollment in education programs was well below what the contract called for .
Such incidents led a prisoner at a CCA facility in Tennessee to conclude , " There is something inherently sinister about making money from the incarceration of prisoners , and in putting CCA 's bottom line ( money ) before society 's bottom line ( rehabilitation ) . "
The companies try to cut costs by offering less training and pay to staff .
Almost all workers at state prisons get union - scale pay but salaries for private prison guards range from about $ 7 to $ 10 per hour .
Of course the companies are anti-union .
When workers attempted to organize at Tennessee 's South Central prison , CCA sent officials down from Nashville to quash the effort .
Poor pay and work conditions have led to huge turnover rates at private prisons .
A report by the Florida auditor 's office found that turnover at the Gadsden Correctional Facility for women , run by the US Corrections Corporation , was ten times the rate at state prisons .
Minutes from an administrative meeting at a CCA prison in Tennessee have the " chief " recorded as saying , " We all know that we have lots of new staff and are constantly in the training mode ...
Many employees ( are ) totally lost and have never worked in corrections . "
Private companies also try to nickel and dime prisoners in the effort to boost revenue .
" Canteen prices are outrageous , " wrote a prisoner at the Gadsden facility in Florida .
" ( We ) pay more for a pack of cigarettes than in the free world . "
Neither do private firms provide prisoners with soap , toothpaste , toothbrushes or writing paper .
One female prisoner at a CCA prison in New Mexico said : " The state gives five free postage paid envelopes per month to prisoners , nothing at CCA .
State provides new coats , jeans , shirts , and underwear and replaces them as needed .
CCA rarely buys new clothing and inmates are often issued tattered and stained clothing .
Same goes of linens .
Also ration toilet paper and paper towels .
If you run out , too bad -- 3 rolls every two weeks . "
Cashing in on Crime
In addition to the companies that directly manage America 's prisons , many other firms are getting a piece of the private prison action .
American Express has invested millions of dollars in private prison construction in Oklahoma and General Electric has helped finance construction in Tennessee .
Goldman Sachs & Co. , Merrill Lynch , Smith Barney , among other Wall Street firms , have made huge sums by underwriting prison construction with the sale of tax exempt bonds , this now a thriving $ 2.3 billion industry .
Weapons manufacturers see both public and private prisons as a new outlet for " defense " technology , such as electronic bracelets and stun guns .
Private transport companies have lucrative contracts to move prisoners within and across state lines ; health care companies supply jails with doctors and nurses ; food service firms provide prisoners with meals .
High - tech firms are also moving into the field ; the Que - Tel Corp. hopes for vigorous sales of its new system whereby prisoners are bar coded and guards carry scanners to monitor their movements .
Phone companies such as AT&T chase after the enormously lucrative prison business .
About three - quarters of new admissions to American jails and prisons are now African - American and Hispanic men .
This trend , combined with an increasingly privatized and profitable prison system run largely by whites , makes for what Jerome Miller , a former youth corrections officer in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts , calls the emerging Gulag State .
Miller predicts that the Gulag State will be in place within 15 years .
He expects three to five million people to be behind bars , including an absolute majority of African - American men .
It 's comparable , he says , to the post - Civil War period , when authorities came to view the prison system as a cheaper , more efficient substitute for slavery .
Of the state 's current approach to crime and law enforcement , Miller says , " The race card has changed the whole playing field .
Because the prison system does n't affect a significant percentage of young white men we 'll increasingly see prisoners treated as commodities .
For now the situation is a bit more benign than it was back in the nineteenth century but I 'm not sure it will stay that way for long . "

An illustration of the Foresight spacecraft proposal to swing by the Apophis asteroid to track its movements .
A boxyspacecraft and its Georgia - based design team are $ 25,000 richer after winning aninternational competition to devise the best plan for tracking a space rockthat will swing past Earth twice in the next 30 years .
The small Foresight spacecraft designed by engineers in Georgia and California wonfirst place on Tuesday in the Planetary Society ?s Apophis Mission DesignCompetition , which challenged contenders to come up with a cost - effective wayof launching a watch dog - like probe to Asteroid 99942 Apophis .
Theasteroid - a space rock between 690 and 1080 feet ( 210 and 330 meters ) wide - isexpected to pass by Earth at a distance of about 18,300 miles ( 29,470 km ) onits first pass in 2029 , then swing further out at about 30 million miles ( 47.9 millionkilometers ) on the second approach in 2036 , asteroidresearchers have said .
But perturbations in Apophis ?
orbit between now andthen could alter the space rock ?s course , prompting the need for furtherobservations to ensure it does not pose animpact risk to Earth , they added .
To trackApophis with Foresight , engineers at Atlanta - based SpaceWorksEngineering , Inc. and Poway , Calif .?s
SpaceDev drew up plans for a $ 137.2 million - mission that would launch the probe atop an Orbital Sciences Minotaur 4rocket .
Accordingto the plan , the rocket would launch between 2012 and 2014 , with Foresightentering orbit around Apophis five and 10 months later .
The probe wouldthen fly in formation with the asteroid , hovering about 1.2 miles ( 2 km ) aboveits surface as the space rock circled the sun .
Shaped likea cube capped with stubby solar panels , the 485 - pound ( 220 - kg ) spacecraftmeasures about 34 inches ( 85 cm ) in width and height , and sports a length of about 26 inches ( 70 cm ) in length .
It is designed to carry an off - the - shelf radiobeacon for tracking , as well as a multi-spectrum imager and laser altimeter tostudy Apophis .
? We applaudthe innovative approach that the Planetary Society took toward soliciting ideasand solutions to this potential threat , ? said SpaceWorks Engineering CEO JohnOlds in a statement .

BEIJING , China ( CNN ) -- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday blamed supporters of the Dalai Lama for recent violence in Tibet , and said Chinese forces exercised restraint in confronting unrest there .
" There is ample fact and we also have plenty of evidence proving that this incident was organized , premeditated , masterminded and incited by the Dalai clique , " Wen said in a televised news conference .
The Chinese premier also dismissed the Dalai Lama 's claim that China is causing " cultural genocide " of his people in Tibet as lies .
The United States has urged Chinese restraint after days of violent protests in Tibet , even as a deadline passed for anti-Chinese protesters to surrender .
Death tolls from the violence vary .
Exiled Tibetan independence campaigners say at least 80 people died while Chinese authorities put the figure lower .
" There are 13 common people who died in the beating , burning and smashing in the riots , " said Champa Phuntsok , the head of Tibet 's regional government .
" They died of fire , asphyxiation and beating .
Some of them were set on fire by rioters and died in the burning . "
U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Tom Casey said the United States is very concerned about the Chinese crackdown on Tibetan protesters .
" We continue to urge restraint on the part of the Chinese government in terms of how it responds to these protesters . "
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , according to wire service reports from Moscow , said : " We have really urged the Chinese over several years to find a way to talk with the Dalai Lama , who is a figure of authority , who is not a separatist , and to find a way to engage him and bring his moral weight to a more sustainable and better solution of the Tibet issue . "
In a news conference in Beijing on Monday , Champa Phuntsok blamed the violence on " a small group of separatists and criminals " who take their lead from exiled followers of Tibet 's spiritual leader , the Dalai Lama .
On Sunday , the exiled Dalai Lama condemned China 's action in his homeland , accusing Beijing of " cultural genocide . "
Shops , schools and businesses were open Monday in Tibet 's capital , Lhasa , but tensions remained high throughout the territory and three neighboring provinces after days of deadly clashes .
Xinhua reported Monday that 160 locations in Lhasa were burned by rioters , including " banks , a press establishment , shops , schools and hospitals . "
Watch Chinese police on the streets »
The state - run news agency quoted police in Tibet giving protesters a deadline of midnight Monday " to stop their criminal activities and offering leniency to those who surrender themselves .
" Those who surrender and provide information on other lawbreakers will be exempt from punishment , " Xinhua quoted a police notice as saying .
James Miles , a reporter for The Economist who arrived in Lhasa just before the violence began last week and has been allowed to stay , told CNN Monday that Lhasa was now quiet but damage was evident throughout the city .
The number of people killed Friday -- and which side they were on -- remained in dispute , but Miles said it appeared the dead included Tibetans as well as Han Chinese who operated businesses there .
Chinese security forces maintained a strong presence , checking identification papers of people on the streets , Miles said .
Phuntsok said the protesters wanted to destabilize Tibet " at the critical and sensitive time that we are preparing for the Olympics . "
" There are 13 common people who died in the beating , burning and smashing in the riots , " said Phuntsok .
" They died of fire , asphyxiation and beating .
Some of them were set on fire by rioters and died in the burning . "
He said Chinese police did not fire their guns or use anti-personnel weapons against the Tibetans despite 61 police officers being injured , six seriously .
Watch riot police search homes »
Tibetan exiles described a much more violent response by police .
A Xinhua story published Monday said the protesters had " indisputable links to peace - preaching Dalai Lama . "
Tibet is officially an autonomous region of China , but the Dalai Lama said that Tibetans are treated by the Chinese as second - class citizens in their own land .
He said they need full autonomy to protect their cultural heritage .
Since Tibet fell under Communist Chinese control in the 1950s , Han Chinese have moved into the province to participate in the government and operate businesses .
Miles reported seeing incidents Friday of Tibetan crowds attacking Han Chinese residents with stones .
He said many of the businesses burned by protesters belonged to Han Chinese .
Violent protests were reported at or near Tibetan monasteries outside of Lhasa and in three other nearby Chinese provinces on Friday and in the days since .
Watch the generational divide among independence activists »
Tibetan monks at the Labrang Monastery in Xiahe , Gansu province -- 750 miles from Lhasa -- apparently staged a protest Friday and Saturday that Chinese security forces acted quickly to stop .
Spence Palermo , a American who was filming a documentary at the monastery , said Chinese officials banned his crew from returning to the monastery Friday .
They were suddenly rushed from their hotel Saturday as a " seemingly endless convoy " of Chinese troops headed toward the monastery , he said .
Newsweek magazine reported Monday that as many as 4,000 monks and lay persons clashed with police near the monastery Friday and Saturday .
Tibet Watch , a group based in Dharamsala , India , told CNN that 34 people have died in the Nwaga County area of Sichuan province in western China .
The dead include women and children , the group said in an e-mail , adding they were killed by Chinese police attempting to stop the protests .
Eight bodies -- including the bodies of two monks -- were brought to the Nagaba Kirti monastery , the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy in Dharamsala told CNN .
Tibet Watch said another protest took place in Machu County in northwestern China Sunday .
It was started by some Tibetan students distributing fliers .
They were later joined by monks and laypeople .
During the demonstration , several shops and a security headquarters were burned , the group said .
An estimated 2,000 Tibetans were using firecrackers in the streets , the group said .
Chinese authorities have denied CNN permission to enter Tibet to report on the current situation .

Mr Mukherjee 's comments have not pleased some opposition parties
In a debate in the Indian parliament , Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee said he was distressed by reports of the violence in the Tibetan capital , Lhasa .
He said that he hoped the troubles would be solved through dialogue and non-violent means .
Meanwhile police in Nepal have dispersed a crowd of 100 Tibetan protestors and Buddhist monks .
Televised pictures showed police beating some of the protesters and detaining dozens of others in the capital , Kathmandu .
' Inadequate response '
" We are distressed by reports of the unsettled situation and violence in Lhasa and by the deaths of innocent people , " Mr Mukherjee told the Indian parliament during a debate on Tibet .
" We hope all those involved will work to improve the situation and remove the causes of such trouble in Tibet , which is an autonomous region of China , through dialogue and non-violent means , " he said .
His remarks were criticised by some opposition parties , who described them as an " inadequate response " .
Exiled Tibetans have staged several protests in Nepal
" Over 100 innocent protesters have been massacred in Lhasa in the past one week by the Chinese security forces which are involved in ethnic cleansing , " Bharatiya National Party MP Vijay Kumar Malhotra said .
" This house should condemn the incidents , " Mr Malhotra said .
Mr Mukherjee reiterated that India 's policy of non-interference in China was still the same despite recent events .
" New Delhi 's policy on China and Tibet has remained unchanged since 1959 despite various political parties being in power at the centre since then , " he said as opposition leaders staged a symbolic walkout .
Scuffles
The BBC's Charles Haviland in Kathmandu says that Monday 's protest by Tibetans was the first time in a series of demonstrations in Nepal that they have been confronted by police firing teargas .
Our correspondent says that there were running battles between demonstrators and police , with protesters being baton charged and people in the crowd being dragged along the ground .
Several people were injured in scuffles and a monk was seen with blood streaming down his face .
I was trying to figure out which parts of 's post to cut , and felt that it was awesome enough to include in its near - entirety .
I spent the weekend luxuriating in the sunlight .
Do n't get me wrong .
I like Ireland fine , but our seasons go much like this : chill wintry rain , brisk autumnal rain , refreshing spring rain and gentle summery rain .
Sometimes hail and snow happens , which we deal with exactly as we would deal with the zombie apocalypse : Fear !
Panic !
Stock up on the food supplies !
Shoot everyone in the head before they eat your brains and the brains of everyone you love !
( Maybe not that last part . )
But I love sunshine , and it happens so rarely in Ireland I took advantage of this sunshiny weekend to go shopping and lie in the parks with my flatmates .
SARAH : I now have everything in the world .
Including cocoa butter shower gel .
DURHAM LASS : Oh , you think you 're just so sophisticated , do n't you ?
SARAH : With my new shower gel , I can say in all confidence that I do .
DURHAM LASS : And you like to rub it in mySARAH : ... DURHAM LASS : The sophistication !
The sophistication , not the gel .
A lady disrobed before us at the Iveagh Gardens where we lay sunning ourselves and caused a sensation .
JENNET : I am glad that neither of you girls are ever possessed by an urge to strip down to your skivvies .
I would be badly startled .
DURHAM LASS : I would n't bat an eye if Sarah did it .
This was obviously a reference to a Certain Easily Misunderstood Episode of my girlhood .
I will explain it to you , so that you understand that the Durham Lass in mentioning this was being completely unfair in casting aspersions on my virtue .
Because none of it was my fault .
As I may have mentioned before , I had something of a youthful weakness for dares .
I was sitting around a lunch room in my convent school with several other girls , when one of them dared me to climb into a very tiny cupboard .
Naturally , I took and triumphantly completed the dare .
I crowed my triumph from inside my tiny cage .
Then I tried to get out .
That did n't go so well .
Jammed up very small in a tiny prison of wood , I began to feel uneasy about the entire situation .
But my trusty comrades told me not to panic .
Our Catholic schoolgirl uniform ( everyone turn off the va-va - voom music right now ! ) was thick and woollen to prevent any males of the species who might ever behold us from guessing we had any shapes at all .
As one girl wisely pointed out , the uniform took up a lot of room .
Surely without clothing , I would have room to wiggle out and be free !
Carefully my schoolfriends tore my uniform off .
( Seriously , enough with the music . ) Then I tried to make my escape .
Unfortunately , I was still stuck fast .
At this point I felt it was well past time for panic , but then another schoolfriend had a brainwave .
Think of the phrase slippery as a greased pig , she said loudly !
The statement was sufficiently bizarre that I stopped hyperventilating in order to demand an explanation .
She explained that greased pigs are apparently slippery enough so that people can't catch them .
Apparently this is an actual sport in some places .
People trapped in cupboards wearing only their delicates should n't judge others , so I simply nodded .
She then seized up the butter dish on our table and advanced on me with a terrible glint in her eye .
People trapped in cupboards can't run .
So I endured , and it was working !
Slowly but surely I eased my way out of the cupboard .
I was almost free when our Matron , a plump but severe lady in a crisp white uniform , came in to check on us .
She stood transfixed in the doorway as she beheld three girls diligently applying butter to another student , as said student flailed half in and half out of a very small cupboard .
Eventually she said ' GIRLS !
That butter belongs to the school , you know .
' For the next two years I went to convent school ( until I did n't anymore , and that is several other stories ) and all any of us had to do was whisper ' That butter belongs to the school , you know ' for us to break down laughing .
It also became a regular term for something that was forbidden : someone else 's boyfriend ?
A trip out of bounds ?
School butter .
That aside , I hope you can all see that the Durham Lass 's accusation was utterly unfounded .
Because I generally regard public disrobing as total school butter .

Newsbeat reporter in Poland
Eighty miles from the capital Warsaw lies Lodz , famous in Poland for its film school but famous amongst locals for its illegal street races .
Magda says she used to meet other illegal street racers most evenings .
She said : " Every night when we can race on the streets , it 's really really nice .
We can meet together and race together . "
When it was illegal it was in strange places , the streets were in bad conditions .
Now it 's very good
Street racer Anna
Hundreds of people , sometimes thousands , would turn up to secret street racing events around the city .
Most would finish with a police raid along with several fines for the drivers .
Sergeant Kinga Krzeszewska from Lodz police says it was a big problem .
She said : " The speeds were really high , sometimes 250 kph ( 155 m ph ) .
It was a great danger not only for the drivers but also for the public . "
She said there were no safety barriers and no way of checking whether the drivers had been drinking or taking drugs .
" A lot of the spectators were as young as 10 or even seven years without any adult supervision , " she added .
Alternative action
The fines and police raids did n't work so officers took a different course of action .
They got together with the illegal racers and for one night only , every month , they cordon off part of the city then let drivers loose on the streets to go as fast as they like .
Lodz is a city in Poland around 80 miles away from the capital Warsaw
Anyone can race , as long as their car works and is legal on the roads and the driver lives in or around Lodz .
The idea is to get the fastest speed over a quarter of a mile of road .
Martin used to race on the streets around Lodz at night .
He 's now one of the organisers of what is called Street Legal , Europe 's first legal street race event .
He said : " All the people who are involved are young people , the ones who used to be involved in illegal street racing .
Now they are doing something completely different . "
System working
Drivers get to put their foot down , the spectators are safe and now Sergeant Kinga Krzeszewska says the police are happy .
" From our knowledge we 've got 80 % less illegal racing in Lodz right now , " she said .
UK police forces say there are no serious problems with street racing
" Plus we have more spectators than the illegal races .
Sometimes even 10,000 people come to see our race . "
So is there a chance of something like this happening in the UK ?
Apparently not .
The Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) in England and Wales say there is n't a problem with widespread illegal racing .
It says to encourage competitive driving on public roads would lead to more casualties .
Police chiefs in Scotland say they have no plans to introduce legal street racing either .
But back in Lodz , there is no doubt Street Legal has gone down well , at least with the drivers , like Anna in her Audi .
She said : " When it was illegal it was in strange places , the streets were in bad conditions .
" Now it 's very good , I 'm glad they did this . "
President Bush with New Orleans jazz band at North American Leaders Summit ( WND photo )
NEW ORLEANS –
At a private cocktail party last night sponsored by the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce , President Bush and Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez openly proclaimed their determination to continue with the controversial Security and Prosperity Partnership , a trilateral alliance critics calls a precursor to a " North American Union . "
Opening the fourth North American Leaders ' Summit , Bush lamented the decision of the House of Representatives to table the administration 's proposed Columbia free trade agreement .
" Unfortunately , we had a setback , " Bush admitted .
" The free trade agreement with Columbia is dead , unless Speaker Pelosi changes her mind . "
Increasingly , the Bush administration is coming under fire from Democratic Party presidential candidates Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , who have argued the North American Free Trade Agreement and other pacts should be renegotiated to be more fair to U.S. workers who have lost high - paying jobs in the continued move toward a global economy .
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
Gutierrez told the business leaders at the private cocktail party that the Bush administration intends to push the SPP agenda , intending to fight for new free - trade agreements with South Korea and Panama , despite Pelosi 's decision to kill the administration 's proposed Colombia agreement in the House .
This year 's summit meeting is being held among growing concern that free trade has hurt U.S. workers , while moving the U.S. toward a European Union - style continental government .

Preceding Gutierrez and Bush to the podium , New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal both emphasized the economic future of the city lay with international trade and the anticipated deepening and widening of the Panama Canal .
As WND previously reported , Gulf cities , including Corpus Christi , Houston and New Orleans , all expect a huge influx of millions of containers from China and the Far East coming though their ports once Panama builds a new canal capable of accommodating the new generation of " post - Panamax " ships that carry as many as 12,500 containers each .
Entering the cocktail party to a background of live music from a New Orleans street jazz band , Bush began by thanking the North American Competitiveness Council , or NACC , for being in the city to meet today with the three leaders and the top trilateral bureaucrats in the SPP working groups .
The NACC is a group of 30 multi-national corporations handpicked by the chambers of commerce in the three countries to provide closed - door advice to the 20 trilateral bureaucratic working groups assigned to " integrate " and " harmonize " North American regulations over a wide range of policy areas .
RELATED : WikiLeaks : ' North American Initiative ' no ' theory '
As WND previously reported , the NACC also dominated the agenda of the third annual SPP summit meeting held last August in Montebello , Quebec , Canada .
Stressing SPP themes , Bush told the group , " the meeting gives three friends the chance to come together to discuss our commitment to security and prosperity , to reconfirm the need for the three of us to work in harmony together for the good of our peoples .
It 's a chance to talk about how we can best protect our people and extend prosperity . "
" One of the best ways to do this is through trade , " Bush continued .
" The people in Louisiana understand the benefits of free trade firsthand .
Many sectors of the economy were hit hard by Katrina , exports were a source for jobs and hope .
Exports through Louisiana exceeded $ 30 billion for the first time ever in 2007 .
But the fundamental is whether we 're going to be a nation that continues to relate to free trade . "

Bush indicated he continues to " strongly support " NAFTA , noting " exports between the three countries have more than tripled under NAFTA and our economies have grown by more than 50 percent . "
" Tomorrow , we will be meeting with the business leaders of the North American Competitiveness Council to listen to their specific recommendations , " Bush said , reinforcing the importance of continuing the SPP agenda , even if with less publicly proclaimed fanfare .
" The United States has an opportunity to continue the trading agenda , As a matter of fact , we have an opportunity with three important countries – Colombia , South Korea and Panama . "
" If we turn down this deal with Colombia , " Bush said , " it would send forth a message that America can not be counted on .
If the Columbia deal does n't go forward , it will embolden the voices of false populism in our neighborhood , and it will make it harder for President Uribe to do what is necessary to make Colombia a safe place in which to live . "
Are you a representative of the media who would like to interview the author of this story ?
Let us know .
CNN reports that George W. Bush , with his disapproval rating shooting past 70 percent , is the most unpopular president in modern American history , or as long as they ’ve been polling the question  less beloved than Richard Nixon in the weeks prior to his resignation , and , I ’d guess , more despised than George III in 1776 .
Bush II is identified primarily in the public mind with the bane of his presidency , the Iraq war , and support for that , too , has reached a new low at 30 percent .
Enthusiasm for our Iraqi misadventure has n’t cracked 35 percent in many months , in spite of all the malarkey about the " success " of the recent escalation .
The domestic accompaniment of the " surge " in Iraq is the rising tide of sheer hatred directed at the War Party and all its works and minions .
Yet they do n’t have anything to worry about this election year : the warmongers can continue on their mad course , oblivious to public opinion , or so they seem to believe , because a U.S. strike at Iran is clearly in the cards .
The only question is when .
As we count the days to the end of the Bush II era , the likelihood that the worst president in our history will go out with a bang increases on a daily basis .
The latest evidence that zero hour approaches is reported by Andrew Cockburn , author , most recently , of Rumsfeld : His Rise , Fall , and Catastrophic Legacy , and co-producer of the PBS documentary on Iraq The War We Left Behind .
According to Cockburn , Bush has signed a presidential finding that greatly increases both the scope and seriousness of covert attempts to destabilize Iran and pave the way for war .
A presidential finding must be divulged to certain members of the intelligence oversight committees in both houses of Congress .
The Democratic leadership is not only aware of all this , but fully complicit : the votes were lined up to pass the needed appropriations without any significant opposition ( or any coverage in the " mainstream " media , either ) .
Over $ 300 million has been appropriated to implement this new , far - reaching campaign of covert aggression .
What this means , in practical terms , is that groups that have previously been beyond the pale as far as the U.S. is concerned are now being welcomed into the anti-Iranian united front , which includes everyone from the neo-Marxist Mujahideen - e- Khalq ( MEK ) to shadowy Arab Sunni groups whose ideology is not far removed from Osama bin Laden’s .
The former is a fanatical cult of Marxoid Iranian " dissidents , " officially classified as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department after they killed U.S. embassy and military personnel in terrorist attacks .
The MEK was driven out of Iran by the mullahs in the wake of a post - revolutionary power struggle , and the group fled to Iraq , where they were given aid , arms , and sanctuary , as they continued to launch terrorist attacks inside Iran .
Saddam used them to crush the Shi’ite rebellion of the early 1990s , which was brutally put down .
With the " liberation " of Iraq , the MEK has been holed up in its cult compound known as Camp Ashraf , ruled over by the wife - and - husband team of Maryam and Massoud Rajavi .
The former is the self - proclaimed " president " of Iran , while Mr. Rajavi serves as commander in chief of the armed forces .
The MEK is a matriarchy : more than half the members are women , as are the majority of top military officers .
But these are no ordinary feminists .
Escapees from this weird political sect , which combines Marxism , elements of Islam , and the Rajavi cult of personality , describe a harrowing experience , including torture , imprisonment , and enforced brainwashing techniques .
Indeed , the victims of the MEK are so numerous that they and their families have formed their own organization , which publicizes the abuse of members and ex-members by the crazed leadership .
The new finding also reportedly authorizes stepped - up aid to militant Arab groups in southwestern Iran , the Pejak Kurdish group , and , as reported by Seymour Hersh last year , radical , al - Qaeda - allied Sunni militants in Lebanon .
Syria , too , is in the War Party ’s sights .
The mysterious explosions that rocked Damascus in February were but a prelude of things to come .
Cockburn also describes authorized tactics in the new finding  signed six weeks ago  as " up to and including the assassination of targeted officials . "
The " war on terrorism " now consists of a large - scale campaign to subsidize , organize , and empower favored terrorist groups  the " good " terrorists of the MEK , " former " terrorists of the " Awakening " in Iraq , and a motley assortment of separatists and fanatics whose violent methods are but a reflection of their intrinsic nihilism .
God only knows what kind of blowback we ’re going to experience as a direct result of this moral slippage .
Maybe it ’s just me , but at a time when the authorities are requiring us to run a veritable gauntlet every time we get on a plane , as a precaution against " terrorism , " encouraging ( let alone subsidizing ! ) such groups is yet more proof that we ’ve slipped into the Bizarro dimension , where up is down and funding terrorism is the same as fighting it .
None of this news is at all surprising to longtime observers of the Middle East scene .
Laura Rozen , writing in The American Prospect last year , speculated that a presidential “ finding ” or perhaps a secret White House directive may have been issued :
“ There is evidence that , while Bush probably has not signed such a finding regarding Iran , he has recently done so regarding Iranian - supported Hezbollah in Lebanon ; further , there is evidence that he may have signed an executive order or national security presidential directive regarding a new , more aggressive policy on Iran .
Such directives are not required to be reported to Congress  they are more in the realm of the president communicating to authorized people inside the administration his expectations for a policy . ”
The reporting of Rozen and others has drawn attention to U.S. efforts to effect " regime change " in Iran for quite some time , but now it seems more than covert action is in the works .
NBC has reported that plans for air strikes against Iran have been drawn up by U.S. military leaders , as Washington steps up its rhetoric denouncing Iranian " interference " in Iraq .
Confronted with this stark fact by Tim Russert on Sunday morning , Barack Obama wilted :
" RUSSERT : [ T ]he administration , we have reported at NBC , are drawing up some plans for potential air strikes in Iran at different missile weapons factories or special force compounds because we have indications , evidence that the Iranians are helping some of their supporters within Iraq to kill U.S. troops .
" OBAMA : Mm-hmm .
" RUSSERT : If it could be demonstrated that was a fact , would you be in support of such limited attacks in Iran ?
" OBAMA : Well , let , let me not speculate yet .
I want to , I want to take a , take a look at the kind of evidence that the administration is putting forward , what these plans are exactly .
I ’ve always said that , you know , as commander in chief , I do n’t take military options off the table and I think it ’s appropriate for us to plan for a whole host of contingencies . "
He then goes into the familiar " carrots as well as sticks " Democratic Party mantra , but notice how he evades the question .
Would he support an attack on Iran ?
Damned if I know .
In any case , we may soon find out .
Worse , Obama opines that our withdrawal from Iraq would occur in slow motion , two brigades a month : at that rate , he estimates , it would take two years for all the troops to come home .
And , in any case , others would arrive to take their place , albeit in limited numbers , to " partner " with the Iraqis and presumably act as the enforcer of last resort .
He reckons at that point we ’ll have been in Iraq for seven years , and if the Iraqis have still failed to get their act together after all that time then they ’re unlikely to do it after 50 years .
True , as far as it goes , but there ’s another way to look at it : with two full years to provoke an incident involving U.S. troops and Iranian forces right across the border , if it has n’t happened at the end of that time it ’ll be a miracle .
When it comes to the conduct of American foreign policy , we are ready for a lot more than mere " change . "
Americans are disgusted , appalled , and depressed by the bloody spectacle , which is bankrupting the country morally as well as fiscally , destroying what was left of our moral capital and eating away at our financial assets as we sink into a quagmire of debt .
Americans do n’t just want any old namby - pamby " change " in this realm  they pine for revolution , i.e. , a complete reversal of current U.S. policy from relentless aggression to a policy based on building and preserving peace .
Polls show the yawning gap between the belligerence of the laptop bombardiers and the antiwar sentiments of ordinary Americans is growing wider by the day .
Obama makes much of his early opposition to the Iraq war , but why does he wimp out when it comes to the next war , the one they ’re planning against Iran ?
We know he ’s against it : you can hear it in the phrasing of his evasions , in his plea for " direct talks " with the Iranians and his call for a regional settlement .
Yet he fails to take an unequivocal stand .
He could hit Hillary over the head with her own hawkishness , yet he fails to do so .
Whether this is a product of his inherent indecisiveness  indicated , in another instance , by his failure to ditch Jeremiah Wright soon enough  or some ideological - political glitch in his thinking is hard to say .
In any case , neither possibility bodes well for his presidential prospects .
While the assassins of peace prowl the world , intent on stirring up violent passions , they do n’t have much opposition on the home front  except in the hearts and minds of the American people .
Yet this heartfelt revulsion against the horrors of the past eight years finds no clear , unstinting voice , no consistent champion among the contenders for leadership in either party .
Remember the " Silent Majority " of the 1960s , which supposedly supported the War Party and just wanted to sweep the antiwar movement out of the way while instituting a policy of " bombs away " in Southeast Asia ?
Today we have the Disenfranchised Majority , which wants out of Iraq and no part of a fresh conflict in the Middle East  and yet has no power to stop it .
The seething resentment this sense of powerlessness breeds has been boiling beneath the surface for a long time , and sooner or later it will burst through in a geyser of considerable force .
Deprived of any other outlet , this eruption could shake  and even shatter  the very foundations of our constitutional republic .
The blame will fall , of course , on allegedly " antisocial " and " radical " elements , who will be smeared as subversives and worse .
The real culprits , however , are the political elites  who blocked all expressions of the popular will and allowed the pressure to build past the breaking point .
NEW YORK -- Brian McNamee gave federal prosecutors syringes and other physical evidence his lawyers say back the personal trainer 's allegations of drug use by Roger Clemens , who returns to Capitol Hill on Thursday in hopes of rebutting the accusations .
Clemens , who gave a deposition Tuesday , is scheduled to hold one - on - one meetings with members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
A spokeswoman for Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D - Md. ) , a committee member , said a representative for Clemens contacted Cummings ' office Wednesday to set up a meeting with the lawmaker .
Cummings spokeswoman Jen Kohl said several other committee members were also asked to meet individually with Clemens .
This came on the same day the reports that McNamee had given federal prosecutors physical evidence surfaced .
Cummings is expected to meet with Clemens on Thursday morning .
Kohl said Clemens would be asked to appear with Cummings at a press conference after the session , though she said it 's doubtful he 'd accept the invitation .
A source told The Associated Press that Clemens is also scheduled to meet with Rep. Tom Davis , the committee 's ranking Republican .
Committee chairman Henry Waxman is not scheduled to meet with Clemens .
On Wednesday evening , a representative of Clemens said that the pitcher was not scheduling additional meetings just to refute McNamee 's latest allegations .
" Roger has been interested in sitting down one - on - one with members of the committee for quite awhile , " said Lanny Breuer , one of Clemens ' lawyers .
" We began scheduling these meetings before we heard about Mr. McNamee 's latest stunt . "
McNamee is due to meet with committee staff Thursday morning to give his own deposition , and his legal team said it will bolster his story with details of the evidence .
His side turned over gauze pads and syringes they said had Clemens ' blood to IRS Special Agent Jeff Novitzky in early January , a person familiar with the evidence said , speaking on condition of anonymity because McNamee 's lawyers did not want to discuss details publicly .
The syringes were used to inject Clemens with steroids and human growth hormone , the person said .
A second person , also speaking on condition of anonymity , said the evidence was from 2000 and 2001 .
" I think this is a significant point in the case .
We believe that this is significant corroboration , " said McNamee 's lead lawyer , Earl Ward .
Breuer called McNamee 's allegations " desperate smears " and said the trainer " apparently has manufactured evidence . "
" It is just not credible , " Breuer said in a statement .
" Who in their right mind does such a thing ? "
In December 's Mitchell report on doping in baseball , McNamee said he injected Clemens 16 times with performance - enhancing drugs in 1998 , 2000 and 2001 .
Richard Emery , another of McNamee 's lawyers , said the committee will be given a description of the evidence that was turned over to prosecutors .
" It does change the nature of the case from a he - said , she - said to something about physical evidence , " Emery said .
Doping expert Don Catlin said steroids could still be detected in a sample that old .
" But if you do n't find it , it does n't mean it was n't there before , " said Catlin , who added there are sure to be chain of custody issues .
He said HGH would be much less stable .
After his five - hour sworn deposition Tuesday , Clemens said that he again denied using performance - enchancing drugs .
By denying under oath that he used performance - enhancing drugs , Clemens put himself at legal risk if prosecutors determine his testimony was n't truthful .
Keith Ausbrook , the committee 's Republican general counsel , told the AP the committee was not aware that such physical evidence existed .
" Unknown and unexpected evidence comes in at all times in any investigation , " Ausbrook wrote in an e-mail .
" We will still need to examine McNamee 's evidence and hear what he has to say . "
McNamee , the former personal trainer for Clemens and New York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte , also told former Senate majority leader George Mitchell that he injected Pettitte with HGH .
Pettitte confirmed in December that he used HGH for two days .
Emery said McNamee 's legal team planned to hold a news conference following their client 's deposition in Washington on Thursday and will discuss the evidence in greater detail then .
Because the items were turned over several years after the events under discussion , Clemens ' side could challenge whether they were tampered with .
" Brian McNamee is obviously a troubled man who is obsessed with doing everything possible to destroy Roger Clemens , " Breuer said in a statement .
" McNamee ... lied to Senator Mitchell , he lied to the federal government and now he apparently has manufactured evidence .
He has changed his story repeatedly on this matter .
He claims to love Roger Clemens , he says he modeled being a father on Roger Clemens , he said Roger treated him like family -- but he now claims he kept blood , gauze and needles from Roger Clemens for seven years .
It defies all sensibility . "
Emery said it was unnecessary for McNamee 's side to persuade the Justice Department that the evidence was authentic .
" They 'll decide themselves what they believe is the case and make their own decisions based on the facts as they have it .
All we know is what we believe is the truth , " he said .
McNamee 's turning over of the syringes first was reported by the New York Daily News on its Web site .
Clemens and McNamee are to testify at a committee hearing next Wednesday along with Pettitte , former Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch and Kirk Radomski , the former New York Mets clubhouse attendant who pleaded guilty in April to felony charges of distributing steroids and laundering money .
He is scheduled to be sentenced Friday in federal court in San Francisco .
" Roger is looking forward to testifying before Congress next week to set the record straight , " Breuer said .
" He will not waiver , nor will he shrink from this because he is telling the truth .
We ask all fair - minded people to listen .
It is time for Brian McNamee to be subject to the same scrutiny as Roger Clemens . "
Information from ESPN.com investigative reporter Mike Fish and The Associated Press was used in this report .
A simple list of related bugs without logical / implicit constraints might be useful .
It 'd be nice to be able to relate bugs and issues in a useful manner .
It would also thus allow for reports showing " a bug and all related bugs " in some fashion , which could be neat .
This would also require checking for circular dependencies / relations .
Ramzy Baroud : Media Language And War
Media Language And War : Manufacturing Convenient Realities By Ramzy Baroud
In the competitive world of media today , swift and conveniently selective reporting is of prime importance .
Google News , for example , claim to scan 4,500 news sources , of which only a few are highlighted as main stories .
There are thousands of similar services , all competing to produce a story in the fastest time .
Thorough - and thus slower - reporting is relegated and crucial information often appears too little too late .
The Iraq story , which has occupied a huge proportion of headline news for years , serves as a good example of this .
On February 1st , only a few minutes apart , two Iraqi women detonated themselves in two crowded pet markets in the Iraqi capital .
Authorities said that 98 people were reportedly killed and 200 were wounded .
Eyewitnesses reported a grizzly scene where human and animal body parts littered the streets , hundreds of feet away from the blasts .
Any thorough analysis of the story would have to examine several related factors .
First , it would need to juxtapose the high death toll with US and Iraqi governments ' reports of ' calm ' in the Baghdad area .
The claim of a ' return to normalcy ' in the Iraqi capital has been propagated for months , as a way of validating US President 's Bush 's military ' surge ' .
Even if we buy into the questionable statistics aimed at hyping the positive outcome of the surge - questionable because they are only promoted by US and Iraqi military sources , with vested interests in downplaying the seriousness of the ' insurgency ' - the violence seems to have shifted from the capital into northern areas , especially Mosul .
Instead of admitting failure in halting the violence which has plagued Iraq since the US occupation of 2003 , US and Iraqi authorities resort to a continued and violent language to confuse and distract from the real issues .
This is how Alissa J. Rubin began her article for the New York Times ( January 31 ) : " The unsettled situation in northern Iraq continued Wednesday as Iraqi troops massed in Mosul to fight Sunni Arab extremists " .
This is a brilliant way to divert attention of the story from the failure of the surge to manipulate other values , and lumping these values to create a completely fallacious association : " Sunni Arab extremists . "
Rubin further quotes an Iraqi defence ministry spokesman as claiming that the goal of the military operation is to " oust Al - Qaeda in Iraq from the city and prevent its fighters from returning . "
The entry statements contain a dangerously inaccurate linkage between Arabs ( an increasing oppressed monitory in the Iraqi city ) , Sunnis ( the ' remnants of the Saddam regime ' as mindlessly parroted by the media ) , extremists of the previous group and al - Qaeda .
The New York Times story - which often sets the standards for reporting in other major US publications - will have laid the prefect foundation to justify future ethnic cleansings of Sunni Arabs from the city , should the ' military operation ' succeed in ' driving out ' al - Qaeda militants ( the numbers of which are inflated whenever such exaggeration is necessary ) .
Returning to the Baghdad markets ' bombings , the response to this tragedy was predictably misleading .
The Iraqi government issued the usual , if somewhat bizarre statement , and US officials , including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made fiery condemnations .
Enough material was gathered within the hour to inundate us with hundreds of ' fresh ' news stories , which were mostly a rehash of the official statements made in Baghdad 's Green Zone or in Washington .
CNN online opened one of its articles , made available soon after the market bombings , with : " Two mentally disabled women were strapped with explosives Friday and sent into busy Baghdad markets , where they were blown up by remote control . "
The allegation was attributed to an Iraqi government official later in the statement .
The Iraqi official said that " people referred to the bomber at central Baghdad 's al - Ghazl market as the " crazy woman " and that the bomber at a second market had an unspecified birth disability . "
Who are these ' people ' ?
Did the CNN reporter examine the legitimacy of that claim by interviewing any of them ' ?
The involvement of women in this sort of violence is often a critical addition to the story , especially for Western readers .
Readers tend to pause longer when they hear of a suicide bomber who was also a mother .
They may feel an urge to learn more about the life of such a woman .
Was she an inmate in Abu Ghraib ?
Tortured ?
Raped ?
Did she lose a family member to the US war , to the Iraqi death squads ?
What do the bombings tell us about the security situation in Baghdad , the success or failure of the ' surge ' or the war which is driving people to suicide in its most brutal manifestations ?
Apparently , it tells us nothing .
But Lt. Col. Steve Stover , spokesman for the Multi-National Division - Baghdad has an explanation that seems , at least from the point view of CNN much more relevant than the seemingly unimportant questions above .
" By targeting innocent Iraqis , they ( those who dispatched the ' mentally disabled ' women suicide bombers ) show their true demonic character . "
Thus , CNN headline : " ' Demonic ' militants sent women to bomb markets in Iraq . "
In Western media language , Arab women are perpetually oppressed victims , and they must maintain that role for the story to read right .
Thus , the women bombers cannot be viewed themselves as extremists , but as victims in the hands of extremists .
Within hours the buzz words on online news were ' mentally disabled ' and ' demonic ' .
But what does ' demonic ' mean exactly ?
What real issues does it address ?
And why should such an irrelevant outburst define the deadliest bombing in Baghdad in months ?
Focusing on such extraneous associations - mindless , mad , demonic women , possessed and acting on the behest of bearded and cunning al - Qaeda ' Arab Sunni , extremists ' - does much more than simply distract from the many military and policy failures in Iraq .
It helps create a parallel universe to that of the real world , thus presenting a substitute image that shapes and reshapes the perceptions and imaginations of faraway news consumers .
The ' real world ' - whether that of Iraq , Palestine , Burma , Kenya or any other - is a world that , although seemingly chaotic , is very much rational
It is predicated on the values of cause and affect .
What may seem ' demonic ' and ' mad ' to a non-media person should not appear the same to a journalist .
The latter 's responsibility is to narrate , contextualize and deconstruct with an independent and critical eye , not merely reiterate what has been told to him by ' official sources ' .
The corporate media 's depiction of the Gaza story which has been unfolding for months might be summed up in one overriding headline : Hordes of Palestinian Breach Gaza Border with Egypt , Israel Concerned over Its Security .
The imprisonment of 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza - where poverty stands at 79 percent and unemployment hovers around a similar number , and where the majority of the population is ' food insecure ' according to United Nations agencies - should have been depicted first and foremost as a humanitarian disaster compelled by an Israeli siege .
The dates related to the successive stages of the siege follow a line of Israel 's political , not ' security ' logic .
Any reasonable timeline of recent events could easily verify that ( the formation of the Hamas government in March 2006 , the ousting of the pro-Israeli Palestinian security apparatus in June 2007 and so on being followed by dramatic Israeli moves to tighten the siege on Gaza , Hamas ' stronghold ) .
But little of that seemed relevant to the way the Gaza story was amply reported .
Like the Iraq story , where the two main trusted sources are the occupation and its puppet Iraqi government , any story of relevance to Israel and Palestine has to be validated by the official Israeli source and to a lesser but growing extent by their allies among Palestinians .
The rest are ' extremist ' , radical and hell - bent on the destruction of the ' Jewish state . '
Note how the Jewishness of Israel is often emphasised whenever the word ' destruction ' or similar words are infused .
This is what Bridget Johnson wrote in the Seattle PI ( January 29 ) chastising the United Nations ' Human Rights Council for its condemnation of Israel 's siege on Gaza : " There was zero mention of Hamas ' continued rocket attacks on Israel -- which preceded the cutoff of supplies that has caused such an uproar -- or Hamas ' refusal to renounce violence against and attempted destruction of the Jewish state . "
The claims were preposterous - especially that of a small group 's ' attempted destruction ' of a country saturated with nuclear arms .
The words ' destruction ' and ' Jewish state ' are simply passed as an innocent ' opinion ' , read by thousands of Americans .
There are many notable omission as well .
Hamas has repeatedly called for a mutual ceasefire , that was also repeatedly rejected or simply ignored by Israel ( in the guise of ' not negotiating with terrorists ' ) .
The siege followed the democratic elections of Hamas , not the rocket attacks , the intensity of which corresponded with the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza .
Also conveniently missed is the fact that Palestinians rockets have killed 10 Israelis in several years .
The killing of any civilian anywhere is tragic , but the facts are rarely contextualised by the media .
The number of Palestinians killed in Gaza as a result of Israeli army attacks since the Annapolis ' peace ' conference two months ago is estimated at 149 .
Several folds were killed in Gaza since the siege started early 2006 .
Over 60 have died since June 2007 as a result of either lack of medicines or Israel 's refusal to allow them entry to better equipped hospitals in the West Bank .
This is only the tip of the iceberg since human suffering cannot only be measured by those who die , but also those who continue to live in perpetual suffering .
For Johnson , this is irrelevant , since this is not about right and wrong , but a war of language .
To win the , one must have command over language - and the way it 's manipulated - and access to platforms that reach the largest number of readers .
An easy recipe to victory is an intentional mix of such words as Islamic extremism , al - Qaeda , Hamas , Jewish state , security , destruction , right to exist , juxtaposed with images or clips of angry Palestinian youth burning Israeli and American flags , ' side - by - side ' , and you will have an American public and government standing in eternal solidarity with Israel .
While most US politicians are self - seeking , power hungry and would do whatever it takes to be elected , the average American , unlike what it may seem , is not born ' pro - Israel ' , and ' anti-Palestinian . '
Most Americans are pro the manufactured , yet misleading image of Israel that reaches their homes through television , wait at their doorsteps in the morning and is beamed to them through the web .
Israel has mastery over the language of the Western media , which , again , helped create a paralleled universe that has little relation to reality .
That alternative universe only exist on the pages of New York Times , the images of CNN , and the blabber of Fox News ' experts ' .
According to that narrative , Palestinians , are , like the Iraqi women suicide bombers , ' demonic ' , ' mad ' , ' extremist ' , ' irrational ' , self hating , and all the rest .
To recognize reality the way it is , one has to re-examine language .
While a critical reader is essential , the task starts in the hand of a journalist , who must understand his topic not based on simple ' facts ' and perceptions .
Simple facts lead to simple conclusions : Sunnis extremists , mad Mullah , unruly Palestinians , besieged Israel .
Every story can be told in three different ways : two by the two main conflicting parties , and a third by the journalist himself .
The journalist must not compromise on his independence , must not buy into jargons , mantras , and turn into another official spokesperson .
To convey a version of a story that is as close the true story as possible , a media person has to comprehend the context himself , analyse the motives and follow the line of logic : cause and affect , then , impart his new realizations - free of self - censorship , coercion or intimidation .
Otherwise , the true story will always be shelved in favour of re-written official statements and repackaged government and military press releases , falsely presented as ' accurate ' , ' independent ' and ' impartial ' .
Mindlessly repeating these official discourses may be easier and more profitable , but it will make no helpful contribution to the field of journalism , and to any possibility of truth and justice .

We ’ve made it clear how we feel about the gas tax holiday being proposed by Sens. McCain and Clinton :
It ’s a boondoggle .
Seemingly every economist in America agrees .
But the economists are in the wrong subfield of punditry : they look at the relevant numbers , come to a conclusion , and viola voilà — their moment in the spotlight is over .
On the other hand , political analysts and campaign correspondents , unburdened by facts , can and have speculated for weeks about a question like which candidate the gas tax kerfuffle helps more .
I ’ve avoided entering this discussion , because the only way to comment seriously is to go to Indiana and North Carolina and conduct in - depth conversations with dozens of voters .
But what the hell .
There is some polling suggesting the universal condemnation the gas tax holiday has received from economists and editorialists has penetrated to the voters ’ level .
Seventy percent of likely voters in a NYT / CBS poll say that politicians pushing the gas tax are doing so because it helps them politically .
McCain ’s reputation for straight talk obviously inoculates him on this issue : 62 percent believe Hillary Clinton says what she thinks people what to hear , compared to 43 percent for Obama and 41 percent for McCain .
Obama has made hay out of the situation , hammering the idea that Clinton ’s willingness to pander on an issue as important as the energy crisis is emblematic of the race as a whole .
The refrain is familiar by now :
She is the same old politics , he represents a fresh start .
She plays politics as a cynical game , he respects the voters ’ intelligence and speaks hard truths .
Is it working ?
Who knows ?
But the fact that the situation fits perfectly into frames that the media has adopted ( Clinton as untrustworthy and willing to say anything to win ; Obama as elitist and out of touch with those all - important blue - collar voters ) , definitely helps keep the controversy alive .
Clinton is pushing hard on the issue .
Her initial defense was that people are hurting and deserve whatever small relief the holiday affords .
But over the weekend , she introduced for the first time the idea that she is proud not to have the experts ’ support .
In a conference call on May 1 , Clinton communications director Howard Wolfson said , “ Sometimes the president will do things that the quote - unquote experts will agree with , and sometimes the president will do things that experts quote - unquote do n’t agree with . ”
The comment was mocked in the press because of its similarity to the anti-science , anti-expert approach of the Bush Administration ( which edits global warming reports from government scientists , for example ) .
But Clinton has embraced this know - nothingism .
She is now saying that she is happy “ elite opinion ” is n’t on her side , because “ elite opinion ” does n’t understand the plight of everyday working people .
And she ’s gone even further :
STEPHANOPOULOS : Can you name one economist , a credible economist who supports the suspension ?
CLINTON : Well , you know , George , I think we ’ve been for the last seven years seeing a tremendous amount of government power and elite opinion basically behind policies that have n’t worked well for the middle class and hard - working Americans … .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But can you name an economist who thinks this makes sense ?
CLINTON : Well , I ’ll tell you what , I ’m not going to put my lot in with economists , because I know if we get it right , if we actually did it right , if we had a president who used all the tools of the presidency , we would design it in such a way that it would be implemented effectively .
Two obvious problems .
First , the idea that the elite opinion opposing the gas tax holiday , which includes many liberal economists , is somehow the same elite opinion that has driven the domestic policies of the Bush Administration is a joke .
In fact , it ’s insulting to voices on the left who use their expertise to serve progressive goals .
The Clinton - friendly Paul Krugman has come out against the gas tax holiday — and he ’s been a passionate voice , indeed an elite voice , against the Bush tax cuts and other Bush Administration ideas that have helped to drive the economy into the ground these past eight years .
Second , the Bush Administration ’s problem is n’t listening to elite opinion .
It is the opposite — the Administration is driven by ideology and heeds experts only when they confirm previously held beliefs .
But slamming the elites , even the ones who are usually on your side , is a perfectly acceptable move in American politics .
If Clinton went out tomorrow and slammed small - town Americans as an undifferentiated group , she be absolutely massacred .
But economists are not a beloved bunch in Indiana and North Carolina , and they can be thrown under the bus in pursuit of a few extra delegates .
All of that said , Obama probably wins on the gas tax holiday for a far simpler reason :
It takes Jeremiah Wright off the front pages .
The fact that the talking heads on TV , the newspaper columnists , bloggers like me , and the candidates themselves are discussing something else — and a policy matter at that !
— is a victory for Obama .
But the fact that many Americans now think a gas tax holiday is a worthwhile part of America ’s approach to the energy crisis means that serious solutions on climate change are the likely loser .
Lessig :
One of the net 's founding principles is under threat Tough action is required by US regulators to protect the principles that have made the net so successful , a leading digital rights lawyer has said .
Professor Lawrence Lessig was speaking at a public meeting to debate the tactics some net firms use to manage data traffic at busy times .
He said the Federal Communications Committee ( FCC ) should act to keep all net traffic flowing equally .
The FCC said net firms had a duty to tell customers about data management .
No more rules
The seven - hour public meeting was held at Stanford University and featured presentations from Prof Lessing , songwriters , network administrators and net engineers .
Prof Lessig said one of the principles that guided the foundation of the net was that all traffic should flow equally across it .
This principle of net neutrality , he said , was being eroded as net firms manage traffic and place restrictions on what their domestic broadband customers can do .
Consumers must be fully informed of the exact nature of the service they are purchasing
Kevin Martin , FCC
The meeting was called by the FCC in reaction to the news that US net firm Comcast had been exposed as managing traffic by stopping some of its 13 m customers uploading files to BitTorrent and other peer - to - peer networks .
The FCC has started a formal investigation to see if Comcast merits a fine for its actions .
In response to the publicity surrounding its actions , Comcast has said it would change its policy .
In the UK many net firms manage traffic at peak times in a bid to ensure that everyone gets the highest broadband speed possible .
Prof Lessig said there had to be clear rules , perhaps involving financial incentives , to force net firms to respect net neutrality .
Current rules , he warned , meant that many firms were tempted to manage traffic to protect profits .
At the meeting the two Democrats who sit on the five - strong FCC board said it needed new powers to make sure net firms complied with net neutrality principles .
But the two Republican commissioners on the board warned against over - burdening net firms with more rules .
Summing up , FCC chairman Kevin Martin said its net policies were powerful enough but just needed to be properly enforced .
He said there was nothing wrong with net firms managing traffic as long as they kept customers fully informed .
" There must be adequate disclosures of the particular traffic management tools , " said Mr Martin .
" Consumers must be fully informed of the exact nature of the service they are purchasing . "

Observations of the cosmic microwave background might deal blow to theory .
The background patterns of space could help us focus on quantum problems .
NASA / ESA / Hubble Heritage Team
The question of whether quantum mechanics is correct could soon be settled by observing the sky — and there are already tantalizing hints that the theory could be wrong .
Antony Valentini , a physicist at Imperial College , London , wanted to devise a test that could separate quantum mechanics from one of its closest rivals — a theory called bohmian mechanics .
Despite being one of the most successful theories of physics , quantum mechanics creates several paradoxes that still make some physicists uncomfortable , says Valentini .
For instance , quantum theory uses probability to describe the properties of a particle .
These properties obtain definitive values only when they are measured , which means that you cannot predict a particle 's position or momentum , for instance , with certainty .
These premises troubled Albert Einstein .
He believed that particles contain extra properties — or ' hidden variables ' — that determine their behaviour completely .
If only we knew what these hidden variables were , we could predict the fate of particles and the outcome of measurements with certainty .
Bohmian mechanics is one of a suite of ' hidden variables ' theories — many now discredited — formulated to tackle this problem .
Neck and neck
So far it ’s been impossible to pick apart quantum mechanics from bohmian mechanics — both predict the same outcomes for experiments with quantum particles in the lab .
But Valentini thinks that the stalemate could be broken by analysing the cosmic microwave background — the relic radiation left behind after the Big Bang .
The cosmic microwave background contains hot and cold temperature spots that were generated by quantum fluctuations in the early Universe and then amplified when the Universe expanded .
Using the principles of quantum mechanics , cosmologists have calculated how these spots should be distributed .
“ It ’s far too early to say that this is definite evidence of a breakdown in quantum mechanics – but it is a possibility . ”
Antony Valentini
Imperial College , London
However , Valentini ’s calculations show that the hidden - variables theory might give a different answer .
“ Any violation of quantum mechanics in the early Universe would have a knock - on effect that we could see today , ” says Valentini .
Almost all measurements of the cosmic microwave background seem to fit well with the predictions of quantum mechanics , says Valentini .
But intriguingly , a distortion that fits one of Valentini ’s proposed signatures for a failure of quantum mechanics was recently detected by Amit Yadav and Ben Wandelt at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign ( see ' Deflating inflation ? ' ) .
That result has yet to be confirmed by independent analyses , but it is tantalizing , Valentini adds .
“ It ’s far too early to say that this is definite evidence of a breakdown in quantum mechanics — but it is a possibility , ” he says .

Cosmic predictions
Hiranya Peiris , an expert on the cosmic microwave background at the University of Cambridge , UK , is impressed by the new work .
“ This is a pretty cool new idea , ” she says .
“ Nobody has ever thought of using the cosmic microwave background to look into really fundamental quantum questions — cosmologists just assume that quantum mechanics is correct , ” she says .
But Peiris adds that Valentini must now come up with more detailed predictions about the types of distortion that will arise in the cosmic microwave background to convince cosmologists that they are really caused by a breakdown of quantum mechanics .
“ He has thrown some really exciting ideas out there , but now he needs to do the nitty - gritty calculations , ” she says .
Vlatko Vedral , a quantum physicist at the University of Leeds , UK , agrees that the cosmic microwave background will be a useful way to test quantum mechanics .
But he adds that even if quantum mechanics is shown to break down in the early Universe , that does n’t necessarily mean that the hidden - variables theory is correct .
FBI : ' There was no information given to Warren County of an imminent terrorist threat to that county or to Southern Ohio '
Kerry Campaign Stands by Decision to Not Challenge Election ...
Brad Friedman Byon
3/16/2008 , 12:56 pm PT
By Brad Friedman from Phoenix , AZ ...
With more than 3,000 counties in the United States of America , only heavily Republican Warren County , Ohio --- one of the last to report election results in the Buckeye State that night --- took action on Election Night 2004 to lock out members of the public and the media from their tabulation room .
The president of the county 's Board of Commissioners claimed at the time that during a " face - to - face meeting between the FBI and our director of emergency services we were informed that on a scale from one to 10 ... Warren County in particular was rated at 10 , 10 being the top highest risk . "
Nobody , however , in Warren County has ever named the supposed FBI official who gave the warning , and to this day , the director of the county 's Department of Emergency Services , Frank R. Young , will not reveal the name of the official with whom he claims he spoke , even as the FBI maintains " there was no information given to Warren County of an imminent terrorist threat to that county or to Southern Ohio , " and that " None of our agents ... advised of any type of any terrorist threat or anything like that . "
Additionally , no one has ever been held accountable for what happened .
During
The BRAD BLOG 's exclusive interview last December with Ohio's new Secretary of State , Jennifer Brunner , she was asked about the infamous Warren County Lockdown and encouraged to investigate the matter to ensure something similar would not be allowed to occur during the 2008 election .
She noted that she was still " troubled " by the ' 04 incident and " [ could n't ] find any justification for it . "
" We 'll look again at that situation and see what the best course of action is to prevent it from happening in the future , " she promised at the time .
The Cincinnati Enquirer picked up on that section of our interview at the time , and now , going on four years since the Lockdown occurred --- first reported by The BRAD BLOG on November 8 , 2004 --- a mainstream corporate media outlet has finally taken the issue seriously enough to devote some resources to a legitimate investigation .
Jon Craig 's investigative report in Sunday 's Cincinnati Enquirer notes : " Among those locked out were an Enquirer reporter , a TV reporter , and a stringer from the Associated Press . "
He goes on to report that " ( t ) he AP had stringers at all 88 boards of elections , and only in Warren County were they not allowed in . "
Despite a misleading summary early in Craig 's article , asserting the paper has " learned ...
A casual conversation about terrorism between the county emergency services director and a friendly FBI agent in a parking lot may have been the final trigger for the lockdown , " what 's clear is that to this day , no one from the FBI has ever come forward to substantiate Young 's claims .
Even today , while Young is taking responsibility for recommending the lockdown , he 's sticking to his story that it was his conversation with an FBI official --- whom he still refuses to name --- that led him to his decision .
Both the FBI and the Warren County Sheriff tell Craig that Young 's claims , essentially , are complete bullshit ...
On that crucial point , from today 's Enquirer report :
Frank R. Young , director of the county ’s Department of Emergency Services , said in an interview last week that he recommended the lockdown .
He said it was inspired , in part , by a conversation he had with an FBI agent in October , while planning security for an unrelated public event .
That conversation took place in the parking lot of the Hamilton Township Administration Building .
Young asked the FBI agent how seriously to take the threats .
The agent – whom Young would not identify – told him : “ We take it very seriously .
There are factions in this country that want to go after – and see disruption of whatever it is – whether it ’s an election or whatever . ’’
Young said the conversation “ was not necessarily what prompted the actions ... We just wanted to have some extra protection around the building , because you never know what kind of a nut is out there . ’’
But Warren County Sheriff Tom Ariss has a different recollection of decisions leading to the lockdown : “ My understanding is the FBI was never contacted .
They never talked to anybody . ”
The FBI looked into whether anyone had told Warren County authorities about a threat to the board of elections , FBI spokesman Michael Brooks said last week .
“ We concluded that there was no information given to Warren County of an imminent terrorist threat to that county or to Southern Ohio , ’’ Brooks said .
“ None of our agents did anything wrong ( or ) advised of any type of any terrorist threat or anything like that . ’’
...
In an interview last week , Ariss insisted that Young “ would never talk to anybody ( from the FBI ) in a parking lot , because they would n’t know who the hell he was .
But I better keep my mouth shut , ” he said with a laugh .
“ I wo n’t even touch it .
Just knowing the FBI , they would have no reason to be up here ...
Had there been any concern , it should have been addressed to us because we are the provider of security on the county buildings . ’’
In other words , Young was then , and continues to be , full of shit .
Yet neither he , nor any members of the County Commission , have faced accountability for their decision or for their misleading statements to the media , which led to robbing the public of their ability to monitor the tabulation of their own Presidential Election , in one of the handful of counties where the fully faith - based results , as reported , tipped the scales to give George W. Bush an alleged victory for four more years .
As we must hit the road again this afternoon , we urge you to read Craig 's full report for yourself for additional notable details and documents as collected from interviews , public records requests , and more .
But one more item of note , for the moment , is that even today --- even after all of the books and reports on what happened in Ohio , including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s '06 report documenting in great detail " How 350,000 Votes Disappeared in Ohio " --- representatives of John Kerry 's ' 04 campaign still stand by their reprehensibly unforgivable decision not to keep their infamous campaign promise assuring that " every vote will be counted . "
A spokesperson reaffirms that decision in Craig 's article , even though the reported results were so close that a mere 6 votes registered for Kerry instead of Bush in each Ohio precinct would have changed the outcome of the election .
The " official " margin of " victory " for Bush in Ohio was just over 118,000 votes .
" Bush still carried the state by a large enough margin that it seems unlikely ... that even with all of these errors that Kerry could have won Ohio , " Kerry 's Ohio legal counsel , Cincinnati attorney Daniel J. Hoffheimer , tells the Enquirer today , as many of the same DNC attorneys across the country prepare to " protect " your votes again in 2008 .

Crispin Sartwell writes :
do me a favor ? : cut and paste this everywhere .
it ’s a…marketing ploy .
but it ’s sincere .
A Philosophical Challenge
My irritating yet astounding new book Against the State argues that ( 1 ) The political state or government rests on force and coercion .
(2) Force and coercion are always wrong if they ca n’t be morally justified .
( That is , the use of force is wrong if it lacks a moral justification . )
(3) The arguments for the moral legitimacy of state – for example those of Hobbes , Locke , Rousseau , Hume , Hegel , Rawls , and Habermas – are unsound .
(4) Hence , state power has not been shown to be morally defensible .
Until you show me otherwise , I conclude that government power is in every case illegitimate .
Not only are the existing arguments for the legitimacy of state power unsound ; they are pitiful .
They are embarrassments to the Western intellectual tradition .
So I issue a challenge : Give a decent argument for the moral legitimacy of state power , or reconstruct one of the traditional arguments in the face of the refutations in Against the State .
If you can ’t , I insist that you are rationally obliged to accept anarchism .
Henceforward , if you continue to support or observe the authority of government , you are an irrational cultist .
We ’re all anarchists now , baby , until further notice .
I may agree with Sartwell about legitimacy , depending on what he means by it .
But I detect a missing premise or two .
For example , that in the absence of a decent argument for the legitimacy of state power , you are rationally obliged to accept anarchism .
Are n’t you rationally obliged to accept the social system that does best relative to the values you care about ?
So what if human flourishing , not legitimacy , is your greatest concern .
You can still accept that all states are illegitimate .
But suppose the path to the best feasible anarchy leaves people worse off in terms of flourishing than in the best illegitimate states .
It seems , in that case , you would be rationally obliged to support states that do better for people than anarchy , despite their illegitimacy .
In which case , it would be irrational cultlike behavior to endorse anarchy just because it is not illegitimate .
Now , some people would say that doing better for people than the relevant non-state alternatives is all it means to say government is legitimate or coercion is justified in the relevant sense , but I do n’t think so .
It seems perfectly coherent to me to say both that an instance or pattern of coercion is morally unjustified and that it leaves its victims better off than they would be in the nearest anarchist possible worlds .
In that case , you just have to choose between flourishing and legitimacy .
I think moral and political philosophers have a bad tendency to make all normative vocabulary line up .
So you can retrofit all moral language so that “ justified ” just means “ best for flourishing . ”
But I think that we in fact have multiple conventional moral vocabularies that are orthogonal to one another , which relate messily , and sometime incoherently .
In the absence of a revisionist account of moral terms that gets them all to march in a single direction , you just have to accept that sometimes its best ( according to one conventional moral conception ) to do the wrong thing ( according to another conventional moral conception ) and there is nothing internal to reason or morality , as such , to tell you which conception generally carries overriding force .
Anyway …
The point is : Showing that the state is not legitimate does not deliver anarchy because “ If the state is not legitimate , then it is not morally defensible ” is a false premise .
The existence of a moral justification , in terms of flourishing , say , does n’t entail final moral justification , since there is no fact of the matter about the final authoritative moral vocabulary .
And the language of “ legitimacy ” may have its own internal logic that is at some level indifferent to flourishing .
So showing that the state is not legitimate need not entail that it is morally indefensible .
Note : I am not sure whether I agree with myself .
How High Heels Might Boost Your Sex Life Reseacher says sexy shoes help train muscles used during sex .
Feb. 12 , 2008  --
High heels may improve a woman 's sex life , a new study has found — but not in the way you might imagine .
The effect of heels on the male libido is well - known , but this research looked at the physical benefits of high heels for women .
Dr. Maria Angela Cerruto , a urologist at the University of Verona , Italy , found that the tippy - toe posture of heels can tone a woman 's abdomen and pelvic floor .
If true , not only will a nice high - heeled shoe attract the man , it may keep him , too .
While high heels are more commonly linked with problems of posture and bunions , Cerruto defends one of her own favorite articles of fashion .
" Like many women , I like high - heeled shoes ; they make you appear more slender and taller , " she says .
And she is pleased to have shown they can be good for you , too .
In a study to be published in the journal European Urology , Cerruto presented the results of her tests on 66 women under the age of 50 .
She found that if they stood with their feet at a 15 - degree angle to the ground ( the equivalent of a 3 - inch heel ) the electrical activity in their pelvic muscles was less — indicating the muscles were more relaxed with higher heels , thus improving their strength and ability to contract .
" We now hope to prove that wearing heels during daily activity may reduce the need for pelvic exercises , " says Dr. Cerruto .
Exercise — Step by Step
That would be great news for most women , who not only struggle with regular exercising , but who are also supposed to remember to do their " Kegels " — named after the doctor who first established the regimen in 1948 — or pelvic floor gymnastics .
According to the Mayo Clinic Web site , " pregnancy , childbirth , excess weight , chronic coughing and just getting older can all take a toll on your pelvic floor muscles . "
The guide recommends regular exercise of those muscles , adding that this can also be " helpful to women who have persistent problems " reaching sexual gratification .
If wearing heels is enough to keep your pelvic floor toned , many lovers of flats might consider stepping up .
Marina Sapia , a new mother in Rome , lit up at the news that wearing heels would do it .
" I do n't wear heels , because I am so tall , but I might start , if this is true , " she told ABC News .
And designers of high - heeled fashion welcomed the news that their creations might finally be considered healthy .
Manolo Blahnik , a shoe designer specializing in sexy high heels , told the Daily Mail that this was " wonderful news . "
" When you put on a high heel , it makes life more exciting , " Blahnik claims .
" It 's a way to appeal to the male species , to attract , " he added , " and it works .
I have men who tell me that heels have saved their marriage . "
He complains of being " hounded for years " about how bad it was for the posture , but found it puzzling .
His mother wore them until she was 87 with no ill consequences .
How High Is Too High ?
But even Blahnik admits that there is such a thing as a heel that is too high .
" I think there 's a limit , though .
Anything over four - and - a - half inches is just too much .
You can't walk properly ; it 's no longer elegant . "
But in fact , even four - and half inches is too high to be healthy .
A limited height — practical — is the key .
" Moderately high heels , " Cerruto calls them .
The news of high - heel benefits for the pelvis intrigues Sabrina Saudelli , a Rome beautician .
" It makes sense that heels are good for abdominal and pelvic muscles , " she thinks .
" To counter the lean forward , you tighten the abdominal muscles and push the pelvis under . "
An advocate for wearing heels in general , Saudelli claims " a small heel is actually good for the posture , much better than ballerina flats . "
But truly high heels , and especially a wobbly stiletto , is bad for the back and a risk for twisted ankles .
" Once you go over three inches regularly , " she adds , " your posture and back are going to suffer . "
So for all their sex appeal , stilettos , sadly , do n't count .

In a comment on But Y would I want to do a thing like this ?
Tom Moertel derived an elegant version of the actual Y combinator in Ruby .
I reproduce his words here with permission .
Tom uses the alternate syntax for .
I avoided this to keep clear of a tiresome debate about operator overloading .
( On one side : those who hate it .
On the other side : those that hate Ruby disallowing overloading ) .
Ok Tom , take it away !
Here ’s my original Ruby definition :
To get rid of the recursive call , let ’s replace it with a variable , whose value we ’ll say is magically equivalent to the result of the recursive call .
To effect the binding of , we ’ll need to wrap the method body in a new lambda expression and pass in the magic value :
So , what value should we pass in for ?
Because the variable represents the value that would have been computed by calling , which is just the body of themethod , we can fill the hole with a duplicate of the body :
And we have our Y combinator : While the combinator works , its implementation repeats itself : there are two copies of the lambda expressionin the method body .
To factor them out , let ’s let the variablerepresent this expression .
Then the method body simplifies to , which is very satisfying .
To setto the correct value , however , we need to add a wrapper lambda that bindsto the original expression .
Putting it all together , we arrive at the final version :
And it , too , works : Cheers ! —

KABUL ( Reuters ) - Afghanistan should set - up a transitional government that includes members of the Taliban once President Hamid Karzai ’s term ends late next year if it is to escape unending crisis , a grandson of the late former king said on Wednesday .

Once a prince , Mostafa Zaher now heads a department overseeing conservation issues in Karzai ’s government , and while the family royal family lacks a political powerbase it is often looked on as a symbol of national unity .
Like many Afghans , Zaher despairs that there is no end in sight to the Taliban insurgency , and conflict that has gripped the country since the late 1970s .
“ We are in the middle of a crisis at this very second , and the situation is getting worse , ” the balding former prince told journalists , adding that decisiveness and vision were needed .
Zaher , 44 , has spent three decades living in exile in the West , and has degrees in political science and economics from Canada .
His grandfather , the late King Mohammed Zahir Shah , returned to his homeland in 2002 , months after U.S. - backed forces drove the Taliban from power .
After returning to Afghanistan , Shah renounced his throne , and in return was accorded the honorary title of “ father of the nation ” .
He died last year .
Despite the presence of more than 55,000 foreign troops , attacks by the Taliban have dramatically jumped since 2006 in Afghanistan , prompting some Western politicians to warn recently that the country may slide back into anarchy .
Less than two weeks ago , Taliban gunmen tried to assassinate Karzai while he attended a military parade near the presidential palace in Kabul .
Like the royal family , Karzai is a Pashtun .
But he has struggled to garner support among fellow Pashtuns .
Most of the Taliban are Pashtuns too , and complaints are often voiced that the Pashtuns are under - represented in Karzai ’s government .
Zaher says the transitional administration he envisages would include members of the current government , along with members of the Taliban and other insurgent groups fighting U.S. , NATO and government forces .
“ We had enough of the war and fratricide .
The Taliban are also the sons of this country , ” said Zaher , who fears Afghanistan could disintegrate unless the crisis ends .
“ You do not make peace with your friends .
You make peace with those who are against you .
This is an intra-Afghan plan and we hope to bring on board all of dissatisfied people , ” he said .
The transitional government would summon a Loya Jirga , Afghanistan ’s traditional grand council of tribal leaders and elders , to determine how to change the system of government from a strong presidential system to one that revolved round parliament , Zaher said .
He denies harbouring political ambitions , but did not rule out the possibility of taking some role if he had people ’s backing .
Clearing up the turf could cost hundreds of pounds
The entire sixth year of a school was sent home on their last day after pupils turfed over the floor of their common room .
Teachers at Banchory Academy took the step after it was discovered some pupils had been drinking .
Aberdeenshire Council said it was decided to send all 100 pupils home .
A spokesman said there were concerns about disruption to exams taking place in the school .
One 17 - year - old pupil was charged with breach of the peace .
' Particularly disappointing '
An Aberdeenshire Council spokesman said : " Banchory Academy is extremely disappointed that the disruptive actions of a number of sixth year pupils has spoiled what was due to be an enjoyable day of activities to mark their last day of term .
" There was evidence that some pupils had been drinking and given the size of the year group the head teacher has had no choice but to send all of them home , both for their own safety and to avoid any disruption to standard grade exams under way today .
" This will be particularly disappointing for those sixth years who were genuinely looking forward to their last day of term . "
The spokesman added : " A day of activities had been planned to but due to the actions of a minority of pupils this has had to be cancelled .
" This is a very poor way for pupils to end their school career and we hope those who disrupted the day understand the upset their actions have caused . "
The cost of clearing up the turf has been estimated at hundreds of pounds .

What are these ?
IT may not surprise you to learn that much of the pork and chicken and beef and milk that you buy at the grocery store comes from huge , industrial - size operations that bear little resemblance to the quaint family farms that adorn many food packages .
But you may be surprised to learn that your tax dollars have helped pave the way for the growth of these livestock megafarms by paying farmers to deal with the mountains of excrement that their farms generate .
All of this is carried out under the rubric of “ conservation . ”
Congress is about to renew the program  and possibly even expand it  as part of a new farm bill wending its way through the Capitol .
It ’s called the Environmental Quality Incentives Program , also known as EQIP  a name that suggests an initiative to encourage farmers to improve environmental standards .
And , in fact , when the program was created as part of the 1996 farm bill , that ’s exactly what it was .
At the time , the government agreed to pay a share  up to 75 percent  of a conservation project , and the payments were limited to $ 10,000 a year .
Farmers used the money for small - scale projects that had environmental benefits , like planting cover crops to prevent erosion and soak up excess nitrogen or installing fencing to better manage grazing cattle .
The first public taste of rocket racing will take place Aug. 1 and Aug. 2 in Oshkosh , Wis. , Whitelaw said , at the annual Experimental Aircraft Association air show .
It will involve two of the sleek aircraft developed for the league .
The racers will also perform at air shows in Nevada and New Mexico .
( More information is available at rocketracingleague.com . )
Competition should begin in 2009 , the founders said .
That is quite a bit later than the league planned .
Rocket Racing was announced in 2005 , and the company released animations showing what a race might look like , with plenty of swooping and blazing rockets .
The founders said then that the first races would be held in 2006 .
The league ’s plans have faltered in the interim .
A video game based on the races that the founders said would be produced has not emerged , and one of its original teams , Leading Edge Rocket Racing , dropped out last year , issuing a statement that suggested the league was in disarray .
“ Some of the things took longer than we had anticipated , ” Whitelaw said .
He added , “ We ’re 15 months behind where I thought we would be , which is not too shabby . ”
The league ’s co-founder , Peter Diamandis , served as chairman of the X Prize Foundation , which awarded the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004 for the first privately financed human flight to space .
Diamandis said in an e-mail interview that “ most pioneers who enter this business are , typically , optimists , and tend to believe things can be accomplished faster than it really takes . ”
The league , he said , fits into a broader goal of “ making space a firsthand experience ” for people , and driving down the cost of getting to space through commercial ventures .
Whitelaw stressed that the league was a business .
It will patent technological innovations on its racers , like safety features , in hopes of making money off them should they make their way into general aviation , and it will try to build profits out of television and merchandising rights .
The company will also sell conventional jet - engine versions of the Velocity racer , he said .
It 's true :
The coolest gadgets often debut overseas -- usually in Asia .
Some are cell phones that double as music players or TVs .
Others are supersmall yet powerful notebooks or handheld PCs .
And some are just weird , like the world 's most disturbing piggy bank .
Luckily ( in some cases , anyway ) , you may not be totally shut out when it comes to procuring one .
Though these devices are n't officially for sale in North America , some are available from gray - market importers such as Dynamism.com , or on eBay .
Just make sure that you can obtain a service plan to support what you buy , if appropriate .
Erica Lancellotti is Ryan Seacrest 's Secret Girlfriend ( Photos )
Erica Lancellotti
is off the market ?
Say it ai n't so !
First the news that Matthew McConaughey is going to be a dad , and now I find out Ryan Seacrest has a secret girlfriend named .
Pretty soon ALL my future ex husbands will be off the market .
What 's a girl to do ?
Oh , I almost forgot ... this is not about me .
It 's about Erica Lancellotti .
That 's the girl who is supposedly American Idol host Ryan Seacrest 's girlfriend .
She 's a bartender in NYC , and owns a company called BarCandy , which is apparently some big deal , and the premier bartending service in New York .
Whatever .
Anyway , it seems Ryan and Erica were at Nello restaurant in NYC on December 29 , and were looking very romantic , holding hands , drinking champagne and laughing over dinner .
According to reports , Erica told In Touch magazine :
“ We have been dating on and off for a few years , ” she confides .
“ We met at the Wetbar of the W hotel in New York and the only thing that has kept us apart has been his busy schedule . ”
Asked about her exact role in Ryan ’s like , Erica responded , “ What surprised me most was when we were at Nello and someone asked who I was , and he said I was his girlfriend . ”
How does Erica feel about her new title ?
“ He ’s a great guy and I love him . ”
Yeah , whatever .
I do n't care .
Really .
The photo above is reportedly of Erica Lancellotti .
There are more photos below .
This is a photo from the contact page of BarCandy .
Ryan briefly dated Desperate Housewives ' Terri Hatcher
When the recent Time Machine and AirPort Updates 1.0 update was released , users quickly discovered that the update enabled an AirPort Disk to be used as a backup drive for Time Machine .
Much rejoicing ensued , since the change meant that it was n't necessary to fork out the dough for a Time Capsule if you already own an Airport Extreme Base Station .
Still , some people were still a bit suspicious of the change .
The suspicion seems to be correct , too .
Glenn Fleishman reports at TidBITS that Apple confirmed to him that the Time Machine +
AirPort Disk combination is officially " unsupported . "
So what does " unsupported " mean , anyway ?
Well as some intrepid users have already discovered , it means that Apple wo n't help you out with any problems related to a Time Machine backup to an AirPort Disk , which could be problematic if you break it .
It 's also possible that the functionality either wo n't work quite right , will break somehow ( possibly losing your backups ) , or will be removed by Apple in the future .
But if you 're willing to accept those caveats , then go for it .
As somewhat of an aside , I 'm surprised that Apple still has n't done anything official about this .
The company could either issue a statement or remove the functionality , but has n't done either , despite Fleishman prompting the company for a statement since March .
So far , it appears that Apple is taking the same kind of " silence as permission " approach that is has done with iPhone hacking , but it would be nice if it could at least let people know that the particular usage is n't supported .
I also would n't be particularly surprised to see the functionality disappear in the next AEBS or Time Machine update , though , so I would n't recommend using the Time Machine +
AirPort Disk trick as your sole backup solution .

There was nothing ominous about the knock at the door , but when I pulled it open I was confronted by four police officers and our street was thick with panda cars .
This is not a scene you see too often in our home village of Great Malvern , not even if there has been a rare burglary in the respectable part of Worcestershire where we live happily among other decent , law - abiding families .
But the police were not coming to our aid .
Instead they were coming to arrest me and my husband Folke for child abuse .
Scroll down for more ...
Before the nightmare : Susan Pope and her three children photographed with an entertainer during a Christmas trip to Harrods in London in 2006 .
The faces of Guy and Harriet have been obscured to protect their identity
Looking me straight in the eye the officer said : " We are about to arrest you for cruelty and neglect to Guy Pope . "
Guy is our 11 - year - old son .
And my crime ?
Smacking him once after he had ignored my warnings to stop his temper tantrum and repeated swearing .
He and his 16 - year - old brother , Oliver , had then concocted a tissue of lies claiming we had starved and beaten them and - far worse in their eyes - refused to let them have their games consoles .
But rather than examining my well - fed younger son and his unmarked , if rebellious brother , the police had called in social services and arrested us .
Folke and I were about to be thrown in police cells for the next 32 hours , interrogated by detectives and warned we would be facing charges .
Worst of all , we would see our children placed on the child protection register by social workers who believe an isolated smack is child abuse .
Nearly a year later I 've lost my job at a private school - and my unblemished career with it - and my family is still subject to the whims of the social services because , I believe , we had the temerity to fight our corner .
Resolute : Despite her ordeal , Susan Pope says parents must have the right to punish children
For all the heartache , however , I can appreciate a certain bitter irony in finding myself in this position .
I worked with children throughout my 25 - year career as a nurse - first in paediatrics and A&E , and latterly at Malvern St James , a local all - girls private school .
I am aware of the boundaries when it comes to discipline inside and outside the home , but if society needs boundaries to avoid anarchy , then so do children .
My husband and I moved to Worcestershire in 1987 .
Folke is a chartered surveyor and we have three children :
Oliver , now 17 , is at a sixth - form college , Guy is at the local comprehensive and Harriet , nine , attends Malvern St James .
I had just picked up Guy and Harriet from school on the Thursday before the bank holiday weekend last May when they began to bicker .
Guy was in a foul mood when we reached home and my patience was wearing thin because , despite repeated warnings , he began to swear at me rather than calm down .
" Guy , enough is enough , " I said .
" I will not have you swearing at me .
" You have already been warned about this .
If you do n't stop you will get a smack . "
He stormed out of the house and went off in search of Oliver .
When they returned , there was more trouble .
Guy said " F*** off , you cow " to me once too often , so I smacked him once on the backside , firmly but not hard .
Smacking is a last resort , but Folke and I believe it is our right as parents to administer this punishment if absolutely necessary .
Guy and Oliver stormed off .
Folke went to fetch them - we had a good idea where they 'd be .
Oliver had fallen in with a local family who to me represent many of the problems in society : the children ( who have different fathers ) are able to do as they please without any parental control .
Oliver had been playing truant and would sometimes stay with this family at night .
As much as we disapproved , at least he was safe .
When Folke arrived at this family 's house he was met by the police .
An officer said : " Serious allegations of physical and mental abuse have been made against you by your children and you are not allowed to go near them . "
The allegations were , of course , completely untrue .
Oliver subsequently admitted he had provoked Guy before calling the police himself and making the claims on Guy 's behalf .
Folke returned home furious but also in a state of shock .
Then two policemen arrived at our house and said they wanted to check Harriet was safe .
Incredibly , we were also told Guy was going to stay with this other family despite the fact that they had not been subject to any Criminal Record Bureau checks and had no foster - parenting experience .
There was not even any Emergency Protection Order ( EPO ) in place - required before your children can be subject to local authority care .
I felt our family was fragmenting before our eyes .
Knowing you cannot go near your child and have lost all sense of control is agony .
But I was determined to hold it together .
Both boys stayed the night with this family and the next morning I tried frantically to contact Social Services .
Eventually a social worker called us and said : " You 're not allowed to see Guy this weekend .
We will be reviewing the situation after the bank holiday . "
With the benefit of hindsight we should have called a solicitor immediately , but we were in shock .
So Folke spent the weekend sanding floorboards while I tried to keep Harriet entertained .
Since Oliver was 16 at the time , there was little we could do but let him fend for himself .
On Tuesday , we went to our solicitor Nick Turner and began to kick up merry hell with Social Services .
We warned them that because they had no EPO they had no right to dictate where Guy went and we would see them in court .
Rather than apologise , they told us : " We will be interviewing your children whether you like it or not .
" You are under investigation for child abuse .
Stay away from Guy . "
Just as we were about to leave to go to court , the police arrived and placed us under arrest on suspicion of child abuse .
Folke had to text his father and brother asking them to attend the court in our absence .
At Worcester police station , I was ordered to remove my hair grip and pins and had to place my Kurt Geiger shoes next to a pair of trainers belonging to a tramp .
We spent the next 32 hours in freezing cells furnished with a plastic mattress , threadbare pillow and a filthy lavatory .
I had to ring for lavatory paper - supplied four sheets at a time .
Eventually , on Friday evening , I was led into a tiny interview room where two stern - faced female detectives lay in wait .
Initially I felt scared but then an overwhelming sense of outrage swept over me .
" Why did you smack Guy 's bottom ? " demanded one of the officers .
" Surely you know this is abuse ?
Why have you not fed him properly ? "
" This is ridiculous , " I said .
" My son is not emaciated and smacking is only used as a last resort .
" As far as I know , reasonable chastisement is still legal in this country . "
Later that night we were released on bail but warned we faced further investigation .
Indeed , as we walked away from the police station , a social worker appeared and warned us we still could not see Guy except under supervision for two hours a week .
In the meantime they were going to assess us as parents .
That was the first time I had ever heard my husband tell someone to " F*** off " .
By the time we arrived home we were dishevelled , filthy and on the edge of hysteria .
But thankfully there was some good news : the judge had thrown out Social Services ' case because officials did not have a leg to stand on .
My brother - in - law had contacted them after the ruling and said : " We are collecting Guy and there is nothing you can do about it . "
Guy had been away from our house for seven nights and was getting very concerned .
The enormity of what he and Oliver had done had long since sunk in .
Meanwhile , Folke and I had yet more meetings to attend .
First was a child protection meeting in Worcester .
Moments before we went in , the supposedly independent chairman told me Rosalind Hayes , the headteacher at Malvern St James , was going to be there and that he had already told her I should be suspended due to the seriousness of the allegations .
Over the next three hours , Folke and I faced a barrage of accusations .
" Why does Guy have no furniture in his bedroom ? " we were asked .
This was easy enough to explain .
It was obvious , even from a cursory examination , that we were in the middle of refurbishing our Victorian house .
The floorboards were being stripped , ready to be varnished .
But the accusations became more and more ridiculous .
" Why are you starving them and depriving them of toys ? "
We explained that both allegations were nonsense .
The " starvation " claim stemmed from the fact that Guy had been putting on too much weight , so when he demanded snacks between meals I 'd sometimes say no .
As for depriving the boys of toys , Oliver and Guy have a Nintendo DS , a Sony PlayStation and a computer .
Like many parents , however , I would not let them vegetate in front of a screen all day .
Our explanations to the panel made not the slightest difference - we were told Harriet and Guy would be placed on the Child Protection Register .
We were horrified and humiliated but determined not to give in and refused to sign any paperwork .
Two days later I received a letter from Malvern St James confirming my suspension , although I was assured the school would support me .
Then came another knock at the door .
It was four social workers , demanding that we sign a child protection plan so that they could assess our suitability as parents .
When I read it I noticed the names on the form were not ours .
When I pointed this out , the senior social worker said he would cut and paste our names in .
Eventually we did sign a replacement - document because it seemed the only way to get Guy back home .
When we finally went to pick Guy up from my brother - in - law 's home , he was deeply upset .
" I just want to go home , " he said .
" Please , Mum . "
We gave him a big hug and reassured him that we loved him .
Since then , we have been trying to piece our family back together again .
The police dropped the case against us but the assessment period imposed by Social Services , which was meant to be completed within 35 days , has still not expired and we have no idea when it will stop .
If the children were at risk then surely they would be the subject of court proceedings ?
Being on the register means we must inform social services if we travel abroad .
And if we are in another part of the UK , we must tell the child protection team in that area .
But there is little chance of us going on holiday because I have lost my job .
In January , I attended a disciplinary hearing with my Royal College of Nursing rep , the school bursar Denis Smith and human resources manager Angela Hensher .
After a short preamble , I was told I was sacked - the end of an impeccable career , just like that .
Apparently , the school was worried about its reputation because my children were on the at - risk register .
A month later Mr Smith was convicted at Worcester Crown Court of dangerous driving and failing to provide a breath specimen - he had rammed a police car during an 80 mph chase .
He was banned from driving for three years and given a suspended eight - month jail term - but he was n't sacked by the school .
I am now taking the school to an employment tribunal , suing police for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment and pursuing more than a dozen complaints against Worcestershire Social Services .
Harriet is still haunted by the whole experience and finds it very difficult to sleep at night .
Guy has been trying to block out the whole affair .
Oliver has also finally shown some remorse .
" Look , I am really sorry , " he told us .
" I realise I made a terrible mistake and I am going to make it up to you . "
He then went on his own to our solicitor 's firm and made a statement withdrawing all the allegations .
Of course , we do n't blame the children - they can't possibly have known what was going to happen .
But we are determined to take action against the police and Social Services , not just for ourselves , but on behalf of other parents who are being hounded in a similar fashion .
Parents need to have the power to set boundaries for their children .
Without discipline in the home , children grow up with no sense of right and wrong .
Folke and I adore our children and try to avoid smacking at all costs .
But we would not hesitate to do the same again .
If our battle helps to restore the power of discipline to parents - not to mention teachers and police on the beat - then some good will have emerged from this terrible ordeal .
• When The Mail on Sunday approached Malvern St James , the school announced it had now accepted the resignation of Denis Smith on the grounds of ill - health .
Police and Social Services refused to comment .
Five time Space Shuttle Astronaut Scott Parazynski , 46 , will be fulfilling a life long dream of climbing Mt. Everest " on his own time and on his own dime time " this May .
True to form , Parazynski's packing list would make any Shuttle commander proud , down to the weight in grams of everything he is taking with him .
What is different about this mission however is how participatory it is .
Scott is blogging about the trip , has posted his packing list online ( down to what is in his " Summit Bling " bag ) , and will even be twittering from Everest .
You can follow all the action at www.onorbit.com/everest.
Parazynski plans to summit the highest mountain in the world with Ang Namgya , Adam Janikowski , and Ang Chhiring .
According to his most recent blog post ( and the posted timeline ) Scott has left Kathmandu and is beginning the 11 - 12 day trek to Everest Base Camp ( EBC ) .
In addition to the summit team there is also a group that calls themselves " Team NASA , " 17 people who work in and around NASA 's Johnson Space Center who will do their own trek to Everest Base Camp in support of Scott in early May .
Although Team NASA is also taking annual leave and paying their own way to participate in the expedition , NASA is being very supportive .
Team NASA has their own wiki where you can meet some of them too .
I highly recommend checking it out , it is not only heartening but also very humorous .
OnOrbit.com includes a " trailer " about the upcoming expedition to help get you in the trekking mood :
www.youtube.com/watch?v=&hl=en
My favorite quote from Scott 's blog is him talking about the parallels between space missions and high altitude mountaineering :
[ T ] here are so many parallels between the exploration we do in space to what we 'll be doing in the Himalayas .
Years of training , abiding by lessons learned from earlier missions , attention to detail when preparing your gear , the importance of teamwork , the use of technology to solve difficult problems , the importance of diet and hydration , and monitoring of the weather to plan your activities are some of the many commonalities we hope to explore over the course of the coming weeks on the mountain .
You can also get really participatory and join Team NASA in training for the expedition by visiting their train like a rocket scientist page ...

A New Zealand man who found himself in a service station queue with no money has attempted to pay for his food with cannabis , the Dominion Post newspaper reported .
Unfortunately he did not get a chance to discover whether the attendant would accept his offer , as the person behind him in the queue was a police officer .
The man 's attempt to buy two packets of chocolate and a packet of potato chips to satisfy his " munchies " was caught short when he was arrested .
He must have been hungry , as he failed to notice the police patrol car being filled with petrol , the paper reported .
The 28 - year - old mechanic from the small North Island town of Carterton pleaded guilty to possessing cannabis in the Masterton District Court and was remanded for sentencing .

President Bush ’s plan to deploy missile defenses in Central Europe will reduce U.S. security , not enhance it .
Installing radar for tracking incoming missiles in the Czech Republic and anti-missile interceptors in Poland could do more harm than good .
Ostensibly , the European radar and interceptors are aimed at the future threat of nuclear - armed Iranian missiles .
But Russia suspects  perhaps with good reason  that the real purpose of the deployments is to cement the security guarantees the United States has given to the two former Russian allies .
In addition , Russia fears , also with justification , that the missile defenses could be augmented someday and used against Russian missiles .
Moscow ’s vitriolic threat to pull out of an arms - control agreement in protest is a warning the United States should heed .
After the Warsaw Pact dissolved and the Soviet Union collapsed , a weak Russia rolled over during two rounds of NATO expansion into what used to be Eastern Bloc territory .
A stronger Russia now regrets such conciliatory policies because they have left the country feeling encircled .
In short , the Russian bear is now tired of having its nose pushed in the dirt and is growling back .
Even if a missile - defense system can be made to work  still an open question after more than 20 years of research and development , costing many billions of dollars  the United States needs to ask whether the risks it would create outweigh the risks it conceivably would reduce .
And the greatest risk of all is the possibility that it could ensnare the United States in an unnecessary conflict with a nuclear - armed Russia .
The problem with even a working missile defense has always been that an adversary can more cheaply build decoys and other countermeasures , or even additional missiles , to overcome or defeat an expensive and limited defense system .
Faced with such defenses , Russia and Iran could both adopt some or all of these responses , triggering a new arms race .
The United States and Russia have been reducing their nuclear arsenals , but a U.S. missile - defense deployment , especially in Europe , could reverse that trend .
The sobering truth is that the potent U.S. nuclear arsenal is still the best way to deter adversaries from a nuclear attack on the United States .
Deterrence is a better , safer , and cheaper alternative than missile defense .
Furthermore , as a price for allowing the deployment of U.S. missile interceptors on its soil , Poland is demanding enhanced U.S. guarantees of protection from Russia .
But if the interceptors are designed to protect Poland and other European countries from Iranian nuclear missiles , why should the United States have to promise Poland favors to win the right to do it another favor ?
Besides , what more could Poland possibly want than the already existing U.S. promise under the NATO treaty to defend Poland from outside attack ?
The Czech Republic will probably also want a payoff to gain enhanced security from Iranian missiles .
Small nations have a history of manipulating their protectors .
They appeal to the protector ’s desire to be the “ Big Man ( or Woman ) on Campus . ”
In the past , Japan has done so when demanding trade concessions from the United States as the price for allowing the United States to retain military bases in Japan , which protect that country .
The United States foolishly has agreed to meet Japan ’s demands , just as it probably will to win Czech and Polish support for missile - defense deployments in their countries .
It is sad to see the United States beg and give payoffs to European allies to assume an even greater burden in protecting them , while pursuing policies that could damage relations with Russia and fuel a possible arms race .
Plans for U.S. missile defenses should be scrapped .

Ziff Davis filed for bankruptcy in the Southern District Court of New York today as part of a debt restructuring plan .
[ UPDATE : Industry reacts ]
The technology publisher said the restructuring agreement was made with an ad hoc group of senior secured note holders .
The group has agreed to pay up to $ 24.5 million to fund the Ziff Davis ’ operations during and after the Chapter 11 case , the company says .
If the restructuring is approved , the company ’s $ 225 million senior note debt would be reduced .
The debt would then be exchanged for a new $ 50 million senior secured note and at least 88.8 percent of the common stock in the reorganized company .
As part of the restructuring , the publisher intends to implement a reorganization soon .
“ This agreement underscores our Senior Secured Noteholders ’ confidence in our ability to position ourselves for continued profitable growth , " CEO Jason Young said in a statement .
" Today ’s restructuring agreement goes a long way towards resolving the burdens of a debt load and capital structure established seven years ago , during a leveraged buyout of the company . ”
Ziff Davis also announced that it was not able to reach an agreement with all of its unsecured noteholders .
Carrying long - term debt of about $ 400 million , Ziff last August announced that it was exploring options to restructure its debt and would not make a scheduled interest payment on its senior subordinated compounding notes due in 2009 .
The company retained corporate turnaround and bankruptcy specialists Alvarez & Marsal and Kirkland & Ellis LLP as advisors as part of the restructuring plan .
Young could not be immediately reached for additional comments .

Charlie Stross is hosting an open conversation on other things we could have bought with the money wasted in Iraq : for example , we could have sent a colony of over 500 astronauts to Mars , provided modern nuclear power to the USA and shut down its coal plants , built modern cities for 600,000,000 Chinese people to live in , and so on :
For $ 6Tn we could buy a lot of juice – a quarter of our global civilization 's energy budget would go carbon - neutral at a stroke .
( Yes , we just solved our carbon dioxide emissions problem by switching to a nuclear economy . )
This probably is n't the ideal way of dealing with our environmental problems , and it's a naive treatment of the costs ( has anyone done a proper treatment of the economic implications of shifting the planet over to a nuclear economy , say to the same extent as France ? ) but it 's thought - provoking .
Finally , there 's all the other little stuff we could solve by pointing $ 513 Bn at it , never mind $ 6000 Bn .
Eliminating childhood diseases in South - East Asia ?
Piffle – Bill and Melinda Gates are trying to do that out of their pocket lint .
Build first - world grade housing in shiny new cities for 600 million Chinese peasants , nearly a tenth of the planetary population ?
Yes , this budget will cover that .
What else ?
Yes , I 'm asking you : what would you do with the cost of the Iraq war ( take your pick : $ 513 Bn or $ 6000 Bn ) in your budget ?
Colonise Mars ?
Solve our carbon emission problem and fix global warming ?

Or something else …?

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Lawmakers grilled executives from the world 's five largest publicly traded oil companies Tuesday , criticizing them for taking tax subsidies and not investing in renewable resources amid record prices for oil and gasoline .
" Americans are hoping that the top executives from the five largest oil companies will tell us that these soaring gas prices are just part of some elaborate hoax , " said Ed Markey , D - Mass , chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming .
" Unfortunately , it 's not a joke . "
Markey slammed executives from Exxon Mobil ( XOM , Fortune 500 ) , Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSA ) , BP ( BP ) , Chevron ( CVX , Fortune 500 ) , and ConocoPhillips ( COP , Fortune 500 ) for their opposition to eliminating about $ 18 billion in tax breaks over a ten year period amid record profits for the industry .
" Last year these companies alone made over $ 123 billion in profit , " said Markey .
" What is the oil industry doing with all this profit ?
Unfortunately , it goes as much to financial engineering as to renewable engineering . "
Several lawmakers , mostly Democrats , want to take the tax break away from oil companies and use the money to subsidize renewable energy projects .
" This is where we should be putting scarce resources , not into areas that probably do n't need our help , " said Oregon Democrat Earl Blumenauer .
Shell Oil Company president John Hofmeister , said that the energy supply outlook was " sobering " and that the U.S. needed to tackle the energy quandary with programs akin to the Manhattan Project , or Apollo moon launch .
Tax breaks : A hard nut to crack
The oil industry , along with the Bush administration , argue that it 's unfair to target the oil industry when these tax breaks are available to all manufacturers .
They also say the breaks are essential to encourage domestic oil production and reducing the country 's dependence on foreign oil .
" I do not believe that funding renewable energy by taxing current forms of energy serves American customers very well , " said John Shadegg R- Arizona .
Stephen Simon , Senior Vice President , Exxon Mobil Corp. reiterated that point .
" Imposing punitive taxes on American companies will discourage the investments needed to safeguard our energy security .
The pursuit of alternative fuels must not detract from investments in oil and gas , " he said .
The oil executives urged the panel to open up areas off the U.S. east and west coasts for oil and gas drilling , arguing that bringing more supply to market is one of the best ways to lower prices .
" The U.S. government restricts supply to American consumers , " said Shell 's Hofmeister .
" Open up the 95 percent of the outer continental shelf that 's off limits , " said Peter Robertson , vice chairman of Chevron .
Most drilling off the U.S. coasts has been banned since the 1970s .
A proposal to lift the ban surfaced in 2006 , but was defeated .
But with sky - high oil prices and growing demand worldwide , interest in offshore U.S. oil has been revived .
" We all know that we have resources off the coast , and these can be developed , " said Rep. Marsha Blackburn , R - Tenn .
Other lawmakers were far less sympathetic to the executives .
Markey hammered Exxon 's Simon over the company 's investment in renewable energy .
" Why is Exxon Mobil resisting the renewable energy revolution ? " asked Markey .
Simon said Exxon has given $ 100 million to Stanford to study renewables .
" $ 100 million ? " said Markey .
" But you made $ 40 billion last year . "
When pressed , Simon said Exxon believes the current generation of renewable energy options will not be able to significantly meet demand .
Referring to reports showing that low income people are paying 10 percent or more of their income on gas Markey said , " So your message to them is you can't do anything for them , " he said .
Exxon has long said it is in the business of oil , and that it prefers to leave renewable energy up to the renewable energy companies .
Although the company has received some praise - even from its critics - for its investments in cutting - edge battery technology .
The House has tried to repeal the tax break several times , only to have it shot down in the Senate and face a veto threat from President Bush .
With oil trading at over $ 100 a barrel and Americans forking out over $ 3 a gallon for gas , the oil industry has come under fire for its record profits over the last few years .
Exxon Mobil made $ 40 billion in 2007 alone , and the other big companies have all posted record profits in the billions .
Critics say the oil companies deliberately keep supplies of gasoline tight , and there have been calls to break up the big firms and enact a windfall profits tax .
The industry has argued they need to be big to compete with large state - owned oil companies from places like Russia and China .
They also say that while the raw numbers are high , their profit margin - at around 9 percent - is roughly in line with other industries .
Markey concluded the hearing with what sounded like warning - urging the oil companies to invest in renewables and do something to lower the price of gas before what he promised would be several more congressional hearings .
" To the extent that you do n't have to take all of this as profit and you can lower your prices , I urge you to do so , " he said .
" My grandfather always said , you should try to start from where you know you 'll end up . "
Ever wondered how an electric microwave works ?
Martin | Aug / 3 / 2019 | 0
Every single house nowadays have a microwave .
Some have expensive ones while some just use simple one to warm their food .
But , how it is originated , how it works and how to increase it 's efficiency , these are the questions that …
In 2006 , Mason Peck at Cornell University in Ithaca dreamt up with an entirely new way to control satellites orbiting planets that have a magnetic field .
The idea is based on the Lorentz force : that a charged particle moving through a magnetic field experiences a force perpendicular to both its velocity and the field .
So the plan is to somehow ensure that the spacecraft becomes electrically charged as it moves through the planetary magnetic field which should then generate a force that can alter the orbit or orientation of the vehicle .
The big advantage of so - called Lorentz actuated orbit control is that it requires no propellant .
That ’s a big deal since the amount of fuel a spacecraft can carry is the main factor that determines its lifespan .
Propellant - free propulsion could significantly increase their operaitng lives .
Today , Peck along with William Gorman and James Brownridge at the State University of New York at Binghamton present the results of the first experimental trials of the idea .
The work was funded by NASA but it has to be said : it does n’t look entirely promising .
The team tested the ability of various objects to hold a charge in a vacuum while being bombarded with plasma , as would be the case in orbit .
To generate the charge on the test object , they attached it to a sample of radioactive Americium - 24 , an alpha - particle emitter , and applied a voltage .
The electric field carries away the positively charged alpha particles leaving the object highly charged .
I ’ll let the team take up the tale :
“ Microscopic arcing was observed at voltages as low as - 300 V .
This arcing caused solder to explode off of the object . “
Obviously , a proplusion system that explodes while it is in operation needs some more work .
The early pioneers of experimental propulsion systems such as Robert Goddard and Werner von Braun all had to cope with catastrophic failures , so Peck , Gorman and Brownridge are in good company .
And as long as nobody gets hurt , a decent explosion livens up any experiment .
So stick with it fellas .
Something tells me that if NASA funds the future development of this system , we ’re going to be in for some fun .

1. Overview
People have tried to understand space , time , motion , and the notion of " continuum " for thousands of years .
This pursuit lead to the Pythagoreans discovery of irrational numbers , Zeno 's paradoxes , infinitesimal calculus , transfinite set theory , relativity theory , quantum physics , and many more intriguing ideas .
What do we mean when we say " continuum " ?
Here 's a description Albert Einstein gave on p. 83 of his Relativity : The Special and the General Theory :
The surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me .
I can get from any one point on this table to any other point by passing continuously from one point to a " neighboring " one , and repeating this process a ( large ) number of times , or , in other words , by going from point to point without executing " jumps . "
I am sure the reader will appreciate with sufficient clearness what I mean here by " neighbouring " and by " jumps " ( if he is not too pedantic ) .
We express this property of the surface by describing the latter as a continuum .
Hermann Weyl said " let us stick to time as the most fundamental continuum " and gave the following description on p. 92 of his The Continuum :
So we can gather the following concerning objectively presented time : an individual point in it is non-independent , i.e. , is pure nothingness when taken by itself , and exists only as a " point of transition " ( which , of course , can in no way be understood mathematically ) .
it is due to the essence of time ( and not to contingent imperfections of our medium ) that a fixed time - point cannot be exhibited in any way , that always only an approximation , never an exact determination is possible .
Corresponding remarks apply to every intuitively given continuum ; in particular , to the continuum of spatial extension .
1.1 What is the Continuum Hypothesis ?
In 1874 Georg Cantor discovered that there is more than one level of infinity .
The lowest level is called " countable infinity " and higher levels are called " uncountable infinities . "
The natural numbers are an example of a countably infinite set and the real numbers are an example of an uncountably infinite set .
In 1877 Cantor hypothesized that the number of real numbers is the next level of infinity above countable infinity .
Since the real numbers are used to represent a linear continuum , this hypothesis is called " the Continuum Hypothesis " or CH .
Let c be the cardinality of ( i.e. , number of points in ) a continuum , aleph 0 be the cardinality of any countably infinite set , and aleph 1 be the next level of infinity above aleph 0 .
Here are six ways to state CH : Sets - of - Reals Versions of CH
Any set of real numbers is either finite , countably infinite , or has the same cardinality as the entire set of real numbers .
Any infinite set of real numbers is either countably infinite or has the same cardinality as the entire set of real numbers .
Any uncountable set of real numbers has the same cardinality as the entire set of reals numbers .
Cardinal - Number Versions of CH
There is no cardinal number between aleph 0 and c .
and .
c = aleph 1
= 2aleph 0 = aleph 1 ( explained in section 3.1.1 )
The Continuum Hypothesis has been , and continues to be , one of the most hotly pursued problems in mathematics .
It was the first problem in Hilbert 's list of 23 important unsolved problems , ten of which he presented to the Second International Congress of Mathematicians at Paris in 1900 .
Pursuit of the Continuum Hypothesis has motivated a lot of useful and interesting mathematics in real analysis , topology , set theory , and logic .
1.2 Current Status of CH
Despite nearly 120 years of investigation , CH is still debated and continues to motivate a lot of mathematics , especially in set theory and logic .
Like the Axiom of Choice ( AC ) , Gödel showed that CH is consistent with standard set theory and Cohen showed that ~CH is consistent with standard set theory ( and thus CH is independent of standard set theory ) .
But , unlike AC , CH has not been adopted as an axiom of set theory .
Instead , mathematicians either live with this incompleteness in set theory or try to find more intuitive axioms that will help to decide CH .
In the " Introduction " of the Israel Mathematical Conference Proceedings , Vol. 6 , 1993 Haim Judah said :
We still think that the study of the size of the continuum should be our guiding light for further research in set theory .

2.2 Assumptions
2.2.1 Mathematical Assumptions
For most of this article , I assume :
The real numbers can be used to represent a linear continuum .
ZF is consistent .
ZFC .
I assume Choice , which is a standard assumption , so that for any two cardinal numbers , k and l , one of the following holds :
k < l k = l k > l This " Trichotomy of Cardinals " tells us that any two cardinals are comparable and all cardinals can be lined up in one ( very ! ) long well - ordered sequence , called the " aleph sequence . "
Trichotomy of Cardinals is actually equivalent to the Axiom of Choice .
( See my Axiom of Choice article for other equivalents of AC . )
In the metamathematics section I discuss CH in the absence of some of these assumptions .
2.2.2 Audience Assumptions
2.3 Terminology
2.3.1 The Word " continuum " Many people use the phrase " the continuum " to mean the real number line but be aware that there are many types of continua , including :
One dimensional linear continua - line , line segment , curve ( path of a point )
Euclidean space - one , two , three , or n dimensional
dimensional Einstein's four - dimensional spacetime
String theory 's ??- dimensional spacetime
Any manifold ( definition of `manifold ' is at UC Davis and Eric's Treasure Trove )
2.3.2 Ordered Sets Ordered sets are usually surrounded by angle brackets rather than square brackets .
Unfortunately , it 's hard to produce good angle brackets in HTML .
The best I could come up with is something like this :
< set , order relation > but these angle brackets look too much like less than and greater than signs ( which is what they are ! ) , so , I 'm using square brackets for ordered sets , i.e. :
[ set , order relation ]

3. Mathematics of the Continuum and CH
The existence of irrational numbers , the uncountability of the reals , and the self - repeating , fractal - nature of the continuum show us that our intuition can't always be trusted .
To avoid problems with intuition , we formalize our intuitive notions and try to rigorously prove or disprove statements about these notions .
Notions related to the continuum and CH include measure , Baire category , density , separability , connectedness , continuity , completeness , compactness , and of course cardinality .
We start with cardinality , the main concept related to CH .
3.1 Sizes of Sets : Cardinal Numbers Before Cantor , collections were either finite or infinite and there was no notion of different levels of infinity .
Only Wallis 's infinity symbol , oo , was needed to represent the notion of infinity .
While investigating questions about singularities of Fourier series , Cantor made the revolutionary discovery that not all infinite sets are the same size .
Cantor showed that the natural numbers ( N ) , the integers ( Z ) , and the rational numbers ( Q ) are all the same size by constructing one - to - one correspondences between them ( for details see Seton Hall University 's Interactive Real Analysis ) .
Cantor described these as " countably infinite " or having " cardinality aleph 0 . "
Cantor also showed that the real numbers can not be put into one - to - one correspondence with a countably infinite set and thus are not countably infinite .
After this surprising discovery , Cantor proposed the Continuum Hypothesis and developed transfinite set theory , the " paradise of the infinite " from which Hilbert hoped we would never be driven !
3.1.1 aleph 0 < c = 2aleph 0
We now step through a sketch of the proof of the following , which will help us to define the continuum hypothesis ( CH ) and the generalized continuum hypothesis ( GCH ) .
aleph 0 < card ( R ) = c = card ( ( 0,1 ) ) = card ( P( N ) ) = 2aleph 0
3.1.1.1 aleph 0 < card( R ) = c Cantor showed , using his famous diagonal argument , that the real numbers ( R ) can not be put into one - to - one correspondence with the natural numbers .
Since the reals are a superset of N , their cardinality must be larger than aleph 0 .
He called the cardinality of the real numbers c for " continuum . "
3.1.1.2 card( R ) = card ( ( 0,1 ) )
When proving things about c it's sometimes easier to work with a set other than R that has cardinality c.
An example of such a set is the set of reals between 0 and 1 , which is called " the open interval zero one " and denoted : ( 0,1 ) There are many ways to show that all the reals can be put into one - to - one correspondence with ( 0,1 ) .
One way to do this mapping is to use the great and powerful arctan function .
You can use arctan with different multipliers and shifters to construct a one - to - one correspondence between R and any open interval of reals .
Exercise f( x ) =arctan( x ) maps R continuously one - to - one and onto ( - pi/2 , pi/2 ) .
What function of arctan maps R continuously one - to - one and onto ( 0,1 ) ?
Since this function of arctan maps R continuously one - to - one and onto ( 0,1 ) and its inverse -- a function of tan -- maps ( 0,1 ) continuously one - to - one and onto R , we see that R and ( 0,1 ) , in addition to having the same cardinality , are homeomorphic .
3.1.1.3 card ( ( 0,1 ) ) = card ( P( N ) ) = 2aleph 0
The set of reals between 0 and 1 can be represented by the set of all countably infinite sequences of 0's and 1's .
Think of these as representing binary " decimals " between .000000 ... and .111111 ... .
In this representation .
1=1/2 , .01=1/4 , .11=3/4 , etc .
The power set of the natural numbers , P ( N ) , can also be represented by the set of all countably infinite sequences of 0's and 1's .
Each sequence represents a subset of N by interpreting a 0 in position n to mean that the number n is not in the subset and a 1 in position n to mean the number n is in the subset .
This way of specifying a set is called the " characteristic function " of the set .
One way to represent all countably infinite sequences of 0's and 1's is to use Cartesian product notation : { 0 , 1} x {0 , 1} x {0 , 1} x ... = {0 , 1}aleph 0
Since in set theory {0 , 1} = 2 , we can also write this as : 2aleph 0
So we now have : aleph 0 < c = card ( R ) = card ( ( 0,1 ) ) = card ( P( N ) ) = 2aleph 0
3.1.2 CH and GCH Since CH is the proposal that c is the next level of infinity above aleph 0 , namely aleph 1 , and we have just shown that c = 2aleph 0 , another way to state CH is : 2aleph 0 = aleph 1
This is sometimes called the " arithmetic version of CH . "
In 1908 Felix Hausdorff proposed the following generalization of CH : For any cardinal aleph a , 2 aleph a = aleph a +1 This is the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis or GCH .
Another way to state GCH is : { card ( N ) , card ( P( N ) ) , card ( P( P ( N ) ) ) , card ( P( P ( P ( N ) ) ) ) , . . .} = {aleph 0 , aleph 1 , aleph 2 , aleph 3 , . . .}
Obviously CH follows from GCH and we have : ZF + GCH |- CH
Note that ZF +GCH |- AC so it would be redundant ( and misleading ) to put ``ZF C + GCH '' on the left side of the turnstile .
3.1.3 Sample Cardinalities After Cantor showed that there are different levels of infinity , Cantor and others quickly discovered the cardinality of many sets , including the following .
Cardinality Samples aleph 0 N = natural numbers
= natural numbers w = [ N , <] = natural numbers in their natural order
= [ , <] = natural numbers in their natural order Z = integers
= integers Q = rational numbers
= rational numbers algebraic numbers
set of all finite sets of natural numbers
set of all cofinite sets of natural numbers ( sets whose complements are finite )
< ww = < wN = set of all finite sequences of natural numbers aleph 1 w 1 = set of all countable ordinals c = 2 aleph 0 R = real numbers

any perfect set of reals
any Cantor set
any uncountable closed set of reals
any uncountable Borel set of reals
any uncountable analytic set of reals
any set of reals with positive measure
any set of reals of second category ( not meager )
P( N ) = set of all subsets of the natural numbers
) = set of all subsets of the natural numbers w w = w N = set of all countably infinite sequences of natural numbers
= = set of all countably infinite sequences of natural numbers w 2 = set of all countably infinite sequences of 0's and 1's
2 = set of all countably infinite sequences of 0's and 1's set of all coinfinite sets of natural numbers ( sets whose complements are infinite )
set of all infinite coinfinite sets of natural numbers
set of all open sets of reals
set of all closed sets of reals
set of all Borel sets of reals
set of all analytic sets of reals
C( R ) = set of all continuous functions from R to R
) = set of all continuous functions from to set of all analytic functions from R to R 2 c = 22 aleph 0 P( R ) = set of all subsets of the real numbers
) = set of all subsets of the real numbers R R = set of all functions from R to R
= set of all functions from to P ( P ( N ) ) = set of all subsets of the power set of N
In this hierarchy of cardinalities , CH is the claim that the aleph 1 and c levels should be merged into one level .
And GCH would mean that 2c = aleph 2 , 22 c = aleph 3 , etc .
3.2 Ordering Sets : Ordinal Numbers
To fully understand CH in the context of ZFC you need to understand the second infinite cardinal , aleph 1 , which is the cardinality of w 1 , the set of all countable ordinals .
Ordinal numbers tell you both the size of a set and the way its members are ordered .
Ordering sets is important because it is the way we extend the notion of counting to infinite sets .
For a finite set , ordering is a breeze .
No matter how you order a set with n members , its order type is isomorphic to : 0 1 2 3 . . . n- 1
This is sometimes written as [ {0 , 1 , 2 , ... , n - 1} , < ] or [ n , < ] to emphasize that it is an ordered set .
For infinite sets , the situation is quite different .
It turns out that for a countably infinite set , there are uncountably many non-isomorphic ways to well order it .
Here are some examples of ways to well order a countably infinite set .
The letters listed in the right column are used as place holders -- no member of the set is actually repeated in its ordering .
Countable Ordinal Order Type ( what it looks like ) w a b c... w + 1 a b c... a w + 2 a b c... a b w x 2 = w+w a b c... a b c... w2 = w x w = w+w ...+w... a b c... a b c... . . . abc... . . .
The collection of all countable ordinals is w 1 and the cardinality of this collection is the next level of infinity after aleph 0 , namely aleph 1 .
( A proof that the cardinality of the set of all countable ordinals is the next cardinal after aleph 0 is in Leary . )
Now , try to wrap your mind around the question of whether a continuum has the same number of points as this !
For more information about cardinal and ordinal numbers , see Infinite Ink's Cardinal Numbers .
3.3 Analysis of the Continuum
One path to finding out if CH is true is to look for sets of real numbers that have cardinality greater than aleph 0 and less than c .
If such sets exist , then CH is false .
While looking for these sets mathematicians have decomposed the reals into different types of sets and come up with characterizations of the reals , continua , and continuity .
3.3.1 Decomposing the Reals
There are many ways to decompose the reals .
We can split the reals into two sets , such as the rational and irrational numbers or the algebraic and transcendental numbers , or we can look at types of subsets of the reals , such as Borel sets and non-Borel sets .
The hope is that these decompositions will help us to characterize the entire set of reals .
For example , the rationals provide a good approximation to the reals because any real number can be approximated " as closely as you please " by a rational number .
This should serve as a warning though .
Despite the rationals ' great ability to represent the reals they are of a different cardinality than the reals .
So , just because a collection of sets is a good approximation of the reals does n't mean that it will give us much useful information about cardinality questions .
Bearing this in mind , let 's try to understand CH by looking at sets that , in some sense , represent the reals .
CH is true for closed , Borel , and analytic sets , i.e. : any infinite closed set either has cardinality aleph 0 or c .
or . any infinite Borel set either has cardinality aleph 0 or c .
or .
any infinite analytic set either has cardinality aleph 0 or c .
This means that if there is a set that falsifies CH , i.e. , a set with cardinality between aleph 0 and c , it will not be one of these types of sets .
Since there are only c of these types of sets and there are 2 c subsets of R , there are plenty of sets left which might falsify CH !
3.3.2 Characterizing the Reals R is a complete ordered field .
Any total ordering [ X , < ] satisfying the following three conditions is isomorphic to [ R , < ] .
X has no first or last element X is connected in the order topology X is separable in the order topology ( more to come )
3.3.3 Characterizing Continuity Hermann
Weyl said that " Precisely what eludes us is the nature of the continuity , the flowing form point to point ; in other words , the secret of how the continually enduring present can continually slip away into the receding past . "
The Hahn - Mazurkiewicz Theorem
A topological space X is a continuous curve iff X is a compact Hausdorff space which is second countable , connected , and locally connected .
3.4 What ZFC Does and Does Not Tell Us About c ZFC does not tell us much about c , it only tells us that c : is a cardinal number .
is larger than aleph 0 .
. is aleph a for some ordinal a .
for some ordinal .
must have uncountable cofinality .
For example , it can not be aleph w or aleph w + w , each of which have cofinality w .
or , each of which have cofinality .
can be any cardinal with uncountable cofinality .
For example , it can be any infinite successor cardinal including aleph 1 , aleph 2 , ... aleph n , ... aleph w + 1 , aleph w + 2 , ... aleph w + n , ... , where n is a natural number .
, , ... , ... , , ... , ... , where n is a natural number .
is not inaccessible ( this follows immediately from the definition of strongly inaccessible ) .
inaccessible ( this follows immediately from the definition of strongly inaccessible ) .
might be a very large cardinal .
ZFC gives no upper bound on the size of c .
4. Metamathematics and CH
The results of Gödel and Cohen about the consistency and independence of CH are metamathematical theorems .
Questions that are not within the framework of standard mathematics , but are rather about the framework of mathematics , are part of metamathematics .
Today the standard framework for mathematics is first - order logic and ZFC .
Most interesting results in logic are about the interplay between formal theory and model theory .
An example of this type of result is Gödel 's First Incompleteness Theorem , which tells us that if we have : a formal theory , T , which contains arithmetic
a model of that theory , M then there is a statement U that is true in the model but cannot be proved in the formal theory .
This type of statement is consistent with T but " undecidable " in T. Gödel 's Completeness theorem tells us that if T is consistent then U is undecidable in T if and only if models exist for both T+U and T+~U. Since ZFC contains arithmetic , it has been known since 1938 , when Gödel proved his incompleteness theorems , that it is incomplete .
CH was suspected to be one of its undecidable statements but it was n't until 1963 that Cohen proved the independence of CH .
He did this by constructing a model of ZFC in which CH is false ( i.e. , a model of ZFC + ~CH ) .
The technique he used to construct the model is called " forcing . "
In 1966 Cohen received a Fields Medal for his work .
A good discussion of these topics is in What is Mathematical Logic by J.N. Crossley and others .
The last chapter gives a nice description of forcing and the construction of a model of ZFC +~CH .
4.1 Models ( standard model , non-standard analysis and the hyperreal line , Hensel 's p-adics , forcing models )
One way to resolve CH would be to come up with a model of the reals , which we all accept as being the " correct " interpretation of the reals , in which CH is true or false .
A candidate is Robinson 's hyperreal line .
4.2 Adding Axioms to ZFC
Most mathematicians work within ZFC but some , usually set theorists , venture into the strange world of ZFC with additional axioms .
Many of these axioms were proposed because they shed light on the continuum and CH .
4.2.1 Why Not Just add GCH or ~GCH ?
The most obvious axiom to add is one that explicitly asserts GCH or its negation , ~GCH .
Since neither GCH nor its negation is " intuitively obvious , " this is not done .
Whenever someone proves something using either GCH or ~GCH it is explicitly stated .
Contrast this with AC , which is used freely in mathematics and its use is often not mentioned .
4.2.2 Large Cardinal Axioms Large cardinals are cardinals that cannot be constructed using only the axioms of ZFC .
Examples of large cardinals are inaccessible cardinals , hyperinaccessible cardinals , Mahlo cardinals , measurable cardinals , and supercompact cardinals .
There are lots more .
Surprisingly , some of these shed light on questions about the real numbers and the continuum .
MC = there exists a measurable cardinal
SC = there exists a supercompact cardinal ZFC+MC |- V#L
ZFC+SC |- Projective Determinacy
4.2.3 Martin's Axiom : A Weak Version of CH
ccc or countable chain condition or countable antichain condition A topological space is ccc if every family of disjoint open sets is countable .
Example : R with the usual topology ( open sets = open intervals ) is ccc .
MA or Martin's Axiom
If X is a ccc compact Hausdorff space , then X is not the union of less than 2 aleph 0 nowhere dense sets .
Suslin line A connected , linearly ordered , ccc space which is not separable ZFC +CH |- MA
ZF +GCH |- ( inaccessible = weakly inaccessible )
ZFC +MA + ~CH |-
There is no Suslin line .
4.3 ZF and Adding Axioms ( other than Choice ) to ZF Without the Axiom of Choice , there is no guarantee that infinite cardinal numbers are comparable .
Cardinal numbers can form a partially ordered set and aleph 1 and c might be on two incomparable branches of the partial order .
( Note : c is comparable to aleph 0 in ZF but in ZF there can be infinite sets that do not contain a countably infinite subset .
These are called " Dedekind finite " sets . )
4.2.1 ZF+GCH
4.3.1 V=L : Shrinking the Set Theoretic Universe ZF+V=L |- AC
ZF+V=L |- GCH
ZF+V=L |-
ZF + |- CH
4.3.2 ZF +AD : A Set Theoretic Universe that 's Incompatible with ZFC The Axiom of Determinacy ...
In ZF +AD the Axiom of Choice is false and the reals cannot be well ordered and , thus , are not equal to any aleph .
But , within this system every set of reals is either countable or has the cardinality of all the reals so the first three of the six versions of CH listed in section 1.1 hold .
4.4 Alternate Mathematical Frameworks
Another path to resolving CH is to view all of mathematics through a framework other than the standard first - order logic and Zermelo Fraenkel set theory .
Possibilities include using Second - Order Logic , Linear Logic , Intuitionist Logic , or the meta framework , Category Theory , which can be used to encompass all frameworks .
Intuitionist Logic
If we restate the question in this form : " Is it impossible to construct infinite sets of real numbers between 0 and 1 , whose power is less than that of the continuum , but greater than ale ph - null ? " , then the answer must be in the affirmative ; for the intuitionist can only construct denumerable sets of mathematical objects , and if on the basis of intuition of the linear continuum , he admits elementary series of free selections as elements of construction , then each non-denumerable set constructed by means of it contains a subset of the power of the continuum .
- Brouwer , 1912 , p. 134 of Collected Works
5. Philosophy of CH
Is there a truth about CH and , if there is , can we know this truth ?
What does CH have to do with reality , both mathematical reality and physical reality ?
These type of philosophical questions have been debated since at least the time of Ancient Greece when the Pythagoreans discovered irrational numbers and the mystery of the continuum started to unfold .
The two main philosophical viewpoints are realist and antirealist .
The quote below by René Thom characterizes pretty well these two views .
Kronecker represents the antirealist view and Thom represents the realist view .
Much emphasis has been placed during the past fifty years on the reconstruction of the geometric continuum from the natural integers , using the theory of Dedekind cuts or the completion of the field of rational numbers .
Under the influence of axiomatic and bookish traditions , man perceived in discontinuity the first mathematical Being : " God created the integers and the rest is the work of man . "
This maxim spoken by the algebraist Kronecker reveals more about his past as a banker who grew rich through monetary speculation than about his philosophical insight .
There is hardly any doubt that , from a psychological and , for the writer , ontological point of view , the geometric continuum is the primordial entity .
If one has any consciousness at all , it is consciousness of time and space ; geometric continuity is in some way inseparably bound to conscious thought .
5.1 Mathematical Realism : CH is True or False As ??? said , most mathematicians are realists during the week and formalists on the weekend .
The following are some mathematicians ( with their realist hats on ! ) who 've stated their opinion about the truth of CH : True : Cantor
Cantor False : Cohen , Gödel , Martin , Solovay
Here 's a quote from Cohen .
( He uses C , instead of c , for continuum . )
A point of view which the author feels may eventually come to be accepted is that CH is obviously false .
The main reason one accepts the Axiom of Infinity is probably that we feel it absurd to think that the process of adding only one set at a time can exhaust the entire universe .
Similarly with the higher axioms of infinity .
Now aleph 1 is the set of countable ordinals and this is merely a special and the simplest way of generating a highter cardinal .
The set C is , in contrast , generated by a totally new and more powerful principle , namely the Power Set Axiom .
It is unreasonable to expect that any description of a larger cardinal which attempts to build up that cardinal from ideas deriving from the Replacement Axiom can ever reach C .
Thus C is greater than aleph n , aleph w , aleph a , where a= aleph w , etc .
This point of view regards C as an incredibly rich set given to us by one bold new axiom , which can never be approached by any piecemeal process of construction .
Perhaps later generations will see the problem more clearly and express themselves more eloquently .
- Paul Cohen on p. 151 of Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis
5.1.1 CH and the Physical World For the advancing army of physics , battling for many a decade with heat and sound , fields and particles , gravitation and spacetime geometry , the cavalry of mathematics , galloping out ahead , provided what it thought to be the rationale for the real number system .
Encounter with the quantum has taught us , however , that we acquire our knowledge in bits ; that the continuum is forever beyond our reach .
Yet for daily work the concept of the continuum has been and will continue to be as indispensable for physics as it is for mathematics .
In either field of endeavor , in any given enterprise , we can adopt the continuum and give up absolute logical rigor , or adopt rigor and give up the continuum , but we can't pursue both approaches at the same time in the same application .
- John Archibald
Wheeler on p. xii of Weyl's The Continuum
5.2 Not Mathematical Realism
The two mainstream antirealist views are formalists and constructivists .
( For now see my descriptions of formalism and constructivism in the Axiom of Choice section of the sci.math FAQ )
6. Conclusion
Maybe the conclusion from all this is that trying to reduce the continuum to a set of individual points is the wrong way to think about it .
This reductionist strategy has also had problems in physics .
Today there are many physicists moving away from reductionism and towards holism .
Maybe a similar path should be taken in mathematics , away from thinking of point sets as the fundamental objects and towards thinking of structures and relations as the fundamental objects of mathematics .
There is a fundamental error in separating the parts from the whole , the mistake of atomizing what should not be atomized .
Unity and complementarity constitute reality .

Appendix 2 : Confusion About CH in Popular Literature
The most common confusions about CH in popular literature ( and in Internet discussions ! ) are a writer : Assuming CH or GCH is true without stating this assumption .
Since CH is not a standard assumption in mathematics and , in fact , most set theorists think it is false , it is important for a writer to state her assumptions about CH .
Misstating CH .
A common misstatement of CH is c = 2aleph 0 .
As we saw in section 3.1.1 , this statement is a fairly simple theorem to prove within ZFC .
An example of confusion is in George Gamow 's One Two Three ... Infinity .
On page 34 he says :
The sequence of numbers ( including the infinite ones ! ) now runs : 1 2 3 4 5 ... aleph 1 aleph 2 aleph 3 ... and we say " there are aleph 1 points on a line " or " there are aleph 2 different curves " ...
Another example of confusion is on page 46 of Michael Guillen 's Bridges to Infinity : an aleph 0 set ... has precisely 2 aleph 0 conceivable subsets ...
It is the first stepping stone beyond infinity , the first transfinite number , which Cantor named aleph 1 ...
A set with aleph 1 elements in turn , has precisely 2 aleph 1 conceivable subsets .
This is the second stepping stone , the second transfinite number aleph 2 , and so forth .
Guillen continues his confusion on page 50 : To this day we still do n't know exactly how many irrationals there are , although it has been established that the total number cannot be more than aleph 1 .
Cantor himself guessed that the total number of irrationals is exactly aleph 1 , mainly since aleph 1 is the next largest infinity after aleph 0 defined by set theory .
His guess came to be known as the Continuum Hypothesis .
But there is still the uneliminated possibility that the number of irrationals actually lies between aleph 0 and aleph 1 .
Your mission , should you choose to accept it , is to find all the mistakes in these quotes .
After you 've done that , take a look at the mistakes I found and let me know if you find any more ( or disagree with the ones I found ) .
If you know of other misstatements of CH , please let me know .
