A new Indianapolis Star - WTHR poll released today showed Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama statistically tied in the Hoosier State .
Obama leads Clinton 41%- 38 % , but once the margin of error of 4.2 % is factored in , the race is even .
Where Obama does hold a clear advantage is in the hypothetical head to head matchup with John McCain .
Clinton ties McCain at 46 % , but Obama leads the Republican 49 % - 41 % .
Even after the margin of error of 4.4 % is factored in , Obama still McCain by 3 + points .
Some of the trends in the poll are the same as what we have seen in other states .

Obama leads Clinton among urban and suburban votes 47%- 33 % , but Clinton leads with rural voters , 55 % - 20 % .
Obama lead with voters age 18 - 35 , 48 - 34 % , and Clinton leads with voters over age 55 , 43% - 32 % .
Clinton leads among white women 48% - 29 % , but Obama has a small lead with all women , 41% - 40 .
Is it any surprise that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are tied in another state ?
Once again , this is a state that will probably come down to demographics .
Clinton is able to run close there because it is 50.7 % female , and 88 % white .
Indiana is an average state with 12.4 % of its residents over age 65 .
It is also a state that is under the national average for amount of people holding bachelor ’s degrees or higher .
In short , much like PA , this is a state that Clinton should at least hold her own in .
This is why Obama being tied is such good news , because unlike in PA , Clinton wo n’t have a large bloc of older voters to appeal to .
If Obama can win in Indiana , he can put to rest many of the fears that he can’t win a primary in a state with a high percentage of white voters .
( Remember , Iowa was a caucus , not a primary ) .
Wins in Indiana and North Carolina would finish Clinton off .
I would n’t expect either candidate to pull away in Indiana , but even a small win will be good enough for Obama .

Grand Theft Auto IV is one day away from release , and already Jack Thompson has begun to step up his war on the title .
The embattled Florida attorney has written a letter to the US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida , R. Alexander Acosta , demanding that legal action be taken against Take Two and retailers for selling the game .
This time , Thompson appears to have an unlikely ally thanks to video gaming news site IGN .
Thompson sent a copy of the letter to Ars Technica , and his demands are far - reaching .
" Indictments should be returned against Take Two corporately and its Chairman , Strauss Zelnick , along with other Take Two officers .
Indictment should also be against Sony and Microsoft which are making this pornographic game available to minors , and openly so , on their PS3 and Xbox systems , " Thompson wrote .
" Further , indictments should be handed down against Wal - Mart , Best Buy , GameStop , and all other retailers distributing this game to minors at their retail stores , openly , to kids who are only seventeen . "
He then compares the game to , of all things , polio .
" Grand Theft Auto IV is the gravest assault upon children in this country since polio .
We now have vaccines for that virus ...
The ' vaccine ' that must be administered by the United States government to deal with this virtual virus of violence and sexual depravity is criminal prosecutions of those who have conspired to do this .
If you doubt me , look at the aforementioned streaming audio / video .
It will make you sick . "
This is where the story takes a turn , because Jack Thompson provides a link to a video , put together by the gaming news site IGN , called " Ladies of Liberty City . "
Be careful clicking on that link ; there is absolutely nothing there that is safe for work .
The video strips the game of all context and merely shows scenes of sexual content and violence , one after the other .
In fact , it can be hard to watch for that reason , and it's a rather numbing experience .
The game 's lead character , Niko , drives up to prostitutes , honks the horn , then shoots them .
You see a simulated sex act , only to have Niko run the hooker over afterwards with his car .
The video shows graphic lap dances featuring one , and then two , girls .
The language is even worse , including — and excuse the stars , " F*** the s*** out of it , you nasty f******. "
" This is clearly an Adults Only game .
It 's not even close , " Thompson wrote .
The sexual content shown in the IGN video is only a very small part of the game , and it can be avoided by players .
The shootings are all random and , as far as we know , play no part in the actual play of Grand Theft Auto IV .
We 'll be sure to update the story if there 's a prostitute - hunting mission , but the video seems designed to show just how depraved the game can be , and it has given Jack Thompson his best ammunition yet to fight the game .
The video is over the top , and since the acts are shown one after the other , the game can be portrayed as a nonstop sexual experience .
When critics slammed Fox News over the coverage of the sexual content in Mass Effect , it was clear that no one involved had actually played the game or even watched a video of the content .
With " Ladies of Liberty City , " IGN has provided Jack Thompson and the mainstream media the perfect weapon to attack the game : a smörgåsbord of sex and violence that can be shown to anyone who doubts the game needs to be stopped .
It 's doubtful any meaningful action will be taken , as Jack Thompson has recently been sanctioned and has so far racked up little apart from personal fame , but it 's clear that the controversy surrounding the game is far from over .
PORTSMOUTH , N.H. , Sept. 1 — Three of the major Democratic presidential candidates on Saturday pledged not to campaign in Florida , Michigan and other states trying to leapfrog the 2008 primary calendar , a move that solidified the importance of the opening contests of Iowa and New Hampshire .
Hours after Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina agreed to sign a loyalty pledge put forward by party officials in Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada and South Carolina , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York followed suit .
The decision seemed to dash any hopes of Mrs. Clinton relying on a strong showing in Florida as a springboard to the nomination .
“ We believe Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada and South Carolina play a unique and special role in the nominating process , ” Patti Solis Doyle , the Clinton campaign manager , said in a statement .
The pledge sought to preserve the status of traditional early - voting states and bring order to an unwieldy series of primaries that threatened to accelerate the selection process .
It was devised to keep candidates from campaigning in Florida , where the primary is set for Jan. 29 , and Michigan , which is trying to move its contest to Jan. 15 .
Armoury out in the war on waste
By John Andrew
Local government correspondent , BBC News
Leaving bags by the wheelie bin ?
Sutton will not take them
As taxes to dump rubbish in landfill soar , one council is rolling out new weapons to encourage recycling in the war on waste .
The London borough of Sutton recycles just over 30 % of its domestic waste - one of the best rates in the capital .
It aims to reach 40 % by 2010 and believes the sharp increase in landfill tax will concentrate minds even more .
" It 's a serious pressure for local people , " says Councillor Colin Hall , lead member on the environment .
" Over three years the landfill tax escalator equates to around £ 210 that they 'll be expected to pay in extra council tax if we do n't do something about the way we collect waste . "
Wheelie limit So what is Sutton doing ?
Unlike many other councils , it has decided against taking the controversial route of collecting general rubbish only once a fortnight and alternating it with collections of recyclables .
Despite a successful trial , there was public resistance when the council tried to roll it out across the borough .
But there are other tools in the armoury .
From June , it plans to phase out the collection of any bags left next to the wheelie bin - what is known as " side waste " .
The council will only take what is in the bin , although as in many other councils , large families can ask for a bigger bin .
One refuse crew told me that while most people were keen when it came to recycling they expected " a bit of aggro " from some residents who feel that because they pay council tax , they should have all their rubbish collected .
Greener gardens ?
The current free service for collecting garden waste will end .
Households will have to pay a yearly charge of £ 35 and use a biodegradable bag issued by the council .
The idea is to encourage more home composting .
The council has also been trialling weekly collections of food waste in Sutton and two neighbouring boroughs .
The waste is sent for processing in Dorset , where it is turned into compost .
It will also team up with three other boroughs to get a better deal on contracts for waste disposal .
This includes commissioning a plant for the mechanical , biological treatment of waste - a process that separates and composts food waste .
Sutton is also considering the use of anaerobic digestion processes to capture the gases from food waste and create energy for sale to local businesses .

Speaking of Rupert Murdoch , the May edition of his Far Eastern Economic Review was banned in China , according to Fridayâ€™s Washington Times , which attributed the banning to the magazineâ€™s publication of an essay by the American Enterprise Instituteâ€™s â€ œFreedom Scholar , â€ Michael Ledeen , entitled â€ œBeijing Embraces Classical Fascism.â€ 
I find the ban absurd myself , but I have to say that Iâ€™ve very rarely read such nonsense as Ledeenâ€™s essay , even by Ledeen whose writings I have monitored pretty closely since 9/11 for indications of what Richard Perle , James Woolsey , Victor Davis Hansen , Dick Cheney , and even Karl Rove may be talking about when they get together in various permutations and combinations .
He argues , among other things , that the China of today is what Italy would look like â€œ50 years after the fascist revolutionâ€ if Mussoliniâ€™s corporatist state had somehow survived into the 1970â€™s , requiring of the reader an act based solely on his or her imagination and absolutely no empirical evidence of any kind .
In Ledeenâ€™s imagination , such a state would â€ œno longer be a system based on charisma , but would instead rest almost entirely on political repression , the leaders would be businesslike and cynical , not idealistic , and they would constantly invoke formulaic appeals to the grandeur of the â€˜great Italian peopleâ€ ¦â€ ™.â€ 
While Ledeen might think that description constitutes â€œclassical fascism , â€  I donâ€™t see the difference between that and a typical autocratic regime that bases its legitimacy on some form of nationalism .
After about another 1,200 words of rampant speculation based on virtually nothing but ( mostly questionable ) cliches and stereotypes â€ ” â€ œthe Chinese , like the European fascists , are intensely xenophobicâ€¦ ; â€ â€ œJust like Germany and Italy in the interwar period , China feels betrayed and humiliated , and seeks to avenge her many historic wounds ; â€ â€œâ€ ¦the short history of classical fascism suggests that it is only a matter of time before China will pursue confrontation with the Westâ€ â€ ” Ledeen concludes : â€œIt follows that the West must prepare for war with China , hoping thereby to deter it.â€ 
Based on my own modest experience in China , I have no doubt that the country ( not unlike the U.S. ) is nationalistic , that its ambitions as an emerging global power are significant , and that ( again , like the U.S. ) it considers military power an essential component of great - power status .
But â€œfascist ?â€
Thatâ€™s quite a leap .
From his own post - graduate study of Italian fascism , as well as his work under the great George Mosse at the University of Wisconsin , surely Ledeen knows that a cult of violence ( to which Ledeen and other hard - line neo- cons like Charles Krauthammer have themselves shown a perverse attraction ) and the so - called Fuehrerprinzip â€ ” the notion that a charismatic leader who thoroughly embodies the virtues of a nation should be revered and his orders followed without question â€ ” are central to the â€œclassicalâ€ fascist ideologies that grew up in Europe in the 1920s and 30s .
And while one can argue that both characteristics were on display during the Cultural Revolution , it would be very difficult to find any trace of them in the Chinese leadership today .
That a once - respected and influential journal should publish this kind of agitprop is truly disgraceful .
The iPod is supposed to be “ iTunes to go ” but as the little music player has advanced over the years , it still lags behind in some relatively basic features , features that have been a part of the desktop program for some time .
i Tunes ’ capabilities seem to be constantly improved and refined ; its portable counterpart ’s behavior has remained relative unchanged , even as it has gained photo and video support .
Forget touchscreens and Bluetooth , FLAC and DivX ; here , I present a list of the iPod ’s more troublesome foibles , all of which could be overcome with a firmware update , making it an even better music player .
Toggle display of the Composer tag
This is something I ’ve wanted since Apple added the Composer field to iTunes five years ago : A display of the composer when listening to classical music .
The 5G iPods have more than enough screen real estate to accommodate an extra line of text .
It makes no sense that after all this time and after adding a way to browse and select by composer , Apple still does n’t allow a way to view it while playing .
Classical music aficionados have to either do without or devise elaborate tagging systems to see who the composer of a piece is .
Of course , not everyone has need for composer display .
There certainly are people who do n’t appreciate Prokofiev .
Also , the field is often populated with junk from Gracenote / CBBD .
A simple toggle in the iPod settings would fix that .
Those of us who want to see the composer can turn it on and those who do n’t can leave it off .
At a glance , there ’s no telling who the composer is .
One hack , though , would be to embed the composer name in the album artwork .
Support for the Album Artist field
i Tunes 7 introduced a new data field to the song info dialogue box : Album Artist .
Apple says it ’s for assigning a primary artist to an album with multiple artists .
It signifies a way to separate the artists producing the work from the artists performing it .
It ’s a great idea for classical works that have a featured soloist in addition to the orchestra or when one artist is a featured guest on someone else ’s song , eg , William Shatner featuring Henry Rollins .
In this case , William Shatner is the primary artist and would be to sole “ Album Artist ” while “ William Shatner featuring Henry Rollins ” are the performing artists .
The tag works well in iTunes , keeping song listing nicely and tidily organized .
The iPod , however , still separates “ William Shatner ” from “ William Shatner featuring Henry Rollins , ” leading to a cluttered interface that is difficult to use .
Most of my music listening is done via iPod , so Album Artist remains under-utilized .
Album Artist would be a very useful tag .
It would even solve my dilemma for tagging remix / dj albums .
But without iPod support , the tag is DOA .
Despite having the same Album Artist , these listings are still displayed by regular Artist .
Full Support for Sort fields .
( accomplished )
UPDATE 3/19/08 : Firmware version 1.3 for the Fifth Generation iPod adds support adds support for Sort Album and Sort Composer .
Other options recently introduced into iTunes but not into the iPod are customizable Sort Fields , which let you control how iTunes alphabetizes your artist and album listings .
By default , the iPod is smart enough to ignore “ A , ” “ An ” and “ The ” at the beginning of artist names .
The Chemical Brothers are sorted with the C’s , for example .
Starting with iTunes 7.1 , you can customize the Sort name for Artists , Albums , Songs , Album Artists , Composers and TV Shows .
If you want Fiona Apple to appear with the A ’s rather than the F’s , just set the Sort Artist to “ Apple , Fiona ” and you ’ll soon see Fiona next to Aphex Twin .
It ’s pretty cool , but …… on the iPod , it only works with Artists .
You can customize all the albums and composers in your library and Gustav Mahler will still be chillin’ with the G’s and The Colour and The Shape will still be sorted with the T’s .
The “ thes ” like to hang out together in album view .
Browsable playlists
Music libraries get larger every day it seems .
And the iPod ’s hard drive does its best to keep up .
At 80 GB , the device can hold a month or so of continuous music .
For myself and others with large libraries , it ’s effortless to create Smart Playlists that contain hundreds or thousands of songs based on specific criteria .
Navigating those playlists can be nearly impossible as they show naught but a long list of song titles .
In my library , creating a Smart Playlist of Ambient music from between 1990 to 2000 returns 305 songs from 44 albums by 11 artists .
Viewing the playlist on my iPod is a jumble of songs .
I would love the option to sort and browse the artists and albums in a playlist .
Perhaps , when you select a playlist , the iPod displays an entry at the top of the song list : “ Browse this playlist . ”
Full - screen album art
When in full screen mode , I want the iPod to display album art as large as it can , no margins , no scaling .
Just like when browsing photos , I want the image to take up the entire screen .
This , the iPod can already sort of do …… if you plug it into an iPod HiFi , Apple ’s own speaker system .
I would like it to be standard .
For more , read this recent rant .
Bonus Wishlist
I ’m not annoyed by these missing features , but if they were real , I ’d find them useful :
i Pod Party Shuffle
A more limited version of iTunes ’ Party Shuffle .
When you ’re shuffling , this would let you see a handful of upcoming songs .
You could skip ones you do n’t want to hear .
Profiles / Pre-sets
My listening preferences are different depending on whether I ’m at work , in the car , at the gym , or moseying around the house .
At the gym , I like to shuffle by song while at work I like to shuffle by album .
When listening to ear buds , I like to use the bass booster EQ , but the bass response in my car is a little heavy , so I like to turn on the bass reducer .
It would be convenient to save different settings configurations for easy switching .
Grouping behavior that makes sense “ Grouping ” is the red - headed stepchild of ID3 fields .
No one * really * knows what it ’s for or how to use it .
Ostensibly , it ’s for creating “ groups ” or subsets of related songs within an album .
But it was n’t until iTunes 7 that you could do anything with it ( you can shuffle by Grouping ) .
It seems to me that an effective behavior for songs with the same Grouping to be “ always keep these songs together . ”
For example , Mouse on Mars’ Varcharz has one song , One Day Not Today , that is broken into 12 tracks .
Give all 12 tracks the same Grouping , “ One Day Not Today ” and the iPod would know to start at the first track and play through all of them sequentially , even when shuffling .
::
Hopefully , one day , these wishes will come true .
I still love my iPod , but I ’m looking for reasons to love it more .
( CNN ) -- A Lonely Planet author says he plagiarized or made up portions of the popular travel guidebooks and dealt drugs to supplement poor pay , an Australian newspaper reported Sunday .
Lonely Planet publishes more than 500 titles and employs 300 authors , according to its Web site .
Thomas Kohnstamm , who has written a book on his misadventures , also said he did n't travel to Colombia to write the guidebook on the country because " they did n't pay me enough , " The Daily Telegraph reported .
" I wrote the book in San Francisco [ California ] , " he is quoted as saying in the Telegraph .
" I got the information from a chick I was dating -- an intern in the Colombian Consulate . "
The 32 - year - old Seattle , Washington , native also claims he accepted free travel , which is a violation of the company 's policy .
Kohnstamm has worked on more than a dozen books for Lonely Planet , including its titles on Brazil , Colombia , the Caribbean , Venezuela , Chile and South America .
An e-mail from Lonely Planet said Kohnstamm 's book were being reviewed , the newspaper reported .
" If we find that the content has been compromised , we 'll take urgent steps to fix it .
Once we 've got things right for travelers as quickly as we can , we 'll look at what we do and how we do it to ensure as best we can that this type of thing never happens again , " the e-mail said , according to the newspaper .
The book 's publisher , Piers Pickard , told the paper that an " urgent " review of Kohnstamm 's books did not reveal any inaccuracies .
The Lonely Planet series publishes 500 titles , updated every two to four years , and employs 300 authors , according to the company 's Web site .
It sells more than 6 million guides a year , the newspaper reported .
Kohnstamm 's book , " Do Travel Writers Go to Hell ? : A Swashbuckling Tale of High Adventures , Questionable Ethics and Professional Hedonism , " is set for release next week .
On his MySpace page , Kohnstamm says the book " is about the decision to abandon Manhattan to try to make it as a travel writer and the good , the bad and the really surreal that I experienced on the road . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
An earnings windfall for Google Inc should benefit rival Yahoo Inc in buyout talks with Microsoft Corp , as investors view the results as proof of a robust online advertising market .
The Yahoo logo is seen at the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas , Nevada January 7 , 2008 .

Yahoo is entering a critical week as it prepares to report quarterly results on Tuesday and faces a Microsoft - imposed deadline to accept the nearly $ 43 billion offer .
The software maker has cast doubt on whether Yahoo is even worth that much with a weakening U.S. economy and general slowness in the ad industry .
Google ’s strong showing could help its rival Yahoo stand firm on a higher takeover price on hopes
Web marketing is more durable in a downturn .
Industry analysts say Yahoo ’s first - quarter results are going to be a major swing factor in its talks with Microsoft .
“ The one thing that can really change Microsoft ’s thought process on valuation is if they can come in with good results , ” said Ross Sandler , analyst at RBC Capital Markets .
“ We think there is a decent likelihood of upside from Yahoo this quarter . ”
Yahoo forecast first - quarter net revenue at $ 1.28 billion to $ 1.38 billion .
Analysts , on average , are expecting profit of 9 cents per share , excluding special items , on revenue of $ 1.32 billion , according to Reuters Estimates .
Google on Thursday reported a better - than - expected profit and revenue growth of 42 percent .
It said client spending had not been hurt by economic concerns , sending its shares up nearly 20 percent to $ 538.43 on Friday .
Yahoo rose 1.7 percent to $ 28.51 .
“ In terms of today and next week , there ’s going to be a lot of upward momentum for all of the Internet companies ” who rely on ad revenue , Sandler said .
For example , Internet conglomerate IAC / InterActiveCorp shares rose 2.8 percent , while online marketing firm ValueClick Inc gained more than 8 percent .
NO SLOWDOWN HERE
Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said his team had carefully reviewed scenarios regarding the economy , and concluded that even if conditions worsened , its search advertising would still attract companies as an efficient way to reach customers .
“ This signals that the online advertising market is still healthy , which should help Yahoo get a better price for its company , ” said Peter Dunay , chief investment strategist at Meridian Equity Partners .
Internet advertising executives bolstered Schmidt ’s rosy view , saying their clients were actually spending more money online at both Google and Yahoo .
“ We have had a handful of clients come to us knowing there is a downturn who are actually looking at it as an opportunity to increase ( market ) share , ” said Kelly Twohig , senior vice president at Starcom USA , who manages the agency ’s digital media buying .
Starcom is part of Publicis .
Part of the rationale is that consumers who find their home budgets shrinking will be more zealous in seeking out information on products and comparison shopping online .
That makes the Web a more important place for companies to hawk their brands , even if they cut advertising elsewhere .
“ You might see brand budgets pulled back , but I do think that search is really still set to grow , ” said Sarah Fay , CEO of the Aegis Group agencies Isobar and Carat USA .
“ Search is still being adopted by many of the companies that have n’t used it heavily , especially companies in the consumer packaged goods space , ” she said .
For its own part , Yahoo has pulled out all the stops in trying to convince Microsoft it is worth more , including dizzying rounds of talks with potential partners for a merger or new venture , from Google itself to Time Warner Inc ’s AOL and News Corp .
Some of the talks involve outsourcing Yahoo ’s search to Google , a move expected to draw regulatory scrutiny as it could nearly eliminate any alternatives to Google ’s search network .
But analysts say no alternate deal scheme could force Microsoft ’s hand more than a major Yahoo earnings beat .
“ That ’s what we call the most powerful trump card they can play , ” Sandler said .
Lack of Exercise
If you do n’t use it , you lose it .
Your muscles store and therefore provide energy .
Exercise gives you energy especially if you do it on a regular basis .
Shoot for 20 - 30 minutes everyday to improve your energy levels .
Another simple thing you can do is take a 5 minute break every hour to get up from your work to stretch and walk around a bit .
So if you ’re feeling lethargic , get your blood pumping by moving your body .
If you ’re feeling exhausted on a particular day , see # 1 and get some rest instead .

Advertisement Six London Underground stations were closed as trouble flared when thousands of people marked the banning of alcohol on London transport with a party .
Four tube drivers , three other staff members , and two police officers were assaulted , and there were 17 arrests .
Several trains were damaged and withdrawn from service , which led to suspended services .
Drinkers gathered on Tube trains and station concourses for a last drink before the ban came in at midnight .
Police said what should have been a fun event came to an " unfortunate " end .
' Like rush hour but fun '
The ban on drinking from - or carrying - open containers of alcohol applies to the Tube , London buses , Docklands Light Railway and trams as of midnight on Saturday .
It was announced by London Mayor Boris Johnson shortly after he took office , with the aim of making public transport safer and more pleasant .
It 's sweaty on there but I 'm going round and round until I vomit
Peter Moore , from Brighton
Booze ends with a bang Tube party in pictures
Your pictures : Tube party
The party , mostly on the Circle Line , was dubbed the Last Round on the Underground or Last Orders .
It had previously been widely advertised on social networking and other internet sites .
The party began in a celebratory mood , with many people in good spirits and anticipating a good night .
Londoner Matt Wynn , 43 , a banker , said : " I 've come along with a bottle of Champagne because I want to show that you can drink responsibly on the Tube and not cause trouble . "
But others took a different approach from the beginning .
Peter Moore , 35 , a sailor from Brighton , said he had downed a can of beer in 10 seconds .
" It 's sweaty on there , but I 'm going round and round until I vomit , " he said .
' More considerate ' Transport for London 's director of transport policing and enforcement , Jeroen Weimar , said the new policy on alcohol was a reasonable one .
" We are encouraging our passengers to show a bit more respect and to be more considerate and involve other people 's views and other passengers views as they make their journeys , " he said .
" And clearly drinking alcohol can create a culture whereby people feel it's ok to do that sort of thing , it 's ok to get more drunk when you 're travelling .
" We 're not going to the stage where we 're saying we 're not going to carry people who 've had a few drinks and who are trying to get home . "
Damaged police vehicle
As Saturday night wore on , eyewitnesses described how drunken partygoers began fighting and vomiting , ripping up maps and adverts , spilling alcohol and leaving debris .
Liverpool Street was one of six stations closed after it was mobbed British Transport Police said there was a " large amount " of instances of disorder reported .
Liverpool Street underground station was closed to ease overcrowding for several hours .
Other Tube stations closed by police were Euston , Euston Square , Aldgate , Gloucester Road and Baker Street .
Seventeen people were arrested for offences such as assault , being drunk and disorderly , assaulting police , public order related offences and drug offences , BTP said .
One police vehicle was damaged and two officers assaulted and another injured .
Police also reported four assaults on train drivers and three assaults on other members of London Underground staff .
' Risk of assault ' Rail , Maritime and Transport Union ( RMT ) general secretary Bob Crow said : " Boris Johnson should apologise personally to all those who were assaulted and abused last night thanks to a half - baked gimmick designed solely as a publicity stunt and without a moment 's thought for the people told to implement it . "
He said the RMT supported measures to reduces anti-social behaviour but that the ban was imposed in haste .
" We warned it could put our members at greater risk of assault , but there is no comfort in being proved right when Tube workers have been injured and abused , " Mr Crow added .
Police said the evening started with people keen to have fun
As well as assaults , there were also " multiple instances " of Tube trains being damaged , which meant they were withdrawn from service , which in turn led to several Tube services being suspended .
A spokesperson for the Greater London Authority said : " Londoners are fed up of feeling threatened and intimidated on public transport .
That 's why the mayor has introduced an alcohol ban which came into effect today .
" It is ridiculous of the RMT to suggest that the alcohol ban threatens the safety of London Underground staff , when it was the consumption of alcohol that fuelled the reprehensible incidents of violence that took place yesterday . "
The GLA said a majority of the London public welcomed the alcohol ban " as a reasonable step that is long overdue " and that Mr Crow was " out of step with ordinary Londoners and the vast majority of the hard - working men and women who work for London Underground " .
' Dangerous ' Superintendent Ellie Bird said she had no doubt that the event had begun with a small number of people keen to have fun without causing trouble .
Other Tube passengers reported debris , broken glass and spilled alcohol
But she added : " Alcohol has a significant impact on crime and anti social behaviour , not only rendering people more vulnerable but raising levels of aggression .

Last December , Republicans in Congress introduced a resolution noting the significance of Christmas and the Christian faith , which eventually passed , blurring the lines between church and state -- and they 're at it again , attempting to rewrite American history and further the lie that America is a Christian nation .
Via Secular Coalition for America :
Jan .
11 - Flush with last year 's success in passing H. Res .
847 , " Recognizing the importance of Christmas and the Christian Faith , " Christian nationalists -- those who would have the United States be governed as a Christian theocracy -- are pushing H. Res. 888 , another resolution which promotes a false and distorted Christian nation reinterpretation of our history .
Generally , we do not take action regarding resolutions because they are ceremonial in nature and express the non-binding opinion of one chamber .
They do not have the force of law .
Read on ...
The resolution , which is supported by the likes of Reps Patrick McHenry , John Doolittle and Mean Jean Schmidt , calls for an " American Religious History Week " and rejects any attempt to remove religious messages or teachings from our public buildings and educational resources .
There can be no doubt that during an election year , Reps voting against the resolution will be labeled anti-religion , but we can't let them be bullied into signing this flawed resolution that goes against the very principles our country was founded on .
Contact your Representatives and tell them to say no to H. Res. 888 , ( corrected ) which further blurs the separation between church and state .
Clone - A- Willy kits enable you to make penis - shaped chocolate pops , candles , or soap from a mold you create out of a real - live boner .
I 've used a DIY dildo kit before , but the dildo it made was so fucking disgusting looking — all pock - marked like Edward James Olmos — and it smelled like it would give me cancer .
But it did n't matter because I do n't even ever masturbate with dildos anyway .
The Clone - a- Willy kits , however , make products that I can at least put to good use .
So the other week , I ordered all three of those kits , plus some Clone - a- Pussy kits to make vulva chocolate and last night , invited a friend ( and his penis ) over to help me out .
( Some stuff after the jump NSFW . )
Advertisement
We started with the chocolate vagina kit , since it seemed a lot less complicated , seeing as how I did n't need to be aroused or anything .
We had to mix this powder with lukewarm water , then pour it into this scoop thingy , and then press it up against my crotch , all in a span of two minutes , otherwise the stuff would 've hardened and been useless .
Advertisement
I pressed it up against me and all of a sudden the excess mixture started pouring out the sides , running down my legs and getting all over the floor .
It was all thick and creamy and it seriously looked like I had some kind of VD , or someone had just shot a lump load all over me .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Sorry for sharing that .
Anyways , I started screaming because that shit was getting all over my floor ( which I just mopped ) , so my boner donor ran and got a towel .
And then we just started laughing maniacally .
There I was , standing in my robe , a bra , and slippers with one hand on a dripping crotch and the other holding a glass of wine .
I totally looked like Nelson Muntz 's mom .
I had to hold the shovel up to my crotch for four minutes .
After enough time had elapsed , I pulled it off ( luckily , it did n't stick to my hair ) , and did not like what I saw .
I do n't mean to get all precious about my pussy or whatever , but this is not an accurate impression of it .
Advertisement
I guess there was a giant air pocket , so we peeled a dry piece of mixture up off the floor and stuffed it in there .
We put the vagina mold in the freezer , per the directions , and then got to work on the chocolate dick kit .
Advertisement
Okay , I 'm here 's the thing about that :
If you want a sexy , fun time , do n't do this .
It 's really weird and mechanical and there 's sooooooo much start and stop .
For instance , first we had to cut the provided dick tube down to the size of his erection , so I had to blow him for a little bit so that we could figure out how long to make the tube , and then left him hanging there as I was hacking the tube down with scissors .
Then I had to combine the molding powder with water , using a thermometer to make sure it was 98 º .
I had two minutes to mix the stuff , pour it in the tube , get him hard again , and then shove his peen in there , all before the mixture hardened .
It was really stressful , and also , impossible .
We could n't do it on our first try .
First of all , my dog began humping my donor 's leg , and she just would n't let go .
And by the time I mixed the stuff and blew him , the mixture had hardened in the tube and he could n't get his dick in there .
So we had to start all over again .
Advertisement
This time , we were practically pros — a well - oiled machine of genital casters .
He mixed the stuff and poured it in the tube , while I blew him until he was at full mast .
Then he stuck it in the tube , and we waited for two minutes until it had set .
( When we pulled it off his dick , it totally queefed ! )
We placed it in the fridge and then went to work on the dick candle kit .
At this point , we felt like we were sweatshop workers in a sex toy factory .
We did the mixture / blow job routine again , and he jammed his dick in the tube .
Except this time , we had issues of a different kind .
His dick is curved , so it was hitting the side of the tube , so we turned it , as per the directions , so that all sides would be covered , but then a bunch of the stuff poured out , and there was n't enough left in the tube to give him full coverage .
Advertisement
I was like , " Oh , well we can still do it , it 'll just be a shorter candle . "
" No way ! " he said .
" Tracie , I ai n't goin ' out like that . "
He insisted we start over , since he wanted it to be longest candle it could possibly be .
At this point , with all the thermometers , measuring cups , bowls , powder and whatevs , my bedroom was starting to look like a meth lab .
Advertisement
Advertisement
We decided to take a break .
All the stopping and starting of making out and oral sex and fingering that had been going on had proven to be really frustrating but also kind of an exciting form of foreplay , since we were repeatedly forced to put the breaks on .
By the time we sat down on the bed together , we just started going at it , and after a few minutes , I was like , " Why do n't we forget about the candle for now and you just fuck me . "
So he did .
Twice .
In the morning , I melted the chocolate to put in the molds .
They were expired or something and were all white .
They look like Junior Mints but they 're not .
Advertisement
I poured the melted chocolate into the molds and let them set for 5 minutes .
My vulva came out looking like a diseased turd .
Advertisement
I 'd like to take the time to reiterate that it DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE .
Got it ?

And here 's the cocklate :

I told you he was curved !

Technology services giant Electronic Data Systems has signed a deal to crawl under Hewlett - Packard 's even larger umbrella .
Say hello to the new HP , cast in the image of the old IBM .
The deal was approved by both boards of directors , and is now awaiting the thumbs - up from American and foreign regulators , as well as from EDS ' shareholders .
The price tag is $ 13.9 billion , or $ 25 per EDS share in an all - cash transaction .
That includes shouldering about $ 300 million of EDS net debt , a trivial amount in these lofty price ranges .
HP needs to take on some new debt to finance the deal , as the coffers currently have only $ 9.9 billion sloshing around .
The company will probably also cut back on its share buybacks , where it usually spends about $ 2 billion per quarter .
The final John Hancocks should come in the second half of 2008 , giving HP some time to collect the funds .
EDS will form the basis of a new division within HP , branded " EDS — an HP company , " headquartered in Plano , Tex. , and led by EDS CEO Ronald Rittenmeyer .
In other words , it will be business as usual for EDS once the customary job cuts in synergistic areas are done .
The new addition more than triples the size of HP 's service department , with sales expected to top $ 55 billion next year .
The acquisition will also add to the buyer 's profits as early as next year , which means that management expects a pretty smooth integration ride .
I was surprised to see this announcement , since HP is doing very well in the hardware sector under post - Carly CEO Mark Hurd .
If these guys were going to buy anything , I would have expected it to be something in the hardware sector , not support services .
But it is certainly true that support services tend to carry higher profit margins than servers and printers do , so if HP wants to expand into a new market , it might as well be this one .
The two companies have a very long history of cooperation , and the working relationship between Dell and EDS gives HP the satisfaction of nixing that deal or pulling the pricing strings any way it wants .

Rawalpindi ( yet again ) wonders why
THE list of causes and countries in which people are prepared to turn themselves , and those around them , into bloody piles of bone and gristle is long and growing .
In Sri Lanka on February 3rd , a woman on a platform at Colombo's main railway station blew herself up , killing at least 15 people , including seven schoolboys and their sports coach .
The next day , Israel saw its first suicide attack for more than a year : at a mall in Dimona , a Palestinian put an abrupt end to his own life , and that of an elderly Israeli woman .
As rescuers tended to an unconscious youth who appeared to be a wounded victim , they noticed — just in time — that he too was wearing an explosives belt .
Meanwhile in the Pakistani garrison town of Rawalpindi , where Benazir Bhutto was slain in December , a human bomb on a motorcycle rammed into a military bus , killing at least ten people .
There is almost always something mysterious about suicide : a gap between everything that was ever said by or known about the self - destroyer ( even by his family ) , and the silence that remains .
In the case of politically inspired suicide , the motives are at once more obvious and more elusive .
Just why are terrorists , often promising young men ( or increasingly , women ) with much to live for , willing to kill themselves as well as others ?
It is exactly eight years since the first international conference on suicide terrorism was convened in Israel ; since then , dozens of security pundits have been searching for new answers to the question .
At the time of that meeting in 2000 , the secessionist Tamil Tigers , waging war in Sri Lanka , were the most prolific users of suicide tactics .
Since then there has been a change .
While Tamil nationalists are still at large , the locus of suicide - bombing has shifted to the Muslim world , and most perpetrators — whether they are fighting local wars , or a global campaign against America and its allies — have claimed to be acting in the name of Islam .
The practice spread from the Hizbullah fighters of Lebanon to Hamas and other Palestinian groups — and thence to the killing fields of Iraq and Afghanistan .
That prompts some Westerners to assert a link between Islam — especially Shia Islam , with its stress on martyrdom — and readiness for self - destruction .
But scholars who comb the available data about suicide attacks are often sceptical about religion 's role .
Robert Pape , of the University of Chicago , has identified three factors that make suicide terrorism probable .
It is likely to occur when a community feels it is under occupation that must be resisted ; when the “ occupier ” is a democratic society whose opinion can be swayed ; and where there is a sectarian difference between the perpetrators ' community and the target community .
In his view , religious differences help to make suicide attacks conceivable , but they are not the main driver .
Nichole Argo , a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , agrees that religion 's role is limited .
What counts is a background of support for the idea of insurgency : a sense among self - annihilators that their peers will see them as heroes .
Nor is religious indoctrination a big factor , Ms Argo insists ; only a fraction of the alumni of hard - line madrassas in Pakistan and Indonesia engage in violence .
Material deprivation is not decisive either ; many suicide - bombers are from comfortable backgrounds .
Randall Collins , of the University of Pennsylvania , has made a good point about middle - class bombers : to do their job , human bombs need middle - class virtues like politeness and discretion — till the very moment of self - annihilation .
Could they be doing more harm than good ?
Research has suggested certain vitamin supplements do not extend life and could even lead to a premature death .
A review of 67 studies found " no convincing evidence " that antioxidant supplements cut the risk of dying .
Scientists at Copenhagen University said vitamins A and E could interfere with the body 's natural defences .
" Even more , beta - carotene , vitamin A , and vitamin E seem to increase mortality , " according to the review by the respected Cochrane Collaboration .
The research involved selecting various studies from 817 on beta - carotene , vitamin A , vitamin C , vitamin E , and selenium which the team felt were the most likely to fairly reflect the impact of the supplements on reducing mortality .
It has been thought that these supplements may be able to prevent damage to the body 's tissues called " oxidative stress " by eliminating the molecules called " free radicals " which are said to cause it .
This damage has been implicated in several major diseases including cancer and heart disease .
' Just eat well '
The trials involved 233,000 people who were either sick or were healthy and taking supplements for disease prevention .
VITAL VITAMIN FACTS Vitamin A : Found in : Oily fish , eggs and liver ; Good for :
Thought to boost immune system , and help skin , sight and sperm formation Vitamin C : Found in : Many fruit and vegetables ; Good for :
Helps heal wounds and assists the body in absorbing iron , may boost the immune system Vitamin E : Found in : Vegetable oils , seeds and nuts ; Good for :
May help boost circulation and keep elderly people active Beta - carotene : Found in : Vegetables that are reddish - orange in colour ; Good for : May boost vision and keep the mind sharp Selenium : Found in : Butter , nuts , liver and fish ; Good for : May boost the immune system How many take vitamins ?
Between 10 - 20 % of people in the West How much is the global market worth ?
About $ 2.5 bn ( £ 1.3 bn )
After various factors were taken into account and a further 20 studies excluded , the researchers linked vitamin A supplements to a 16 % increased risk of dying , beta - carotene to a 7 % increased risk and vitamin E to a 4 % increased risk .
Vitamin C did not appear to have any effect one way or the other , and the team said more work was needed into this supplement - as well as into selenium .
In conclusion , " we found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention , " they said .
It was unclear exactly why the supplements could have this effect , but the team speculated that they could interfere with how the body works : beta - carotene , for instance , is thought to change the way a body uses fats .
The Department of Health said people should try to get the vitamins they need from their diet , and avoid taking large doses of supplements - a market which is worth over £ 330 m in the UK .
Vitamin supplements help and are not a substitute
Joel Kosminsky , London
Readers ' comments
" There is a need to exercise caution in the use of high doses of purified supplements of vitamins , including antioxidant vitamins , and minerals , " a spokesperson said .
" Their impact on long - term health may not have been fully established and they can not be assumed to be without risk . "
A ' stitch - up '
But the Health Supplements Information Service , which is funded by the association which represents those who sell supplements , said many people were simply not able to get everything they needed from their diet .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" For the millions who are not able to do that , vitamins can be a useful supplement and they should not stop taking them , " said spokeswoman Pamela Mason .
Another nutritionist who has formulated supplements described the review as a " stitch - up " , arguing it only looked at studies which examined the effect they had on reducing mortality , rather than other advantages .
" Antioxidants are not meant to be magic bullets and should not be expected to undo a lifetime of unhealthy habits , " said Patrick Holford .
" But when used properly , in combination with eating a healthy diet full of fruit and vegetables , getting plenty of exercise and not smoking , antioxidant supplements can play an important role in maintaining and promoting overall health . "

What are these ?
( More new articles – scroll to the bottom )
We run Windows XP on all of our home and work systems ( which is almost 1,000 machines ) .
After mid-2008 , we will have NO CHOICE but to purchase Vista when we want to purchase a Microsoft desktop operating system .
I ran Vista Ultimate for 10 months on a daily - use system and was SO FRUSTRATED with it that I switched back to XP Pro .
The system runs much better , and all of our forensics software works properly again ( most of the forensic tool vendors we work with are NOT producing Vista versions – I wonder why ) .
After mid-2008 , if I ’m in a jam , I ’m switching to Linux .
That is , unless Microsoft continues selling XP or some other decent OS .
Vista ?
No way .
I ’m conflicted even saying this .
I have written a Vista book , but I still ca n’t stand the OS .
This reminds me of the Windows ME debacle almost ten years ago .
Windows ME was pathetic , and most people skipped it and waited for the next OS , Windows 2000 .
Vista is the new “ ME ” – the Windows version that most corporations are turning their back on .
I ’m also thinking of purchasing some OEM copies of XP just in case I need it after mid-2008 .
If the next version of Windows ( that is , the version after Vista ) is also a bust , I ’ll probably walk away from Microsoft ’s products for good .
Tens of thousands of you already have .
I believe I ’m qualified to state this opinion .
I ’ve been using DOS and Windows daily since 1986 .
I also have 20 years ’ daily - use experience with UNIX , and several years of experience with other operating systems ( RSTS/E , KRONOS , VMS , RT - 11 , MacOS , and TOPS - 10 ) .

Weimar Inflation in America Probably almost everyone is familiar with the hyperinflationary episode that engulfed Germany after the First World War .
That nation ’s economy was crippled by monetary problems that resulted in dreadful personal hardships , even though up to that time Germany had achieved one of the highest living standards in the world .
The newly formed German government , named for the city where their constitution was drafted after the Kaiser ’s abdication in 1918 , kept pumping up the money supply .
The process started relatively slowly , but quickly the pace of money creation accelerated .
The Weimar government was paying its bills on credit – just like Zimbabwe is now doing .
The Weimar government was issuing currency in exchange for valuable goods and services that it was receiving , and the vendors of those goods and services accepted the newly issued currency in the expectation that they would be able to exchange it for goods and services of like value .
However , they soon realized that they were deluding themselves .
Prices were rising rapidly , with the consequence that a flight from the currency into commodities and other tangibles began .
There was no discipline on the creation of new currency , with the result that it was being issued to excess .
Within a few short years , the German government eventually destroyed the Reichsmark , the currency it had been issuing , making the words Weimar Germany synonymous with hyperinflation , economic collapse , deprivation and personal hardship .
All the wealth saved in Reichsmarks was wiped out .
For example , in his classic book , “ Paper Money ” , penned three decades ago under the pen name of Adam Smith , George J.W. Goodman recounts the story of Walter Levy , an internationally known German - born oil consultant in New York .
Levy told him : “ My father was a lawyer , and he had taken out an insurance policy in 1903 .
Every month he had made the payments faithfully .
It was a 20 - year policy , and when it came due , he cashed it in and bought a single loaf of bread . ”
The following photo is from an insightful book by Bernd Widdig entitled “ Culture and Inflation in Weimar Germany ” .
This photo shows one way in which people coped with rising prices .
As the inflation worsened , people sold whatever they could to survive .
Widdig succinctly describes it in the caption to the above photo as follows :
“ The impoverished middle class has to sell its cherished possessions .
” He should have correctly stated though that it was the “ newly impoverished middle class ” .
They only became destitute after the inflation had destroyed their savings and ability to maintain their standard of living .
Sadly , the problems of Weimar Germany are now appearing in the US .
To survive the impact of rising prices , Americans today – like Germans did eight decades ago – are selling cherished possessions , as explained in a recent story by Associated Press entitled “ Americans unload prized belongings to make ends meet ” .
The full article is available at the following link : http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/story?id=4750846&page=1
AP explains how some Americans are trying to cope with the ravages of inflation : “ To meet higher gas , food and prescription drug bills , they are selling off grandmother 's dishes and their own belongings .
Some of the household purging has been extremely painful - families forced to part with heirlooms . ”
It is indeed no doubt painful , just as it was for the Germans in the photograph above , who surely must have been putting on a brave face for the photographer .
Confirmation of the AP story came a few days later on May 14th from an article in the Washington Post , which reported : “ Nearly seven in 10 Americans are worried about maintaining their standard of living , as concern has spiked higher in just the past five months , according to a new Washington Post - ABC News poll .
Soaring consumer prices are a major challenge , with many people struggling under the weight of the rising costs of fuel , food and health care .
The poll shows that the weak economy and rising prices are high among voters ' concerns , and contribute to a souring national mood in this presidential election year .
More than eight in 10 said the country has veered pretty seriously off - track , and a separate poll released yesterday by ABC showed economic anxiety at its highest level on record since 1981 .
Overall , 68 percent of people surveyed in the new Post - ABC poll said they were concerned about their ability to keep up their lifestyles , a jump of 17 percentage points since December .
The increase cuts across party and income lines . ”
Crude oil is $ 132 .
Corn is $ 6 .
The cost of everything is rising .
Inflation is worsening , and it ’s not hard to understand why .
M3 , the total quantity of dollars , is now growing by 17 % per annum .
Weimar inflation has arrived in America .
The Federal Reserve is following the footsteps of the central bank in Weimar Germany .
It is the same path taken by many central banks that have issued countless fiat currencies based on nothing but government promises .
It is the path to the fiat currency graveyard , and the once almighty US dollar – which long ago used to be “ as good as gold ” , just like the Reichsmark once held that same exalted title – is knocking at the graveyard ’s gate .
This insight about the importance of gold and shortcomings of fiat currency is not suprising , nor is it new .
Here is what Rep. Howard Buffett , father of Wall Street legend Warren Buffett , had to say on May 4 , 1948 .
“ Our finances will never be brought into order until Congress is compelled to do so .
Making our money redeemable in gold will create this compulsion . ”
Absent that compulsion , the dollar is going the way of the Reichsmark .
Do n’t count on the US government to do the right thing and make the dollar redeemable into gold .
Instead , take those steps necessary to protect yourself and your family to prepare for the dollar ’s inflationary collapse .
Buy gold .
Buy silver .
Avoid the US dollar .

The government ’s response to the crisis has drawn international criticism that echoes the condemnation it received after its brutal suppression of demonstrations for change last September .
Its usual wariness toward outsiders is widely believed to have been heightened by a national constitutional referendum scheduled for Saturday that would enhance the power of the military junta .
Myanmar ’s leaders said they would postpone the vote in only the hardest - hit parts of the country .
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations urged the junta ’s senior general , Than Shwe , on Thursday to delay the referendum altogether and to allow aid workers into the country to do their jobs .
There are thousands of aid workers inside Myanmar already .
Save the Children has a staff of 500 there and has been able to provide 63,000 families with plastic sheeting , food , water purification tablets and other supplies .
CARE has a staff of 500 , Doctors Without Borders has staff members there , and the United Nations has 1,500 people in Myanmar .
But the scale of the disaster dwarfs these measures , aid experts say .
Without a huge influx of supplies and transportation in the area , where many villages were accessible only by boat or helicopter to begin with , the workers can offer only limited help , aid officials said .
“ It ’s highly frustrating for everyone , ” said Ms. Fore , whose agency has relief teams , helicopters and ships offshore , all waiting for visas .
The French and British Navies find themselves similarly blockaded .
American State Department officials spoke Thursday of air - dropping supplies , but said they would not do so without the junta ’s permission .
Many people in the worst - hit areas have not had any food or safe drinking water or medical treatment since the cyclone hit , said the spokesman for the United Nations ’ World Food Program , Paul Risley .
The storm has mixed drinking water and sewage , posing a severe risk of diarrheal diseases , and flooding has left vast pools of standing water where mosquitoes can breed and spread malaria and dengue fever .
The cyclone struck a country particularly ill equipped to deal with a public health catastrophe , said Dr. Chris Beyrer , an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins who has worked extensively in Myanmar .
Under the military government , the public health infrastructure has been crumbling for decades , he said .

Every home in Hull could be powered by the wind farm
One of the UK 's biggest offshore wind farms could be built off the East Yorkshire coast under plans submitted by energy giant E.ON .
The Humber Gateway Offshore Wind Farm would consist of up to 83 turbines in the North Sea , five miles ( 8 km ) off Spurn Point .
The £ 700 m scheme would generate enough electricity for up to 195,000 homes .
E.ON said construction work would begin in the next two to three years with power being generated a year later .
It has submitted planning applications to East Riding of Yorkshire Council and the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform .
' Vital role '
The company said it planned to hold a series of public meetings to explain the project to the local community .
Project manager Chris Sherrington said : " If built , Humber Gateway would be one of the biggest offshore wind farms in the UK and would play a vital role in the fight against climate change .
" Not only will this scheme put East Yorkshire at the forefront of the UK 's effort to reduce carbon emissions , it will help ensure a secure , reliable and clean supply of electricity for families and businesses across the region .
" We 've spent a great deal of time and effort studying how the wind farm would interact with the local environment and we feel it 's extremely important that we talk to the community about the findings of our these studies and to hear their views on the project . "
Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Nick Rau said FoE was delighted with the plans .
" Offshore wind has a key role in the fight against climate change and helping us switch to a low - carbon economy .
" Projects like this are a springboard to a massive expansion of offshore wind energy . "

How is the universe 156 billion light years across if it is only 13.7 billion years old ?
Hidden wifi cameras can be beneficial in many circumstances .
This is true whether you ’re wanting some for your business or for your home .
In a place of business , you can use hidden wifi cameras to keep an eye on employees and prevent criminal activities .
In the home , you can use your hidden wifi cameras to watch your children with their nanny , keep an eye on your delivered packages , and more .
However , there are a few misconceptions about hidden wifi cameras .
If you ’re considering getting some for your home or place of business , then there are some important things that you should know about them .
In our guide below , we discuss several different things that you should know about these types of cameras to help you decide if they ’re right for you !
1 . They ’re More Than a Criminal Defense Tool
Many people believe that hidden wifi cameras are simply a tool to prevent criminal activity .
This is one of the misconceptions about spy cameras .
Although this is true for both the home and workplace , these cameras can do so much more than preventing theft and other criminal activities .
If you have different types of services coming in and out of your home , then a hidden camera is a great way to ensure that everything goes smoothly .
For example , if you have a dog walker , a nanny , or maintenance that enters your home while you ’re not there , a spy cam allows you to be in two places at once .
It ’s also a great tool for keeping an eye on your children when you ’re not home , especially if they ’re past the age of needing a nanny and are home alone .
There are several different ways that a hidden camera can help you , preventing crime is only one of them .
2. They Can Record Video
If you were n’t sure if wifi cameras can record actual video footage or not , then know that they can !
A camera that records video is ideal for situations that require actual documentation .
Videos are recorded onto a memory card and you can then use the memory card to show proof of an event when needed .
If you ’re worried about acquiring an endless amount of video of nothing , then you have some options .
Many cameras allow you to set your video to record 24/7 or to record based on motion detection .
When your camera detects motion , it ’ll begin to record , saving you space on your memory card .
3. You Can Live Stream to Your Smartphone
Here ’s one of the biggest advantages of using a wifi hidden camera : you can live stream video .
As long as you have a reliable internet connection where your camera is and where your smartphone is , then you can have the live footage on your phone .
Without wifi , you wo n’t be able to watch what ’s happening at that exact moment .
When wanting to keep watch on your children at the home while you ’re away or on your employees at your business while you ’re gone , this is the way to do it .
4. Changing the Placement Is Easy
Unlike other cameras that require a wired system , wifi camera placement can be changed as desired with ease .
You wo n’t have to worry about needing to rewire the system to switch the camera from one room to another .
If you need your hidden camera by the front door during the week and in the living room during the weekend , you can do so without any second installations or major hassles .
5 . They ’ll Detect Motion
Motion detection alerts are another great benefit of using a wifi hidden camera .
When motion is detected , the camera will begin to record and send it as a live feed straight to your phone .
You ’ll never have to wonder if that package was delivered to you while away again .
And if you ’re worried about thieves stealing things off your porch , then you ’ll have peace of mind .
When your children or spouse arrive home for the day , you ’ll also be notified .
This works well for homes and businesses for similar reasons .
6 . They Can be Battery or AC Power Charged
Wifi hidden cameras can either be battery or AC power charged .
Because wifi streaming can use up a lot of power , it ’s ideal to have a wifi camera with an AC power charger .
However , if you do n’t need long - term video surveillance , then you can use a battery - operated one .
The decision is yours to make depending on the situation .
7. You Can Monitor Multiple Rooms at Once
If you need to monitor more than one room at a time , then you ’ll want to invest in wifi cameras as they can help you monitor multiple rooms at once .
Install one in the living room , one in the kitchen , and a few outside .
You can also install multiple cameras around your business as long as they ’re in public areas .
Once the cameras are installed , you can monitor them together using your smartphone .
Are Hidden Wifi Cameras Right for You ?
After reading through these top things to know about hidden wifi cameras , do you think they ’re right for you ?
If you need to keep your home or business safe along with everyone inside it , then hidden cameras can be a great option !
Use this guide to help you decide if wifi cameras are the right choice for you .

At a news conference on 4/9 , The Carnegie Science Center announced plans to open the largest robotics exhibition in the United States in the Spring of 2009 with a cost of $ 3.1 million .
The new exhibition hall will be called Robo World and will occupy the second floor of the science center .
Supposedly in attendance were Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Anthony Daniels , the actor who played C - 3PO in Star Wars .
The new permanent 6,000 sq ft exhibition hall will feature world famous robots .
I hope this means they will have robots from the Robot Hall of Fame , since that is part of Carnegie as well .
I guess we have a trip to Pittsburgh in our future .

Judge orders all references to ' Taser ' stricken from medical examiner 's reports
A Summit County Common Pleas judge ordered the county medical examiner to delete any reference that Tasers contributed to the deaths of three Ohio men .
All three men were in an ' agitated ' state and ' on drugs ' when police officers shot them with Tasers , and the judge ordered their deaths be ruled ' accidental ' also that any reference to " homicide or " electrical pulse stimulation " should be deleted from death certificates and autopsy reports . "
Five sheriff 's deputies had been indicted on charges related to the death of one of the men , who also had a history of mental illness .
The judge further ordered that man 's death be ruled as " undetermined " and to " delete any references to homicide and the death possibly being caused by asphyxia , beatings or other factors . "
The court hearing centered around the " very narrow issue " of whether or not the use of the Taser Model X26 could contributed in any way to the cause of death .
A Taser International spokesman issued the following statement after the court ruling :
" Taser International believed from the beginning that these determinations of cause of death must be supported by facts , medical research and scientific evidence , " spokesman Steve Tuttle said in a prepared statement Friday .
As of mid-April , 68 wrongful - death or injury lawsuits have been dismissed or judgments entered in favor of Taser , according to the company .
The company has not lost any product - liability lawsuits .
The attorney from the prosecutor 's office representling the medical examiner said of the case :
" It was an interesting case and an uphill battle , " said Manley .
" Taser is quite a force to be reckoned with and does everything to protect their golden egg , which is the Model X26 . "

Can Republicans vote in Ohio ’s Democrat presidential primary ?
According to the Ohio Secretary of State ’s website :
How do I establish which political party ’s ballot I am entitled to vote ?
“ You may vote the primary ballot of the political party with which you currently wish to be affiliated .
If you voted the primary ballot of a different political party in 2005 or 2006 , you will complete a statement at your polling place confirming the change in your political party affiliation . ”
Switching party affiliation on primary election day , at polling place .
I would expect that poll workers , being political critters by nature , will not like Republicans or independants voting in the Democrat primary election , and they may try to throw sand into the gears .
— –
Here ’s how it works , as best I can figure :
1 . A registered Ohio voter goes to the appropriate primary election voting place , with the required personal identification .
2 . A poll worker will ask if you want a Republican or a Democrat ballot .
3 . The poll worker checks which party primary you voted in last time , and if it is not the same party as you are asking to vote in this time , you may be challenged .
If you are not challenged , then there should be no problem .
4 . If you wish to switch party affiliations , say so .
5 . You will be given a form , either Form 10 - X or Form 10 - W , which you must fill out and sign .
6. Ohio Revised Code 3513.20
Effect of challenge to voter at primary , states in part :
“ Before any challenged person shall be allowed to vote at a primary election , the person shall make a statement , under penalty of election falsification , before one of the precinct officials , blanks for which shall be furnished by the board of elections , giving name , age , residence , length of residence in the precinct , county , and state ; stating that the person desires to be affiliated with and supports the principles of the political party whose ballot the person desires to vote ; and giving all other facts necessary to determine whether the person is entitled to vote in that primary election .
The statement shall be returned to the office of the board with the pollbooks and tally sheets . . . . ”
— — –
A mere pro forma change of parties is not contemplated by the statute , but I do n’t want to get into a discussion of what the meaning of ‘ principles ’ is .
According to the The Democratic Party web site , the party ’s principles are :
Honest Leadership & Open Government ,
Real Security ,
Energy Independence ,
Economic Prosperity & Educational Excellence ,
A Healthcare System that Works for Everyone , and ;
Retirement Security .
If you can support these principles , you can legitimately align yourself with the Democratic Party
Please remember , things frequently do n’t go as they are supposed to .
Do n’t panic , and do n’t over - react .

March 21 , 2008 – Possible problems for malicious party switchers : Will Rush Limbaugh Be Indicted for Voter Fraud ?
Nuclear physics and Roman archaeology just do n’t mix , or so you would
think .
But researchers at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics in Padua ,
Italy , and a team of archaeologists have found a common goal : to raise 1500
ingots of lead from a Roman freighter which sank off the coast of Sardinia
more than 2000 years ago .
The physicists , Gianni Fiorentini and Ettore Fiorini , want the lead
for experiments that are of critical importance in particle physics and
cosmology .
Donatella Salvi , an archaeologist working with the Italian authority
for artistic and historical heritage , wants to know more about the Mediterranean
lead trade in the first century BC .
The ship was discovered two years ago near an island called Mal di Ventre ,
so - named because of the high wind that plagues the area .
It was modified
to carry lead and is the only one of its type known .
The physicists want the ancient lead for a practical reason .
Lead is
the best material for shielding delicate experiments which detect minute
amounts of radiation , for example from the unusual kinds of radioactivity
associated with double beta decay , or from the rare interaction of neutrinos
– the ghost - like particles that are emitted from the Sun and pass through
the Earth unheeded .
Another experiment requiring shielding is the detection
of particles of so - called dark matter – the material believed to hold the
Universe together .
Advertisement
Such experiments are usually carried out deep underground in specially
built installations , such as the Gran Sasso Laboratory near Rome .
Here ,
1400 metres of solid rock protect the detecting apparatus from high - energy
cosmic rays raining through the atmosphere .
Small amounts of radioactive
materials in the rocks themselves , however , can interfere with the experiments ,
so the detector has to be surrounded by an additional lead shield .
Commercial lead has only tiny amounts of radioactive contaminants such
as lead - 210 , but even this is enough to affect very sensitive experiments .
However , the half - life of lead - 210 is 22 years , which means that lead excavated
a long time ago would have lost most of its radioactive component .
In fact ,
physicists have sometimes relied on lead from old cannonballs for their
experiments .
Lead that is 2000 years old would be expected to contain virtually no
radioactive isotopes at all .
The physicists , when they tested a small portion
of a salvaged ingot , found this was the case .
What will the archaeologists get out of the salvaging project ?
Apart
from the 300 million lire ( £ 135 000 ) from the institute , the physicists
have agreed to analyse the ingots to establish their geological origins
and set up a database for archaeological studies .
Each ingot has a manufacturer ’s
mark and the researchers hope that the data will help them to map the trading
routes that once served a flourishing Roman metallurgical industry .
Zeroing in on a group of cells in a high layer of the cortex , a team of researchers from Mount Sinai School of Medicine , Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute may finally have found the cause of the swirling textures , blurry visions and signal - crossing synesthesia brought on by hallucinogenic drugs like LSD , peyote and " ' shrooms . "
The group , which published its findings in this week 's issue of , may have settled a long - simmering debate over how psychedelic drugs distort human perception .
" There 's this huge body of literature about these compounds , and I think this paper begins to nail down how the heck they 're working in the brain , " says Bryan Roth , a pharmacologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
" It 's not the end of the story , but I 'd say it 's the end of the beginning of the story . "
Since the 1980s researchers in this field have agreed that LSD , which was first synthesized by Swiss scientists in 1938 , likely affects serotonin 2A receptors in the brain ( serotonin is a neurotransmitter suspected to play a role in the communication of mood and consciousness ) .
These receptors show up in many places in the brain , including several areas in the cortex ( known for sensory perception ) , and the thalamus ( an interior region known for relaying messages to the cortex as well as regulating arousal and awareness ) .
The current research was performed by creating a mouse model that enabled scientists to observe behavioral and cell - signaling responses to hallucinogenic drugs by comparing them with those triggered by lisuride , an anti-Parkinson 's disease drug chemically similar to LSD that does not have hallucinogenic effects .
After determining that mice given psychedelic drugs consistently experience head twitching , the team bred mice with the serotonin 2A receptor knocked out to determine whether the hallucinogens still caused head twitching .
After testing many candidate regions , the researchers localized the effects of hallucinogens to the pyramidal neurons in layer V of the somatosensory cortex , a relatively high - level region known to modulate the activity of other sections in the cortex and subcortical areas .
Using what he calls an " imperfect but usual analogy , " Stuart Sealfon , a neurologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City likens the receptors to a lock into which both hallucinogenic and nonhallucinogenic keys fit .
While LSD may turn this lock to the right , kicking off one set of responses , lisuride turns the tumbler to the left , an action that only causes a subset of those responses .
" Both the hallucinogens and the nonhallucinogens activate what we would call the classical signaling cascade downstream of this receptor in these cells , " Sealfon says .
" But , the hallucinogens , we show , are activating an additional signaling cascade and we believe the sum of both of them together is probably what causes the effect we see . "
U.N.C. , Chapel Hill 's
Roth says that the new study 's localization of LSD 's effect on the pyramidal neurons in level V makes sense .
" We know that LSD profoundly affects human consciousness and awareness & so this tells us that the receptor on those neurons is an important locus for modulating consciousness , " he explains .
" If you muck up the actions of those neurons , it would n't be so surprising that you would affect consciousness . "
Still , the finding does not appear to have silenced the debate .
While Roth concedes that cortical serotonin 2A receptors are likely part of the mechanism of hallucinogenic drugs , Dave Nichols , a molecular pharmacologist at Purdue University , believes the thalamus must be involved in some manner .
" The thalamus is the major relay station for sensory information that is sent to the cortex , and there are serotonin 2A receptors localized in the thalamus and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus , which controls the flow of information through the thalamus , " he argues .
" For the authors to say that a unique mechanism has been identified that does not involve the thalamus , I therefore think cannot be correct . "
While consensus on the exact way hallucinogens work may be a ways off , Sealfon says the research goes far in demystifying the effects of drug abuse .
Also , he notes , drugs similar to LSD are routinely prescribed to patients suffering from mental illnesses , often without doctors ' full understanding their effects .
" If you could understand what makes a drug like LSD or mescaline have such a dramatic effect , then the principles behind that and the approaches developed for [ gaining that understanding ] can be applied to drugs that are used to treat neurological and psychiatric conditions , " he says , adding that doctors can then " identify what drugs will have less side - effects and more specific effects "

Our second cat that DreddsGirlfriend and I rescued from the feral realm is dying .
It is the devastation cat cancer .
She was doing very well , but death has some quickie reversal aspects to it .
My heart is very scarred from the deaths I have seen in these wonderful pets I tried to save .
I really would not mind being cremated at a pet crematorium , because I think that in many aspects animals are superior to humans .
But it is an individual thing , some animals are full of hatred and ill will .
Some humans too .
But from the standpoint of warrior worshippers , who generally do n't think that much of animals , this seems to be an extreme dis to them .
I would not do that to a soldier , even tho I can never be one , so yes Brad , this is not left , it is right .

You must learn to take things in context , and get a bit intahnashonal dude or dudette .
For instance , these words :
Sue Scott plays all the female parts ( Comodee or Comedy ? ) would cause some wrong wingers to cry " lesbian " .
Butt o reilly yours , its just a cowboy bond band .

Speaking of push ah and poll ah ... Joe " Zell Miller " Lieberman just checked out McFeign 's family jewels ( his " bearings " ) and announced that they were all there .
Obama , if you remember , had suggested that McFiegn has " lost his bearings " by getting dirty and saying " Hamas wants Obama to win " .
Well , lets just hope the Scrotum Court headed up by the neoTurds ( Scrotlea , et alia ) do n't have to squeeze out another erection ( speaking Japanease of coarse ) .

Maybe if we had left the Native Indians alone or allowed them to guide us ... well who knows , maybe we would appreciate the land , the animals , and take wisdom from what they knew ... but we took their children at the age of seven , ( Canada ) from their parents and put them in " English " schools , mostly Catholic , some died and were buried without the parents knowing where they are or even that they died .
I do n't resent our Native Indians not having to pay taxes .

Personally I think those that are both ignorant enough to not see through the blatant lies of the Bush administration and the ENTIRE 110th Congress and do n't have the intestinal fortitude to simply say NO ! to mass murder & the total destruction and eternal contamination by radiation of an entire country that has done nothing to us are actually the ones that are dishonoring the PETS not the other way around .
When this all first started I had sympathy for the soldiers , I no longer do .
How can anyone not expect such as this from the Bush administration ?
These people are nothing but 21st century Nazi's .

How do we know that the pentagon has not been cremating untold numbers of US soldiers , who have no family to look out for them ?
How do we know they have really been reporting the truth about how many they have cremated .
Judging from history , we know that the pentagon does not tell the truth .
If it were only 200 soldiers , why did then need to use a pet cremation services .
If they were n't doing anything sinister , why did they suddenly halt this when it came to light ?
Why does this scream Mob covering up the bodies to me ??

In listening to the video of Morrell do his damage - control thing with this issue of a private funeral industry contractor contracting out to a pet mortuary to incinerate the remains of some of our dead Iraq war vets , I heard one of the press people ask , " What 's insensitive about that ?
What 's the problem there ? "
Anybody want to guess who owns that voice ?
I swear it sounds like Dana Perino .
Also , I have an unrelated question : I remember watching the video at your site about the touch screens being manufactured in Asia , and I remember watching the video about the US company and its employees who refused to approve the hanging chad ballots that were used in PBC in 2000 .
Is this one video , or two ?

What I 'm asking is , does that video also contain the story about the company in America that manufactures paper ballots and whose employees refused to approve the ballots that were used by PBC in the 2000 election ?
I do n't want to have to watch the whole video to find this answer , if I can help it .

The specs for the punch holes in the ballots for that election were wrong .
Employees complained .
Were given some song and dance about adjusting for moisture affects .
Inspectors at the company repeatedly nixed the bad batches , but the batches were put back into circulation anyway .
Someone was determined to get bad ballots into Florida in 2000 .

' co-located ' is actually used a lot in big corporations , for example : " Design engineering and planning are going to be co-located in the new building to facilitate coordination between the groups . "
That said , it seems a bit strange with the ' low fatality rate ' that the repugnants think this war has cost that the military has resorted to pet-crematoriums .
I suppose they were the lowest bidder , and thats the way the buck rolls .

But that is not the end of the story , because some of us really love and care for our pets .

Gaming , as an industry , has become an economic powerhouse .
The growth of the industry in the US is exceeding the overall growth of the US economy , and is in fact a bright spot in an otherwise dour picture of the nation 's finances .
Game developers are creating a product that is doing very well in even the worldwide market , and where these companies set up shops , jobs and cash follow .
Developers in the UK are now pressuring the government to step up tax breaks for the gaming industry , and they 're wielding a very real stick : developers have already begun to flee for the greener pastures of Canada .
15 game companies have joined a lobbying group called " Games Up ? " to fight for better benefits in the UK .
" All our key competitors offer tax breaks and grants , putting UK developers at a disadvantage , " said Richard Wilson , a chief executive of Tiga , the UK trade organization for game developers .
Tiga argues that these tax breaks would , in the long run , help the UK .
The organization " cited figures by Games Investor Consulting that suggested if its proposals on skills and tax credits were implemented , the British games industry would receive an additional investment of £ 220 m over five years , creating an additional 1,500 jobs , rather than the projected decline from 10,000 developers today , " as reported by the Financial Times .
Instead of entertaining these ideas , the UK government seems more likely to fight Canada .
" The UK government is concerned that state aid offered to computer games companies by a number of federal institutions in Canada may not be compatible with World Trade Organization principles , " an official from the UK Ministry of Culture , Media and Sport told Canwest News Service .
Paul Jackson , director of the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association , used even stronger words when talking to the Financial Times about this issue .
" The Canadians have driven a tank over the French Citroen and have now parked on our lawn ... it is becoming very challenging to keep core development studios here . "
Searching for " game industry " on the Invest Quebec site , you can see how quickly the big studios are expanding their Canadian presence .
" Ubisoft is one of the world 's leading designers and publishers of video games , with subsidiaries in 21 countries and 3,000 employees .
Its Montreal studio alone employs over 1,300 people ( a number that is expected to double by 2010 ) and produces close to 50 percent of the titles in the Ubisoft group 's catalogue , " the site proclaims .
Or , again , " Beenox Studios ( Activision ) has been a wholly - owned subsidiary of Activision since 2005 .
The company , which has more than 100 employees at its Québec City studio , plans to triple its workforce in the near future by hiring 200 people by 2009 . "
The economic break given to developers in Quebec is huge : companies can save up to 30 percent of payroll in tax credits , with a 7.5 percent bonus if the game includes a French - language version .
If you 've ever purchased a game with instructions in both French and English , even in the US , there was a very good reason for that .
The UK government may be barking up the wrong tree , as the WTO TRIMs ( Trade - Related Investment Measures ) agreement seems to address this directly .
" The long and short of the TRIMs Agreement is that developed countries can offer all the investment incentives they please , by tax relief or other means , provided they avoid local content requirements , " noted the Center for Strategic Tax Reform .
Fighting Canada over these issues could be a long process , and in the meantime game developers will leave the country .
The WTO is not known for ruling on these disputes in a timely fashion , and the case has to go through the EU before even getting that far .
This is n't the first time the UK has clashed with Canada over tax breaks causing businesses to pack up and move to our chilly neighbor up north .
The last product to cause controversy ?

SYDNEY ( Reuters Life ! ) -
There ’s perfectionist mothers , unpredictable mothers , “ me first ” mothers and “ complete ” mothers but family experts say the fastest growing group of mothers is the “ best - friend mother ” -- and it can only end badly .

There 's perfectionist mothers , unpredictable mothers , " me first " mothers and " complete " mothers but family experts say the fastest growing group of mothers is the " best - friend mother " -- and it can only end badly .
REUTERS / Toshiyuki Aizawa
Clinical psychologist Stephan Poulter , who works with family relationships , has come up with five categories that he finds fit most mothers .
He finds the group that is on the rise is mothers who want to be best friends with their children .
But he said going partying with your children , wearing the same clothes as them , trying to keep up with their youth with breast implants and surgery , erodes all boundaries -- and leaves the children without a mother who can guide them .
“ You see this all over the media with a lot of the actresses in Hollywood -- their mothers are their friends , ” said Los Angeles - based Poulter in a telephone interview .
“ One tragic one is Lindsay Lohan .
Her mother is out drinking with her .
Now she ’s been in and out of rehab and arrested twice .
What kind of role model is she getting ?
Look at Paris Hilton too .
Same story . ”
He said Anna Nicole Smith , the former Playboy model , was another prime example .
She died of an accidental prescription drug overdose in Florida in February 2007 -- just five months after her 20 - year - old son Daniel died of a drug overdose .
Poulter , who has just released a book called “ The Mother Factor , ” said this style of mothering had been on the rise for about 15 years but now accounted for 30 - 40 percent of mothers .
“ EPIDEMIC ”
“ This really is an epidemic .
Because of unresolved issues with their parents , some parents today do n’t want to be so hard and just want their children to like them .
At the end of a long working day they do n’t want conflict , ” he said .
“ But kids need a parent , not another friend , and this leaves them motherless .
This can create a lot of rage in boys , and daughters who are drug - orientated and out of control tend to be motherless daughters of this type . ”
Rose Rock , the mother of U.S. comedian Chris Rock , who has raised 10 children of her own and looked after 17 foster children , has also warned about this shift in parenting .
She has laid down the 10 commandments of parenting in a new book , “ Mama Rock ’s Rules : Ten Lessons for Raising a Houseful of Successful Children , ” and No. 1 is to be a child ’s mama , not their friend -- and to have rules in your house .
“ At no time should you let your children think they can disrespect you or treat you like a buddy , ” Rock told Reuters .
She attributed the rise in the number of mothers wanting to be their children ’s best friend to a lack of time and to parents finding it is easier to let children lay down their own rules .
“ It is a new thing that everyone wants their children to like them but parenting is not a popularity contest , ” she said .
“ I do n’t need to be a 12 - year - old ’s friend but I do need to be their protector , guide and warden .
This is just a cop out . ”
Poulter says he tries to make families realize that they need to take back the traditional roles .
“ I need the parents to recognize that they are not their child ’s friend and get their kids ’ respect and then the kids can separate from their mother and move forward in their life and not feel they are responsible for their mother , ” he said .
“ For the kids this can work .
But I think it is very hard for the mother to shift and to become the parent . ”
Over the course of the Iraq War , the Pentagon has used hand - picked retired military officers as “ message force multipliers ” to shape public opinion , a New York Times investigation revealed last month .
According to the report , which was the product of a two - year battle with the Pentagon over the release of some 8,000 pages of documents , briefers gave talking points to the retired military men , who were then frequently showcased as experts on war matters by various media that did not make viewers aware of the experts ’ administration connections .
In fact , the media outlets were generally unaware that the analysts had received administration briefings .
From the administration , these analysts received access to top - level officials ( as well as tours of Iraq and Guantanamo Bay and the accompanying insider knowledge ) , which some of them then parlayed into business advantages , for example for defense contractors for whom they worked .
From media outlets , they sometimes received payments for their contributions .
These serious conflicts of interest were not revealed until the Times ’ investigation .
For this display of media manipulation , former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria C. “ Torie ” Clarke deserves the lion ’s share of credit .
While Mohammed Saeed al - Sahhaf , who as Information Minister of Iraq epitomized the clueless propagandist ( he proclaimed that Baghdad was not under attack , as images of U.S. troops on the outskirts of the city played on a television screen behind him ) , Clarke exemplifies the sophisticated , savvy operative dedicated to spinning the war favorably for the Bush administration .
“ Clarke was the Pentagon mastermind for the selling of the war and management of the media , ” John Stauber , executive director of the Center for Media and Democracy , told me .
“ She invented the Pentagon ’s ‘ twin towers of propaganda ’ that proved so effective : embedding news media with the troops , and embedding military propagandists into the TV media , as exposed recently by the New York Times . ”
Clarke came to her post in the George W. Bush administration in May 2001 , after working in the private sector as a public relations specialist and after having served as a staffer in both the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations .
Her biography on the website of the Harry Walker Agency , whose clients include a who ’s who list of Democratic and Republican Party bigwigs , trumpets , “ From the Pentagon to the private sector , Victoria Clarke has been at the center of some of the most historic events in the United States in recent years . ”
( E-mail requests for an interview with Clarke were unanswered at the time of publication . )
In her pre-Pentagon career , Clarke was president of Bozell Eskew Advertising , an issue - advocacy and corporate communications firm ; vice president of the National Cable Telecommunications Association ; and the Washington - office director for Hill & Knowlton , the public relations firm heavily involved in Gulf War I .
She also served as the press secretary to Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) , and after leaving her Pentagon post wrote Lipstick on a Pig : Winning In the No - Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game .
When she joined the George W. Bush administration as part of Donald Rumsfeld ’s Pentagon , Clarke came “ to her job with distinct ideas about achieving what she called ‘ information dominance , ’ ” the New York Times reported .
She spearheaded the idea of embedding of reporters with troops during the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
In a February 2003 memo prepared for the National Security Council , Clarke — with Rumsfeld on board — argued that allowing journalists to report from the front lines would give Americans the opportunity to get the story , both “ good or bad — before others seed the media with disinformation and distortions , as they most certainly will continue to do .
Our people in the field need to tell our story .
Only commanders can ensure the media get to the story alongside the troops .
We must organize for and facilitate access of national and international media to our forces , including those forces engaged in ground operations . ”
But given the opportunity , Clarke demonstrated that she would prefer to altogether circumvent reporters , who after all are generally expected to maintain independence , objectivity , and critical thinking in their work .
Instead , she would use the military analysts to spread the Bush message .
As the New York Times reported , “ Other administrations had made sporadic , small - scale attempts to build relationships with the occasional military analyst .
But these were trifling compared with what Ms. Clarke ’s team had in mind .
Don Meyer , an aide to Ms. Clarke , said a strategic decision was made in 2002 to make the analysts the main focus of the public relations push to construct a case for war .
Journalists were secondary .
‘ We did n’t want to rely on them to be our primary vehicle to get information out , ’ Mr. Meyer said . ”
Anyone who watched television news during the run-up to the invasion , its initial phases , and the first few years of the occupation of Iraq , was probably struck by the many retired military officers who were given huge chunks of airtime .
But no one — other than Pentagon officials — knew that these new media favorites on Fox News , CNN , MSNBC , ABC , CBS , and NBC had often been thoroughly briefed and armed with talking points by the Pentagon , State Department , White House , or other officials .
The retired officers provided explanations of the action taking place on the ground , offered justifications for administration strategies , pointed out the hot spots in - country , and often led the pro-war cheerleading .
And whenever there was an anti-war outcry that threatened to gain momentum — for example , in 2006 when former generals came forward en masse to criticize Rumsfeld and his handling of the war — the Pentagon public relations machinery would kick into gear , briefing the analysts , giving them material with which to rebut criticisms , and then keeping tabs on the analysts ’ on - air performances .
Setbacks in Iraq — like the generals ’ revolt , the Abu Ghraib scandal , and the growing insurgency — brought pushback from the Pentagon by way of a new set of talking points for the well - schooled retirees .
Given the Bush administration ’s predilection for trying to manipulate and manage the media — buying favorable coverage for its various programs through payments to well - known sympathetic columnists , trying to skirt the mainstream media by giving interviews and special access to supportive local news outlets , paying for favorable coverage in Iraqi newspapers — one might expect that it would develop major league messaging capabilities .
But it is surprising disappointing to see the military retirees used in this fashion .
The analysts were a group of men who were respected , knowledgeable , and had long service records , who could reach a broad audience and influence policy .
“ In a spin - saturated news culture , [ Clarke ] argued , opinion is swayed most by voices perceived as authoritative and utterly independent .
And so even before Sept. 11 , she built a system within the Pentagon to recruit ‘ key influentials ’— movers and shakers from all walks who with the proper ministrations might be counted on to generate support for Mr. Rumsfeld ’s priorities . ”
It ’s difficult to know exactly what drove these men to regurgitate misinformation and disinformation to the American public , even while some suspected they were being used .
Were the secret Pentagon meetings with Rumsfeld the major draw ?
Was it the first - class trips on government aircraft and cushy hotel stays that drew them in ?
Perhaps it was the contracts that these former military officers realized they could get for the defense companies they lobbied for , and the consulting firms they headed ?
Maybe it was ego , the garnering of fame via television face time , or maybe it was the extra cash .
One of the things that made Clarke — who left the administration in 2003 and now works at ABC , one of the networks hoodwinked by Clarke ’s team of retired military officers — an effective media spokesperson is that she is a likable mom .
She is n’t shrill , and she manages to maintain a rather disarming demeanor , which was on display during her televised press briefings while with the administration , and on such television programs as 60 Minutes , Good Morning America , and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart .
She “ revolutionized the Defense Department ’s relationship with the media , humanizing the Bush administration ’s military effort and restoring respect for people in uniform , ” Manuel Miranda , former counsel to the Republican former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist , told me .
“ A different person in her role at the Defense Department might have led to very different result at a critical time . ”
Clarke also may have indirectly brought about a “ revolution ” in the way the Pentagon does business during the remainder of the Bush presidency .
Shortly after its groundbreaking investigative report appeared , the New York Times reported that Robert Hastings , principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs , decided to indefinitely suspend its briefings program “ pending an internal review . ”
Some people are content to own regular pets such as cats , dogs , birds , and gerbils while others prefer the more exotic , such as chinchillas , sugar gliders , monkeys , pythons etc. , wanting the status of having owned an exotic animal .
It is the owner ’s choice if they want to take on the many responsibilities that are involved in taking care of an exotic animal .
And for those who seek the exotic , unusual and lavish , these pets can help fulfill that desire while adding to one ’s status symbol .
There are many exotic pets that are legal to purchase [ some even require special licensing ] under the correct circumstances , ranging in price from approximately $ 800 to $ 138,000 .
Most of them are available whether you are rich or poor , however all of these pets demand high attention and lots of time .
Considering how cool these pets are it may be even cooler to get them the best environment for them to live in , which also may be a bit expensive .
Either way , you may need to get a bump in your cash flow to make it work .
Bengal Cat
No relation to the Bengal tiger , the Bengal cat is a hybrid creation featuring pre-designed genetic characteristics that are crossbred with the likes of something more exotic , such as the Asian leopard cat .
The Bengal cat is a fun loving , always on the go cat that you wo n’t find resting very often .
The result is a new feline breed that acts much like a mellow domestic , but looks like he just walked off the Savannah plains .
Savannah Cat
Bred in a similar process to the Bengal Cat , the Savannah Cat is bred by mating the African Serval with a smaller domestic cat .
The Savannah inherently has a much more difficult breeding process , because an African Serval is 40 lbs and undomesticated and breeding it with a domestic house cat is problematic .
Concurrently , the gestation periods between the two animals are different .
Chinese Crested Hairless Puppies
These chinese crested hairless puppies weigh about 5 to 12 lbs and are very vivacious , alert and friendly animals .
Considered to be one of the rarest dogs , these dogs are prone to sunburning on a hot and clear day .
The dogs first originated in Africa and the animals is most often found to be a very pleasant companion that lives for over 10 to 12 years .
Hyacinth Macaw
The hyacinth macaw weighs in at four pounds , and the world ’s largest parrot species also enjoys a tremendous four - foot wingspan .
This South American native mates for life , is easily domesticated and will probably outlive you .
In the wild , he eats the nuts from two kinds of palm trees , but one of them , the acuri , he only eats after it has passed through the digestive system of another animal .
Kinkajou
This nocturnal rain forest mammal is friendly and affectionate by nature and , therefore , enjoys some popularity among exotic - pet owners .
Despite their sharp , carnivorous teeth they eat bananas , eggs , mangoes , fruit loops , marshmallows , and gummi bears .
This preserves their wicked , bacteria - loaded bite for when threatened or scared .
Sugar Glider
These popular little nocturnal marsupials from northeast Australia weigh no more than about five ounces .
Their lively and curious nature helps them to bond easily with humans .
Unfortunately , they ’re also social and nocturnal , and want your attention when you ca n’t give it – at night .
For that reason , it is recommended that you keep at least two .
Owners should also provide an environment with branches or vines to satisfy the sugar glider ’s desire to climb .
Snow Macaque
The Japanese Macaque , also known as the Snow Monkey , is a terrestrial Old World monkey species native to Japan .
The Snow Macaque is considered a threatened species as we continue to encroach on more and more of the animal ’s habitat .
Due to this fact , coveted licenses and special permits are mandated to own this very rare animal .
The Snow Macaque is a smaller primate with a lifespan of over 25 years with the distinguishing feature of a hairless red face .
Squirrel monkey
Hailing from Central and South America , the squirrel monkey is omnivorous , measuring in at about 2.75 pounds ; they have a number of predators , which is one reason they run with a posse that can number as high as 500 .
Speaking proportionately , they have the largest brain of all the primates ( that includes humans ) .
Couple that intelligence with a social and affectionate nature , and things like house - training come relatively easy to this monkey .
Mona monkey
This West African native is an Old World monkey who peaks out at about 15 pounds and lives into his early 20s .
Like any other monkey , this mona monkey also needs to move those crazy limbs .
Owners should provide them with an enclosure that permits climbing , swinging , goofing around , and even hiding .
The most difficult job may be monkey - proofing your home , since he can outsmart or out - jiggle most baby - proof methods .
Chimpanzee
Eerily analogous to humans in life span , behavior and even DNA ( we share 94 % ) , chimps have a hold on human fascination and attract the likes of scientists , zoo - goers and potential pet owners .
This remarkable similarity also hints toward why they make for such problematic and unmanageable pets .
Chimpanzee can be house - trained , but he ’s intelligent enough to have a mind of his own .
If he wants to raid the fridge , but fails to outwit you , his 115 - pound frame has another option - take it by force .
His average upper - body strength is five times that of a human .
With a more sophisticated gripping capacity he could show you up at the gym , but why bother ?
He can just maul you to death .
Chinchilla Lanigera
Chinchilla ‘s lifespan is typically about 15 years , but 18 - 22 years is not uncommon .
Its Body length is about 10 - 14 inches ; tail is another 5 - 6 inches or so .
With gentle handling from a young age most chinchillas will become quite tame and bond closely with their owners , although sometimes they do not like to be held or cuddled .
They are very active and playful .
Chinchillas can be kept singly , and usually will do fine as same sex pairs especially if they are littermates or introduced at a young age .
White Lion Cubs
According to Forbes ( America ’s Priciest Pets ) , as a pet this cub is the world ’s costliest animal .
The white lion is not a species unto itself ; he ’s your standard lion with a potentially fatal flaw .
The flaw is a recessive gene that alerts both potential prey ( wildebeests , hippos and adult elephants ) as well as predators ( hunters ) to his presence .
The problem with raising a cub is the same as raising some puppies — they grow up .
In the case of a white lion , that can mean reaching 500 pounds .
Ball Python
There are two types of people : those who like snakes as pets and those who do n’t .
It ’s doubtful that the red eyes or exotic colors of some of these rare variations will entice the uninterested .
After all , ownership in this case means keeping your 5 - foot - long ball python in a 30 gallon tank and feeding it dead mice , rats or gerbils every 10 days for the next 30 years .
Reticulated Python
Hailing largely from Thailand and Indonesia , reticulated pythons represent the longest known species of snake in the animal kingdom .
How do you keep this monster happy ?
Start with a fairly large tank for a habitat in which humidity levels and high temperatures must be regulated with some discipline .
Breeders recommend getting a second person to help you feed your reticulated albino type II tiger python ; someone needs to call an ambulance when it mistakes you for a carcass .
Lavender Albino Python Female
This Albino is very different from the more common form of albinism .
The white areas have a nice lavender color and the eyes are a very deep , ruby red .
The trait is a simple recessive and is represented in captivity at this time .
Also available from python breeder Bob Clark , the rarity has fueled demand .
Leopard Gecko
Leopard geckos may live about 20 years .
Leopard geckos reach approximately 8 - 10 inches in length .
Leopard geckos are commonly yellow and white with black spots ( hatchlings start out more striped , and gradually change to the spotted appearance ) .
There are several color and pattern ( e.g. jungle ) variations .
Our biological rhythm controls many metabolic functions and is based on the circadian rhythm , which is a roughly 24 - hour cycle that is important in determining sleeping and feeding patterns , cell regeneration , and other biological processes in mammals .
A newly discovered rhythm discovered by NYU dental professor Dr. Timothy Bromage also originates in the hypothalamus , a region of the brain that functions as the main control center for the autonomic nervous system .
Unlike the circadian rhythm , this clock varies from one organism to another , operating on shorter time intervals for small mammals , and longer ones for larger animals .
For example , rats have a one - day interval , chimpanzees six , and humans eight .
Bromage discovered the rhythm while observing incremental growth lines in tooth enamel , which appear much like the annual rings on a tree .
He also observed a related pattern of incremental growth in skeletal bone tissue – the first time such an incremental rhythm has ever been observed in bone .

The black hole at the top is a blood vessel canal .
Credit : Dr. Tim Bromage
Reporting his findings today in the “ Late - breaking News ” session during the 37th Annual Meeting of the American Association for Dental Research , Bromage said , “ The same biological rhythm that controls incremental tooth and bone growth also affects bone and body size and many metabolic processes , including heart and respiration rates .
In fact , the rhythm affects an organism ’s overall pace of life , and its life span .
So , a rat that grows teeth and bone in one - eighth the time of a human also lives faster and dies younger . ”
Humans have by far the most variation in these long - term incremental growth rhythms , with some humans clocking as few as five days , and others as many as ten .
Correspondingly , humans have the most variability in body size among mammals .
Future research will assess whether there is a link between slower growth rhythms and growth disorders .
Since the autonomic nervous system controls human behavior , future research will also assess whether growth rhythms can be linked to variations in human behavior .
Will God Get You Out of Your Depression ?
Religion can help or harm your mental health , depending on your denomination .
March 19 , 2008  --
" It was then that I carried you . "
Some may recognize this line from the widely popular " Footprints in the Sand , " the poem that describes how , during the hardest parts of life , God carried the author through hard times .
Believers like Laverne Williams , a one - time depression patient and deaconess at Union Baptist Church in Montclair , N.J. , identify with this parable .
She says her religion was an invaluable resource during her depression .
" My faith really got me through because I knew it would pass , " she said .
However , some people with mental illness have found their faith causes more pain than peace .
" I had no idea what was happening to me , I had all the signs of major depression , " said Susan Gregg - Schroeder , a United Methodist minister and coordinator of Mental Health Ministries .
" There is a huge stigma against mental health in our faith communities . "
Religion , it seems , can act as a double - edged sword when it comes to mental health .
" Religion can amplify things , both positively and negatively , " said Brother Larry Whitney , university chaplain for community life at Boston University .
" It 's not religion ; it 's the misuse of religion that creates a negative reaction . "
Belief vs. Relief
" You might be shocked to find out there are some denominations that do harm to people , " said Patricia Murphy , chaplain and assistant professor of psychiatry at Rush University .
" Some congregations teach that depression is a sin ... that 's the reaction they get when they turn to their pastor . "
Being punished by your religious leader for an unavoidable disorder sounds bad enough — yet it 's often compounded with tacit warnings against leaving the condemning sect .
" Some religious groups are taught that the only way you get to heaven are if you are in that denomination , " says Murphy .
" There are some people who are wounded by that , it adds to their depression , God becomes a problem , religion becomes a problem . "
Gregg - Schroeder faced first - hand the difficulties of depression during her second year working as a minister .
Gregg - Schroeder said she and her family kept her depression a secret for two years , while she struggled with shame and the fear of losing her job .
" Studies have shown that faith leaders are least supportive [ with mental health problems ] , " said Gregg - Schroeder .
" There 's this attitude that if you pray harder , you 'll be able to pull yourself out of it .
I 've gone to funerals of people who were told to just pray to Jesus and stop taking your meds . "
Religion can also exacerbate depression in individuals , like homosexuals , who have made life choices that run against their church 's rules .
" When there 's a mismatch between one 's religion and one 's characteristics , it 's very difficult , " said Suzanne Lechner , research assistant professor of psychiatry and psychology at Miller school of medicine Miami .
" They are holding two different beliefs in their head : ' I 'm a sinner , but this is who I am . ' "
Spiritual Prescription
However , for those people with supportive denominations and a strong , inner connection to their faith , their religion may help to heal their mental disorders .
Indeed , the majority of studies show religious folks fare better than non-religious ones .
" Depression patients with a strong , intrinsic , religious belief -- it holds their life together , " said Dr. Harold Koenig , professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center .
" These people do better . "
In a study that examined 1,000 patients over a six - month period , Koenig found that religious depression patients recovered from the depression faster than those who were non-religious .
But researchers say that just being outwardly religious -- going to church , synagogue , or Sunday school -- does n't help people battle depression .
They also need an internal and personal connection to their faith .
Monika Ardelt , a sociology professor at the University of Florida , notes that with end - of - life patients , those who were just socially religious were n't better off -- in fact , " it 's worse than if you never had any religion at all . "
Ardelt said this might be due to haunting questions ( Was I a good enough Catholic ? " ; " Do I really believe in heaven ? " ) , that neither strong believers nor atheists worry about at the end of life .
In order to get the full benefits of faith , researchers note that one needs to adhere to a regimen of outward activity and inward connection .
" A person has to [ also ] be engaged in a religious community , attending religious services once a week or more , reading a scriptures at least three times a week and praying once a day , " said Koenig .
" If they are doing that , they have a greater than 50 percent increase in speed of depression recovery . "
It may sound like a complicated prescription -- intense inner beliefs and constant outer activity , but the benefits seem to be real .
A Blessing for the Brain
Non- religious folks may ask why faith works so well .
" Worship provides social support , and it does help , " said Murphy .
" [ It also ] provides individual role models ; [ people ] turn to someone like Job , God loves Job and he got through it , Christians look at Jesus , see what Jesus went through , so there 's a divine social support system . "
Michael Willborn of Durham , N.C. , fervently believes that his Christian faith got him through his depression .
" If you do n't have a relationship with Christ can you be depressed ?
Yes you can .
Can you manage ?
I do n't see how people do it without Christ , " he said .
Williams agrees , saying religion was an invaluable resource during her depression .
" Hearing from God , in terms of Him saying ' you are somebody , I will not leave you alone ' -- I really believed that . "
Williams said .
" I was n't saying , 'oh , my goodness … it will never pass . '
You have a light at the end of the tunnel -- it may be far , and it may flicker , but it 's there . "
So , should the depressed run out and get some religion ?
Doctors and counselors say it 's up to the patient .
" I really think it 's a matching process , " said Lechner .
" For people who are religiously inclined to begin with , it can be clinically enormously helpful , I 'm [ not ] going to recommend necessarily to someone who 's not that interested in talking about God or getting involved in organized religion .
As a clinician , you want to give them as many techniques to cope as they can , and I consider religion in that bag . "
Cartoon do not usually make for legal doctrine , but then again most employers can recognize a joke .
The managers of Catfish Bend Casino , however , seemed to lack an sense of humor or sense of perspective .
They fired Dave Steward , a former security supervisor , for simply posting a Dilbert cartoon — a termination found by a judge to be without cause .
Steward thought that people needed to be cheered up at the casino with a slew of firings planned for the workforce .
So he posted a Dilbert cartoon on the bulletin board .
In the strip , Dilbert and another character have this exchange :
“ Why does it seem as if most of the decisions in my workplace are made by drunken lemurs ? ”
“ Decisions are made by people who have time , not people who have talent . ”
“ Why are talented people so busy ? ” “ They ’re fixing the problems made by people who have time . ”
Pretty funny .
However , the management of the Catfish Bend Casino also so insecure that they took immediate offense and fired Steward for not being a “ team player . ”
What is most astonishing is not just that these managers would take such a facially moronic action over a cartoon , but ( rather than backtracking in the face of public outcry ) they actually litigated the case to defend their lack of humor .
The casino ’s human resources director , Steve Morley , testified how “ upper management ” was offended and demanded retribution over the cartoon : “ Basically , he was accusing the decision - makers of being drunken lemurs . ”
It turns out that this was an insult to drunken lemurs .
Administrative Law Judge Lynette Donner ruled with Steward , finding that his posting was “ a good - faith error in judgment , ” not intentional misbehavior .
Moreover , the creator of Dilbert Scott Adams is now doing a series in the cartoon strip on the case .
All over a cartoon and “ upper management ” without a modicum of humor .
It appears that the old adage that the fish rots from the head down at the humor challenged management of the Catfish Bend Casino .

~ sorto '
I have no Torrent clients or other file - sharing software .
I do have a consulting business that require me to create reports that are often very large ( 15 to 40 MB ) .
PDFs .
Because the size is too large for email attachments , I upload the reports to one of my web servers via FTP or SSH depending upon the file , the server and the confidentiality required .
Both with my Business Comcast account and my home account , I have seen Comcast throttle uploads ( and sometimes downloads ) .
With my FTP client , I can see the upload begin where it should : at 1 to 1.3 Mbps ... a few seconds , it will gradually begin to drop ... to 800 K , then 500K and after 30 seconds to a minute , it will stabilize somewhere between 150 K and 300K .
A few minutes ago , it took me 25 minutes to upload a 23MB file ...
Hmmm , 1 Mbits / MINUTE !
So , they 're actually giving me 1/60 of the bandwidth that they are charging me for .
I smell lawsuit .
In general , the larger the file , the slower the upload .
Files less than 10 MB tend to have less throttling , and those below 5 MB usually have none .
The throttling does not seem to discriminate among different file types .
( .exe , .avi , .jpg , .pdf etc )
Traceroutes to my servers ( one hosted less than 5 miles away and other in Ohio ) show the first hop beyond the router is asterisked out and times out .
I assume the throttling begins at that node .
These are hosted servers , with no throttling , giant bandwidth and I 'm paying for massive gigabytes of throughputs .
I 've prepared a video of the throttling using Camtasia and will be producing a YouTube video of the sordid mess .

Sonoma , CA lperdue Member well , it 's a contractual sort of thing .
They promise one thing and they deliver another .
The data is very clear that the bandwidth is there and they 're throttling it ...
They 've also made representations that prompted me to rely on those representations ... to the detriment of my business .
Those both fall into tort category which does offer me grounds .
I will probably bring this in Small Claims court which evens the playing field .
Sure it limits me to $ 7,500 PER INFRACTION but that 's better than allowing them to escape entirely .
Plus there are class action lawsuits already filed .
And I do n't think they -- or the FCC and the FTC -- will be happy with the suit or the YouTube video .

lperdue ,
On the Comcast Business 8 M bps / 1 M bps plan , your subscribed upload speeds should result in throughput of about 125 KB/s ( minus some protocol overhead ) .
Please remember that 125 KB/s = 1 Mbps .
Having been with Comcast for a long time , I know that they do overprovision their modems , so I 'm not surprised that you settle out at over 150 KB/s .
The reason that you get a boost up to 1 MB/s upload ( 8 Mbps upload ) for a while is a feature called PowerBoost .

Hobgoblin : I 'll be posting the video of a dozen sessions showing the throttling in action .
Just got to find time to edit down for YouTube length .
And " Up to " legally must approximate the touted speeds , otherwise it becomes false and deceptive advertising .
15 or 2 OK is a loooooong way from 150K .
And I 've never even seen CLOSE to the " up to " except for the first few seconds of a transfer before the throttling chokes it back by 90 %

Okay - I looked at the JPG .
Let 's see if we can strengthen it .
This wo n't get you to " proof , " but it does make for better evidence .
1 . Can you demonstrate that the destination server can accept uploads at that speed ?
2 . You said before that you have both home and business accounts .
Which account involves this JPG -- more importantly , what are its purchased speeds ?
Does it include PowerBoost uploads ?
( note .
If it does include Powerboost uploads , this would explain why the speed falls off from the starting higher speed .
Now the concern becomes why are both speeds so low ? )
3 . On that computer , have you performed the " tweaks " test here at DSLReports with a clean result ?
4 . Is it possible to take the same computer , files , etc.. to a non-Comcast connection and repeat the test in order to compare the results ?
5 . Have you exhausted the Tech Support resource such that they 're sure there is n't a technical problem ?

Anyway , while I was cooking , I uploaded the following which shows the raw video of the throttling process :
»ideaworx.com/home-comcas ··· pets.avi
It needs editing ( as I said previously ) and has about a dozen sessions .
The first is like 3 minutes ... the rest are closer to 30 sec .
What they show ( look in the lower , right hand corner under " speed " ) is the transfer starting at the higher speed and then dropping shortly afterwards .
I have another .avi on my office computer that shows the same pattern .
I 've had Comcast to both locations three times .
The last time I called they said they would charge me $ 19.95 to have someone come out .
I have performed the tweaks test .
I 'm good on that .
Both my hosting services are pissed and will give me an affidavit on the minimum 12 Mbits / sec I can have if I can get that connection .
I do not have a way to test on a non-comcast connection .
Wish I did .
Sorry to be gone so long ... had to make dinner ...

If Comcast is having undue influence on FTP uploads , a VPN will keep them from being able to detect the protocol you are using .
I would also like to suggest that you hit the " hey mods " button and perhaps get this Topic broken out for some additional opinions .
I looked at your recording and I can't explain what I 'm seeing .
It 's not PowerBoost ( that would stay high for a while , then drop abruptly -- your speed slows very gradually by comparison .
It is n't related to abuse / limits / caps .
By sticking it in here , I 'm afraid that you 're limiting its exposure and people who could help are not seeing it .
There are several companies that sell VPN services .
Most are marketed to travelers who frequently use hotspots in public places .
One is called www.hotspotvpn.com -- which I only mention because it comes up first in Google when I search on those two terms .
You might also search the terms anonymous VPN -- since Comcast et. al. has declared war on some of its users , such services have become popular .

Does both the SFTP and FTP get throttled or only FTP ?
SSH or SFTP is known as the poor man's VPN .
Comcast will not know what you are doing with the SSH connection .
You could , for example , try downloading a file before uploading using the same session and see if that makes a difference with the throttling .
edit : Security statement : I would use SFTP over FTP when given a choice because your account login information ( and password ) is sent in the clear when using FTP .
Not so with SFTP .
edit2 : As a point of reference , I went to a local Panera ( free WiFi ) and used SFTP ( on port 443 ) to transfer a large file to my laptop from my home Comcast machine .
It uploaded the file at a fairly constant 175k Byte / second ( I have blast 16/2 service .
The port 443 is how I have my home sshd daemon set up .
So , client sftp is " sftp - o port=443 name@xx.xx.xx.xx " .
From reading your first post , it appears that you can upload your files using SFTP ( SSH file transfer ) .

Sonoma , CA lperdue Member After raising hell on this DSLReports forum yesterday , a near - miracle happened sometime while I was sleeping .
This morning , I 'm getting uploads at about 300 Kbps ( .3 Mbps ) at both home and office .
FTP and SSH are the same .
The bandwidth is also no longer showing the gradual throttling back of the bandwidth shown in the video .
While this upload speed is less than half the bandwidth I 'm paying for at home and 1/5 of what I 'm supposed to get at the office , it is a surprising improvement .
I must assume that someone from Comcast monitors this .
Yes , I do understand that Comcast hides behind a speed limit technicality that amounts to " up to what we tout so loudly in our advertising . "
However , " up to " should not mean , " never will get there . "
Approaching the touted bandwidth does not mean _never_ getting past 20 to 50 % of what the customer has been led to expect and what the customer is paying for .
That , folks , is false and deceptive advertising .
So , as of this morning , I _still_ have a crappy connection .
But , nevertheless , it 's better than the sluggish , near - dial - up speeds that crippled me for the past weeks .
It still fails to deliver anything close to promised and that 's a contractual violation .
Stay tuned .
I 'm still headed for court so a judge can decide what " up to " reasonably means in a court of law .

No , not an employee or affiliated in any way .
I am a former comcast customer , but no longer .
I used to have their business 6.0/768 business connection in California before I moved to the east coast .

Thanks for that .
I had the connection to your server clocked at 330 Kbps -- about 2.64 Mbps ... I uploaded the same file to my own server , just afterwards at 360 KBps ... 2.88 Mbps ...
Both were , obviously , excellent .
I 'd be a happy camper if this were to continue .
But until today , everything was consistently throttled .
And now , only now , am I getting the bandwidth I 've paid for .
At least here at my office .
We 'll see what happens .
Stay tuned .

Advertisement A violinist who left his 285 - year - old instrument in the back of a New York cab has played a concert to thank the driver who returned it to him .
Philippe Quint gave a private 30 - minute performance on Tuesday in the taxi waiting area at Newark Liberty International Airport .
He left his violin , a 1723 Kiesewetter Stradivarius , in a taxi on the way back from the airport last month .
The driver , Mohamed Khalil , got in touch the next day to return it .
" I can not describe it in words , the feeling that I was going through at the time .
I was frantically looking for the violin that whole morning , " Mr Quint said .
After leaving it in the taxi on his return from a performance in Dallas , Mr Quint rang the police and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey .
The following day Mr Khalil was put in touch with Mr Quint , and soon the violin was returned .
" He just saw it in the back seat there .
He had no idea how priceless this instrument was , " Mr Quint said .
Reward Mohamed Khalil , who was born in Egypt , was given a reward of $ 100 ( £ 50 ) by Mr Quint , and was also presented with a medal from the City of Newark .
In addition to the airport performance , he and his family are also being given tickets to Mr Quint 's next New York performance , at Carnegie Hall in September .
The violin was made by the Italian Antonio Stradivari , and then owned by the 18th - Century German composer and violinist Christophe Kiesewetter .
It has been valued at $ 4 m ( £ 2 m ) .
In 2006 the Stradivari Society arranged a loan of the instrument from its current owners , Clement and Karen Arrison , to Mr Quint , who has been nominated for a Grammy award .

China quake death toll rises above 8,700
CHENGDU , China -
A powerful earthquake toppled buildings , schools and a chemical plant Monday in central China , killing more than 8,700 people and trapping untold numbers in mounds of concrete , steel and earth in the worst quake in three decades .
The 7.9 - magnitude quake devastated a region of small cities and towns set amid steep hills north of Sichuan 's provincial capital of Chengdu .
Striking in midafternoon , it emptied office buildings across the country in Beijing and could be felt as far away as Vietnam .
The 7.9 - magnitude quake devastated a region of small cities and towns set amid steep hills north of 's provincial capital of .
Striking in midafternoon , it emptied office buildings across the country inand could be felt as far away as
Snippets from state media and photos posted on the Internet underscored the immense scale of the devastation .
In the town of Juyuan , south of the epicenter , a three - story high school collapsed , burying as many as 900 students and killing at least 50 , Xinhua said .
Photos showed people using cranes , mechanical hoists and their hands to remove slabs of concrete and steel .
Buried teenagers struggling to break free from the rubble , " while others were crying out for help , " the official Xinhua news agency said .
Families waited in the rain near the wreckage as rescuers wrote the names of the dead on a blackboard , Xinhua said .
The earthquake hit one of the last homes of the giant panda at the Wolong Nature Reserve and panda breeding center , in Wenchuan county , which remained out of contact , Xinhua said .
In Chengdu , it crashed telephone networks and hours later left parts of the city of 10 million in darkness .
" We can't get to sleep .
We 're afraid of the earthquake .
We 're afraid of all the shaking , " said 52 - year - old factory worker Huang Ju , who took her ailing , elderly mother out of the Jinjiang District People 's Hospital .
Outside , Huang sat in a wheelchair wrapped in blankets while her mother , who was ill , slept in a hospital bed next to her .
Xinhua reported 8,533 people died in Sichuan alone and 216 others in three other provinces and the mega-city of Chongqing .
Worst affected were four counties including the quake 's epicenter in Wenchuan , 60 miles northwest of Chengdu .
Landslides left roads impassable Tuesday , causing the government to order soldiers into the area on foot , state television said , and heavy rain prevented four military helicopters from landing .
Wenchuan 's Communist Party secretary appealed for air drops of tents , food and medicine .
" We also need medical workers to save the injured people here , " Xinhua quoted Wang Bin as telling other officials who reached him by phone .
To the east , in Beichuan county , 80 percent of the buildings fell , and 10,000 people were injured , aside from 3,000 to 5,000 dead , Xinhua said .
State media said two chemical plants in an industrial zone of the city of Shifang collapsed , burying hundreds of people and spilling more than 80 tons of toxic liquid ammonia .
Though slow to release information at first , the government and its state media ramped up quickly .
Nearly 20,000 soldiers , police and reservists were sent to the disaster area .
Disasters always pose a test for the communist government , whose mandate rests heavily on maintaining order , delivering economic growth , and providing relief in emergencies .
Pressure for a rapid response was particularly intense this year , with the government already grappling with public discontent over high inflation and a widespread uprising among Tibetans in western China while trying to prepare for the Aug.
8 - 24 Beijing Olympics .
" I am particularly saddened by the number of students and children affected by this tragedy , " President Bush said in a statement .
International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge sent his condolences to President Hu Jintao , adding : " The Olympic Movement is at your side , especially during these difficult moments .
Our thoughts are with you . "
Premier Wen Jiabao , a geologist by training , called the quake " a major geological disaster , " and traveled to the disaster area to oversee rescue and relief operations .
" Hang on a bit longer .
The troops are rescuing you , " Wen shouted to people buried in the Traditional Medicine Hospital in the city of Dujiangyan , on the road to Wenchuan , in comments broadcast by CCTV .
" As long as there was a slightest hope , we should make our effort a hundred times and we will never relax , " he said outside the collapsed school in Juyuan .
The quake was the deadliest since one in 1976 in the city of Tangshan near Beijing that killed 240,000 — although some reports say as many as 655,000 perished — the most devastating in modern history .
A 1933 quake near where Monday 's struck killed at least 9,000 , according to geologists .
Monday 's quake occurred on a fault where South Asia pushes against the Eurasian land mass , smashing the Sichuan plain into mountains leading to the Tibetan highlands — near communities that held sometimes violent protests of Chinese rule in mid-March .
Much of the area has been closed to foreign media and travelers since then , compounding the difficulties of getting information .
Roads north from Chengdu to the disaster area were sealed off early Tuesday to all but emergency convoys .
In Chengdu , the region 's commercial center , the airport closed for seven hours , reopening only for emergency and a few outbound flights .
A major railway line to the northeast was ruptured , stranding about 10,000 passengers , Xinhua said .
Although most of the power had been restored by nightfall , phone and Internet service was spotty and some neighborhoods remained without power and water .
Nervous residents spent the night outside , some playing cards or heading to the suburbs .
State media , citing the Sichuan seismology bureau , reported 313 aftershocks .
" Traffic jams , no running water , power outs , everyone sitting in the streets , patients evacuated from hospitals sitting outside and waiting , " said Ronen Medzini , an Israeli student in Chengdu , via text message .
When it hit shortly before 2:30 p.m. , the quake rumbled for nearly three minutes , witnesses said , driving people into the streets in panic .
" It was really scary to be on the 26th floor in something like that , " said Tom Weller , a 49 - year - old American oil and gas consultant staying at the Holiday Inn .
" You had to hold on to something like that or you 'd fall over .
It shook for so long and so violently , you wondered how long the building would be able to stand this . "
While most buildings in the city held up , those in the countryside tumbled .
On the outskirts of Chongqing , a school collapsed , killing at least five people .
Residents said teachers kept the children inside , thinking it was safer .
The city of Mianyang ordered all able - bodied males under 50 to take water and tools and walk or drive to Beichuan , where most of the buildings had collapsed .
State TV broadcast tips for anyone trapped in the earthquake .
" If you 're buried , keep calm and conserve your energy .
Seek water and food , and wait patiently for rescue , " CCTV said .
Although initially measured at 7.8 magnitude , the U.S. Geological Survey later revised its assessment of the quake to 7.9 .
Its depth — about six miles below the surface , according to the USGS — gave the tremor such wide impact , geologists said .
The earthquake also rattled buildings in Beijing , 930 miles to the north , causing evacuations of office towers .
People ran screaming into the streets in other cities , where many residents said they had never felt an earthquake .
In Beijing , where hundreds of thousands of foreign visitors are expected for the Olympics , stadiums , arenas and other venues for the games were undamaged .
Li Jiulin , a top engineer on the 91,000 - seat National Stadium — known as the Bird's Nest and the jewel of the Olympics — was conducting a site inspection when the quake struck .
He told reporters the building was designed to withstand a 8.0 quake .
" The Olympic venues were not affected by the earthquake , " said Sun Weide , a spokesman for the Beijing organizing committee .
" We considered earthquakes when building those venues . "
Some 660 miles to the east in Anhui province , chandeliers swayed in the lobby of the Buckingham Palace Hotel .
" We 've never felt anything like this our whole lives , " said a hotel employee surnamed Zhu .
The massive Three Gorges dam , the world 's largest about 350 miles to the east of the epicenter , was not affected , according to the information office of State Council Three Gorges Construction Committee .
The area around the enormous dam remains increasingly precarious as rising waters in the reservoir have led to landslides .
Premier Wen , after arriving in Chengdu , traveled to Dujiangyan , near the collapsed high school .
On his plane , he appealed for people to rally together .
" This is an especially challenging task , " state TV showed Wen saying , reading from a statement .
" In the face of the disaster , what 's most important is calmness , confidence , courage and powerful command . "
The number of people dying in police car accidents has more than tripled in four years , with a record 44 pursuit deaths last year compared to nine in 1997 / 98 .
Some high - profile cases have dominated the headlines , including Sir Paul McCartney 's wife Heather Mills and newsreader Sheena Macdonald .
Both suffered serious injuries in accidents involving police vehicles .
Ms Macdonald 's high profile helped her campaign for improvements in training .
She was in a coma for more than 72 hours after being struck by a police car in Islington , north London , in February 1999 .
Her injuries included a major fracture to the upper face and jawbone and serious brain injuries .
She had to undergo facial surgery during which a titanium staple was inserted into her head .
The newsreader was devastated when the driver was acquitted of careless driving .
She said : " I certainly think that driving fast is part of the police driving culture .
Speed apparently matters to them very much .
" These are young boys driving what are in effect lethal weapons , two tons of steel , at speed
" Twenty , 30 miles an hour is actually a colossal speed to be going at if you hit somebody . "
' Waste of money '
Heather Mills , who recently married Sir Paul , became a household name after using her disability to bring attention to others she considered less fortunate than herself .
After an accident involving a police motorcycle in 1993 she suffered crushed ribs , a punctured lung , and multiple fractures of the pelvis and the loss of her left leg below the knee .
PC Simon Osbourne , the motorcyclist involved , was cleared of careless driving and described Ms Mills ' £ 200,000 compensation award as " a waste of taxpayers ' money " .
Things show no sign of improving , only last week a 29 - year - old female pedestrian in Shooters Hill , south London , was killed .
In March an eight - year - old boy from Doncaster suffered head injuries after being hit by a police car on an emergency call .
And in October of last year an 80 - year - old woman from west London was also seriously injured .
The revelations in Scott McClellan ’s new book are not new to those who have been following the Bush Administration from the outset .
The question is why was it news to McClellan ?
As press secretary , should n’t he , at least once in a while , have read some of the news coming from outside of the mainstream , even if it was considered to be a left - wing perspective ?
Does the word “ press ” in his title have no meaning ?
Was he merely a " secretary " taking dictation ?
Regardless of the labels foisted upon the blogs and news outlets outside of the mainstream , McClellan has now confirmed what these outlets already reported and he consistently and vehemently denied .
McClellan , a former insider , an integral part of the Bush A team , a man who was viewed by the President as a friend , claims that he was misled , and by the way , so was the President .
And further , it was of course the fault of the press who did n’t ask tough enough questions and did n’t question the assumptions that he himself presented as bullet - proof facts .
This accusation , from the press secretary who often would n’t even take questions from the White House press corps , dismissing them as irrelevant , is as hollow as the talking points McClellan happily repeated for the Administration week after week .
The mainstream media continue their meek mea culpa and continue to repeat the same talking points : if we knew then what we know now , yadda yadda , yadda .
Rather than fill the media chatter with more minutia about who manipulated the press and by how much , I suggest a different route :
The revelations in McClellan ’s book mandate a new look at impeachment .
With eight months to go , Bush & Co. still has time to do more damage : Iran has yet to be “ conquered , ” the FEC has yet to be further corrupted , FISA still hangs like a chad waiting for the next tortured rationale .
While the Republicans are fighting for retroactive immunity for their favorite lobbyists , we should not be granting retroactive immunity to Bush , Cheney and the rest of the gang who brought us endless war , endless debt , broken policies , broken government , and everything but compassion , never mind the “ conservative ” part .
While there might be enough evidence and support to charge Bush &
Co with war crimes after they leave office , the likelihood of that happening is nil .
It ’s simply not going to happen , no matter what anyone promises now and no matter who ’s in office .
Even Obama ( a Constitutional scholar in his own right ) , should he be elected , will as his first order of business move to bring the country together , a reconciliation of sorts .
He will not allow a political environment that will set in action a Republican faction that will automatically oppose him , accuse him and the Democrats ( no matter how many new seats they win ) of being vindictive , and noisily block everything on his agenda .
The time to take action is now , while the charges are still fresh and there ’s time to call witnesses and bring the House down , if needed .
If Congress gets caught up with hearings at the expense of other business , so what ?
What is more important than the accountability of an Administration run amok ?
Besides , what has Congress done lately that has not been bogged down ?
Everything Congress does these days is a fight , so why not this fight ?
Bush has historically low ratings and Congress is even worse .
Congress will not lose on this account , although that seems to be how they perceive it .
At this point on the calendar , the Democrats can't be accused of political payback or of launching a vendetta for Clinton .
It 's not about regime change ; it 's about accountability .
We do n’t have to revisit all the reasons for impeachment here ; they ’ve been out there for years .
Below are a few web cites that give all the technical details for articles of impeachment .
This is not an all - inclusive list ; there are plenty of others .

If Congress were actually tied up with impeachment hearings and Bush & Co. had to spend their time defending themselves , would they spend their political capital attacking Iran ?
It 's a lot less likely than if they are left to their own devices and continue to spend their capital on the election , perhaps including an October surprise to bolster their chances of an incumbency .
If by some miracle , the next Congress actually decided to try Bush & Co for war crimes , there are still a host of issues that are considered impeachable offenses but may not be prosecutable crimes : Lying / misleading the public about the rationale for war while reprehensible and treasonous is n’t a criminal offense .
Yes , lying under oath is a crime but going on national television and lying is not on the books .
McClellan ’s claim , and it will be Bush ’s defense should there ever be an impeachment hearing on this matter , is that the President was mislead by his advisors ( including Cheney ) and he did n’t know the truth .
McClellan clearly saw his own role as defending the President , even if it meant keeping himself insulated .
We know that those in the administration who offered alternative views were dismissed or fired .
McClellan 's good soldier did not include putting himself in the line of fire , but it does make it harder to reconcile the “ I did n’t know about it ” defense .
Leading the country to war on the basis of misleading information is at best incompetence .
While incompetence , in and of itself is n’t impeachable , the sum total of all the Bush messes that will be left behind are wrapped in gross incompetence and incomprehensible negligence - high crimes and misdemeanors .
In a word , they are impeachable offenses .
But they are not necessarily criminal offenses that can be proved in court , regardless of who appointed the presiding judge .
Whether or not Bush was misled , as President he had / has the ultimate responsibility .
If he knew what he was saying was untrue , he lied ; if he did n’t know it was untrue , he was n't doing his job .
And while we can impeach a president for not doing his job , we ca n’t prosecute him for it – there ’s no law against not doing one ’s job well .
The job performance review is at the ballot box or at the hands of the impeachment process .
The market forces are usually assumed to take care of people who do n’t do their jobs ; in the real world they get fired .
But in the world of Republican spin , misleading / lying , and propaganda strategies , they go on to live cushy lives , held up as heroes by their right - wing loyalists , hosting radio shows , lobbying for corporate clients , commanding big speaker fees , all while collecting pensions and health care benefits at the public till ; they continue to believe that they are ennobled and entitled .
Let ’s be clear .
The window of opportunity is short .
After January , Bush and his cohorts will walk out of that oval office never to be called to the carpet .
The next administration will have to play clean up and we the people will suffer the effects for a very long time .
But the worst effect will be the legacy of a government that is not accountable to its people , a government that can lie as easily as it can tell the truth without suffering any consequences , a government that can substitute fiction for fact without it being duly noted on page 1 of every major news outlet , a government that can spend all of its time on electioneering instead of on policy - making while pretending to be busy at work for the people , a government that can appoint cronies that turn a functioning civil service into a political machine and then claim government does n't work – all while a passive electorate and cowed Congress stand by and watch as a bunch of thugs dictates their own policy and quell dissent .
There are a lot of skeletons buried under the lawn of the Bush White House .
Right now only Barney is digging , and he ’ll never bite the hand that feeds him .
The only path to digging for the truth is impeachment .
These ideas are stunningly brilliant .
It is the ultimate smack in the face to a label hungry , ' designer ' dependent , utterly pretentious society .
Tobias has taken the Vreeland maxim , " Elegance is refusal " to a dazzling new peak .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup Poll Daily tracking for April 10 - 12 shows Barack Obama continuing to hold a solid lead over Hillary Clinton in national Democratic voters ' support for the presidential nomination , 50 % to 41 % .
The latest news in the campaign focuses on remarks Obama made , first reported on Friday , about working class and rural voters being " bitter " about the economy .
Clinton and John McCain have seized on the remarks .
Initial indications are that the controversial remarks have not yet hurt Obama -- his 9 - percentage point lead in the current results ( based on March 10 - 12 polling ) is right in line with the average 8.5 - point lead he held in the prior six days ' tracking results .
Also , his lead in the current results shows a slight improvement from his 7 - point advantage in March 9 - 11 polling .
As the story gains momentum in the press , the coming days ' tracking results will measure its ultimate impact .
The controversy comes just as Obama has established himself as the leader in Democratic voters ' preferences for the nomination , holding a statistically significant lead in each of the past seven days ' tracking results .
Prior to that , he had only managed to hold a significant lead in as many as four consecutive days ' results , doing this in late March .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
The results of the general election trial heats are the same as in previous days , with Obama ahead of McCain 46 % to 43 % and Clinton up on McCain 46 % to 45 % .
Though both results are within the poll 's margin of error , the fact that the Democrats ' advantages have held up for several days suggests a high probability that they actually hold a lead in the underlying population of registered voters .

9 Bird Shit Facials
The Geisha facial is an ancient beauty secret so awesome , it 's been brought back to the present so modern women can experience it .
Experience what , you ask ?
Why , having the shit of a nightingale spackled on their face , of course .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement Guanine is a chemical that does wonders for the complexion and poop is a wicked source of it ( hence the word guano ) .
How anyone discovered the value of a face smeared in bird poop is unclear , but apparently it 's been around long enough that Japanese kabuki performers and Geisha used to swear by it .
And now you too can pay about $ 180 to have a stranger put shit on your face on purpose .
On purpose .
Naturally , bird shit is n't for everyone .
So thank God for ingenuity , as some crafty lady named Diane Irons has assured everyone that kitty litter is pretty much the exact same stuff they 'll put on your face at a regular spa .
So really all you need to do to acquire the ingredients for the perfect complexion is train your pet bird to shit in the litter box .

8 Treating Bad Breath With Charcoal Fresh breath is a valuable commodity .
As any gum commercial will show you , it 's the key to picking up women and not smelling like you just ate the ass out of a dead bear .
These things are important .
And not just to us , but to our ancestors .
While modern oral hygiene offers many wonderful things like toothpaste with stripes of other toothpaste in it and minty dental floss , back in the day they had to be a little more creative .
Sure , fingers and twigs made great toothbrushes , but what was going to remove that colon smell from your food hole ?
Charcoal , of course .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement Ancient Romans were some of the first to use charcoal while other cultures used burnt sticks to help reduce stank , and there is some precedent for that as it will filter odor .
In the 1800s , when young ladies were looking to improve their own stink they borrowed this technique and adapted it to simply sucking or chewing lumps of charcoal , leaving them minty fresh and black - toothed .
Some of you may recall the powerful evidence in 2004 that George W. Bush was cheating in the debates by wearing an earpiece .
The New York Times famously ( well , at least somewhat famously ) documented the evidence and then refused to print it because it might have had an effect on the election .
A few of you may be aware of the extensive evidence that Bush has worn an earpiece and been prompted with answers at speaking events for the past three years .
This background is reason to believe a candidate might cheat and that it is technologically feasible .
It is also reason to believe the media would kill the story .
It is not reason to know that Mitt Romney cheated in the MSNBC debate this week .
But there are other good reasons to believe that he did .
In case you have n't heard about this at all , during the debate , Tim Russert asked Mitt Romney a question , then everyone watching heard a whispered voice say " he raised taxes . "
Then Romney answered the question by saying " I 'm not going to raise taxes . "
Watch the short video clip .
It looked like Romney was being prompted .
I do n't think anyone ever imagined that the noise in Romney 's tiny hidden earpiece ( assuming he had one ) could have been so loud as to be heard on Romney 's microphone without leaving the candidate writhing on the floor in pain .
If that 's what happened , I 'm inclined to vote for the man .
The theory is that somehow the transmission to Romney from his assistant got picked up .
I do n't know how this could have happened , and I doubt that Romney 's assitant sat near an open-mic intended for audience questions .
But I do know that Bush wore that box on his back in order to try to avoid something like this happening .
Now , Andrew Sullivan at the Atlantic has posted a comment from one of his readers , which I cannot confirm , that reads :
" Some people have enhanced the first 'he raised taxes ' whisper using audio technology and have discovered that there was actually more to it than just ' he raised taxes ' .
They 've disconvered [ sic ] that more can be heard : ' He raised taxes , I 'm not gonna ...'.
Listen to the full enhanced audio yourself .
Go out and get a tape and enhance it yourself if you think this is wrong . "
Clearly that needs to be investigated .
But even without that , there is good reason to believe that Romney was prompted .
The leading you 're - a - bunch - of - conspiracy - nuts explanation yesterday was that it was OBVIOUSLY one of Russert 's staffers prompting HIM .
But the whisper begins too early for that to make sense .
And two NBC staffers , when they heard the whisper , and when they read comments about it from viewers on the MSNBC blog , Emailed a third staffer a blog post wondering what it was .
The third staffer posted this and then later deleted it .
If Russert was getting prompts through an earpiece , these people would probably have known it and not blogged it .
On the other hand , MSNBC 's efforts to kill the story , including the deletion of the blog post and the readers ' comments ( which I suspect was directed by someone higher up ) would fit with covering up Russert 's cheating .
And in one version of the MSNBC blogger 's explanation for deleting the post , his colleagues never intended it to be posted .
The timing and the wording of the prompt ( especially if Sullivan 's reader is right ) do not make sense as a prompt for Russert .
But probably only a threat to Russert 's ego will motivate MSNBC to investigate Romney , so I 'm happy to keep that possibility out there .
Please tell all your friends it was a prompt for Russert , and call NBC to ask about it in those terms .
Sloppiness and possibly reflexive covering up do not tell us what is being covered up , but MSNBC originally gave Raw Story an explanation that explained nothing , saying Romney 's microphone was not working .
That 's funny : during the whisper , Romney 's lips are n't moving .
What difference would it have made in any way for his microphone to have been working or not working ?
Next MSNBC posted a new blog post acknowledging that people wanted to know what happened but not offering any explanation .
The post claimed that MSNBC did not know whose voice is heard whispering , and that MSNBC was reviewing tapes of each of the candidates in order to determine whether it was one of them .
This would tend to suggest that MSNBC does not think it was one of their staffers in a control room , and does not think it was one of their staffers feeding ideas to Russert .
( I 'm still unable to find the readers ' comments on this on the MSNBC blog , and if they were deleted the new post says nothing about restoring them . )
So , today the leading you 're - a - bunch - of - paranoid - whackos position is , of course , NOT that it was obviously a prompt for Russert .
Why ?
Because MSNBC says that 's not what it was .
Instead the leading position is something stranger than that , and it is the leading position because MSNBC says it 's what happened .
Having ruled out the possibility that one of the other candidates was whispering to himself , MSNBC added an update to its blog post concluding that someone in the audience must have been whispering near an open mic .
This is apparently based on nothing other than MSNBC 's inability to come up with any other explanation , other than the obvious one .
Nobody claims to be the whisperer .
Nobody claims to know why a mic was open then and not at other times .
There 's no substance to the theory .
It may , in fact , be true .
But , for now , it 's just a baseless theory , and a less probable one than that Romney was cheating .
MSNBC 's position now reads like a report on an election result that varies wildly from the exit polls .
Such a result ( if in the United States , abroad the opposite would be true ) clearly proves that the exit polls must have been wrong !
How do you know ?
Why , by ruling out the possibility that the discrepency was caused by Huckabee whispering to himself .
In case shame takes over and the latest MSNBC conclusion gets purged , here it is :
" After reviewing the tapes , NBC determined that an open mic picked up a whisper from the audience .
It is unclear who it is that says it , but it was not said by any of the candidates , was not heard in the hall and , more importantly , not heard by the candidates . "
How do we know it was not heard by the candidates ( not even the one who appears to hear it and repeat it ) ?
Why , because MCNBC tells us so .
And how can MSNBC possibly know that ?
At best ( and , I doubt this is even true ) they asked one or more of the candidates or their staff , and those candidates said they did n't hear it .

Back in my school days , February was an important month — not just because it included the eagerly - anticipated Valentine ’s Day , but because even though it was the shortest month of the year , it encompassed two holidays for which public schools were closed : Lincoln ’s Birthday ( February 12 ) and Washington ’s Birthday ( February 22 ) .
Two school - free days for the kids , two days off for working parents , and terrific bargains on bedding , linen , and towels at department store white sales .
What was n’t to like about February ?
Nowadays , though , many of us — whether we be employees or students — do n’t get any weekdays off at all in February , or we ’re offered a single holiday that falls on the third Monday in February and is neither Lincoln ’s nor Washington ’s Birthday but some hybrid known as “ Presidents ’ Day . ”
What happened to our traditional February holidays ?
And just what the heck are we commemorating on “ Presidents ’ Day ” ?
Some of us think we ’re observing George Washington ’s Birthday ( perpetually moved to more convenient Monday dates since 1971 ) , some of us think we ’re celebrating the combined birthdays of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln ( two formerly separate holidays smushed into one ) , and some of us think we ’re honoring the memory of all U.S. presidents past and present .
Which is it ?
Throughout the 19th century , George Washington was the towering figure of U.S. history to the American public .
In honor of the man who commanded the Continental Army and led the American colonies to victory in the Revolutionary War , served as first President of the United States of America , and earned the sobriquet “ The Father of Our Country , ” Washington ’s Birthday , February 22 , was celebrated with more patriotic fervor than any holiday save the Fourth of July .
Accordingly , the observance of Washington ’s Birthday was made official in 1885 when President Chester Alan Arthur signed a bill establishing it as a federal holiday .
( Washington was actually born on February 11 , 1732 , under the Julian calendar in effect at the time he was born , but his birth date is reckoned as February 22 under the Gregorian calendar which was adopted in 1752 . )
However , the seeds of confusion were sown in 1968 with the passage of a piece of legislation known as Uniform Holidays Bill , intended to create more three - day weekends for federal employees by moving the observance of three existing federal holidays ( Washington ’s Birthday , Memorial Day , and Veterans Day ) from fixed calendar dates to designated Mondays , and by establishing Columbus Day , also to be observed on a Monday , as a new federal holiday .
( Subsequent legislation enacted several years later eventually restored the observance of Veterans Day to November 11 . )
Under this act , from 1971 onwards the observance date of Washington ’s Birthday would be relocated from February 22 to the third Monday in February .
( Oddly enough , this change guaranteed that Washington ’s Birthday would never again be celebrated on his “ actual ” birthday of February 22 , as the third Monday in February cannot fall any later than February 21 . )
So far , so good .
The date of observance of Washington ’s Birthday might have been tinkered with a bit , but the holiday was still undeniably “ Washington ’s Birthday . ”
So what happened to Lincoln ’s Birthday ?
And whence came “ Presidents ’ Day ” ?
The concept of combining Washington ’s and Lincoln ’s birthdays into one holiday called “ President ’s Day ” was floated as far back as the early 1950s , as the New York Times noted in 1968 :
The first uniform Monday holiday plan was promulgated by NATO [ the National Association of Travel Organizations ] in the early 1950’s .
It called for combining Washington ’s and Lincoln ’s Birthdays into a single President ’s Day , to be celebrated the third Monday in February , and shifting Memorial Day to the fourth Monday in May , Independence Day to the first Monday in July and Veterans Day to the second Monday in November .
This initial effort met with sporadic success in a few states .
But after several years of attempting to get the individual states to adopt uniform Monday holidays , it became apparent that a Federal bill was needed to serve as an example for state action .
Although early efforts to implement a Uniform Holidays Bill in 1968 also proposed moving the observance of Washington ’s Birthday to the third Monday in February and renaming the holiday “ President ’s Day , ” the passed version of the bill provided only for the former .
The official designation of the federal holiday observed on the third Monday of February is , and always has been , Washington ’s Birthday :
This holiday is designated as “ Washington ’s Birthday ” in section 6103 ( a ) of title 5 of the United States Code , which is the law that specifies holidays for Federal employees .
Though other institutions such as state and local governments and private businesses may use other names , it is our policy to always refer to holidays by the names designated in the law .
President Nixon is frequently identified as the party responsible for changing Washington ’s Birthday into President ’s Day and fostering the notion that it is a day for commemorating all U.S. Presidents , a feat he supposedly achieved by issuing a proclamation on 21 February 1971 which declared the third Monday in February to be a “ holiday set aside to honor all presidents , even myself . ”
This claim stems not from fact , however , but from a newspaper spoof .
Actually , presidential records indicate that Nixon merely issued an Executive Order ( 11582 ) on 11 February 1971 defining the third Monday of February as a federal holiday , and the announcement of that Executive Order identified the day as “ Washington ’s Birthday . ”
Washington ’s Birthday has become Presidents ’ Day ( or President ’s Day , or even Presidents Day ; the usage is inconsistent ) for many of us because federal holidays technically apply only to persons employed by the federal government ( and the District of Columbia ) .
Individual state governments do not have to observe federal holidays — most of them generally do ( and most private employers and school districts follow suit ) , but federal and state holiday observances can differ .
For example , former Confederate states have observed several holidays not recognized at a federal level ( such as June 3 , Jefferson Davis Day ) , and controversial Arizona governor Ev Mecham drew headlines in 1987 when one of his first official acts upon inauguration was to rescind an executive order issued by the previous governor that had established the birthday of Martin Luther King , Jr. ( a federal holiday ) as an Arizona state holiday .
Although Lincoln ’s Birthday had never been designated as a federal holiday , it was observed as a state holiday in many parts of the country .
However , after additional federal holidays were created for Columbus Day and the Birthday of Martin Luther King , Jr. ( in 1971 and 1986 , respectively ) , some states dropped the observance of Lincoln ’s Birthday as a separate holiday in order to maintain a fixed number of paid holidays per year ( while other states had never observed Lincoln ’s Birthday in the first place ) .
As a result , we now have a hodgepodge of state holiday schedules in the USA : some states still observe Lincoln ’s and Washington ’s birthdays as separate holidays , some states observe only Washington ’s Birthday , some states commemorate both with a single Presidents ’
Day ( or Lincoln - Washington Day ) , and some states celebrate neither .
And there are odd exceptions such as Alabama , which designated the third Monday in February as a day commemorating both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson ( even though Jefferson was born in April ) .
A few states even moved their observances of Washington ’s Birthday , Lincoln ’s Birthday , and Presidents ’ Day to November or December in order to lengthen the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday periods without creating additional paid holidays .
An attempt to clear up some of this confusion at the federal level was made through the introduction of the ‘ Washington - Lincoln Recognition Act of 2001 ’ ( HR 420 ) to Congress in 2001 .
The bill proposed that “ the legal public holiday known as Washington ’s Birthday shall be referred to by that name and no other by all entities and officials of the United States Government ” and requested “ that the President issue a proclamation each year recognizing the anniversary of the birth of President Abraham Lincoln and calling upon the people of the United States to observe such anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities , ” but it failed to clear subcommittee and languished there without ever being voted upon .
( CNN ) --
At a time when gas prices are at an all - time high , Americans have curtailed their driving at a historic rate .
Americans are not driving as much as they did a year ago as gas prices skyrocket .
The Department of Transportation said figures from March show the steepest decrease in driving ever recorded .
Compared with March a year earlier , Americans drove an estimated 4.3 percent less -- that 's 11 billion fewer miles , the DOT 's Federal Highway Administration said Monday , calling it " the sharpest yearly drop for any month in FHWA history . "
Records have been kept since 1942 .
According to AAA , for the first time since 2002 , Americans said they were planning to drive less over the Memorial Day weekend than they did the year before .
Tracy and Adam Crews posted on iReport that their annual Memorial Day weekend has traditionally involved camping and fishing .
" Well , due to the continual rise in gas , we felt our only recourse was to nix the idea this year and stay home " in Jacksonville , Florida , they wrote .
Instead , the couple said they " decided to camp out in the backyard .
We set the tent up , just finished installing our above ground pool , and cleaned up the grill .
...
We have ourselves a campsite !
It 's been a blast ! "
Nakeisha Easterwood of Smyrna , Georgia , said with gas prices on the rise , she sometimes catches rides with friends , and does n't drive into town more than once a day .
" It 's crazy , " she said .
According to AAA , the national average price for a gallon of regular gas rose to a record $ 3.936 .
That compares with an average price per gallon of $ 3.23 last Memorial Day .
" With it being near $ 4 a gallon , you definitely have to drive slower and pick and choose when you 're going to do it , " said Steve Kahn of Roswell , Georgia , at a Memorial Day festival in Atlanta .
Some Americans have turned to public transportation .
Ridership increased by 2.1 percent in 2007 , in part because of rising gas prices , according to the American Public Transportation Association .
Americans took 10.3 billion trips on public transportation in 2007 , the highest level in 50 years , the group said .
The Energy Information Administration says gas consumption for the first three months of 2008 is estimated to be down about 0.6 percent from the same time period in 2007 .
For the summer season , gas consumption is expected to be down 0.4 percent from last year .

MEXICO CITY - Mexicans spent a whopping $ 2.58 billion in bribes in 2007 , some 42 percent more than they doled out just two years ago , according to a poll released Wednesday .
The survey , conducted by the nonprofit group Transparency Mexico , showed that 197 million bribes were paid nationwide in 2007 - compared to 115 million in 2005 .
That 's almost two for every living Mexican , given the country 's population of about 105 million .
Bribes ate up about 8 percent of family incomes here in 2007 , the study said .
" It has become a habit here in Mexico , and that makes me angry , " 30 - year - old law student Sarahi Sanchez said .
" It hurts , because Mexico is more than just its government .
Mexico is not all about corruption .
Mexico has art and culture and beauty . "
The poll found that while more people are giving out bribes , the average bribe was smaller : about $ 13 , compared to $ 17 in 2005 .
Smaller bribes include those shelled out to avoid traffic tickets or pay off informal " parking attendants , " private citizens who block off sections of public streets and force drivers to " tip " them for giving them a space .
The attendants , in turn , pay police for the right to operate .
The poll interviewed 16,000 people face - to - face throughout the country in December 2007 and had a margin of error of less than 1 percentage point .
Corruption is so rooted and pervasive in Mexican culture that many people see nothing wrong with it .
A continuum runs from tipping a waiter to bribing a politician , with no clear line separating what 's acceptable and what 's not .
For Rodolfo Guzman , bribes are the price of doing business .
The Mexico City bus driver hands out about 500 pesos ( $ 48 ) per year to cops so they turn a blind eye when he drops off and picks up passengers at places along the road that are not official bus stops .
The bribes run between 20 and 50 pesos ( $ 3.20 to $ 4.75 ) every time police catch him .
" The truth is , it is just easier that way , " Guzman said , noting that paying a traffic fine would be more costly and time consuming .
But the study also reveals Mexicans must pay bribes even when they 're not breaking the law .
Bribes move about 10 percent of all government transactions - including those to obtain construction licenses , vehicle inspection stickers and street - vending permits .
Among the top 10 most frequent bribes people reported paying were to city tanker trucks that deliver drinking water to homes in poorer neighborhoods .
Others paid to get their trash collected , their goods passed through customs and their cars out of police lots after they were towed .
Mexican authorities say part of the problem is that citizens do n't refuse to pay the bribes .
The government has run numerous ads encouraging Mexicans to report corruption .
That may be easier said than done .
The sixth most common type of bribe , according to the study ?
Money given to investigators to ensure they file crime reports .

A school has been forced to remove CCTV cameras they installed in the students ’ toilets after furious protests from pupils and parents .
Hundreds of outraged students petitioned against the cameras after they spotted them in the toilets and even refused to use the loos all day so they were not caught on CCTV .
Other children were kept at home by their families rather than expose themselves to the “ gross invasion of privacy ” .
The cameras were installed at Lipson Community College in Plymouth , Devon , which has 1,400 pupils .
Concerns were first raised when pupils returned from the week - long break on Tuesday and spotted the cameras .
Principal Steve Baker said contractors fitted them on the orders of another staff member , who did not have the measure approved by him or school governors .

POP
Sitting in his seat , a seat broad and broken
In , sprinkled with ashes
Pop switches channels , takes another
Shot of Seagrams , neat , and asks
What to do with me , a green young man
Who fails to consider the
Flim and flam of the world , since
Things have been easy for me ;
I stare hard at his face , a stare
That deflects off his brow ;
I ’m sure he ’s unaware of his
Dark , watery eyes , that
Glance in different directions ,
And his slow , unwelcome twitches ,
Fail to pass .
I listen , nod ,
Listen , open , till I cling to his pale ,
Beige T - shirt , yelling ,
Yelling in his ears , that hang
With heavy lobes , but he ’s still telling
His joke , so I ask why
He ’s so unhappy , to which he replies ...
But I do n’t care anymore , cause
He took too damn long , and from
Under my seat , I pull out the
Mirror I ’ve been saving ; I ’m laughing ,
Laughing loud , the blood rushing from his face
To mine , as he grows small ,
A spot in my brain , something
That may be squeezed out , like a
Watermelon seed between
Two fingers .
Pop takes another shot , neat ,
Points out the same amber
Stain on his shorts that I ’ve got on mine , and
Makes me smell his smell , coming
From me ; he switches channels , recites an old poem
He wrote before his mother died ,
Stands , shouts , and asks
For a hug , as I shrink , my
Arms barely reaching around
His thick , oily neck , and his broad back ; ’ cause
I see my face , framed within
Pop ’s black - framed glasses
And know he ’s laughing too .
UNDERGROUND
Under water grottos , caverns
Filled with apes
That eat figs .
Stepping on the figs
That the apes
Eat , they crunch .
The apes howl , bare
Their fangs , dance ,
Tumble in the
Rushing water ,
Musty , wet pelts
Glistening in the blue .

Playing a certain type of music can enhance the way wine tastes , research by psychologists suggests .
The Heriot Watt University study found people rated the change in taste by up to 60 % depending on the melody heard .
The researchers said cabernet sauvignon was most affected by " powerful and heavy " music , and chardonnay by " zingy and refreshing " sounds .
Professor Adrian North said the study could lead retailers to put music recommendations on their wine bottles .
The research involved 250 students at the university who were offered a free glass of wine in exchange for their views .
Brain theory
Four types of music were played - Carmina Burana by Orff ( " powerful and heavy " ) , Waltz of the Flowers from The Nutcracker by Tchaikovsky ( " subtle and refined " ) , Just Ca n't Get Enough by Nouvelle Vague ( " zingy and refreshing " ) and Slow Breakdown by Michael Brook ( " mellow and soft " )
The white wine was rated 40 % more zingy and refreshing when that music was played , but only 26 % more mellow and soft when music in that category was heard .
MUSIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Cabernet Sauvignon : All Along The Watchtower ( Jimi Hendrix ) , Honky Tonk Woman ( Rolling Stones ) , Live And Let Die ( Paul McCartney and Wings ) , Wo n't Get Fooled Again ( The Who ) Chardonnay : Atomic ( Blondie ) , Rock DJ ( Robbie Williams ) , What 's Love Got To Do With It ( Tina Turner ) , Spinning Around ( Kylie Minogue ) Syrah : Nessun Dorma ( Puccini ) , Orinoco Flow ( Enya ) , Chariots Of Fire ( Vangelis ) , Canon ( Johann Pachelbel ) Merlot : Sitting On The Dock Of The Bay ( Otis Redding ) , Easy ( Lionel Ritchie ) , Over The Rainbow ( Eva Cassidy ) , Heartbeats ( Jose Gonzalez ) Source : Montes wines
The red was altered 25 % by mellow and fresh music , yet 60 % by powerful and heavy music .
The results were put down to " cognitive priming theory " , where the music sets up the brain to respond to the wine in a certain way .
" Wine manufacturers could recommend that while drinking a certain wine , you should listen to a certain sort of music , " Prof North said .
The research was carried out for Chilean winemaker Aurelio Montes , who plays monastic chants to his maturing wines .
Mr Montes said : " It was therefore a natural extension to link with Heriot Watt and to scientifically determine the impact that music has on how wine tastes . "
Previously , Professor North conducted supermarket research which suggested people were five times more likely to buy French wine than German wine if accordion music was played in the background .
If an oompah band was played , the German product outsold the French by two to one .

We all have seen quirky one - off sculptures made from recycled materials but it is a decent bet that most designers do n’t think about the possibilities of creating lines of recycled furniture .
With so many materials going to waste in droves it seems a shame not to think big about how to give these a new life .
While many of these are still mostly conceptual a lot of them have potential beyond being whimsical one - time creations .
Aluminum shavings sound like something that might be easy to recycle but they are n’t .
In fact they are normally dumped into landfills though one designer has decided to turn them into quite classy - looking nicely - colored counter - tops .
Now you could pay more for a granite counter - top or have something that both looks equally interesting / variegated and makes a great conversation piece .
Newspapers can be a very tricky thing to reuse without recycling but one student designer has figured out away to work around their weaknesses and play on their strengths .
The strength and the natural ‘ give ’ of the newspapers provides a solid - but - soft underlying structure to this otherwise sturdy chair .
Whether these recycled spoon creations are tacky or clever is up to you to decide .
They certainly are more variegated and playful than some of the other simpler designs shown here .
Judging from her dress and decor however they are a perfect fit to the designer ’s own style .
Old tires are probably some of the most prevalent not - easily - recyclables on the planet .
The above solution is really quite simple and small - scale enough that not a lot of reworking of the tires is necessary to create these comfortable little chairs .
One has to wonder if these old whiskey barrel parts used to create various pieces of furniture have a lingering odor ( pleasant or otherwise ) from their days of aging alcoholic beverages .
Regardless , though , they do have a rough - and - ready character from their slightly uneven shapes that gives a natural variety to the resulting designs that somehow makes them feel more comfortable , aged and homey .
It sure takes a lot of drinking straws to make a single piece of furniture but if the material is difficult to do anything else with then why not , really ?
It ’s hard to imagine this would n’t crush under pressure but perhaps the sheer number is enough to make it stable while the void spaces make it comfortable .
In clockwise order shown above are various more great examples of recycled urban furniture : a light made from broken light tubes , a lamp made from an old iron , a chair from a shopping cart and a table from bent bike tires .
If you have any additional ideas for ordinary trash you could turn into interesting recycled furniture you can add them in the comments below .

" The Fable "
Because of this history of repression , the following mythological fable should , among other things , be considered as a theoretical discussion of religious and non-religious opinions .

Some time in the future ...
Is it a secret society or UFO group trying to go mainstream ?
Is it the " Brotherhood of the Beast " and host for the incarnation of the Antichrist as touted in the document that Scientology defectors call OT - 8 ?
Others are asking : " Is Scientology a worldwide criminal organization ?
Is it a bizarre new form of mystical Nazism and fascism ?
Is Scientology the next Jonestown , Waco , Swiss Solar Temple and Japanese Aum suicide \murder tragedy waiting to happen , or is Scientology all of these things ?
This fable cannot address all of the questions that are now being asked about this most unusual organization .
Many of the above queries have been adequately answered in other reports widely available on the Internet .
This fable will although pierce through the many layers of initiation secrecy , security clearances and fear that cloaks the real Scientology - and answer some of the most difficult and intriguing questions listed above .
This fable will focus exclusively on the secret satanic elements of Scientology , ( part 1 ) the Hollywood celebrities and politicians involved with this group ( part 2 ) and the reports of member suicides , attempted suicides and member induced psychotic episodes ( part 3 )
At the end of this fable ( part 4 ) the reader will find a " Moral of the Fable " section as well as other appendix sections which contain challenging ideas and additional research resources available via the Internet and bookstores to further assist him or her to independently evaluate the many questions and moral and social dilemmas this fable presents .
Secrecy
Less that 2 % of the individuals within Scientology have ever seen the inner secret initiations and information of this story .
Significant parts of this story have never been seen before in any form .
Scientology members who have been exposed to Hubbard 's secret writings are required to sign nondisclosure agreements for the rest of their lives .
To attempt to enforce secrecy Scientology has even registered Hubbard 's secrets as its " trade secrets " .
This story is the result of decades years of research from the work of many different researchers and sources .
Often in unexpected ways , the style and structure of this story will seem to suddenly twist and turn as it tries to unveil the convoluted secret Scientology and the layers of deception and misinformation used to hide it secrets from uninitiated outside eyes and ears .
In discovering the secret Scientology for yourself keep in mind that the overall context of Scientology and its actual actions IS as important as specific initiation details .
Why Now ?
There are now hundreds of Scientology and Dianetics groups and Scientology " front group " recruiting organizations .
Scientology and Dianetics are now operating in almost every country in the world .
It is making inroads into global political systems and it appears to be taking over a significant part of the Hollywood media machine .
The recent scientology raids and this story
Part of Scientology 's real reasons for these raids was not the alleged " copyright " infringement , but to prevent and limit the public exposure and debate on Scientology 's most secret initiations and the member casualties surrounding the secret initiation processes .
( At last review there are over 100 regularly changing locations on the Internet where you can review these secret initiations and enter into this heated free speech and religious freedom dialog .
Appendix 1 will help you find them .
They are contained in what is commonly called the " Fishman affidavit " or " Fishman Geertz documents . " )
At the very center of these " Fishman affidavit " copyright infringement raids is a super secret , ( highly disavowed by Scientology ) document called OT 8 .
In the OT 8 document which defectors claim to be authored by Scientology 's deceased founder , L Ron Hubbard , the highest initiates of Scientology are instructed by Hubbard that Hubbard really is Lucifer the Antichrist .
In this document Hubbard goes on to declare to Scientology 's highest initiates that Lucifer has really been unfairly maligned by Christian churches and it is really Christ who is the evil and Lucifer who is good .
Hubbard then goes on to say that Christ was really a pedophile and child molester and that Hubbard will soon return to human form from the afterlife as a powerful politician to lead the world into a new era .
Commenting to the media after the raids , Warren L. McShane , President of the Religious Technology Center , the Keeper of Hubbard 's copyrights and trade secrets , reiterated the necessity of keeping Hubbard 's secrets away from the minds of the uninitiated : " McShane said the church had every right to aggressively protect its text .
And , he said , certain advanced texts could " do harm " if studied by people not yet deemed ready for them by church officials .
" It 's like jumping in an 18 - wheeler and not knowing how to drive , " McShane said , adding , " Spiritually , a person has to be ready for it . "
McShane was reflecting Scientology 's internal views on these secret materials .
In the actual secret materials themselves initiates are warned that premature exposure to the secrets will cause the individual to die , get very sick or go insane .
The authenticity of the OT 8 document which discloses Scientology 's satanic nature , and information about how so many celebrities and politicians have become involved in promoting this group has become a stormy and ongoing discussion involving tens of thousands of people on and off the Internet .
This allegorical story will do much to help stimulate the reader to independently evaluate the authenticity of the OT 8 document , the claims that Scientology is the world 's largest secret satanic society and understand how Hollywood 's biggest names got involved and could be promoting this organization .
PART ONE : SCIENTOLOGY RECRUITS HOLLYWOOD
Introduction
The origins of Scientology 's Hollywood fascination
According to Hubbard , Scientologists should target prominent individuals as their " quarry " and bring them back like trophies for Scientology .
He listed the following people of that era as suitable prey : Edward R. Murrow , Marlene Dietrich , Ernest Hemingway , Howard Hughes , Greta Garbo , Walt Disney , Henry Luce , Billy Graham , Groucho Marx and others of similar stature .
" If you bring one of them home you will get a small plaque as a reward , " Hubbard wrote in a Scientology magazine more than three decades ago .
Although the original effort faded , the idea of using celebrities to promote and defend Scientology survived and is now being expanded though Hubbard 's successor David Miscavige .
Celebrities are considered so important to the movement ' s expansion that the church created a special office to guide their careers and ensure their " correct utilization " for Scientology .
The church has created a special branch that ministers to celebrities , providing them with first - class treatment .
Its headquarters , called Celebrity Center International , is housed in a magnificent old turreted mansion on Franklin Avenue , overlooking the Hollywood Freeway .
In Miscavige 's Hollywood , Scientology has assembled a star - studded roster of followers by aggressively recruiting and regally pampering them at the church 's " Celebrity Centers , " a chain of country club like clubhouses that offer expensive counseling and career guidance .
Adherents include screen idols Tom Cruise and John Travolta actresses Kirstie Alley , Mimi Rogers and Anne Archer , Palm Springs mayor and performer Sonny Bono , jazzman Chick Corea and even Nancy Cartwright , the voice of cartoon star Bart Simpson .
Why Scientology pursues celebrities
The roles that celebrities play in Scientology are dictated by a series of Scientology policies called the Opinion Leader Policies that were written by Hubbard .
These policies state that you need to get your people into the power points in society , ( points where you are the opinion leader or you control the opinion leader . )
The Celebrity Center Program is nothing more than an extension of Hubbard 's plan of world domination by taking over or controlling opinion leaders .
To create a favorable environment for Scientology 's expansion , church executives are working to win allies among society 's power brokers and opinion leaders .
This theme is expounded in church publications , " We need to be able to approach the right people in order to get things done , " wrote Heber Jentzsch , president of the Church of Scientology International , in the newspaper Scientology Today .
" We need to find out how to reach key people in the media , in government , in the control points of society , the people who rule things . "
Underscoring the campaign 's breadth and determination , a pullout questionnaire entitled " Communication Lines to the World " was inserted in the Scientology newspaper .
It asked Scientologists to list their connections to people in six areas :
POLITICS : " This would be political figures on a local , state or national level , such as local city officials , mayors , governors , senators , congressmen , and members of parliaments .
It would also include government agency officials and civil servants . "
MEDIA : " This would be any media terminals that you know , such as owners or proprietors of magazines , newswire services , newspapers or publishing houses , and radio networks or stations and publishers and editors of any type of news media . "
LEGAL : " This would be any judges , law enforcement officials , lawyers , barristers and so on . "
FINANCIAL / CORPORATE : " This would be any members of the board or presidents , vice presidents or other senior officials / executives with banks or other financial institutions ( such as savings and loan companies , credit unions , etc. ) financiers ( this could be government or private industry ) stockbrokers , financial advisers and commodities brokers . "
ENTERTAINMENT / CELEBRITIES : " This would be any producers or directors in the stage , motion pictures or television ; actors , artists , writers and any opinion leaders in these areas . "
In HCO PL 12 January 1973 policy letter , Hubbard States : " The most important action to undertake when going about making a Safe Point is to carefully and painstakingly find out who exactly are the Top Dogs in the area in financial and political circles and their associates and their connections , and to what each one is hostile . "
All of this information is sent to the intelligence branch of Scientology .
( Keep in mind one of the major activities of a secret society is turning its members into deployable agents who will fanatically use their resources and connections to forward the goals of the group or knock out the enemies of the group . )
How celebrities are recruited into Scientology
Most Scientology celebrities are victims that do n't know that they are being systematically deceived and rendered suggestible by use of counseling processes that are no more that covert hypnosis .
A very few of them know about Scientology 's secret goals , but most of them have no idea about the suicides or the attempted suicides at the Celebrity centers or other centers .
Any time they hear anything negative they are told " It 's all lies .
Do n't listen to it "
The battle - plan
Everything is done to learn as much as possible about the target non-Scientology celebrity .
The following are just a few key areas of information that are assembled on the target : who are the celebrity 's closest friends , their business contacts , places most often frequented , credit histories , public records and police reports .
Any information on the targeted celebrity is fair game .
It can be used to manufacture an " innocent " or coincidental recruiting opportunity or can be used to produce a recruiting influence leverage over the target .
Wherever possible , a Scientology celebrity is used to help set up and recruit a non-Scientology celebrity .
Because a Scientology celebrity 's loyalty to Scientology can be absolutely blinding , Scientology celebrities would not be beyond divulging almost anything they know about the non Scientology celebrity target .
Once all this information is assembled the Celebrity Center staff implements the Battle Plan .
They try to set up a meeting scenario that looks like a chance meeting .
The best " set ups " are enacted where a lot of unknown Scientology shills can be placed around the target celebrity .
Some other Scientology celebrity friends are there too , ( Scientology has been using charity events lately for this . )
Once the meeting is started some general communication is first established to relax the target .
They can't obviously just walk up and say " Come to the Scientology center " ; first they have to establish a rapport with the person .
Once they have got a conversation going they gradually try to steer the discussion over to the target 's emotional or psychological buttons , and \or they start " admiration - bombing " the target .
When the emotional button " hook " has been placed into the target then they start telling them about Scientology and invite them to an event or in to the center .
The late Yvonne Jentzsch , the original head and originator of the first Celebrity Center , said the way to hook celebrities is to " admiration - bomb " them .
( This means you emotionally over flood them with attention and admiration . )
From her teaching and example , the Scientology staff quickly learned as a method of invisible but powerful control to give celebrities the excessive God - like admiration they are vulnerable to .
A former celebrity center staff members reports watching her handle celebrities .
Yvonne demonstrated that she could " push these admiration and attention buttons " on the celebrities to get them to do just about anything .
On one hand , she 'd say " We really can use these celebrities to bring in more people " , and on the other hand she would talk derogatorily about the various celebrities that she was manipulating .
About Karen Black she said .
" Karen 's just a dingbat , and so promiscuous . "
Chick Corea was a puppy , she said .
" I can get him to do anything for me , just give me the phone . "
Keep in mind that celebrities are usually not college graduates with Doctorates .
Most celebrities have no idea that there is such sophisticated and pervasive hidden manipulation governing every step of the recruiting process used to get them into Scientology .
Generally celebrities got into show business to achieve fame ( attention and admiration . )
These are ready made hooks for them .
The Scientology recruiting con is so good that during the recruiting meeting the target celebrity is made to think that the new friends ( hidden recruiters ) are friendly , VERY knowledgeable and the offers of help or benefit being suggested are just the perfect coincidence to provide what just happened to be needed .
Targeting celebrity vulnerability
When Scientology targets celebrities , it focuses on three kinds : those who are on their way down - they have a reason to listen ; those who have n't made it yet , they also have a reason to listen because they want to get on top ; and those who have made it but have some sort of severe problem in their lives that makes them vulnerable .
Scientology also exploits celebrities ' vulnerability by providing a false but seemingly " meaningful " new role for their celebrity power .
Scientology involvement suggests to the celebrity that they are going to be more than just fluff and frill , or another Hollywood empty headed pretty face or a sex symbol .
Scientology gradually suggests to targeted celebrities that by joining this world movement they become part of a secret and special elite and are gaining a " world historic destiny " for their celebrity power .
In the shallow celebrity world of Hollywood this is a powerful initial intoxication and inducement to get involved .
What do the celebrities get from Scientology ?
1. ) Some free services and discounted services .
In the HCO PL 1 January 1963 policy letter Hubbard says : " Central Orgs ( organizations ) are instructed to process selected celebrities who are just beyond or who are just coming into their prime .
The pay is to be any contribution you would care to make if we have helped .
No other pay is demanded . "
2. ) Commissions .
In some cases they get commissions of ten percent of the take from people coming in the door .
3. ) Special perks .
One of the perks that celebrities get is a considerable amount of free use of Scientology 's private country clubs and properties .
The following recent revelations were made about typical celebrity treatment in a affidavit to Los Angeles lawyers by Andre Tabayoyon , a Scientologist for 21 years .
I , ANDRE TABAYOYON , declare as follows : 115 .
I witnessed money from various non profit Scientology organizations , and labor provided by various non profit Scientology organizations being used for the personal benefit of Miscavige , Tom Cruise , other Scientology senior executives and other Scientology celebrities ( such as John Travolta , Chick Corea and Priscilla Presley ) .
117 . Miscavige , other senior Scientologists and certain celebrities would also use the movie theater we constructed on the base to view first run movies provided to him by his acquaintances in the movie industry .
The cost of this was easily $ 150,000 .
This cost does not include labor ( again slave labor ) or expensive film projection equipment .
118 . During the 1980's , Miscavige befriended the actor Tom Cruise and they spend a lot of time together on the Hemet base .
Their special chef , Sinar Parman , would prepare them fancy meals .
Often they would hang out alone in the space designated for L. Ron Hubbard on the Clipper Ship we built in the desert .
This space had a small kitchen , a little dining room , a little bar and a bed .
They also had the exclusive use of the officers lounge .
On other occasions Miscavige and Cruise would work out in the expensive gym we built for exclusive and restricted use .
No one else was allowed to talk to Tom Cruise when he was on the base .
One time one of the gardeners spoke to him and this caused a major flap on the base .
At Gold , Miscavige is known by his initials DM and Tom Cruise by his initials TC .
From the late 1980 's until I left the Gold , Tom Cruise was provided a personal and exclusive apartment and storage facilities by the Scientology organization and at Scientology 's expense .
Tom Cruise kept two Yamaha motorcycles , a Mercedes Benz automobile and a large motor home at Gold .
These were stored in what used to be Hubbard 's garage and parking lot .
Obviously , Miscavige and Cruise have developed a special relationship .
One is a young world - domineering celebrity .
The other is a young domineering cult leader who seeks to ' clear ' the world and to rule it according to Scientology beliefs and practices .
119 . When Tom Cruise got married to Nicole Kidman , they and David Miscavige went to a Colorado Ski Resort for the marriage ceremony .
A Sea Org staffer ( Sinar Parman ) was taken along to do personal cooking for Tom Cruise and Miscavige at the expense of Scientology not for profit religious organizations .
This left only 3 cooks at Gold to cook for 800 people three times a day .
120 . I personally participated in the construction of an apartment at the Gold base , using extensive funds from various non profit Scientology religious organizations , for the personal and exclusive use of Tom Cruise .
This was done on the orders of David Miscavige .
Even though Miscavige has claimed to be Chairman of the Board of RTC , here he is directing the expenditure of CSI money and the deployment of CSI labor -- both paid and slave .
Other apartment cottages were built for the use of John Travolta , Kirstie Alley , Edgar Winters , Priscilla Presley and other Scientology celebrities who are carefully prevented from finding out the real truth about the Scientology organization .
The labor used to construct Tom Cruise 's apartment was provided by Gold , a division of CSI , and persons from a myriad of Scientology organizations serving time in the RPF .
The RPF ( Rehabilitation Project Force ) is the Scientology gulag or concentration camp .
Using RPF 'ers to renovate and reconstruct Tom Cruise 's personal and exclusive apartment at the Scientology Gold base is equivalent to the use of slave labor for Tom Cruise 's benefit .
The Tom Cruise apartment at the Gold base is located at the golf course end of the Gold base , closest to State Street .
When Tom Cruise visits the Gold base , and stays in his personal apartment , he is cared for by a Sea Org steward .
121 . We also had to renovate the Tom Cruise apartment at the Hemet Base after it was damaged by a mud slide .
The repairs had to be performed on an emergency basis .
Both the Gold crew and the RPF 'ers were placed on extended hours to restore the apartment .
Again , Tom Cruise was benefiting from the use of what is essentially prison slave labor being worked almost around the clock .
122 . Tom Cruise also enjoyed use of facilities constructed on the Gold base that were not available to any Scientology staff except the senior most Scientologists on the base , particularly Miscavige and his lieutenants .
For example , I saw Tom Cruise use the exercise room which was off limits to at least 98 percent of the staff .
Tom Cruise also had unrestricted access to the Ship which has a sauna , Jacuzzi and a large Olympic sized swimming pool .
With regard to the Miscavige / Cruise gym this was built in conjunction with the estates facility in approx .
1989 .
The gym building cost approx .
$ 150,000 ( again using slave labor ) and contains a complete lineup of the most modern weight training equipment .
It is one of the most incredible gyms imaginable and is for the exclusive use of Tom Cruise , David Miscavige and other specially and specifically approved by him .
It also has an incredible shower area .
123 .
To assure that Tom Cruise 's stays at the Hemet base were enjoyable , special provisions were made for him and restrictions were imposed on the staff at the Hemet base .
Millions of Church dollars were spent so that millionaire Tom Cruise could regularly visit the Scientology base and be friends with Miscavige .
For example , Tom Cruise received special meal services , special room services and the Hemet base staff was restricted in its access to Hemet base facilities .
Indeed , a girl by the name of Jennie Matsamura was assigned to take care of him and his renovated cottage .
The Hemet base staff was barred from going where Tom Cruise might be present .
Construction and renovation work that was done on the base for Tom Cruise 's benefit often had to be torn up and redone because the coloring was slightly off or there were a few inches of group that did n't quite match in color .
Once we had to pour a concrete walkway so that Tom Cruise would not have to walk on the desert soil .
Before the concrete dried it rained .
The concrete was spoiled .
Miscavige went into a fury over that .
124 .
On one occasion , prior to a Cruise / Kidman visit , Miscavige decided to redo the meadow in beautiful flowers ;
Tens of thousands of dollars were spent on the project so that Cruise and Kidman could romp there .
However , Miscavige inspected the project and did n't like it .
So the whole meadow was plowed up , destroyed , re-plowed and sown with plain grass ...
131 .
In 1989 /1990 we also constructed a tennis court at Gold for the exclusive list of Celebrities and Miscavige .
Non profit Scientology religious organization funds were used for this inurement project .
The tennis court cost at least $ 200,000 to build .
The rubber coating alone , on the tennis court , cost $ 80,000 .
Then there was the landscaping and rose garden around the tennis court .
I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America and of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct .
Executed in Los Angeles , California this 5th day of March , 1994 .
Andre Tabayoyon
It is not unlike a commercial business strategically giving away services in an effort to increase sales by obtaining a celebrity endorsement . "
5. ) Celebrities also get into Scientology because other celebrities already did , and because some behind the scenes people are working to get them lured in .
6. ) People whether celebrities or not often join a cult when they are in a " transition state , " like starting in college , getting divorced , getting fired , starting new job , etc .
And actors are always in transition : after having completed an assignment , they have fears :
Will the film , musical or play be a success ?
Will they get a new job ?
This must be terrible , and totally new for most of us , since we get paid every month and only search a new job every few years .
The last one makes actors very vulnerable to someone selling certainty or confidence .
What 's expected from celebrities in Scientology
They also are expected to constantly promote and talk about Scientology .
Recruiting and other Scientology promoting activities proves their loyalty to the organization and approves their security clearance to go to the next secret level .
Celebrity activity is closely monitored .
If they do n't promote Scientology in their media coverage or if they do n't promote it at their events or do special events for Scientology their loyalty is questioned .
The following are three examples of Scientology celebrity endorsements and promotions :
" lt 's nice to know you can be a cause of your life as well as an effect , " convert John Travolta , 23 , says of his Scientology training .
" lt 's a logical and very sane way of living .
I do n't get upset as easily as I used to .
I do n't think I could have handled my success as well without it . "
From ' The Auditor " : The Monthly Journal of Scientology - AOSH ANZO 136 .
" The Road To Freedom " album of LRH songs released on CD !
Attendees of the 23rd of June event were able to snap up the brand new edition of " The Road To Freedom " album now available on CD and cassette .
This album features such leading artists as John Travolta , Chick Corea , Julia Migenes , Karen Black , Nicky Hopkins , Amanda Ambrose , Gayle Moran and Leif Garrett .
This album is a unique and highly enjoyable collection of songs composed by L. Ron Hubbard to impart to the listener some of the basic knowledge that Scientology offers .
Whilst viewed as controversial by those who seek to oppose man 's spiritual freedom , the lyrics on this album offer answers to questions man has asked for eons . "
Kirstie Alley is active in disseminating a new 47 page booklet on ways to preserve the environment .
The booklet , entitled " Cry Out , " was named after a Hubbard song and was produced by Author Services Inc. , his literary agency .
Author Services is controlled by influential Scientologists .
In April , Alley provided nationwide exposure for the illustrated booklet ( which mentions Hubbard but not Scientology ) when she unveiled it on the popular Arsenio Hall Show .
Since then , it has been distributed to prominent environmental groups throughout the U.S .
Although the advertising is n't finished yet , the new campaign includes a half - hour " documercial " entitled " The Problem of Life . "
It dramatizes a couple who are looking for answers to the questions of life , " a spokesman said , such as : What 's it all about ?
Where are we going ?
Would n't it be good to have a job that is fulfilling ?
The couple unsuccessfully visits a doctor , a psychotherapist and a marriage counselor .
" At the end , they find out Scientology could provide the answers , " the spokeswoman said .
The documercial ends with a 10 - minute direct - sales pitch from Jeff Pomerantz , the soap - opera star ( best known for his role in the " Dynasty " series ) who is one of the church 's several celebrity members .
Celebrities are not only pushing Scientology and Scientology 's non religious alter ego Dianetics for multilevel marketing like commissions ; they are also heavily pushing the Scientology front groups , like Narconon , the Way to Happiness , Applied Scholastics , and others .
A partial list of front groups set up and directly or indirectly controlled by Scientology , and which are involved in recruiting for Scientology or covertly or overtly attacking adversaries or defending Scientology , includes :
the Committee To Defend The First Amendment
the Hubbard Dianetics Foundation
the Citizens Commission On Human Rights
Narconon
the Committee On Public Health And Safety
the Task Force On Mental Retardation
the Gerus Society
the Dianetic Information Group
the Committee To Re-involve Ex-offenders
the National Commission for Law Enforcement And Social Justice
the Foundation For The Communication of Culture International
Doctors For Religious Liberty
Vanguard , April , ( a pseudo anti cult organization )
Alliance To Protect Religious Liberty
Committee For A Safe Environment
American Citizens For Honesty in Government
the Way to Happiness Foundation
the Whistle Blowers
Health Med
Criminon
Applied Scholastics
Concerned Businessman's Association of America
Sterling Management
" Churches are looked upon as reform groups .
Therefore we must act like a reform group . "
An example of Hubbard 's thinking on this matter is policy directive HCO PL 12 January 1973 " The Safe Point " :
" ... Rule l ...
Get in a safe place and speak up .
It is necessary of course to have a safe place to get into , from which one can in safely speak up .
One cannot defend himself in a point that has no defenses ... Thus the Safe Point takes consideration over Active Defense ... a special unit must be set up and run at full steam to make a safe point and gain viable PR Area Control over all publics in the area ... The PR Area Control action in a new area can go so far as to create in the area of whole past and future track for the activity being established .
It can make it sound old - fashioned , stable , reliable , expert , productive ... "
Front groups and charity events
Here 's how it works .
One Scientology celebrity " innocently " contacts another non- Scientology celebrity and says , " How would you like to do a charity event with me to help raise money for drug rehabilitation ? "
Then the other celebrity usually agrees .
He or she has no idea that it 's a Scientology front group recruiting group like Narconon or the Way To Happiness Foundation , or one of their ecological or other Scientology front groups .
Because the front group 's name sounds established credible , stable , reliable , etc. and the goal of the charity event sounds benign and worthwhile , the non-Scientology celebrities get sucked in to inadvertently having their names used to promote or in association with the Scientology front groups .
Then to make things even worse they individually become the target of the powerful and manipulative celebrity - recruiting machine if they attend the event .
Scammed by Scientology front groups :
Gov. Jim Edgar rescinded a proclamation that declared March 13 as " L. Ron Hubbard Day " in Illinois in honor of the late founder of the Church of Scientology .
Gubernatorial proclamations traditionally are issued to honor deeds of individuals at the request of a variety of organizations .
Edgar aides said the Hubbard proclamation " slipped through the cracks " and was issued without any thought surrounding the controversial author and church founder .
In his original proclamation , issued Feb. 28 , Edgar said Hubbard 's " writings on the mind and human spirit have helped millions of people lead better lives .
His literary works have enriched the lives of many readers . "
But Tuesday , Edgar issued only a one - sentence proclamation , stating that his original proclamation was rescinded .
Another Scientology - linked group , the Concerned Businessmen 's Association of America , holds anti- drug contests and awards $ 5,000 grants to schools as a way to recruit students and curry favor with education officials .
West Virginia Senator John D. Rockerfeller IV unwittingly commended the CBAA in 1987 on the Senate floor .
An October 1990 news release from the church [ of Scientology ] , said Senator John McCain and Reps. Jon Kyl , John Rhodes , Bob Stump and then Rep. Morris Udall had written to the IRS asking it to explain why it was targeting Scientologists .
" I find it hard to believe these guys did n't have a clue .
Then again God has n't blessed us with the brightest politicians , " Said a writer at the Arizona Republic on June 29 , 1991 .
How Scientology keeps control over its Hollywood members
The celebrities who are still in Scientology have passed the hypnotic suggestibility culling process .
That is not to say that celebrities are statistically any more hypnotically suggestible than anyone else in the population .
It just means that through its clever culling process Scientology has isolated them and has " worked " their other vulnerabilities to establish and maintain their control over the celebrity .
In the next step of the recruiting process , Scientology celebrities are bombarded with hyped - up , hypnosis imbalanced " success stories . "
Moments after completing every suggestion pregnant hypnotic Scientology counseling session the celebrity targets are then REQUIRED to write their own glowing " success stories . "
( In many of these counseling sessions Scientology buries the hypnotic suggestion for the intended result in the questions being asked . )
After their own " counseling " sessions , celebrities are taken to a public area and admiration - bombed for their Scientology success .
They are NOT allowed to have any objective testing time after they have been put in the covert hypnosis to verify the legitimacy of what 's happened to them .
Then they are controlled by social pressure by having signed their names to glowing unverified testimonials .
Very few people will later admit that they signed or claimed something that was n't true or fairly tested .
It is just too embarrassing for most people to admit they were so thoroughly conned or controlled .
Controlling celebrities ’ relationships
Soon the celebrities are seeing less and less of their old non-Scientology friends , and these old relationships seem less and less important .
If the celebrity starts having any problems with their old non Scientology girlfriends or mates they will often find " miraculously " attractive Scientology females or males directly or indirectly will start to befriend them .
Numerous celebrities have ended up dumping their old girlfriends or wives and marrying Scientology staff members because of these deliberate isolation and manipulative befriending efforts .
The goal of a Celebrity center staff member is to occupy and control every part of the celebrity 's life and resources .
By unwritten de facto policy , the most attractive Scientology staff are assigned to the Celebrity Center public areas .
When the non-Scientology wife or husband or girlfriend or business associate of some celebrity sees them getting involved in Scientology , one of the first things they notice is how Scientology is baiting the individual to change their non-Scientology friendly sexual , emotional or business relationship partners .
Of course this is not a problem - at least initially - if you decide to become a Scientologist to keep your current relationship .
For example , Tom Cruises new wife , the striking , red - headed Aussie actress Nicole Kidman used to tell her friends that she was upset by the assertive American Scientologists ' always hanging around Cruise , She was particularly displeased at their behavior during the Cruises ' wedding , last Christmas Eve in Telluride , Colorado .
By late March , however , after wrapping with Billy Bathgate with Dustin Hoffman , Kidman now was saying she had made peace with Scientology .
" She was very open about it . "
Today 's confessions will be used tomorrow
Scientology is smart enough to know that when the celebrities confess such embarrassing and incriminating things it allows powerful control over them , because if it was made public it could destroy their careers .
What the celebrities do n't know is that there are secret internal Scientology policies that were seized in the FBI raid where it states that the intelligence people are under strict policy orders to use this information if needed .
If somebody starts to go against Scientology the intelligence people grab their confessions , and imply , hint or state or that the materials out of the confessions will be leaked .
( See G.O. order 121669 which allows reading of PC files to gather information to use against the person .
The FBI seized many incriminating summaries of PC files cullings . )
From a former member : " While Case Supervisor in 1978 at the Celebrity Center Mission in Las Vegas , Bruce Hamilton of the Las Vegas Guardian 's Office came to see me and asked me to go through my PC ( preclears ) files and to provide him with any information which had been disclosed in auditing sessions which I thought would be helpful to control the person and would be " helpful to his cause . "
When I disagreed with these " Gestapo type tactics " he told me that these orders came " directly from Los Angeles " or " this comes directly from Clearwater " , and that if I did n't comply , it would be " treason " . "
From another former member 's deposition ( Andre Tabayoyon ) : Tom Cruise 's p.c. ( pre-clear ) folder was kept in the Gold case supervision ( c /s ) office which I had access to as a security missionaries .
It contains supposedly confidential information derived during auditing sessions .
However , the contents of such pre-clear folders have been culled and used against people .
It is my opinion , based on my Scientology training , education and experience , that such information is collected by the Scientology organization in order to be able to exert control and influence over people such as Tom Cruise or John Travolta , should they ever attempt to leave the Scientology organization .
The Travolta story is a good example of this tactic .
John Travolta has long served as an unofficial Scientology spokesman , even though he told a magazine in 1983 that he was opposed to the church 's management .
High - level defectors claim that Travolta has long feared that if he defected , details of his homosexual and bisexual life would be made public .
" He ( Travolta ) felt pretty intimidated about this getting out and told me so , " recalls William Franks , the church 's former chairman of the board .
" There were no outright threats made , but it was implicit .
If you leave , they immediately start digging up everything . "
Franks was driven out in 1981 after attempting to reform the church .
From another Scientology member and former head of security .
Richard Aznaran , recalls Scientology ringleader Miscavige repeatedly joking to staffers about Travolta 's allegedly promiscuous homosexual behavior .
( It is curious to note that when Scientology recently sued Time magazine for a critical article on Scientology which mentioned Travolta 's homosexuality they did not list this as one of the article 's slanders . )
Celebrities with sexual secrets ( or any type of secrets ) should adopt the firm policy to NEVER under any circumstances CONFESS ANYTHING to Scientology .
What control would Scientology have if Lisa Marie Presley gets Michael Jackson to confess everything that happened concerning the child molesting charges against him ?
A former Scientology celebrity speaks out
" I remember having a choking anger against anyone who ever said anything against Scientology , " says actress Diana Canova ( Soap ) , a former member .
" I would get crazy , I was just so angry .
I would have done anything for them . "
During her seven years in Scientology , Canova experienced the Celebrity Center from both sides of fame .
" When I started , I was n't in television yet .
I was a nobody -- I 'd done some TV , but I was not one of the elite , not by a long shot -- until I did Soap .
Then it became . . .
I mean , you really are treated like royalty . "
" There was always pressure to get other celebrities in .
The first time I walked in those doors , they said , ' Just give us all the money in your bank account .
You 'll get it back tenfold . ' "
When she joined , auditing prices were about $ 25 .
" It went up to about $ 175 in the early ' 80s , " she recalls .
" That was shocking to me .
I was beginning to wonder , Is it really worth it ?
They 're telling you , ' Do n't spend $ 100 an hour on a shrink 's couch , it 'll ruin your mind . '
Auditing is so much better ? "
" It took me years before I decided to quit , " says Canova .
" I guess finally I was so fed up with being afraid .
You 've heard all these horror stories . . . "
Canova warns : " They 're capable of doing a lot of things . "
Canova says she spoke up because she thought it was important .
" I see some of my friends having to keep their mouths shut for personal reasons , for business reasons , " she says .
" I do n't believe that 's right .
If it 's going to be termed a religion , or a church , then those kinds of fears have no business being there .
Nobody should be afraid .
And you can quote me on that . "
From other celebrities who are out
John Brodie , a former San Francisco 49 'ers quarterback , was involved in Scientology from 1970 to 1982 .
He was one of the first 25 Scientologists to reach the level of OT 7 , considered a formidable accomplishment by members .
Still , Brodie says he never considered himself part of the group .
Brodie said he gave up promoting Scientology after some of his friends in Scientology were expelled and harassed during a power struggle with church management .
" There were many in the church I felt were treated unfairly , " Brodie said .
There are many Hollywood people who have left Scientology but fear speaking out .
Some of them leave and just order Scientology to stop using their names and " success " stories .
Hopefully , because of this report and the full Scientology celebrity listing at the end of part two , more former Scientology celebrities will begin to tell their stories in the media .
About Scientology ’s top celebrities
Kirstie Alley of Cheers fame is the big celebrity promoter of Narconon .
She travels all over doing events for them .
The Narconon Scientology front group takes drug addicts and addicts them to Scientology through repetitive hypnotic trance .
Alley was chained to drugs and now she 's chained to Scientology .
Is Kirstie Alley any more free ?
She 's not suffering drug problems - but has n't she 's lost her life again ?
According to a twenty - two year former member , Tom Cruise went somewhat insane while doing Scientology 's secret initiation levels ( OT III , the story of the galactic Emperor Xenu ) .
The member from which this information is coming said Cruise was getting his " OT III repair " processing at that time .
To prevent a public scene , they quickly got him into some more hypnotic trance induction and mellowed him out .
Did Marcia Clark lie to the media during the O.J. Simpson trial by saying she was n't a Scientologist .
You do n't marry someone in Scientology 's intelligence division unless you are a security cleared Scientologist .
Her husband is one of the heads of the Citizens ' Commission on Human Rights ( CCHR ) which is one of the intelligence division 's main front groups attacking psychiatry .
The Michael Jackson Scientology recruiting story is intriguing .
Celebrities who bring in other BIG celebrities ( like Mimi Rogers who brought in Tom Cruise ) are treated even more royally inside the organization .
The speedy Lisa Marie Presley Michael Jackson marriage fits the classic profile of Scientology celebrity recruiting and in some ways is similar to the conveniently fast Travolta Marriage .
Michael Jackson was a highly vulnerable target .
He had just come out of a drug rehabilitation program , went through child molesting charges , and his career was slumping .
Lisa Marie reportedly chased him and would n't take no for an answer .
Michael Jackson is the ultimate plum to Scientology .
In Scientology 's mind one Michael Jackson can bring in millions of new young and naive members .
A fanatical Scientologist would easily marry or divorce to prove his or her total dedication to " bringing in " millions of people ( clearing and controlling the planet . )
Those celebrities who have been through the OT III initiation know that " clearing the planet " really means they are one of the elite aliens trapped here .
They know the Scientology secret initiations woke them up to their real identity and world historic destiny , and that they will have to go back out into the galaxy and eventually re-fight the old space war .
( The Scientology secret initiation process produces a fanatical loyalty at a virtually irrational level . )
Is Lisa Marie a Scientology fanatic ?
She was married to a Sea Org member who signed a " billion year " contract .
She has lived extensively at Scientology centers .
By this time she has probably passed the OT III initiation .
It 's well within the scope of Scientology covert operations and loyalty testing for her to have been on a celebrity recruiting operation for acquiring Michael Jackson .
Michael Jackson may be Scientology 's current # 1 celebrity recruiting target .
Unfortunately , going from the PR nightmares of his recent past into the world 's most dangerous satanic cult will not be the best way to improve his marketability .
He may find that what he gets with Lisa Marie may not be worth the " marriage " benefit .
The parallels make one wonder , did Scientology offer Lisa Marie Presley as an easy public relations solution to Jackson 's sexual identity problems and his potential child molesting problems ?
Getting married after being considered a homosexual or a child molester is a good way to quash those notions in the public 's eye .
Was this another Travolta Kelly Preston quick marriage orchestrated for public relations benefit ?
If Jackson is being manipulated to get in , will he ever dare go public ?
If he is not in yet , are Scientology and Lisa Marie slowly isolating him by replacing his non Scientology staff and advisors with pro Scientology people to effect the final conversion ?
Will Jackson and his staff smell the con , and distance themselves completely and permanently from Lisa Marie and the cynical Scientology celebrity manipulators ?
Only time will tell ...
The political arena from politicians to lobbyists is definitely a high priority Scientology target .
Sometimes when it better suits their secret goals Scientology tries to hide or play down a celebrity connection .
A good example is Sonny Bono .
Scientology pretty much owns Sonny Bono the politician .
This is because he is an initiated Scientologist .
His first loyalty must be not to the government , not to anything else , but Scientology first and foremost .
Sonny Bono is now a member of the House of Representatives in Washington .
Although Scientology was reported to be secretly telling its members to donate to Bonn 's reelection campaign , Scientology has down played Bonn 's membership .
Maybe Scientology believes that if more secret Scientology becomes public it's not good for his and their political destiny ?
( The OT VIII Bulletin talks about Hubbard coming back as a politician and fulfilling the prophecy of the Antichrist coming back as a political figure . )
Sonny Bono also happens to be on the U.S. copyright committee .
Scientology uses copyrights and copyright raids to try to enforce secrecy of its secret initiations .
Scientology 's most ( in ) famous celebrity : Charles Manson
The New York Times stated that Manson first got interested in Scientology while he was incarcerated in the McNeil Is land Penitentiary in Washington ( Scientology has recruiting programs for prisons ) .
From another report , Manson received about 150 hours of Scientology counseling in prison and at one point went psychotic .
" Charles was very preoccupied with this new thing called Scientology " , one of his friends from prison has told .
" He thought that it could do something for him . "
Manson himself has told that he learned the methods very quickly , because he had not been programmed in advance .
Manson had lessons in Scientology by three of his cell mates .
One of them , Lanier Palmer , was " Doctor of Scientology . "
After his release from prison , The New York Times reported , he went to Los Angeles where he was said to have met local Scientologists and attended several parties for movie stars , possibly the July 18 initial dedication of the first Celebrity Center .
Scientology literature was also said to be found at the ranch when Manson and his family were captured .
There were hints that he later got involved with other OTO groups or may have joined the Process , the sex and Satan group which originally broke away from Scientology .
It is interesting to note that the OTO is commonly considered the mother cult of Satanism to western society .
Scientology was derived in significant part from the OTO .
The Process came in significant part from Scientology .
Another escapee - group from the Process was the notorious Son of Sam cult .
The Son of Sam cult had cells that spread all over the USA .
Since 1976 about 15 - 20 cult killings were committed by the sect in the New York - area , especially of young girls .
The leaders in New York were among others , David Berkowitz and the brothers John and Michael Cam .
They killed " to bring this era to an end . "
At David 's home the police found the telephone number of the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater , Florida , Scientology 's main secret level training center .
David explained to the police , that the Son of Sam cult was an escapee from Scientology , though , there is no proof of David personally being close to Scientology .
Celebrity responsibility
They never have seen the FBI raid documents that talk about Scientology 's doing covert operations on anti-Scientology celebrities , showing that Scientology was gathering histories on celebrities to use for either possible recruitment or as covert operation targets if they were an " anti-Scientology celebrity . "
They do not know about Scientology illegally acquiring the tax returns of John Wayne and Frank Sinatra , or the covert operations on cartoonist Andy Berry .
( The person who draws Berry 's World Cartoon . )
Although it is not advertised , gradually the celebrities do learn that he or she too will become " fair game " if he or she publicly acknowledges the abuses or real secret nature of Scientology .
In spite of the preceding , Scientology celebrities now must be held legally co-responsible for the damage Scientology causes because they 're allowing their names and images to be used to bring children , young adults and families into Scientology and because they are getting something for helping it .
They are getting paid in free services , commissions and country club perks .
If celebrities still choose to continue to be celebrity spokespersons or allow their names to be used in Scientology 's endorsements and success stories , Scientology celebrities should begin to assume that the organizations which promote compassionate religion , family values and other humanitarian social values in opposition to the secret values and goals of Scientology will soon begin through public education and dialog to target their careers and public relations images .
The tremendous pain , loss , anguish , and anger Scientology has caused to so many individuals and families is real .
( See included suicide appendix # 3 . )
It would not be surprising to find more and more Scientology celebrity careers caught up in the growing backlash against Scientology in the courts and in the media , both here and abroad .
The Hollywood " religion 's " backfire potential
Scientology has made a very bad strategic decision in linking its future expansion so solidly to Hollywood celebrities .
First of all , they are betting their future on the concept that people will buy sincere and real spirituality from the endorsement of a slick Hollywood celebrity .
That 's a bad bet because most people today are wise enough not to buy whatever a Hollywood celebrity endorses until they know the product personally .
Second , Hollywood has long been know as the neurotic center of the universe .
Hollywood is also known to be a " tinsel town " of insincerity and has so many other negative connotations - why would any legitimate religion seek celebrity endorsements or try to create a religion around the unspirituality of celebrity fame ?
Most legitimate religions use good works or some humble program or their philosophy for promotion .
But , Scientology is desperately looking at its celebrity recruitment as its savior , the idea being : if these celebrities can be in it , it must be good ; another BIG mistake for David Miscavige , the celebrity - crazed new leader of Scientology .
Hollywood 's strange population of too many overpaid shiny people fails to impress most folks who tend to laugh at them and their fame - distorted lives .
Next , Hollywood is infamous for its lack of loyalty .
When more people understand what Scientology really is and the first few Scientology celebrities are named for damages in new lawsuits against Scientology , Hollywood and Hollywood celebrities will distance themselves from Scientology faster than you can say " let 's make a deal . "
Finally , do n't be surprised to see leading anti-Scientology critics soon challenging Scientology 's top celebrities to appear on any national TV shows to debate the topics discussed in this report .
The Scientology celebrity master list
PART TWO : THE SATANIC ELEMENTS OF SCIENTOLOGY
In classical Satanism there are numerous elements that help to characterize it as a classical satanic church .
One of those elements is the prediction of an ultimate conflict between God and God 's representatives ( pure good ) and Lucifer and his representatives ( pure evil ) .
Classical Satanists identify with the devil or Antichrist and believe or act in opposition or with disgust to the values , ritual and symbols represented by the Christ figure and the values , ritual and symbols of traditional Christianity .
Classical Satanists often worship through use of reversal of traditional Christian symbols and ritual such as the black mass or by reversing crosses or other religious symbols .
Classical Satanists often practice their beliefs among their own members and with the outside world by reversing truth with deception and lies .
Much biblical prophesy states that there is to be a final conflict for possession of the world between Lucifer and his representatives and God and God 's representatives .
Part of this conflict involves Satanists - before the final conflict - trying to possess , destroy or indelibly mark the souls of its members .
Biblical prophesy also implies as the time of the final conflict approaches the forces of the Beast will place a number on their members to mark their own .
While classical Satanists often talk about this upcoming great spiritual war , a major part of their energy seems to be directed toward acquiring secular power in the forms of political and financial leverage and slave master - like control over the personal lives of those around them .
Keeping the above elements in mind , read this story 's examination of these elements for their parallels in Scientology and its origins .
Origins are important !
Aleister Crowley
Crowley is significant because his ideology and OTO organization is considered to be the root and mother cult responsible for birthing classical and neo-Satanism into the U.S. and western society .
Aleister Crowley ( 1875 -1947 ) was reared in the Plymouth Brethren .
Crowley had been introduced to magic in a book by A.E. Waite .
His Cabalistic studies led him in 1898 to the OGD ( another secret society . )
Crowley rose quickly in the order , but was refused initiation to Adeptus Minor because of his moral turpitude ( in this case homosexuality ) .
Crowley gained a reputation through the next two decades for breaking every conceivable moral law , from fornication to murder .
Crowley went to Paris and was initiated by Mathers , which led to a split in the order in London .
In 1904 , Crowley received a " communication from the astral " with instructions for the establishment of a new order , which he set up in 1907 .
It was called the Astrum Argentinure ( silver star ) .
In 1909 , Crowley began publishing the Equinox to spread his ideas .
Aleister Crowley called himself " The Great Beast " , a reference to The New Testament 's description of the Anti-Christ .
In his masses he used cocaine , opium and hash .
While traveling in Sri Lanka ( Ceylon ) , Crowley was taught yoga by his guru Ananda Metteya , alias Allan Bennett .
Bennett had emigrated to the island in 1900 to become a Buddhist - monk .
In 1904 Crowley stayed in Cairo and , during a seance , got a " revelation " by his guardian angel Aiwass ( Aiwaz ) , which was communicated in the form of a prose poem entitled Liberal Vel Legis , i.e. , The Book of Law .
This became the textbook for the lodges of the Crowley Satanists .
In chapter two , it was Aiwass states : " We have nothing to do with the outcast and the unfit ; let them die in their misery .
For they feel not .
Compassion is the vice of kings ; stamp down the wretched and the weak ; this is the law of the strong ; this is our law and the joy of the world .. ; "
When Crowley heard the voice , he looked over his shoulder and claims he saw his guardian angel , who appeared like a 30 years old , dark - skinned man , trim , and with a face like a tyrannical king , with eyes that could spoil everything .
John Symond reported this happening in his book about Aleister Crowley : " He had caught a glimpse of the Devil .
Aiwass was the messenger of Hoor - Paar - Kraat , that is to say Set , the destroyer god , the brother and murderer of Osiris .
Set was also called Sheraton , and Sheraton is the prototype of the Christian Satan " .
Crowley enthusiastically expounded the text of The Book of The Law when he performed masses .
From the basic ideas of Satanism , he declared : " There are no other gods than man " .
Accordingly , man has the right to live after his own law , has the right to eat what he wants , has the right to think what he wants , to love whom he wants , to kill those who try to take these rights from him .
Aleister Crowley is known to have driven all of his mistresses and wives to hysteria , madness or divorce with his demands .
John Symond 's records in his introduction to ' The Confessions of Aleister Crowley ' that Crowley 's female scribe wrote in her magical ' diary : " it was ' damn hard ' to think of ' the rottenest kind of creature ' as a Word . "
The " Word " was Crowley 's self - assumed title as teacher of the Aeon .
Crowley drove several of his disciples to suicide and humiliated others to madness .
He is accused of infanticide , and never denied the charge .
( Interested readers should consult his ' Confessions ' , a work of unmitigated egotism . )
The OTO connection
Reuss , whose lodge - name was " Brother Merlin " , contacted Aleister Crowley in 1912 , and he became a member of this additional lodge receiving the name " Brother Baphomet " .
Baphomet , the symbol of the satanic goat , usually portrayed as a half - human , half - goat figure , of a goat head .
It is often misinterpreted as a symbol of witchcraft in general .
( It is used by Satanists , who worship the devil , but is not used by neo -Pagan witches , who do not worship the Devil . )
The origin of the name Baphomet is unclear .
It may be a corruption of Mahomet ( Mohammed ) .
The English witchcraft historian Montague Summers suggested it was a combination of two Greek words , baphe and metis , meaning " absorption of knowledge . "
Baphomet has also been called the Goat of Mendes , the Black Goat and the Judas Goat . )
The O.T.O. developed its sexual rites quickly under Reuss and later broadened them under Crowley .
Not long after , Crowley took over the leadership of the lodge .
Like other secret lodges , members may not disclose their knowledge .
Hubbard and Crowley , the Parsons transition
He was very interested in several things that were the creation of what some people call the Moon Child .
It was basically an attempt to create an miraculous conception - except by Satan rather than by God .
Another important Crowley principle was the creation of what was called embryo implants - of getting a satanic or demonic spirit to inhabit the body of a fetus .
This would come about as a result of black - magic rituals which included the use of hypnosis , drugs and the dangerous and destructive practices .
Hubbard ’s initial exposure to Crowley and the dark side of spirituality would get the opportunity to be further developed through his association with Jack Parsons .
Jack Parsons was an acknowledged genius in the field of chemistry and a major figure in the first stirrings of rocket research at Cal Tech .
Parsons was involved with the U.S. branch of an occult secret society called the O.T.O .
The ideological leader of this U.S. O.T.O. group was none other than Master Therion , the " Beast 666 , " or as the contemporary world press described him , " the wickedest man in the world , " Aleister Crowley .
During the first World war Aleister Crowley had written a novel called the " Butterfly Net " later to be published under the name " Moonchild . "
This novel tells the story of a magical operation based on the theory that a particular type of spirit can be induced to incarnate in an unborn human embryo by surrounding the mother with the appropriate influences , carrying out certain rituals , etc .
Parsons wished to carry out such an operation designed to achieve in an unborn child , the incarnation of Babalon , an aspect of the great Mother goddess Nuit .
He decided that Hubbard would make an ideal co-worker .
In order to obtain a woman prepared to bear this magical child , Parsons and Hubbard engaged themselves for eleven days in rituals .
These do not seem to have produced any marked result until January 14 , 1946 when , so Parsons said , Hubbard had a candle knocked out of his hand .
Parsons went on to record saying that Hubbard called him and , " We observed a brownish yellow light about seven feet high .
I brandished a Magical sword and it disappeared .
Hubbard 's right arm was paralyzed for the rest of the night . "
All this work seemed to have its desired result and , on January 18 , 1946 Parsons found a girl who was prepared to go through the required incantation rituals and become the mother of Babalon .
Parsons was the High Priest and had sexual intercourse with the girl , while Hubbard , who was present , acted as a skryer , seer , or clairvoyant and described what was supposed to be happening on the astral plane .
Hubbard and Parsons were attempting the most reckless magical feat imaginable .
They were trying to incarnate the Scarlet Woman described in the Book of Revelation as " Babylon the Great , the Mother of Harlot and Abominations of the Earth ... drunken with the blood of saints , and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus . "
The foregoing ritual bears some resemblance to that of a girl who defected from Scientology in 1979 .
She had been coerced into a perverted act of sexual intercourse with a man fitting Hubbard 's description in Hubbard 's private quarters at the Fiefield Manor in Los Angeles .
She describes the event as one where " my mind was being ripped away from me by force " , while the man lay on her for one hour without erection and without ever saying a word .
Around the time of the Parsons connection it is documented that Hubbard used huge amounts of testosterone , stilbestrol ( a female sex hormone ) .
Taking the sex hormones were his solution to an impotence problem .
Another solution Hubbard attempted was to resort to " affirmations . "
The " Affirmations " were commands stated to himself as part of self - hypnosis .
Sometimes you will see in his hand written notes a statement of fact , like , " Yeah , I 'm screwed up on sex . "
And then he 'll come back with an affirmation : " You are sexually wonderful !
Your sexual prowess has never before been equaled on the face of the Earth ! "
Impotence was on Hubbard 's mind a lot at that period .
He wrote page after page about how " after Fern , " he had been too afraid to go to a doctor with the clap .
Fern was the girl in Miami who he claims gave gonorrhea to him .
So he dosed himself with sulfur , and then he says the sulfur depressed his libido , and his solution to that was the testosterone and stilbestrol .
" It so depressed my libido , " he said , that he needed someone like Sara to stimulate him .
( Sara was Sarah Northrup who later became Hubbard 's mistress and wife . )
L. Ron Hubbard , Jr. speaks on his father
Ron Jr. says that he remembers much of his childhood .
He claims to recall , at six years , a vivid scene of his father performing an abortion ritual on his mother with a coat hanger .
Ron Hubbard Jr. remembers that when he was ten years old , his father , in an attempt to get his son in tune with his black magic worship , laced the young Hubbard 's bubble gum with Phenobarbital .
According to Ron Jr. drugs were an important part of Ron Jr.'s growing up , as his father believed that they were the best way to get closer to Satan -- the Antichrist of black magic .
" In my father 's private circle , " Ron Jr. explains , " there were lots of mistresses .
When I was younger , I participated in private orgies with him and three or four other women .
His theory was that one has to open or crack a woman 's soul in order for the satanic power to pour through it and into him .
It got kind of far out , culminating in a variety of sex acts .
Dad also had an incredibly violent temper .
He was into S & M and would beat his mistresses and shoot them full of drugs . "
When asked by a interviewer how this " soul - cracking " worked , L. Ron Hubbard , Jr. said , " The explanation is sort of long and complicated .
The basic rationale is that there are some powers in this universe that are pretty strong .
" As an example , Hitler was involved in the same black magic and the same occult practices that my father was .
The identical ones .
Which , as I have said , stem clear back to before Egyptian times .
It 's a very secret thing .
Very powerful and very workable and very dangerous .
Brainwashing is nothing compared to it .
The proper term would be " soul cracking . "
" It 's like cracking open the soul , which then opens various doors to the power that exists , the satanic and demonic powers .
Simply put , it 's like a tunnel or an avenue or a doorway .
Pulling that power into yourself through another person — and using women , especially is incredibly insidious .
" It makes Dr. Fu Manchu look like a kindergarten student .
It is the ultimate vampirism , the ultimate mind fuck .
Instead of going for blood , you 're going for their soul .
And you take drugs in order to reach that state where you can , quite literally , like a psychic hammer , break their soul , and pull the power through . "
" He designed his Scientology Operating Thetan techniques ( Scientology 's secret initiations ) to do the same thing .
But , of course , it takes a couple of hundred hours of auditing and mega thousands of dollars for the privilege of having your head turned into a glass Humpty Dumpty --- shattered into a million pieces .
It may sound like incredible gibberish , but it made my father a fortune . "
( The materials of the Operating Thetan techniques [ the Fishman documents ] are the reason for the raids mentioned earlier . )
" ... Also I 've got to complete this by saying that he thought of himself as the Beast 666 Incarnate . "
Interviewer : " The devil ? " Ron Jr. : " Yes .
Aleister Crowley thought of himself as such .
And when Crowley died in 1947 my father then decided that he should wear the cloak of the beast ; and become the most powerful being in the universe .
" Scientology is black magic that is spread out over a long time period .
To perform black magic generally takes a few hours or at most ; a few weeks .
But in Scientology it is stretched out over a lifetime and so you do n't see it .
Black magic is the inner core of Scientology - and it is probably the only part of Scientology that really works .
" Also you 've got to realize that my father did not worship Satan .
He thought he was Satan .
He was one with Satan .
He had a direct pipeline of communication and power with him .
My father would n't have worshipped anything , I mean .
When you think you 're the most powerful being in the universe , you have no respect for anything let alone worship .
" ...
The one super - secret sentence that Scientology is built on is : ' Do as thou wilt .
That is the whole of the law . '
It also comes from the black magic , from Aleister Crowley .
It means that you are a law unto yourself , that you are above the law , that you create your own law .
You are above any other human considerations . "
The following is from a piece , written by L. Ron Hubbard , Jr. about his father in 1985 entitled " Philadelphia . "
" We were in Philadelphia .
It was November 1952 .
Dianetics was all but forgotten ; Scientology , a new science , ' had become the focus of attention .
Every night , in the hotel , in preparation for the next day 's lecture , he 'd pace the floor , exhilarated by this or that passage from Aleister Crowley 's writings .
Just a month before , he had been in London , where he had finally been able to quench his thirst ; to fill his cup with the true , raw , naked power of magic .
The lust of centuries at his very fingertips .
" To stroke and taste the environs of the Great Beast , to fondle Crowley 's books , papers , and memorabilia had filled him with pure ecstasy !
In London he had acquired , at last , the final keys ; enabling him to take his place upon the Throne of the Beast , ' to which he firmly believed himself to be the rightful heir .
The tech gushed forth and resulted in the Philadelphia Doctorate Course lectures . "
It is perhaps coincidental that Hubbard , in the late fifties , set up his headquarters at Saint Hill Manor in England , less than half an hour 's drive from what had been Aleister Crowley 's former house in Tunbridge Wells .
Aleister Crowley 's ideology and Scientology 's ideology : a comparison
Hubbard gives examples in the Philadelphia Doctorate Course of several people remembering lives earlier on earth , some up to a million years ago .
The similarity between the Magical Memory and Time Track is that they both can recall every past incident in a person 's life , they both can recall incidents from past lives , and they both must be developed by certain techniques in order to make use of them .
Both Hubbard and Crowley consider it important to have the person recall his or her birth .
" Having allowed the mind to return for some hundred times to the hour of birth , it should be encouraged to endeavor to penetrate beyond that period " { Crowley ) .
" After twenty runs through birth , the patient experienced a recession of all somatics and ' unconsciousness ' and aberrative content . "
" Thus there was no inhibition about looking earlier than birth for what Dianetics had begun to call basic - basic " ( Hubbard ) .
In 1952 , Hubbard recommended a work by black magician Aleister Crowley , which Hubbard called The Master Therion ( published in 1929 ) .
This book was reprinted as Magick in Theory and Practice , and it also contains reference to the recollection of birth : " Having allowed the mind to return for some hundred times to the hour of birth , it should be encouraged to endeavor to penetrate beyond that period .
If it be properly trained to run backwards , there will be little difficulty in doing this . "
Both Hubbard and Crowley are avowedly anti-psychiatry .
" Official psychoanalysis is therefore committed to upholding a fraud ... psychoanalysts have misinterpreted life , and announced the absurdity that every human being is essentially an antisocial , criminal , and insane animal " ( Crowley ) .
Hubbard considered that psychiatry controlled most of society and was struggling to create a 1984 world .
Hubbard and Crowley both posit the ability of the person to leave his or her body at times .
Crowley states that the way to learn to leave your body is to mock up a body like your own in front of your physical body .
Eventually you will learn to leave your physical body with your " astral body " and travel and view at will without physical restrictions .
Hubbard teaches the same , and his method of " exteriorization " is to tell the person to " have preclear mock up own body " which will send the person outside his body .
Both Crowley and Hubbard use an equilateral triangle pointing up in a circle as one of their group 's symbols .
Both use Volume 0 instead of Volume 1 to begin enumerating their works .
Crowley 's notion of " the will " : " The original definition of Scientology 8- 8008 was the attainment of infinity by the reduction of the apparent infinity and power of the MEST [ Matter , Energy , Space , Time ] universe to a zero for himself , and the increase of the apparent zero of one 's own universe to an infinity for oneself ...
It can be seen that [ the ] infinity [ symbol ] stood upright makes the number eight " .
Which is to say , the essential idea of Scientology is to raise the power of the individual 's will or intention to " an infinity " .
This aim is held in common with all magical systems ( Cavendish quotes Crowley " the Great Work is the raising of the whole man in perfect balance to the power of Infinity " , The Magical Arts , p.5 ) .
The exercises used in the attempt to achieve this - especially those in The Creation of Human Ability ( some of which were on the original " OT 5 " course ) - are ritual magic disguised as therapy .
Adopting the same stated purpose for Scientology as Crowley had for his Magic , Hubbard says , in a 1952 taped Scientology lecture : " Our whole activity tends to make an individual completely independent of any limitation . "
In Crowley 's Organization are several grade levels .
To reach the Grade of Adeptus Exemptus " The Adept must prepare and publish a thesis setting forth His knowledge of the Universe , and his proposals for its welfare and progress .
He will thus be known as the leader of a school of thought . "
It is apparent that Hubbard has fulfilled this requirement .
The " creative processing " of Hubbard 's 1952 Philadelphia Doctorate Course derives substantially from the work of black magician Aleister Crowley .
One could go on for quite some time listing the similarities between Crowley 's and Hubbard 's theories and writings , but for additional information the reader is encouraged to investigate for him or herself .
Scientology ’s symbols and the Satanic
The RTC ( a main Scientology corporation ) symbol contains the Dianetics triangle , which is a common magical symbol , representing the door of the Cabala , the letter Daleth .
Hubbard indeed assigned it to the Greek equivalent of Daleth , Delta .
The triangle on its base is also the symbol of Set , the Egyptian god called by some " the destroyer of man " , the male equivalent of Babalon .
Indeed Crowley equates Set with Satan .
Hubbard also used the " Daleth " triangle of the Egyptian destroyer - god Set as the Dianetic symbol .
Hubbard copied the back of Crowley 's Tarot - cards , a distinctively marked cross , which he used for his main Scientology church cross and symbol .
The Sea Organization symbol of Scientology 's elite paramilitary division is also interesting .
The five pointed star , or pentacle is the most commonly known symbol of magical power .
It is held between two thirteen - leaved laurels .
The theta symbol used by Scientology is the central symbol of Crowley 's Ordo Templi Orientis , where it denotes " Thelma " or the will .
Perhaps Hubbard's " thetan " is pronounced to match with a lisped " Satan " ?
He was , after all , wry in his humor and such a subtle perverse twist and deceit of lower initiates would be entirely congruent with classical Satanism .
Crowley 's order - the OTO - had a common origin with the Thule group to which several members of the Nazi hierarchy belonged ( including deputy party chairman Rudolph Hess ) .
The sig rune used by the Nazis - appears on the Scientology International Management Organization 's symbol - a red square enclosing a white disc and set off by four lightning flashes or sig runes .
The swastika of the Nazi flag has been replaced by the Scientology " S and double triangle " .
The symbol of the Religious Technology Center is surrounded by sig runes .
The sig rune is otherwise peculiar to the Nazis .
L. Ron , junior , was sure that the teachings of the pre-Nazi Germanen Orden and the Thule secret societies had passed directly to his father by courier .
No explanation is given for using these sig runes by Scientology .
At the time that both of these symbols were introduced , Hubbard also created the International Finance Police , headed by the International Finance Dictator .
An significant choice of words .

While Hubbard was supposedly researching his Dianetics in the late 1940s , he was in fact engaging in magical rituals , and trying out hypnosis both on himself and others .
During the 1984 Armstrong trial against Scientology , extracts from Hubbard 's voluminous self - hypnotic affirmations were read into the record .
The statements , hundreds of pages of them , are written in red ink and Hubbard frequently drew pictures of the male genitalia alongside the text .
Amongst his affirmations to himself we find " " Men are my slaves " , " Elemental Spirits are my slaves " and " You can be merciless whenever your will is crossed and you have every right to be merciless " " All women shall succumb to my charms !
All mankind shall grovel at my feet and not know why . "
L. Ron Hubbard repeatedly played them back to himself while under the influence of hallucinatory drugs such as mescaline and cocaine .
Was Hubbard 's evil intention to secretly subjugate no less than all of mankind ?
In 1938 in a letter to the first of Hubbard 's three wives he said , " I have high hopes of smashing my name into history so violently that it will take legendary form ... "
More from the sacred scriptures of Hubbard .
" THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN CONTROL PEOPLE IS TO LIE TO THEM .
You can write that down in your book in great big letters .
The only way you can control anybody is to lie to them . "
" If you really want to enslave people tell them that you are going to give them total freedom . "
( At the top of the Scientology grade chart of levels of initiate attainment at the OT 8 level is the benefit obtained from that level .
At OT 8 it is written " Total Freedom . " )
Of practitioners unlicensed by him Hubbard said " Harass these persons in any possible way . "
Nor did Hubbard exclude the possibility of murder against those who opposed him .
The " Suppressive Person declare " and the " Fair Game Law " speak reams in terms of Hubbard 's true intent and spiritual nature .
" An enemy may be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist ... may be tricked , sued , lied to , or destroyed . "
From the words of L. Ron Hubbard in HCO policy letter of 18 October 1967 , known as the " Fair Game Policy . "
" A suppressive person becomes fair game .
By fair game is meant may not be further protected by the codes and disciplines of Scientology ... They can not be granted the rights and beingness ordinarily accorded rational beings and so place themselves beyond any consideration for their feelings or well being ... The homes , property , places , abodes of persons who have been active in attempting to suppress Scientology are all beyond the protection of Scientology ethics . "
More from the mouth of L Ron Hubbard : " When you move off a point of power , pay all your obligations on the nail , empower your friends completely and move off with your pockets full of artillery , potential blackmail on every erstwhile rival , unlimited funds in your private account and the addresses of experienced assassins and go live in Bulgaria and bribe the police ....
" So to live at all in the shadow or employ of a power you must yourself gather and USE enough power to hold your own - without just nattering to the power to kill Pete ' , in straightforward or more suppressive veiled ways to him as these wreck the power that supports yours .
He does n't have to know all the bad news and if he 's a power really he wo n't ask all the time , What are all those dead bodies doing at the door ? '
And if you are clever , you never let it be thought HE killed them - that weakens you and also hurts the power source .
Well , boss , about all those dead bodies , nobody at all will suppose you did it .
She over there , those pink legs sticking out , did n't like me . '
" Well , ' he 'll say if he really is a poor , why are you bothering me with it if its done and you did it .
Where 's my blue ink ? '
Or , Skipper three shore patrolmen will be along soon with your cook , Dober , and they 'll want to tell you he beat up Simson . '
Who 's Simson ? '
He 's a clerk in the office enemy downtown . '
" Good , when they 've done it , take Dober down to the dispensary for any treatment he needs .
Oh yes .
Raise his pay .'....
" ... we all are n't on the stage with our names in lights , always push power in the direction of anyone on whose power you depend .
It may be more money for the power , or more ease , or a snarling defense of the power to a critic , or even the dull thud of one of his enemies in the dark , or the glorious blaze of the whole enemy camp as a birthday surprise ....
Real powers are developed by tight conspiracies of this kind pushing someone up in whose leadership they have faith . "
( From the policy directive " The Responsibilities of Leaders " by L. Ron Hubbard . )
Hubbard on compassion and ethics , " This universe is a rough universe .
Its a deadly serious universe .
Only the strong survive .
Only the ruthless can own it . "
( From The History of Man by L Ron Hubbard , p.38 . )
" Only a barbarian minister is a man of God . "
" The purpose of ethics is to remove counter - intentions from the environment . "
( HCO policy letter of June 18 , 1968 . )
In Booklet of the Scientology Professional Auditors Course ( 1982 ) , states .
" A very effective thought control technique could be worked out from Scientology which could be used to make individuals into WILLING slaves . " ( emphasis added )
Passing of the mantle of the beast , or just random unconnected events ?
According to Hubbard 's son L. Ron Hubbard , Jr. , his father considered himself to be the successor to Crowley when Crowley died in 1947 ; he believed that he had taken on " the mantle of the Beast . "
Hubbard told his son that Scientology actually began on December the 1st , 1947 , the day Aleister Crowley died .
According to this son Hubbard 's purpose in Scientology was to " crack souls , " to bringing unknowing people under his control and to use them as channels for satanic purposes .
Is this soul cracking the process of Scientology 's secret initiations ?
Is it the indelible marking or possession of the souls of the initiates ?
In one of the secret Scientology initiations called the Clearing Course the initiate is instructed to locate and audit out " the Light . "
In a hypnotic trance the initiate keeps working on removing " the power " the Light " has over them until " the Light " can no longer have any effect on them .
After completing this level of initiation the person is declared " cleared " and given a Clear number .
Initiates are numbered in the succession of when they go Clear .
The initiate wears their clear number that is engraved onto the back of a small silver bracelet that is worn almost all the time .
The clear number list is published periodically and great attention is given to announcing more numbered Clears each year .
A peculiar event occurred aboard Hubbard 's flagship , the Apollo , in 1973 .
Those aboard ship responsible for overseeing the management of Scientology organizations were involved in a ceremony called the Kali ceremony after the Hindu goddess of destruction .
The whole event was staged very seriously , and the managers were led into a dimly lit hold of the ship and ordered to destroy models of their organizations .
A few years before , a high - ranking Sea Organization Officer claims to have been ordered to Los Angeles where he was meant to mount an armed attack on a magician 's sabat .
He did not mount the attack but claims that the meeting happened exactly where Hubbard had told him it would .
In the original " Operating Thetan section VII course " , Scientologists were given exercises which would supposedly lead to the ability to implant thoughts into another person 's mind .
Scientologists believe that they will ultimately be capable of psychic feats including telepathy and telepathic control of others ( the aim of all forms of black magic ) .
In 1976 , Hubbard ordered a secret research project into the teachings of gnostic groups .
He had already carried out a project to determine which of his ship 's crew members were " soldiers of light " and which " soldiers of darkness " .
The latter group were apparently promoted .
During the 1952 Philadelphia lectures while discussing religion and the Antichrist Hubbard quipped , " Who do you think I am ? "
The audience laughed it off .
Also in Scientology 's Philadelphia Doctorate Course lectures , Hubbard discusses occult and black magic of the middle ages .
" The magical cults of the 8th , 9th , 10th , 11th and 12th centuries in the Middle East were fascinating .
The only modern work that has anything to do with them is a trifle wild in spots , but is a fascinating work in itself , and that 's the work of Aleister Crowley - the late Aleister Crowley - my very good friend . "
Scientology 's secret anti-Christianity
New Church members are told that Scientology 's policy is to " Change no man 's religion " and they are also assured that Scientology doctrine does not conflict with any other religions , and indeed it is consistent and supportive of ALL religions , past and present .
Scientology promotes to the public that : " Scientologists hold the Bible as a holy work and have no argument with the Christian belief that Jesus Christ was the Savior of Mankind and the Son of God .
" We share Christ 's goals for man 's achievements of wisdom , good health and immortality . "
Christianity is among the faiths studied by Scientology ministerial students .
There are probably many types of redemption .
That of Christ was to go to heaven . "
Scientology states as well that : " The Church has no dogma concerning God . "
Scientology publishes these statements as part of its " catechism . "
Scientology has recently distributed promotional materials ( The " What is Scientology ? " book ) containing these representations to every member of the U.S. Congress , to libraries , to the media , to educators , to judges , and to people of influence all across this the U.S and in other parts of the world .
The main target of Scientology 's promotion and marketing are Christians , and by far the largest percentage of Scientology 's members come from Christian backgrounds .
Using Scientology 's own figures from " What is Scientology ? "
Christians account for fifty - three percent of its members .
The second largest percentage comes from Judaism , which worships the same God , Jehovah , as Christianity .
From the following the reader will see that Scientology secretly teaches that the God of Christianity and Judaism is an implant .
( In the Scientology dictionary an implant is defined as , 1 .
A painful and forceful means of overwhelming a being with artificial purpose or false concepts in a malicious attempt to control and suppress him .
( Scientology Auditor No. 71 ASHO ) 2 .
An electronic means of overwhelming the thetan [ the individual themselves ] with a significance .
( Hubbard Communication Office Bulletin 8 May 1963 ) .
Scientology enforces the acceptance of the implant teaching with its system of " ethics " punishments , its " auditing procedures , " and its institutionalized mockery of God and Christ .
Anyone in Scientology who professed a belief in Christ , or God , or who sought help through prayer , was subtly viewed and handled as a " psychotic . "
Such a person was segregated , given special auditing to break his belief , and , if the " aberration " persisted , he would be " off- loaded . "
Members learned quickly inside Scientology to disavow any belief in God , or to not mention Him , or to not look to Him for wisdom or help , and to view Christians as " aberrated " and " dramatizing the Christ implant . "
Members learn very quickly that , inside Scientology , even thinking of Christ or God as real was labeled as an " other practice , " a punishable " ethics offense " or " overt , " which would become the subject of a " security check " on Scientology 's lie detector , its " E- meter . "
A former Scientologist states that : " While on the confidential class 8 course in Scotland , listening to Hubbard 's twenty lectures taped just weeks previously on the Apollo in Corfu , Greece , I was exposed to , among other things , Hubbard 's opinion of Christianity : " Somebody on this planet , about 600 B.C. found some pieces of " R6 " ( R6 is the name of an special implant . )
I do n't know how they found it ; either by watching madmen or something .
But since that time they have used it .
And it became what is known as Christianity . "
Many of Hubbard 's early views on Christianity and other religions views expressed in the early 1950's Philadelphia Doctorate Course .
The series covers 62 taped lectures .
Students on the OT 8 course listen to all these tapes as part of their OT 8 initiation .
On 9 December 1952 , Hubbard lectured on " What 's wrong with This Universe : A Working Package for the Auditor " .
Hubbard describes some of the " between lives " implants , that supposedly occur to everyone after they die .
In his later writings , Hubbard claimed that all religions came from " implants . "
In the secret initiation of OT 2 the initiate has to visualize in while trance " inventing and destroying religions . "
Hubbard 's later writings , in the 1960's , and especially in the 1980 OT 8 document , also re-assert that Christianity was also an implant .
In this tape he states : " You 'll find out thousands of years before the year one A.D. earth , you will have facsimiles and dolls made up like Christ .
FAC One ' , a million years ago , is occasionally rigged with Christ , and the devil and an angel .
It 's a fascinating thing , it 's an old game . "
( A facsimile is a mental image picture , recorded in the mind .
Hubbard described FAC
One as probably a supersonic shot in the forehead , chest and stomach , incapacitating and reducing the size and function of the pineal gland . )
In several taped lectures made in England in the 1960's , Hubbard stated that an alien space organization , called the Markab Confederacy implanted their own troops before they sent them off on missions .
Hubbard claimed the Scientology organizational structure was modeled after the Galactic Confederation , of which he was a part of .
In the infamous OT 8 document of 1980 , Hubbard wrote that Christ was a Markabian agent , and Hubbard was a high - ranking official in the Galactic Patrol .
In the 1950's , Hubbard wrote a series of newsletters about his technical " discoveries " and called them PABS ( Professional Auditor Bulletins ) .
In PAB 31 Hubbard writes : " Religion does much to keep the assumption in restimulation , being basically a control mechanism used by those who have sent the preclear into a body .
You will find the cross as a symbol all over the universe , and the Christ legend as implant in preclears a million years ago . "
In the same article , Hubbard infers that Jesus Christ was an agent of a mind - control organization that was imported to Earth : " A few operating thetans scarcely could lead to trouble .
Witness the chaos resulting from the activities and other determinism technology of one operating thetan , 2,000 years ago .
It is despicable and utterly beneath contempt to tell a man he must repent , that he is evil .
Those who talk most about peace on earth and good - will among men themselves carry forward the seas of unrest , war and chaos . "
In HCO bulletin of 18 July 1959 Hubbard wrote as a " Historical Note " : " The whole Christian movement is based on the victim .
Compulsion of the overt - motivator sequence .
They won by appealing to victims .
We can win by converting victims .
Christianity succeeded by making people into victims .
We can succeed by making victims into people . "
Hubbard 's criticism of Christian confessionals is utter hypocrisy , in view of his organization 's policy of leaking the contents of confessionals and transgressions culled from the confidential records of dissident present and former church members .
In HCO bulletin 21 January 1960 he writes ,
" Some Churches used a mechanism of confession .
This was a limited effort to relieve a person of the pressure of his overt acts .
Later the mechanism of confession was employed as a kind of blackmail by which increased contribution could be obtained from the person confessing . "
Hubbard continued his " research " on the " insidious genesis of Christianity " and in the " Heaven " bulletin of 11 May 1963 he released his latest " objective " findings , which were : " Based on over a thousand hours of research auditing , analyzing the facsimiles of the reactive mind , and with the help of a Mark V Electrometer .
It is scientific research and is not in any way based upon the mere opinion of the researcher ...
The contents of this HCO bulletin discover the apparent underlying impulses of religious zealots and the source of the religious mania which terrorized Earth over the ages and has given religion the appearance of insanity . "
In his much touted 1950 book , " Dianetics , the Modern Science of Mental Health " , Hubbard asserted that " engrams " were the root cause of ALL human aberrations and psychosomatic illnesses .
With his new discoveries of what transpired in Heaven , Hubbard offered a new cause of the human dilemma : " The Goals - Problems - Mass ( GPM ) implants , which are the apparent basic source of aberration and human travail , which began with the goal to Forget , were cynically done `in Heaven ' .
Hubbard dismissed the concerns of some members about his disparagement and cynicism about other religions : " For a long while , some people have been cross with me for my lack of cooperation in believing in a Christian Heaven , God and Christ .
I have never said I did n't disbelieve in a Big Thetan but there was certainly something very corny about Heaven et al .
" Now I have to apologize .
There was a Heaven .
Not too unlike , in cruel betrayal , the heaven of the Assassins in the 12th Century who , like everyone else , dramatized the whole track implants if a bit more so .
The symbol of the crucified Christ is very apt indeed .
It 's the symbol of a thetan betrayed . "
Hubbard describes the incident as occurring 43 + trillion years ago .
The stunned thetan was placed in a doll body and tra
Hundreds of Chinese students have held protests in two British cities protesting at how media outlets , including the BBC , have covered the run-up to the Beijing Olympics .
More than 1,000 people , mainly students , gathered outside the BBC 's offices in Manchester , north - west England , while around 300 staged a demonstration outside the Houses of Parliament in London .
Holding up banners , they expressed concern about how the media had covered the Olympic torch relay as well as last month 's unrest in Tibet .
" I was in London ... during the torch relay on April 6 and we saw thousands of students coming from all over the UK just to support the torch relay and were really excited about that , " London protester Becky Qin told BBC television .
" But when I went back to Cambridge and saw the recorded version of BBC News 24 , we were disappointed to see nothing about the supporting groups at all .
" It was as if the torch was just struggling its way through London and it was all about how people were so resentful about it " .
She also said the broadcaster had provided " blurry numbers " about how many people had died in Tibet .
In Manchester , organiser Tian Yang said " The way they frame the story is biased .
There is only one side of the story .
They take their views from Tibetan Government and the Western petitions .
" All we want is more people to listen to our voice and Chinese people 's voices because they are only interviewing the Tibetan separatists . "
The Olympic torch 's parade around the world ahead of the games , which start in August , has been hit by repeated demonstrations by protesters concerned about China 's human rights record .
In London , 37 people who tried to disrupt the procession were arrested .
Violence broke out in Tibet 's capital Lhasa on March 14 following four days of peaceful protests against Chinese rule .
Exiled Tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have died in the subsequent Government crackdown , while China says Tibetan " rioters " have killed 18 civilians and two policemen .

I recently heard from an anti-war student I met while I was speaking at a college in northern Vermont .
The e-mail included the following query :
“ I told you about how I wanted to build a career around social activism and making a difference .
You told me that one of the most important things was to make myself reputable and give people a reason to listen to you .
I think this is some of the best advice I ’ve received .
My issue however is that you mentioned joining the military as a way to do this and mentioned how that is how you fell into it .
…
We talked extensively about all of our criticisms of the military currently and our foreign policy . …
What I do n’t understand is , how can you [ advise ] someone who wants to make a difference with the flawed system , to join that flawed system ? ”
The question is a valid one .
Throughout my travels in the United States , where I interact with people from progressive anti-war groups , I am often confronted with the seeming contradiction of my position .
I rail against the war in Iraq ( and the potential of war with Iran ) and yet embrace , at times enthusiastically , the notion of military service .
It gets even more difficult to absorb , at least on the surface , when I simultaneously advocate counter - recruitment as well as support for those who seek to join the armed services .
The notion that the military and citizens of conscience should be at odds is a critical problem for our nation .
That confrontation only exacerbates the problems of the soldier and the citizen , and must be properly understood if it is to be defeated .
Let us start by constructing a framework in which my positions can be better assessed .
First and foremost , I do not view military service as an obligation of citizenship .
I do view military service as an act of good citizenship , but it can under no circumstance be used as a litmus test for patriotism .
There are many ways in which one can serve his or her nation ; the military is but one .
I am a big believer in the all - volunteer military .
For one thing , the professional fighting force is far more effective and efficient than any conscript force could ever be .
There are those who argue that a draft would level the playing field , spreading the burdens and responsibilities associated with a standing military force more evenly among the population .
Those citizens whose lives would be impacted through war ( namely those of draft age and their immediate relatives ) would presumably be less inclined to support war .
Conversely , the argument goes , with an all - volunteer professional force , the burden of sacrifice is limited to that segment of society which is engaged in the fighting , real or potential .
Two points emerge : First , the majority of society not immediately impacted by the sacrifices of conflict will remain distant from the reality of war .
Second , even when the costs of conflict become discernable to the withdrawn population , the fact that the sacrifice is being absorbed by those who willingly volunteered somehow lessens any moral outcry .
I will submit that these are valid observations , and indeed have been borne out in America ’s response to the Iraq war tragedy .
However , simply because something exists does n’t make it right .
The collective response to the Iraq war on the part of the American people is not a result of there not being a draft , but rather poor citizenship .
An engaged citizenry would not only find sufficient qualified volunteers to fill the ranks of our military , but would also personally identify with all those who served so that the loss of one was felt by all .
The fact that many Americans today view the all - volunteer force not so much as an extension of themselves , but more along the lines of a “ legion ” of professionals removed from society , illustrates the yawning gap that exists between we the people and those we ask to defend us .
Narrowing this gap is not something that can be accomplished simply through legislation .
Reinstating the draft is illusory in this regard .
There is a more fundamental obstacle to the reunion of our society and those who take an oath in the military to uphold and defend the Constitution .
Void of this bond , the inherent differences of civilian and military life will serve to drive a wedge between the two , regardless of whether the military force is drafted or volunteer .
Lacking a common understanding of the foundational principles upon which the nation was built , a citizenry will grow to view military service as an imposition , as opposed to an obligation .
Simply put , one cannot willingly defend that which one does not know and understand .
The fundamental ignorance that exists in America today about the Constitution creates the conditions which foster the divide between citizen and soldier that permeates society today .
America must take ownership of its military , not simply by footing the bill , but by assuming a moral responsibility for every aspect of military service .
The vehicle for doing this has been well established through the Constitution : the legislative branch of government , the Congress , which serves to represent the will of the people .
Congress , especially the House of Representatives , was never conceived of as separate and distinct from the people , but rather as one with the people , directly derived from their collective will via the electoral process .
Unfortunately today , few Americans identify with Congress .
An “ us versus them ” mentality pervades .
This mentality creates the crack in the moral and social contract which exists regarding a citizenry and its military .
Congress is responsible for maintaining the military .
Congress is the branch of government mandated with the responsibility for declaring war .
When the bond is strained between the people and Congress , the bond between citizen and soldier is broken .
Congress , left to its own devices , will begin to view the military not as an extension of its constituents , but rather as a commodity to be traded and used in a highly politicized fashion .
This is the reality we find ourselves in today ( and indeed which has existed for some time ) .
The 2006 midterm elections highlight this reality , where a strong anti-war sentiment upon the part of the voters resulted in a Democratic majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate .
Having assumed the mantle of legislative power , however , those who were elected on the coattails of anti-war sentiment were able to shun their anti-war constituents .
They did so by taking full advantage of the reality that the anti-war movement was in fact not a movement at all , but rather a concept pushed forward by a disparate mass without much political viability .
Where anti-war sentiment did in fact cross over from the ranks of the progressive left and into the mainstream of American society , it was quickly quashed through the dishonest logic that if one truly supported the troops ( as most red - blooded Americans swear they do ) , then one must by extension support the mission .
This flawed connectivity empowered Congress to sidestep the issue of withdrawing American forces from Iraq , and enabled it to continue rubber - stamping funding for a war which long ago lost any connection , perceived or otherwise , to the general security of the American people .
And so U.S. service members continue to fight and die in Iraq , a conflict which grows more unpopular with the American people each passing day .
The question thus emerges :
What is the appropriate response on the part of the American citizenry ?
While we insulate ourselves from political duplicity , the soldiers ultimately pay the price for the cowardice of those whom we elect to represent us in higher office .
This seems to be the path taken by most Americans , who have grown numbly indifferent to the incessant stream of disappointment over the continued failure of Congress to truly represent the will of the people .
We have therefore built a wall which separates we the people from the one aspect of republican governance which is , by design , supposed to give us voice .
In doing so , we likewise create a buffer between citizen and soldier , as those who are constitutionally mandated to fund the care , equipping and utilization of the military now operate in ambiguity created by the vacuum of citizen apathy .
Thus liberated from the moral compass provided by the people , Congress has lost its ability to defend its own role in governance , and over time has demeaned its constitutional mandate by transferring powers inherent to the legislative branch to an executive branch which has assumed the role of caretaker of the military .
By vesting absolute power in the hands of the executive , Congress has all but assured that America has become a nation no longer governed by the rule of law , but rather the rule of man .
This sort of tyranny is what Americans fought a revolution to free themselves from 233 years ago .
An executive that operates in accordance with a unitary theory of governance is one that views the capacity to defend the state as being in fact the capacity to defend the realm .
As such , one sees a gravitation of emphasis : Rather than focusing on external threats to the collective , the realm becomes obsessed with internal threats to its ability to retain power .
The Patriot Act is a clear - cut example of how a unitary executive has undermined and corrupted the legitimate law enforcement mechanisms of the land by vesting the executive with powers normally associated solely with the legislative branch .
In this regard , we see the armed forces similarly abused , with the creation of military command structures ( namely U.S. Northern Command ) which exist not to protect the people , but rather protect the realm from the people .
This is not a stated objective , but rather one inferred from the fact that , for the first time since the imposition of posse comitatus in 1876 , the United States has positioned its armed forces so that they can participate in normal state law enforcement .
In short , instead of serving as a force of protection for the American people from external threats , the military views the American people as the threat , “ targets ” which need to be investigated as potential threats to the military .
An example of just how far off track the executive branch , facilitated by an all too complicit legislative branch , has strayed when it comes to the common defense is the Pentagon ’s controversial Counterintelligence Field Activity , ostensibly created in a post - 9/11 world to “ … protect the [ Defense ] department by supporting the detection and neutralization of foreign espionage . ”
The CFA operates under the umbrella of U.S. Northern Command , created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks to ostensibly safeguard the American homeland .
A major aspect of the CFA ’s work is something known as the Joint Protection Enterprise Network , or JPEN .
The JPEN network enables the Defense Department to share unverified information with civilian police departments , the FBI and other government agencies such as the National Security Agency ( NSA ) .
Originally dubbed Project Protect America , the JPEN system came into being in July 2003 with the full support of then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
The heart and soul of the JPEN system is the “ Threat and Local Observation Notice , ” or TALON report , the brainchild of then - Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz .
In the conduct of its work , the CFA created and distributed thousands of TALON reports via the JPEN system on the activities of private U.S. citizens , with a particular focus of those engaged in anti-war protests .
The CFA is slated in the near future to be morphed into a larger Defense Intelligence Agency - run Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence activity .
Far from limiting the scope and scale of the activities currently undertaken by the CFA , this new organization will simply increase the level of illegal and unconstitutional activities currently undertaken by the CFA against the American “ target . ”
The fact that the U.S. military now views the American citizenry as its target , as opposed to the object of its defense , shows just how broken the circle of trust is between citizen and soldier .
Additional TALON reports are being assembled on anyone deemed to be a potential threat to the U.S. military , including all who are involved in “ counter - recruitment ” activities designed to provide alternatives to military service for today ’s youths .
This myopic approach toward installation and facility security undertaken by the Pentagon is not only intellectually weak but constitutionally prohibited .
The legislative branch , operating amid constituent apathy , continues to fail in its mission of upholding the rule of law .
In similarly deplorable fashion , the Pentagon has allowed itself to be hijacked by the radical right wing of the Republican Party .
The fact that Fox News has become the channel of choice for the U.S. military speaks volumes about the mind - set which has gripped those who lead it .
The military has always been a conservative institution .
Yet when wearing the uniform of the United States serves more as a front for defending a political ideology ( a rabid one at that ) rather than upholding and defending the Constitution , the military does itself a disservice .
The disconnect between those who serve in the military and those whom they are sworn to protect can be fatal when one realizes the recruiting pool no longer identifies with the military as a legitimate expression of patriotism and citizenship .
The scope of this ideological hijacking is broad , yet barely recognized .
One can glimpse just how deep and nefarious this ideological shift is when one considers the extent to which evangelical Christians have infiltrated the U.S. Air Force Academy , proselytizing their heavily politicized religion to the future officers and leaders of that service .
The past comments of Lt. Gen. William Boykin , a decorated Army Special Operations veteran who described America ’s post - 9/11 “ war on terror ” as a conflict between “ Christian ” America and “ radical Islam , ” are widely embraced within the U.S. military .
President Bush has echoed Boykin in his speeches and statements , and the military ’s favorite presidential candidate , Republican Sen .
John McCain , has become the embodiment of Boykin ’s philosophy .
The Constitution prohibits the notion that America be defined as a Christian nation .
To allow the military , sworn as it is to uphold and defend that document , to posture itself as Christian , becoming in effect the “ sword of God , ” is unthinkable and unforgivable .
The implications of such posturing are far - reaching , especially from the military recruitment standpoint .
The all - volunteer military succeeds when it attracts to its ranks those who have a sincere desire to serve their nation .
It succeeds greatly when those it attracts come from the broadest possible cross section of the American demographic .
There has always been an economic aspect to the all - volunteer force ; service is not slavery , and the military has always promised the security of a middle - class lifestyle to those who choose to enlist .
But military service , properly motivated , has never been solely about the money .
It is about defending a greater good , the people of the United States of America and their values and ideals as defined by the Constitution .
It has become increasingly difficult to motivate enough of today ’s youths to serve in the armed services based upon the call of duty alone .
One of the primary reasons for this shortfall is the unfortunate perception , not improperly derived , that military service is not in keeping with the concept of “ doing the right thing . ”
This perception , born of an unpopular war and the dishonest foreign policies of successive administrations , is further exaggerated by the reality that the military not only operates as a separate and distinct part of American society ( this has always been the case ) but , due in large part to post - 9/11 hysteria , has been positioned to view the American people as a threat .
The inherent problems of the military trying to recruit from a population base which is under attack from the military are self - evident .
Genuine patriotism was once a viable recruitment pitch .
Now , economic incentives , false promises and pseudo - patriotism are used as the bait to lure the youths of today into America ’s legions .
Like the legions of the past , these new warriors march not on behalf of the citizens they are sworn to protect , but rather the emperor who commands them .
This may be viewed as an overly harsh statement , but there is no other way to describe the abuses of a unitary executive who positions himself above the Constitution and Congress in a time of war .
Having described the current state of the military and military service in this manner , why would I ever encourage a citizen of military age to consider service in the armed forces ?
First and foremost , one needs to understand that the entire military system has not been corrupted .
There are still men and women of honor who serve with dedication and pride .
They are , in fact , in the majority .
It takes only a few bad apples to spoil the lot , however , and our military today , thanks to a nebulous mission and lower recruiting standards , is full of bad apples .
Likewise , to quote a Russian general , “ a fish stinks from its head , ” and nothing smells worse today than the “ head ” of the United States .
Our commander in chief has disgraced the office he was entrusted with , and in doing so has severely damaged the foundation of American civil society as well as the institutions sworn to uphold and defend it .
The solution , however , cannot be “ cut and run . ”
Simply identifying the problem and pointing a finger at the perpetrators will do nothing to resolve these critical issues .
Our military cannot change unless we the people re-establish the link between ourselves and the legislative branch of government and rebuild the bond of trust between citizen and soldier .
This cannot happen in stages , but rather must occur simultaneously .
While the vast majority of America struggles to regain its moral and ethical compass through the re-establishment of the rule of law as set forth by the Constitution , we need to continue to maintain a military which is capable of defending us .
This requires good people to serve , even if the conditions of their service are not ideal .
Do I want to have an intelligent , morally grounded soldier on the front line in Iraq , making the decisions about the use of force in the framework of an illegal and unjust occupation , or do I want to relinquish that job to a former felon lacking even a high school diploma ?
Do I want the troops of today led by Bible - wielding zealots or Constitution - wielding patriots ?
While we struggle to re-establish the bond between citizen and soldier , we have an absolute requirement to ensure we continue to field a military composed of citizen soldiers .
The only way to prevent our military from becoming the new Roman Legion is to staff it with citizens of principle who reject such an abominable label .
We are a nation at war , not just abroad , but with ourselves .
Now , more than ever , we need citizens of standing to answer the call to service , not in the name of a criminal president or an illegal war , but rather in defense of the Constitution and all that it stands for , against all enemies , foreign and domestic .
This is not your economy .
It ’s not even your parents ’ economy .
To a surprising degree , this is your great - grandparents ’ economy .
Quietly , while attention has focused on the technology , finance and service sectors , businesses that stood astride 19th century industrial America but then collapsed have been resurrected to meet the needs of a feverishly industrializing world .
In the process , much of what Americans think they know about their economy is being upended .
Steel makers , railroads , mining concerns and agriculture , long considered part of a fading past , suddenly have bright futures .
And segments of the economy long lauded as the wave of the future are undergoing an old - fashioned , and very painful , consolidation .
“ The wheel has turned .
What was up is down , and what was down is up , ” said San Francisco investment executive Frank Husic .
“ And it ’s all because an emerging world wants to eat , drive and live in houses , things we take for granted and have for well over a century . ”

Dan Basse , president of AgResource Co. , a Chicago agricultural forecasting firm , agreed .
“ The tech industry offered us things to occupy our minds and entertain us .
But we ’re moving back to a world of stuff , whether that ’s vegetable oil or copper or zinc or cotton .
Stuff that you can hold in your hand and drop on your foot . ”
The twin turns of fortune for the nation ’s old and new economies are letting once - struggling behemoths such as U.S. Steel Corp. put modern marvels such as Microsoft Corp. to shame .
The price of U.S. Steel ’s stock has shot up 1,000 % in recent years , while Microsoft ’s has essentially flat - lined .
And the changes are lifting much of America ’s geographic middle at the expense of its coasts .
Personal income in the nation ’s manufacturing , mining and farming states , which are concentrated in the heartland , has been growing at an average annual rate of 6.5 % in the last five years .
The rest of the country has managed only a 5.4 % pace , according to government statistics assembled by Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ The new trends in the economy bode well for the middle and very badly for the edges , ” Husic said .

There ’s one huge catch :
While the heartland ’s revival is producing lots of new revenue and profits for old - economy companies , and while it ’s pushing up the incomes of their employees , it ’s not generating lots of new jobs .
Still , those industries are doing substantially better than former high - growth sectors like finance or retail , which are laying off workers by the thousands .
And the benefits of fatter paychecks and steadier employment ripple throughout the heartland states to millions of people not directly involved in the booming industries .
The slow growth of new jobs does mean , however , that the spillover to the rest of the country is likely be quite limited , and the economy as a whole will have to keep relying on high tech and services if it is to experience new growth in income and employment .
Steel production has risen almost 5 % over the last five years , according to the American Iron and Steel Institute .
But steel employment has fallen 10 % , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Corn production has jumped 30 % during the same period , and farm payrolls have fallen by nearly the same percentage , U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show .

Dollar ’s drop
There ’s also a mitigating element in the revival .
As the value of the dollar has dropped sharply over the last five years , the prices that foreigners pay for U.S. pelletized iron ore , steel plates , corn and coal also has declined .
Once the overall U.S. economy recovers , the dollar is likely to head back up , erasing part of the advantage that U.S. farmers , miners and manufacturers now have .
Few analysts think , however , that the weak dollar alone is what ’s powering the comeback of the old economy , and few expect it to fade when the dollar recovers .

“ We ’re in the midst of 2 to 3 billion people around the world rising out of abject poverty and demanding they have a better living standard , ” said Daniel R. DiMicco , head of Nucor Corp. , America ’s largest steel company .
“ That means we ’ve got a 20 - to 30 - year bull market in basic stuff . ”
AgResource President Basse said , “ This is called globalization .
It turns out we have some things [ foreigners ] want too . ”
The new vitality is reflected in a major surge in exports of U.S. goods , up about 80 % over the last five years , to $ 316 billion in the first quarter of 2008 from $ 176 billion in the first quarter of 2003 , government figures show .
Foreign demand has helped drive U.S. Steel from a loss of $ 420 million five years ago to a nearly $ 880 - million gain last year .
Mining giant Freeport - McMoRan ’s profit is up 1,539 % , from $ 181.7 million to nearly $ 3 billion .
Fertilizer maker Mosaic Co.'s earnings went from $ 54 million for all of 2003 to $ 521 million for just the three months ended in February .

Contrast these performances with those of former darlings of finance and tech .
Insurance powerhouse American International Group Inc. swung from an $ 8 - billion profit five years ago to an almost $ 8 - billion loss last quarter .
Chip maker Intel Corp. , although still in the black , has seen its profit slide .
And the high - tech sector is experiencing the kind of consolidations -- and job reductions -- typical of a maturing industry , rather than a booming upstart .
Oracle Corp. has gobbled up PeopleSoft Inc. , Siebel Systems Inc. and BEA Systems Inc. , for instance , while Hewlett - Packard Co. agreed to acquire Electronic Data Systems Corp. for a whopping $ 13.9 billion this month and Microsoft is edging toward another attempt to gobble up Yahoo Inc .
“ We ’ll see more consolidation , not less , ” HP Chief Executive Mark Hurd said last fall at a technology conference in San Francisco , predicting that a few companies would end up with the capability to offer a full array of hardware , software and services to customers in all segments of the market .

Unlikely comeback
Meantime , the comeback of codger industries is flipping some of Americans ’ most prominent notions about the nation ’s economic past and future on their heads .
Consider that when he ran the Federal Reserve in the 1990s , Alan Greenspan liked to imagine how the actual physical weight of what the United States produced was falling as the economy shifted away from heavy industry and into computers , microchips and the almost completely ethereal Internet .
But the country ’s economic weight loss , if it ever really occurred , is coming to an end , say old - economy watchers , and with it near - total reliance on the promise of high tech .
Advertisement
Most Americans may also have assumed that , along with high tech , the future of the U.S. economy -- and that of most other developed nations -- lay with the service sector .
That ’s why , until recently , investors snapped up companies like global fast - food giant McDonald ’s Corp .
But as food prices have rocketed and agriculture has taken off , some investors have a new sweetheart : Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan , Canada , the world ’s largest supplier of a type of fertilizer that dates to the 14th century and is in increasing demand by farmers .
Today , the little - known firm is valued by the stock market at almost $ 64 billion , nearly as much as McDonald’s .
Similarly , it ’s been widely assumed that U.S. costs would always be much higher than those of the developing world .
But what do you find today ?
“ The United States has become one of the lowest - cost producers of steel in the world , ” said Michelle Applebaum , a top - ranked steel analyst with her own Chicago research firm .
Who ’s the high - cost producer ?
“ China . ”
Advertisement
One reason is that the U.S. is rich in basic resources , especially those that go into steel .
And many U.S. manufacturers have long relationships -- and long - term , fixed - price contracts -- with suppliers .
As rising demand for raw materials has driven up world prices , American producers have been relatively sheltered .
“ Nobody in America is buying ore at the inflated prices the Chinese are paying , ” Applebaum said .
The big exception is oil , but almost every country is paying its rapidly escalating price .
Wage gap narrows
Advertisement
Perhaps the most fiercely held assumption about the economy has been that U.S. manufacturers could never compete globally because Americans earned vastly more than foreign workers .
During the last several decades , though , the wages of many American workers have not grown at anything like the rates they used to .
In the last decade , they have n’t grown at anything like wages in much of the emerging world .
So the wage gap is narrowing .
Also , as rapidly industrializing countries such as China , India and Brazil demand more raw materials , driving up prices , labor costs are a dwindling factor in global competition .
“ Forget about labor costs .
That ’s all Kool - Aid talk , ” said DiMicco , steel company Nucor ’s CEO .
“ Hot - rolled sheet [ one of the major products of the steel industry ] is selling for $ 1,000 a ton today .
Our labor costs for everything are under $ 10 " per ton , he said .
“ It ’s become virtually insignificant . ”
Advertisement
And at least some old - economy companies are hustling to stay out front .
This month Nucor applied for permits to construct a $ 2 - billion steel mill in St. James Parish , La .
If approved , it would be the first integrated steel plant built in the U.S. in about four decades , DiMicco said .
“ It ’s back to basics , ” he said .

Here is a short list of items that you should take with you whenever you go on a hike or a camping trip .
For general disaster planning , it is probably also a good idea to have the survival collection ( from twelve to one ) in a small box in the trunk ( boot ) of your car .
This website is viewed all over the globe , and no one list is appropriate for all times and places .
There is probably no need to carry water when traveling down a fresh water river .
Special situations usually require a special kit .
Adjust this as necessary .
Also , this is only a guideline – Be responsible for your own safety .
It was tough to make the list short enough for ListVerse , and yes I probably did omit some important things , but hey , in a survival situation do we really need toilet paper ?
15 Good Quality Tent
Selecting from an ultra lights solos at a bit over 2
Lbs to family affairs that need a car to transport can be daunting .
A tent should be chosen based on what and where you expect to use it .
This is often the most expensive item in the kit , and depending on your sleeping bag , also the heaviest .
It is most important to right - size and right season your tent .
You should insist on putting it together in the store before you purchase it .
If they do n’t let you – take your money elsewhere .
And after you bring it home , put it up in rain / dark / etc. – just so you know how .
14 Sleeping Bag
Like a tent the where and when are critical : wet / dry , warm / cold .
Do n’t over do the temperature rating .
Buy for the coldest less a bit ( 10 - 20 degrees ) .
There is nothing more uncomfortable than a minus 20 bag in a French hostel in the summer .
Take off your shoes in the store and climb in .
Do n’t worry when other customers think you are crazy – you probably are and it ’s ok .
13 Camp Stove
Also take fuel , a metal cup , and a soup spoon .
I put these all together because these four items make the complete minimalist mess kit ( the knife is at # 3 ) .
The really cool stoves are tiny and can take almost any fuel .
MSR has an XGK EX that I suspect can run on just about anything .
Peak 1 has one called Xpedition with a twin burner but requires a propane / butane canister .
12 Nylon Cord
Get it anywhere .
1/8th or 3/16th inch should do it .
Not less than 10 feet , not more than is comfortable .
Also about 20 to 30 feet of fishing line .
Packs tight and , oh , so useful .
Depending on where you are going , you should add a hook or two , but always take the line .
11 Whistle and Signal Mirror
Just a plain ball type whistle and a flat metal mirror will do .
Or get fancy and find a signal mirror , one with an aiming sight .
ACR make the Hot Shot , but there are others .
If you travel with kids , the whistle should always be with them .
Even at the mall .
Make a family signal and teach it to the little ones .
10 Compass and Map
It is absolutely amazing how people can go into the woods without a map and compass .
Sure Lewis and Clark crossed a continent without a map , but they had mad skillz !
Do n’t cheap - out on the compass .
Read the instructions before you need it .
Do n’t rely on a GPS .
Batteries fail and most electronics die when you fall into the river .
9 Flashlight
There are two types that never need batteries .
A wind - up type or magnetic induction ( Faraday ) .
Neither one holds a light as long as a battery , you have to keep winding or shaking , but they will never go bad in the kit .
Most have LED bulbs that last way longer than an incandescent .
8 Sun Protection
I hope I get no flack on this entry , but I suggest that there is almost nothing as debilitating as a really bad burn – or even a slight one .
A hat or bandanna at all times is critical as well , especially for anyone who has thinning hair .
People tend to forget sunscreen up top and a scalp burn is horrid .
Oh , do the lip thing also .
7 Weather Gear
Sure the forecast says sunny .
But do n’t believe everything that you hear .
The weather can change rapidly in the hills and nothing drops your core temperature faster than being soaked to the skin .
I prefer ponchos to jackets , ( except in windy conditions ) they can also double as a tarp and rain collector .
Some places sell emergency ponchos for a few dollars .
Oh , and do n’t wear cotton in the winter .
Cotton holds the perspiration ( humidity ) next to your skin and you have a much better chance of freezing to death – not a good idea .
6 Space Blanket
Get one or more of these light weight life savers .
They can reflect about 90 % of your body heat .
Or check out the orange Space brand bags – that way if you do n’t make it , someone can find you .
5 First Aid Kit
A general purpose first aid kit is rather basic .
Customize it for your local conditions .
Each person in your party should carry at least a small basic kit .
Remember that iodine can be used as a wound disinfectant and to purify water ( 3 drops per liter , let it stand for ½ hour ) .
4 Fire Starter
You can take water proof matches , but a flint stick is better – practice first .
A basic flint stick is easy to carry and use .
The Strike Master Magnesium makes an incredibly hot spark , probably enough to ignite whatever tinder that you can find .
When you practice with this though , it probably best to do it outside .
3 Multi-Tool
Years ago the basic tool was a knife .
I still carry my Spyderco just about every time I leave the house .
But in my camping kit is a Leatherman Multi-tool .
With all of the garbage that people leave behind , a good multi-tool can be used to turn trash into gear .
I have n’t tried their new Skeletool CX yet , but it looks sweet .
2 Food
OK , this is a tough one .
Even if you are intending to be back home for an early dinner , throw a couple of bars ( Clif or power – not breakfast ) into the day pack .
Take things that make sense , though .
If you are going into a place where water tends to be scarce , freeze - dried beef stew is probably not a good choice .
And when faced with a truly survival situation , start the hunting and gathering as soon as you realize that you may not be home soon .
Getting food in the wild usually takes time , if you wait it may be too late .
1 Water Supplies
Assuming that you are in a low fresh water situation – take as much as you can reasonably carry .
You will wish you had more .
The human body needs this stuff more than anything else .
I know there is controversy over the plastic , but I ’ve been using the same Nalgene for years .
In 2005 , 22 billion plastic water bottles were tossed out in the US alone .
World wide the estimate is 5 times that .

One of the world 's most respected statesmen , Nelson Mandela , has condemned United States intervention in the Middle East as " a threat to world peace " .
In an interview with the US magazine , Newsweek published on Wednesday , the former South African president repeated his call for President George Bush not to launch attacks on Iraq .
Mandela on the US Bush motivated by arms sales and oil Dick Cheney a ' dinosaur ' US responsible for Iran 's Islamic revolution US action led to Taleban
He said that Mr Bush was trying to please the American arms and oil industries .
And Mr Mandela , 84 , called some of Mr Bush 's senior advisers , including Vice President Dick Cheney " dinosaurs " .
He said that the United States ' backing for a coup by the Shah of Iran in 1953 had led to that country 's Islamic revolution in 1979 .
On Afghanistan , Mr Mandela said that US support for the mujahideen ( including Osama Bin Laden ) against the Soviet Union and its refusal to work with the United Nations after the Soviet withdrawal led to the Taleban taking power .
" If you look at those matters , you will come to the conclusion that the attitude of the United States of America is a threat to world peace , " he said .
No evidence
Mr Mandela said that the US was clearly afraid of losing a vote in the United Nations Security Council .
Israel has weapons of mass destruction .
Nobody mentions that
Nelson Mandela
" It is clearly a decision that is motivated by George W Bush 's desire to please the arms and oil industries in the United States of America , " he said .
He said that no evidence had been presented to support the claim that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction , while former UN weapons inspector in Baghdad Scott Ritter has said there is no such evidence .
" But what we know is that Israel has weapons of mass destruction .
Nobody mentions that , " he said .
The former South African leader made it clear that the only member of the Bush team he respects is Colin Powell .
He called Mr Cheney a " dinosaur " and an " arch - conservative " who does not want Mr Bush " to belong to the modern age . "
Mr Mandela recalled that Mr Cheney had been opposed to his release from prison .
Clinton is using an anti-trade message to win over working class voters in Pennsylvania .
HRC Colombia ties do n't stop with Penn
Mark Penn is n’t the only Hillary Rodham Clinton supporter on the wrong side of the Colombia trade agreement .
The Democratic - leaning advocacy firm the Glover Park Group , former home to Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson , signed a $ 40,000 per month contract with the government of Colombia in April of 2007 to promote the very agreement that Clinton now rails against on the presidential campaign trail .
Advertisement
That means Glover Park Group was arguing the same position as Penn 's firm .
The contentious Clinton strategist and Burson - Marsteller chief executive lost his campaign job over the weekend after The Wall Street Journal revealed that he ’d met with Colombian officials to plot strategy on the pact .
Several other Glover Park employees have deep connections with the Clintons , including founding partner Joe Lockhart , who served as the White House press secretary under President Bill Clinton , and Joel Johnson , who was a senior communications adviser in the Clinton White House .
Six employees of Glover Park Group contributed a total of nearly $ 20,000 to Clinton ’s campaign in 2007 , according to data kept by the Center for Responsive Politics .
Wolfson , who is set to take over many responsibilities from the departing Penn , resigned from Glover Park last year to avoid conflicts of interest but retains an equity interest in the firm .
The tangled web of connections on the trade issue inside the Clinton camp illustrates the thin line in Washington between private and political advocacy .
Top campaign aides often spend their off - election years inside large firms with a complex array of clients .
The benefit of such arrangements is that a party or candidate ’s political brain - trust remains largely intact and ready to assemble quickly for the next political battle .
Republicans have trotted down this path for years .
Republican presidential hopeful John McCain ’s campaign is led by current and former lobbyists , some of whom are connected to such political boogiemen as subprime lenders .
But it ’s a trickier course for Democrats since their candidates often adopt populist themes that can conflict with a corporate client list .
Indeed , the latest Clinton brouhaha is a classic example of that .
The New York senator is using an anti-trade message to win over working class voters in Pennsylvania , a presidential primary most observers believe she must win big on April 22 to stay competitive with Democratic challenger Barack Obama , who also opposes the deal .
“ We ’ve got to have new trade policies before we have new trade deals , ” Clinton said last week .
“ That includes no trade deal with Colombia while violence against trade unionists continues in that country . ”
To avoid tarnishing either candidates or clients , many advisers take on voluntary campaign roles so the two ca n’t be directly linked .
Others seek to distance themselves from their private employers while working in the public arena .
And a few , like Penn , try to walk a tightrope by keeping both jobs at the same time .
Over the weekend , Penn tripped .
After taking a break from Clinton ’s anti-trade campaign to meet with his pro-trade Colombian clients , both parties dropped him .
At the time Glover Park got involved in the Colombia trade issue , Clinton ’s position on trade was less clear .
As it signed its contract last spring , Congressional Democrats seemed to have struck a deal with the White House to push it and three trade deals through Congress .
That subsequently fell apart after labor leaders objected .
At about the same time , Wolfson ’s leave of absence from Glover Park became effective .
He and his wife realized income of between $ 1 million and $ 5 million from selling part of their equity stake in Glover Park Group in November of 2006 .
But the couple still maintains an equity stake in the firm valued at from $ 500,000 to $ 1 million , according to a recent Capitol Hill financial disclosure filing .
Wolfson ’s wife , Terri McCullough , is the chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) .
In an e-mail to Politico , Wolfson said “ I took a leave from the firm last year and have no client contact and receive no salary from the firm . ”
Several Wolfson allies , who declined to be named , argued that his distant relationship with Glover Park Group was far different from Penn ’s ongoing involvement at Burson - Marsteller .
According to the Glover Park Group contract , which was disclosed to the U.S. Department of Justice last year , the firm was to work with ProExport Colombia , an entity of the Colombian Government Trade Bureau , in developing a strategy to promote the free trade agreement .
The contract called for Glover Park to identify the key concerns of members of Congress , develop a comprehensive government relations strategy , and pinpoint reporters , academics , and business leaders who could help make Colombia ’s pro-free trade argument , all in close coordination with Colombian government officials .
The contract was set for five months , beginning on April 2 , 2007 .
But it is not clear from public documents whether this is an ongoing effort .
Glover Park ’s report on the lobbying was to be addressed directly to the Colombian minister of trade and the Colombian ambassador to the United States , among other officials .
The contract was signed by Carl Smith , who is Glover Park ’s CEO and was previously chief of staff for Al Gore ’s 2000 presidential campaign .
Smith declined to comment for the record .

John Cusack movie takes on war profiteers David Edwards and Chris Tackett
Published : Saturday March 29 , 2008
|
Print This Email This John Cusack was on HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher and spoke about his upcoming film , War. Inc. , which according to Cusack focuses on the military - industrial complex .
The film , says Cusack , differs from other films inspired by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan because , it " has a much more absurdist take on [ war ] . "
Cusack added , " some things are so vicious if you did n't look at them through a different lens you could n't get out of bed .
And certainly the war profiteering , immorality and illegality of this disastrous , free - market Utopian enterprise out there is certainly well - documented . "
While explaining that the film shares similar themes as those found in Naomi Klein 's book , The Shock Doctrine , Cusack said , " the very core things that make up our government like wars or interrogation or border patrol , jailing , any of those types of things that you would think would be sacred things that would happen with the state are now being turned into for - profit enterprises .
And if you want all these things to be , if you want corporate ethics to be our national interest , then you have the situation we 're in now .
But right now , when you think that we 've out sourced everything to interrogation , which means torture is a cost - plus enterprise , I think you can see a complete spiritual bankruptcy to this whole neo -con movement .
It 's a nightmare beyond anything you can really imagine . "
Maher asked if these issues were just a result of a neo -conservative movement and Bush administration or evidence of a " rot in America itself that is a lot deeper . "
Cusack responded , " Yeah , I do think the issue goes deeper , a lot deeper . "
Adding later , " Some of these truths are so horrible you do n't want to think about that , but it 's just -- I mean the gig 's up .
If guys who are statesmen on CNN are also sitting on the board and are shareholders in some of the most profitable defense contractors in the world and they publicly make the case to go to war , got to war , then create a new market with the war , come back and speak evangelically about free markets that are n't free , these are n't particularly subtle fact and the stock prices jump 145 % and their companies are awarded $ 2.3 billion contract .
After a while you have to expose and shame and indict and hopefully convict the participants in this illegal immoral ideology . "
The full interview can be seen in the video below .
The Defense Department has n't kept close enough watch over the contractors working on its most important aircraft program , the Joint Strike Fighter .
And as a result , " the advanced aviation and weapons technology for the JSF program may have been compromised , " the Department of Defense 's Inspector General notes in a report , obtained by the Project on Government Oversight .
The Pentagon is working with eight other countries to build a single , stealthy , single - engine fighter that is supposed to be a low - cost replacement for a huge variety of aircraft – the A - 10 , F - 16 , F / A - 18 , even the British Harrier jump jets .
More than 2,400 JSFs are planned over the next several decades , at a cost of $ 337 billion .
But monitoring the 1,200 contractors working on the planes has proved to be a herculean effort for the Pentagon 's Defense Security Service , or DSS .
The Inspector General 's report does n't list any specific cases of classified information breaches .
But it does state , repeatedly , that the DSS cut regulatory corners , meant to protect the stealth jet 's secrets .
" DoD [ Department of Defense ] did not always employ sufficient controls to evaluate and correct potential unauthorized access to classified U.S. technology , " the report observes .
In particular , the audit found problems with how the Defense Department oversaw BAE Systems , the London - based arms - maker .
Defense Security Service officials conducted security reviews at BAE Systems facilities .
But the did n't bother to check up on the company 's internal audits – reports that would have " help[ed ] the Defense Security Service to evaluate and address potential security weaknesses at BAE Systems , the primary foreign - owned contractor supporting the strike fighter program . "
For example , the report notes , the Defense Security Service :
did not obtain and assess ... at least [ redacted ] BAE
Systems ’ reports discussing over security weaknesses in controls over classified technology at BAE Systems facilities for 2004 and 2005 ; *
* did not identify [ redacted ] percent of the security weaknesses identified by BAE Systems when both audited the same facilities ; and *
established an unauthorized policy of discarding security reports after 2 years , thereby preventing our verification of the resolution of security weaknesses identified in 2001 , 2002 , and 2003 . *
In fact , BAE Systems appeared to reject requests for the security reports , saying that " all information contained in the internal audits was privileged and not available to the Government , despite the requirement in the SSA [ Special Security Agreement ] that the contractor submits those reports to DoD [ Department of Defense ] for review and appropriate action .
DSS
did not challenge BAE Systems ' claim that the internal audits are privileged and not subject to Government review .
Rather than treating contractors ' audit reports as useful tools to complement the industrial security assessments , DSS classifies all contractor reports as " routine correspondence " and destroys them after two years .
" How can the Pentagon security agency allow BAE , its contractor , to deny access to these security records ? "
Nick
Schwellenbach , a Project on Government Oversight national security investigator , asked in a statement .
" This is government information and
BAE is stiff - arming the Pentagon . "
UPDATE : " DSS has a thorough and fundamentally sound facility inspection process which was only marginally diminished by the failure to systematically collect , analyze , and retain BAE 's required reports , " Director Kathleen Watson said in her response to the Inspector General .
" While we regret that BAE 's internal and independent reports weere not available for the audit team to review , DSS has since taken action to resolve this shortcoming . "
But it sounds like that was n't the only deficit the agency had to make up .
This DSS outfit has been in bad shape for a while , a recent House Armed Services Committee hearing revealed :
REP .
IKE SKELTON : You stated that the Defense Security Service was underfunded and understaffed when you first arrived .
That was two years ago .
Is that correct ?
KATHLEEN WATSON , DSS DIRECTOR ;
Yes , sir .
REP .
SKELTON : Do you have enough staff today ?
And are you fully funded today , to do your job ?
MS . WATSON :
I 'm fully funded to do my job .
We 've had an increase in our budget in the last year of $ 80 million , which is substantial .
We are not properly resourced yet in terms of personnel because of the hiring process in the department ...
REP .
SKELTON : How short are you as we speak in staff ?
MS .
WATSON : Well over a hundred .
REP .
SKELTON : What 's your total number of staff members ?
MS . WATSON : Total DSS is about 750 , give or take a few positions ...
REP .
VIC SNYDER : Ms. Watson ,
I had a couple questions I wanted to ask you .
In the GAO [ Government Accountability Office ] statement , on page 2 , it says – talks about your - alls files on contract and facility security programs and the security violation , that says , " Further , the manner in which this information was maintained , geographically dispersed paper - based files , did not lend itself to this type of analysis . "
Y'all have paper - based files ?
MS . WATSON : We did .
REP .
SNYDER : Why ?
* MS. WATSON : The agency has been under - resourced for approximately 20 years .
We now have a database , the Industrial Security Facilities Database , that we use .
It 's not a system that I would call the system of the future .
It 's what we have now .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Thursday that the worst of the credit crisis is over , according to sources who attended a speech he delivered in New York .
Greenspan also said house prices still had a long way to fall and that it was unlikely they would stabilize by year - end , according to meeting attendees who provided Reuters details of the speech at the Alternative Public Strategies Conference .
Conference organizers said Greenspan had requested that members of the media intending to cover his speech could only do so in their personal capacity and would not be allowed to report on whatever he said .
As chairman of the Fed , Greenspan oversaw the reduction of interest rates to as low as 1 percent , which some critics charge provided fuel for the real estate bubble .
Greenspan has vehemently rejected assertions that he is the cause of the problem .
The attendees , who declined to be identified by name , said Greenspan mentioned that U.S. growth was likely to be sluggish for an extended period of time and that a so - called doomsday scenario was unlikely to materialize .
The U.S economy is reeling from a housing - led slowdown , with some analysts convinced it is already in a recession despite a 0.6 percent growth rate in the first quarter .
According to the Obama campaign , his extemporaneous reference to his uncle 's being a part of liberating Auschwitz yesterday was a small error :
Aides said his grandmother 's brother , Charlie Payne , helped liberate a Buchenwald sub-camp in April 1945 as part of the 89th Infantry Division .
This was the RNC's Alex Conant :
Unless his uncle was serving in the Red Army , there ’s no way Obama ’s statement yesterday can be true .
Obama ’s frequent exaggerations and outright distortions raise questions about his judgment and his readiness to lead as commander in chief .
I have a feeling Conant wishes he had n't been quite that aggressive .
The chorus of Republicans trying to gin up a new meme about Obama 's honesty and fitness to be commander - in - chief has not been pretty these past few days .

Tomorrow is ExxonMobil ‘s annual meeting .
At that meeting , shareholders are going to vote on a number of Rockefeller family - supported shareholder resolutions , one of which will if passed , force Exxon to invest more money in alternative energy .
The Rockefeller family ’s logic is that their investment in Exxon ( which goes back to the founding of Standard Oil by John D. Rockefeller ) will lose value over time as Exxon ’s competitors gain footholds in the alternative energy markets to the detriment of Exxon .
But the very first resolution to be voted on is not one that ’s supported by the Rockefeller family .
In fact , the very first resolution to be voted on is one that would specifically ban resolutions that qualify as “ shareholder activism , ” supposedly like the resolutions supported by the Rockefellers .
And the first resolution was introduced by the Free Enterprise Action Fund ( FEAFund ) , a mutual fund founded and managed by none other than S&R ’s own favorite purveyor of global heating propaganda , Steven J. Milloy .
The UK ’s Guardian online ’s article quotes Milloy as saying “ They ’re not bona fide shareholders .
They ’re not shareholders who are invested in Exxon because they think it ’s a good investment – they ’re shareholders who want to use Exxon to advance their social and political agenda . ”
If you read the FEAFund Prospectus , it says the following :
[ T ]he Fund may take an activist position with respect to one or more corporate managements if
the Adviser believes advocacy may : Promote the American system of free enterprise ;
Ensure that corporate management makes sound business decisions based on long - term investor interests ; and
Protect businesses and their investors from what the Adviser believes is harmful social activism .
( Source : page 2 )
In other words , the FEAFund ’s Advisor , Steven J. Milloy , has introduced a resolution that equates to shareholder activism with the stated goal of banning activist shareholder resolutions .
And , as a libertarian who likely supports the elimination of the estate tax , Milloy is also claiming that the Rockefeller family , who control Exxon shares via the Rockefeller estate , are n’t bona fide shareholders .
And Milloy , who ’s funds ’
Prospectus claims a Milton Friedman quote as it ’s guiding principle ( “ The Social Responsibility Of Business Is To Increase Its Profits . ” ) , is opposing a resolution based on concerns that the long - term profitability of ExxonMobil is threatened by it ’s unwillingness to develop alternative energy technologies and sources .
Right .
And this from a mutual fund that , according to the Prospectus , invests a minimum of 65 % of its money in Fortune 500 and S&P500 companies , yet has generally underperformed the S&P500 since its inception .
Compared to the S&P500 and the DJIA , the FEAFund is marginally better than the S&P and significantly worse than the DJIA over the last year .
This certainly implies that the the social responsibility of the FEAFund is to minimize fund shareholder profit by underperforming the market .
For more detailed information about the individuals who were bankrolling the FEAFund as of December , 2007 , please see We Berate , You Deride – A look at Steven J. Milloy ’s current affiliates and backers .
Uncontacted tribe photographed near Brazil - Peru border

Members of one of the world ’s last uncontacted tribes have been spotted and photographed from the air near the Brazil - Peru border .
The photos were taken during several flights over one of the remotest parts of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil ’s Acre state .
‘ We did the overflight to show their houses , to show they are there , to show they exist , ’ said uncontacted tribes expert José Carlos dos Reis Meirelles Júnior .
Meirelles works for FUNAI , the Brazilian government ’s Indian affairs department .
‘ This is very important because there are some who doubt their existence . ’
Meirelles says that the group ’s numbers are increasing .
But other uncontacted groups in the region , whose homes have been photographed from the air , are in severe danger from illegal logging in Peru .
Logging is driving uncontacted tribes over the border and could lead to conflict with the estimated five hundred uncontacted Indians already living on the Brazilian side .
‘ What is happening in this region [ of Peru ] is a monumental crime against the natural world , the tribes , the fauna and is further testimony to the complete irrationality with which we , the ‘ civilised ’ ones , treat the world , ’ said Meirelles .
There are more than one hundred uncontacted tribes worldwide , with more than half living in either Brazil or Peru .
All are in grave danger of being forced off their land , killed and decimated by new diseases .
Survival has launched an urgent campaign to get their land protected , and a unique film narrated by actress Julie Christie .
Survival ’s director Stephen Corry said today , ‘ These pictures are further evidence that uncontacted tribes really do exist .
The world needs to wake up to this , and ensure that their territory is protected in accordance with international law .
Otherwise , they will soon be made extinct . ’
For further information please contact Miriam Ross on ( +44 ) ( 0)20 7687 8734 or email [ email protected ]
Act now to help uncontacted Indians
Please write a letter to Peru ’s president asking him to recognise his country ’s isolated Indians ’ land rights – and by doing so protect uncontacted peoples on both sides of the Peru - Brazil border .
The Great Rice and Beans Experiment
April 9 , 2008 at 11:54 am
Hi , my name is Maria and I ’m about to live for 30 days on $ 30 worth of food .
I ’m doing this primarily to raise money for Blandford Nature Center and Mixed Greens , but I also hope to raise awareness about the limited diet available to people living on a low income .
Between April 10 and May 9 , 2008 , I will not spend more than $ 30 TOTAL for food .
In a typical month , I spend about $ 250 on groceries , coffee , and restaurant meals , so this is a big reduction for me .
At the end of the month I ’ll donate the difference to Blandford Nature Center and Mixed Greens .
Along the way , I ’ll be sharing my experiences on this blog .
You can follow along as I attempt to survive on a diet heavy on starch , local food that I ’ve traded labor for , and foraged food like dandelion greens .
I promise there will be lots of pictures and maybe even some video .
Who Am I and Why Am Doing This To Myself ?
You may be wondering why any human being would voluntarily live under these types of restrictions for a month .
Aside from the fact that I enjoy being contrary , I really support the work that Blandford Nature Center and Mixed Greens is doing to make sure that urban kids have access to local , healthy food and the local ecology .
I grew up in a rural area of West Michigan in a working class family .
We did n’t have a lot of money , but we always ate really well .
I had fresh veggies from my mom’s huge garden ( which I did n’t appreciate at all at the time ! ) , fruit that we picked ourselves from a farmer friend ’s trees , and lots of preservative free , home cooked meals .
Now I ’m taller and my day job is researching nonprofit organizations .
In my ( copious amounts of ) free time I write a blog about personal and organizational change .
So I ’m very interested in how nonprofits move our society forward and how they can do this more effectively .
I met the super - awesome Lisa Rose Starner when we were both students in Grand Valley State University ’s MPA program and was immediately impressed by her vision of creating an organization that leveraged a lot of system resources to create change ( sorry if this is starting to sound too academic ! ) .
Once she founded Mixed Greens and later when it merged with Blandford Nature Center , I became even more impressed with the work of this organization .
They are employing a very simple mechanism ( vegetable gardening ) to address a number of complex issues ( nutrition , food equity , social skills , planning skills , confidence , etc , etc , etc ) and they are doing it well .
What I like best is that they are making it possible for urban kids to have access to high quality fresh , local foods just like I had as a country kid .
A few months ago , when browsing on the Internet in my pajamas , I came across this crazy site called Hungry for a Month .
Evan , the man who wrote the blog , lived on $ 1 a day worth of food for a month .
At the end of the month , he donated the rest of his normal grocery budget to a food bank .
It was a crazy , awesome idea but in my analysis he did one thing wrong – he DIDN ’T INVOLVE THE FOOD BANK in his project .
Because I ’ve been working in nonprofits for many years , I know that by creating a relationship with the org he was targeting for his donation , he could have leveraged his effort to raise A LOT more money .
I thought to myself , “ Self , this sounds cool .
Do you know of any innovative , food related organizations that have super - cool staff members that would be interested in a fundraiser like this ? ”
And Self responded , “ How about Mixed Greens ?
They ’re super - cool . ”
A quick email to Lisa later , and an idea was born .
What Are the Rules ?
I ’ve decided to structure my rules a bit differently than Evan .
Here ’s the summary :
I can spend up to $ 30 in the next 30 days for food .
I can barter for locally grown food .
In this case , “ local ” means anything within a 100 mile radius of my workplace in downtown Grand Rapids .
I can forage for food such as wild onions , wild garlic , and dandelion greens .
Stay tuned for more on this .
“ Gift food ” is forbidden .
This means no coffee and donuts from the office , no friends buying me dinner , and none of mom ’s cookies ( sorry Mom ! ) for the month .
DRY
Spices are excepted from all of this .
According to my estimates , I spend far less than $.01 per day on basic spices like salt , pepper , and oregano so I wo n’t count them .
Wet spices like sauces and condiments DO count in my $ figures – even ketchup packets .
My reasoning for these rules is that most people in the world do n’t have access to fancy office jobs that provide free coffee , treats on an almost daily basis , and a nice cafeteria with all of the ketchup , mustard , and mayonnaise packets that you care to steal .
They also do n’t usually have friends with the disposable income to just buy them food during lean times .
In my experience , however , they do have social networks that are willing to barter and share what they have in their pantries and freezers .
People who live in the country ( at least where I grew up ) also often have a bit of land available to them for gardening and access to undeveloped land where lots of “ weeds ” that happen to be edible grow .
Now I ’m learning that people who live in urban areas can gain access to these types of resources as well
In addition , since Blandford Nature Center and Mixed Greens emphasizes connecting with the local ecology and food production system , I want to focus on eating local foods as much as possible .
Obviously , Michigan in April is not the best place to find local foods , but you may be surprised at how many edible “ weeds ” and frozen or canned local food I can turn up .
I think it ’s going to be a fun challenge !
Oh , and unlike Evan ’s $.09 hot dogs ( scroll to Day 18 ) I ’ll be trying to eat as healthy as possible .
How Can You Help ?
If you would like to support this project , you can help in many ways .
For example you can :
Eat for one day for $ 1 and donate the rest of your normal daily food spending .
( We ’ll have an online donation button up on this blog very soon . )
button up on this blog very soon . )
Share the blog and information about Blandford Nature Center and Mixed Greens with your friends and family .
Subscribe to the blog ’s RSS feed , email updates or bookmark it and come back often .
If you participate in social media like Facebook , StumbleUpon , or Digg , submit your favorite posts and share them with your networks .
Support local food by visiting the early farmers ’ markets this spring .
Plant a garden .
You can start with peas and lettuce right now .
I ’m really looking forward to this experiment .
It ’s going to be a challenge , but also a lot of fun .
I hope you ’ll join me for the journey .

LONDON  After a seven - year legal battle , Britain ’s Court of Appeal ruled Wednesday that the British government was wrong to include an Iranian resistance group , the People ’s Mujahedeen of Iran , on its list of banned terrorist groups .
Spokesmen for the group , whose name means People ’s Holy Warriors , said the ruling appeared to leave Britain ’s interior minister , Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , with no further legal recourse but to order Parliament to strike the group from a list of more than 20 proscribed terrorist organizations under Britain ’s Terrorism Act .
The court ’s ruling denied the government ’s bid to carry the appeal further , seemingly closing off recourse to Britain ’s supreme appellate body , the so - called Law Lords .
But the British government did not say what it planned to do .
The People ’s Mujahedeen has roots that go back to the Iranian resistance to Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi ’s rule in the mid-1960s .
After the 1979 revolution , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini turned against the group , executing many of its members and driving others into exile .
It regrouped in Iraq in the 1980s and was listed as a terrorist group by the United States in 1997 and the European Union in 2002 .
Howard Dean appeared on the Daily Show and said definitively that the Michigan and Florida delegations will be seated .
( H/t Scott Jacobs . )
The video is here and embedded below .
Representative quotes :
STEWART : If I were designing a plan to submarine your chances , and again , you do n’t have to follow my advice here , I would take the state that was , let ’s say crucial to the Republican election chances — lets , let ’s call it Florida — and I would find a way to insult them .
Maybe not seat them at the convention , that sort of thing .
Then I would pick a Rust Belt state , maybe a Michigan , and say to them the same .
Now you ’ve got two states that are angry with you .
Do you think that would be a good way ?
DEAN : Well , we ’re actually going to seat them at the convention .
STEWART : What ?!
This is news !
Are you really going to do that ?
DEAN : We ’re going to find a way to seat them at the convention .
START : Are you really going to ?
DEAN : Yeah .
STEWART : How — how can you do that when their results do n’t count ?
DEAN : Well , it ’s a little hard , but we ’re gonna do it .
. . . .
It ’s gonna be quite a juggling act , but we ’re gonna do it .
You cannot have a Democratic convention without Florida and Michigan .
Could this be a harbinger of things to come for McCain 's chances with African - Americans this fall ?
Politico :
A reader notices an odd choice , or oversight , in John McCain 's latest television spot :
The woman at left is wearing an Obama t- shirt .
Now that 's bipartisanship .
Or something .
Also perhaps an indication of how ( unsurprisingly ) hard it 's going to be for McCain to build any African - American support at all .
UPDATE : Seeing some skepticism in the comments , I took the liberty of juxtaposing an enlarged screenshot ( with adjusted contrast ) with a close - up of the actual Obama shirt .
I do n't want to turn into a right - wing investigative blogger here ( because it 's really not a big deal either way ) , but it seems pretty obvious to me that , at the very least , you can't completely rule out the possibility that it's an Obama shirt .
To me , the blue circle above the stripes is the tell - tale sign .

WASHINGTON  When Mark Begich , the popular 45 - year - old mayor of Anchorage , came to town for a meeting of mayors in January , he was beckoned to the Capitol by the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada .
There was one agenda item : ousting Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska , the senior Republican in Congress .
For 45 minutes , Mr. Reid and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York , the head of the Democrats ’ campaign efforts , pressed the mayor to run this year .
Last week , they got him .
Mr. Begich announced that he had formed a committee to start raising money .
Effectively , the race is on .
For Democrats hoping the November elections set off a seismic shift in Washington , the dream scenario is not just capturing the White House , but also winning a filibuster - proof majority of 60 seats in the Senate  a luxury no president has enjoyed since Jimmy Carter 30 years ago .
As far - fetched as that might seem 
Democrats now control the Senate by a razor - thin 51 to 49 , thanks only to two independents who vote with them  some Democrats have started thinking aloud that such a scenario is within reach .
The Lewis Engineering and Scientists Association are asking several members of Congress to look into cancer rates in the Developmental Engineering Building and NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland , Ohio ( NASA Lewis was changed to NASA Glenn in 1999 and sits at Lewis Field in Cleveland ) .
Any good scientist would hate that title .
Why ?
Because it 's designed to lead you to conclude something – like there is a link between cancer and NASA or that 40 engineers on the same floor being diagnosed with cancer means something .
So what are the facts ?
The facts are :
- According to a union spokesperson , Dennis Pehotski , 40 out of 100 engineers on the 3rd floor of that building have been diagnosed with cancer in the past three to four years .
- The Union is concerned about conditions in the building .
- According to reports unveiled to workers last month from the Ohio Department of Health and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health , cancer rates at NASA Glenn are within the normal range .
- The union is worried about possible mold and asbestos in the ceiling , a dirty air filter and other building problems .
- The NASA Glenn safety director , said they would clean the filter more often , that tests showed safe conditions and that they would answer any questions that come to them .
The building is scheduled to be razed ( demolished ) in 2010 .
- The group has contacted Congressman Kucinich 's office and his spokesperson has said they would investigate the matter with Glenn officials .
- The building was constructed in 1965 .
-( The other implication is that it has something to do with being a NASA engineer - but nothing in the article supports that . )
And of course the most scientifically meaningless of all facts , the anecdotal one : I have never worked on a floor where 40 people had been diagnosed with cancer in the past three to four years .
( Note , my quick internet search did not give me an easy number for what a " normal " cancer rate " should " be .
If you have a credible reference please pass along . )

Rove calls Siegelman accuser a ' complete lunatic '
WASHINGTON -- Karl
Rove says a one - time Republican campaign worker who has accused him of dirty tricks against a former Alabama governor is a " complete lunatic , " and he calls CBS a " shoddy operation " for airing her allegations .
In an interview with GQ magazine , President Bush 's former political guru says he has never met Jill Simpson , an Alabama attorney and GOP campaign volunteer who has claimed that Rove tried to sabotage Democratic Gov. Don Siegelman 's career .
CBS says it stands behind the " 60 Minutes " program from February in which Simpson said Rove asked her to find evidence that Siegelman was cheating on his wife .
Rove declined to respond to her allegations on the program .
Simpson , who has given sworn testimony to congressional investigators , has claimed she overheard conversations among Republicans suggesting that Rove pushed the Justice Department to go after Siegelman , who was convicted on corruption charges in 2006 .
" She 's a complete lunatic , " Rove said in the interview .
" I 've never met this woman .
This woman was not involved in any campaign in which I was involved .
I have yet to find anybody who knows her . "
Asked why CBS aired her allegations , he said , " Because CBS is a shoddy operation . "
It aired the story to get good ratings , he added .
Simpson 's attorney , Priscilla Duncan , said she would ask the magazine to retract the remarks and apologize to Simpson .
MONTGOMERY --
A federal appellate court today ordered former Gov. Don Siegelman released from prison while he appeals his 2006 conviction , but denied co-defendant Richard Scrushy 's request to be released .
Siegelman attorney Vince Kilborn said Siegelman would be released sometime Friday morning .
" His wife and his daughter , Dana , are driving out to get him , " Kilborn said .
Scrushy attorney Art Leach said he had been told the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals denied Scrushy 's request , but had no more details this evening .
Siegelman has been in an Oakdale , La. , prison camp for nearly nine months .
A federal jury in 2006 convicted Siegelman and Scrushy of federal funds bribery .
Prosecutors alleged Scrushy bought a seat on a state board with a $ 500,000 donation to Siegelman 's lottery campaign .
The judges wrote that Siegelman met both requirements for an appeal bond :
He is not a flight risk and his appeal raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial .
" After thorough review of this complex and protracted record , we conclude Siegelman has satisfied the criteria set out in the statute , and has specifically met his burden of showing that his appeal raises substantial questions of law or fact , " the judges wrote .
The court did not elaborate on what those questions were .
Siegelman 's lawyers , among other issues , have argued prosecutors did n't prove that Siegelman and Scrushy struck a " quid pro quo " deal to swap the money for the appointment .
U.S. Judges Susan H. Black and Stanley Marcus wrote the four - page order .
U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller ordered Siegelman and Scrushy directly to prison after their sentencing last summer .
Siegelman , who was also convicted on an obstruction of justice charge , was sentenced to seven years and four months in prison .
Scrushy was sentenced to six years and 10 months .
The court had denied Scrushy 's appeal bond , but his lawyers asked the court to reconsider and offered to pledge all of his assets as assurance he will not flee .
Leach said he learned today that request had been denied .
Kilborn said today 's order to release Siegelman is " a big win in a very long war .
It 's a good feeling . "
Now , he said attorneys will be working to have Siegelman 's conviction reversed .

Conyers on Karl Rove : ' Someone 's got to kick his ass ' Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Thursday May 15 , 2008
|
Print This Email This House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers Jr. ( D - MI ) is still on the hunt for former Bush strategist Karl Rove .
" We 're closing in on Rove , " Conyers was heard saying today on the House floor , according to a source for Politico .
" Someone 's got to kick his ass . "
Rove , having refused to obey a subpoena calling for testimony on his role in the dubious prosecution of former Alabama governor Don Siegelman , has a week to change his mind .
If he does n't show , Conyers said : " We 'll do what any self - respecting committee would do .
We 'd hold him in contempt .
Either that or go and have him arrested . "
" We want him for so many things , it 's hard to keep track , " he added .
The House Judiciary Committee has rejected an offer by Rove to respond in writing instead of testifying under oath .
Rove had previously agreed to speak , but only off the record , and without a written transcription .
House Rep. and Judiciary Commitee chair Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) tells MSNBC 's Dan Abrams in the interview embedded below that the Committee is prepared to issue another subpoena , followed by a request to Attorney General Michael Mukasey to enforce the subpoena .
If that effort fails , then Rove will be held in contempt of Congress , Wexler says .
" Karl Rove and [ the Bush administration ] have thumbed their nose at Congress , " says Gov. Siegelman .
" They have clearly engaged in systematic and calculated abuses of power relating not just to the abuse of the Department of Justice , but to other areas of importance to the American people .
And Congress , rightfully so , should press Karl Rove to come and testify under oath and answer these questions . "
Gov. Siegelman urges the national media to help persuade Congress to investigate .
" This is the time , and this is the moment , " Siegelman says , " for Congress to stand up and be counted on this issue . "

Omar Khadr is seen in this undated family portrait .
REUTERS / Handout / Files
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A Canadian captured in Afghanistan at age 15 can be tried for murder in the Guantanamo war crimes court , a U.S. military judge ruled in rejecting claims that he was a child soldier who should be rehabilitated rather than prosecuted .
Canadian prisoner Omar Khadr , now 21 , is charged in the Guantanamo court with throwing a grenade that killed a U.S. soldier during a firefight at a suspected al Qaeda compound in Afghanistan in 2002 .
His military lawyer , Lt. Cmdr. William Kuebler , had argued in February hearings at the Guantanamo naval base that Khadr was a child soldier illegally conscripted by his father , an al Qaeda financier .
He urged the judge to drop the charges , which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison .
The judge , Army Col .
Peter Brownback , issued a ruling on Wednesday agreeing with prosecutors ’ position that the law authorizing the Guantanamo trials contained no minimum age .
Brownback ’s ruling clears the way for Khadr to be tried in the special tribunals created by the Bush administration to try non-U.S. captives it considers “ unlawful enemy combatants ” outside the regular civilian and military courts .
Kuebler called the ruling “ an embarrassment to the United States ” and said Canada would share in the embarrassment if it allows its citizen to be tried at Guantanamo .
He said Khadr would be the first child soldier tried for war crimes in modern history .
The United States and Canada have ratified an international treaty , the Child Soldier Protocol , that outlaws recruitment of combatants under age 18 and requires governments to help child soldiers recover and reintegrate into society .
It does not specifically bar prosecution of child soldiers but says they should not be subjected to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and that they cannot be subjected to life imprisonment without possibility of release .
Khadr , who was shot twice in the back by U.S. soldiers during the battle that led to his capture , is charged with murder , attempted murder , conspiring with al Qaeda , providing material support for terrorism and spying on U.S. military convoys in Afghanistan .
“ Customers have come to us and said they really like the XO laptop and they would like to see Windows on it , ” said James Utzschneider , manager of Microsoft ’s developing markets unit .
The first of the project ’s child - friendly XO laptops running Windows XP will be tested next month in limited trials in four or five countries .
Mr. Utzschneider declined to identify the countries , but he said XO laptops running Windows would be generally available by September .
The pact with Microsoft is not an exclusive agreement .
The Linux version will still be available , and the group will encourage outside software developers to create a version of the project ’s educational software , called Sugar , that will run on Windows .
Windows will add a bit to the price of the machines , about $ 3 , the licensing fee Microsoft charges to some developing nations under a program called Unlimited Potential .
For those nations that want models that can run both Windows and Linux , the extra hardware required will add another $ 7 or so to the cost of the machines , Mr. Negroponte said .
The laptops now cost about $ 200 each , and the project ’s goal is to eventually bring the price down to about $ 100 .
O.L.P.C. led the way in designing inexpensive laptops for children in poorer nations , but others have followed , notably Intel with its Classmate PC , which runs Windows and is $ 400 or less .
The project ’s agreement with Microsoft involves no payment by the software giant , and Microsoft will not join One Laptop Per Child ’s board .
That contrasts with the approach of Intel , which joined the project last July , took a board seat and pledged an $ 18 million contribution  only to quit in January amid squabbling over Intel ’s aggressive sales tactics with the Classmate PC .
Of the Microsoft arrangement , Mr. Negroponte said : “ We ’ve stayed very pure . ”
But the alliance with Microsoft has created some turmoil within the project .
Walter Bender , the president who oversaw software development , resigned last month .
His departure , Mr. Negroponte said , was “ a huge loss to O.L.P.C. ”

The " Unlimited " Potential of American Wind Power : AWEA
April 22nd , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
The American Wind Energy Association held a press conference today ( 4/21/08 ) to discuss the present and future of their industry in the United States .
Representatives from Siemens , Vestas , GE and Gamesa were there to share their perspectives and answer questions .
What they revealed was an industry both optimistic and tenuous ; their products are in high demand , but they are reliant on tax credits for large - scale expansion .
Given the increasing popularity and regulatory necessity of sustainable power generation , both American and international turbine producers are eying the practically limitless growth potential in the United States .
All they need is stability in policy to dramatically expand their manufacturing and R&D capabilities , simultaneously creating thousands of jobs and a competitive American industry .
The United States has a natural edge when it comes to wind energy .
Unlike Europe , we have a lot of land with which to harness wind , including across sparsely populated areas .
If NIMBY is n’t a problem , the potential for sustainable energy generation is even greater .
According to Roby Roberts , V.P. of Government Relations for Vestas , you need about 8,000 components to make a wind turbine , some of which are really big .
Apparently the trick with so many bits and pieces is bringing them together ; it does n’t make sense to transport them over vast distances .
Consider the iconic wind turbine propeller blades .
Some of the largest blades are 80 meters long – over 260 feet !
– which no doubt require special handling , licensing , and lots of money to transport .
Instead of building or assembling many of these parts overseas , it makes much more economic sense to manufacture and assemble them locally .
That means jobs , lots of them , for communities and regions where wind turbines can be built .
All of the industry leaders agreed that each of their companies was eager to build and expand their manufacturing and Research & Development capabilities across the United States , which would produce thousands of stable jobs .
Julius Steiner , CEO of Gamesa USA , commented that if the supply chain could be built in the USA , it would be internationally competitive .
That ’s part of why , despite policy difficulties , international companies like Gamesa ( founded in Spain ) have jumped into the US market without any guarantee of a production tax credit ( PTC ) extensions .
“ The PTC provides an incentive of two cents per kilowatt - hour generated to facilities that produce electricity from renewable energy resources …
The credit can be claimed for 10 years , beginning on the date the qualified facility is placed in service .
The facility must begin operation before the credit expires . ” – AWEA newsroom
It ’s not that the wind industry needs tax credits to exist , but they do need the PTC to expand and build a supply chain .
Without these tax credits , building the manufacturing infrastructure for large - scale wind turbine projects would be nearly impossible .
The key to investment in manufacturing is a long - term outlook .
Randall Swisher , Executive Director of the AWEA , said the industry needed five years minimum of policy stability to expand the existing infrastructure foundation .
Roby Roberts of Vesta claimed that once the supply chain is in place , prices should drop , making the industry even more competitive .
If Congress extends the PTC for even a year , these companies will continue to expand their manufacturing capabilities .
Fortunately all of these companies have already built the first links of a solid supply chain , all of them are optimistic that the tax credits will come , and all are commited to the US market .
The importance of the PTC can be gleaned if you take a step back .
Internationally , the markets with the most lucrative potential for the wind industry are the USA , Europe , China and India .
Europe has a lucrative policy system in place , and China recently announced their own policy to spur the development of wind power .
That leaves the United States as a kind of uncertain frontier where , like the Wild West , fortunes could be made or lost .
The fortune at stake is not just local jobs , but leadership in a lucrative technology which these industry leaders agree is “ limitless ” .
Wind power is already booming , but because energy demand is always rising and wind is renewable , this industry could grow for decades without slowing down .
All they need is enough time to build , which relies upon the PTC .
Julius Steiner characterized this moment as , “ the middle of the beginning for the renewable energy industry . ”
He compared potential renewable energy policy to the laws that made the Interstate Highway system possible , hoping for a similar national push towards a nationally beneficial energy infrastructure .
They were all unanimous in a sense of urgency : the time to expand the PTC was now .
If the tax credits are allowed to expire , opportunities could be lost and manufacturing jobs will be the first to suffer .
I left with a firm impression that these industry leaders are optimistic about the future .
Having survived previous boom - and - bust cycles , they felt that they had passed a critical phase in their industry development , and that a foundation had been built on their end .
But , I agree with Julius Steiner when he said that we needed to get the “ fundamentals right in our country ” by setting a policy foundation for renewable energy to launch from .
Several states have already begun to move in that direction , but the wind and sun know no political boundaries .
Even a minimum national policy would help us diversify the power grid , move towards energy independence , and build manufacturing jobs at home instead of exporting them overseas .
On top of it all , we would have cleaner air and contribute less to climate change .
Wind power is already a leader among renewable energy technologies , and its future is bright – that is not in question .
The question instead is whether or not we , as a nation , will support it now and reap the economic and ecological benefits later , or delay it another year while our competition forges ahead .

If you do n't like conflict , than maybe you should consider moving to Reykjavik -- that 's the message from the Global Peace Index .
Iceland headed the rankings of the survey , which is drawn up by a non-governmental initiative called Vision of Humanity .
It evaluates 140 nations with respect to 24 criteria , including numbers of deaths from organized conflict , levels of violent crime and proportions of GDP used for military expenditures .
Denmark was deemed the world 's second most peaceful country , followed by Norway , New Zealand and Japan .
" The world appears to be a marginally more peaceful place this year , " index founder and Australian philanthropist Steve Killelea said in a statement .
" This is encouraging , but it takes small steps by individual countries for the world to make greater strides on the road to peace . "
Confirming the obvious
Five years of war have made Iraq the world 's most dangerous place
At the other end of the index , war - torn Iraq was adjudged to be the most violent country on the globe .
It was followed by other perennial hotspots of conflict -- Sudan , Afghanistan , Israel and Chad .
Somewhat more surprisingly , Russia ranks very low on the list in 131rd spot .
The United States is also in the bottom half of the table in position 97 .
Meanwhile , China ranks 67 , and Germany a respectable 14 .
The nations that made the biggest jumps in the table were Angola , Indonesia , India and Uzbekistan .
Kenya dropped dramatically on the Global Peace Index
Meanwhile , owing to violence following last December 's presidential election , Kenya suffered the steepest decline .
The index is pitched at governments as a means of self - evaluation and at commerce .
" You ultimately can't have business where you have conflict , " said Nobel Peace Laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa , a major supporter of the survey .
" So it is in the nature of self - interest to promote the kind of circumstances and the kind of environment where you can carry out your business . "
Red - light cameras save lives but result in more crashes that cause property damage , a new study says , as drivers slam on their brakes at camera intersections to avoid tickets , causing chain - reaction crashes from behind .
Researchers at the University of Florida College of Public Health say the findings , based partially on statistics from Toronto 's red - light cameras , show the program is flawed .
" Before and after " studies of 38 red - light camera intersections in Toronto revealed collisions resulting in death or injury dropped 18.2 per cent .
But property damage - only collisions rose 4 per cent .
A wider look at all six Ontario municipalities with red- light cameras , including Toronto , showed that fatal and injury crashes dropped by 6.8 per cent while property damage collisions were up 18.5 per cent .
The Florida researchers , whose review included studies in North Carolina and Virginia as well as Ontario , noted that " increased rear - end crashes were a particular problem and may occur as drivers attempt to stop abruptly in order to avoid a ticket . "
The researchers suggested Florida could be asking for trouble if it introduced red - light cameras because of the state 's high number of elderly drivers who are more likely to be injured or killed in a crash .
Toronto politicians say the drop in deaths and injuries here is enough reason to keep the cameras .
" Our documentation shows that in Toronto it 's been a sensational success , " said Councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker , chair of city council 's public works and infrastructure committee .
" Red - light cameras are saving people 's lives , saving people from being maimed and injured , " De Baeremaeker said .
He had n't seen the Florida study but doubted it would change his view .
" Myself and our staff will read it in detail , but its findings are completely contrary and completely at odds with everything we 've experienced in the city of Toronto .
We have nothing but praise and good things to say about the red- light camera program . "
While the number of property damage collisions increased , De Baeremaeker said it was important to look at the types of crashes .
The Toronto experience showed a 26.2 per cent drop in " angle " or T - bone crashes , while rear - enders were up 10.1 per cent .
Province - wide , angle crashes dropped 25.3 per cent while rear - enders increased a whopping 49.9 per cent .
" The T - bone accidents have gone down , " De Baeremaeker said .
" Those are the most dangerous . "
Toronto has also seen an increase in rear - end collisions , but the program has achieved its objective of reducing severe collisions , city officials said in a report .
The new pedestrian countdown signals may be helping to reduce crashes at intersections , said Councillor Shelley Carroll , a member of the public works committee .
" Instead of seeing ` Do n't Walk ' and speeding up , people are seeing the seconds tick down , " Carroll said .
" You 're at the threshold when you can see the countdown begin , so it makes more sense to stop than to gun it . "
Carroll said the city has no reason to re-think red - light cameras .
" We 've had positive reasons to continue the program , " she said .
" Over all , we 've been pleased . "
In addition to Toronto , Ontario municipalities with the cameras include Hamilton and Ottawa , and Halton , Peel and Waterloo regions .
Researchers looked at accident data from 1995 to 1999 , before red - light cameras , and compared the results to data from 2001 and 2002 , after the cameras began operating .
DIGG THIS
Whatever your expectations for Ron Paul ’s book The Revolution : A Manifesto , I can say with confidence that they have been exceeded .
By a mile .
Ron Paul has produced the kind of book that changes the person who reads it .
It is one of the most persuasively argued and beautifully written defenses of the free society I have ever encountered .
No president , no presidential candidate , indeed no American politician has ever written anything like this .
But that is such faint praise , and such an unjust understatement , that I almost regret uttering it .
From the first page of this book to the last , Ron Paul tells his fellow Americans things that — if the usual political and media fare we are offered is any indication — they are not supposed to hear .
As I ’ve said in another context , Ron Paul ’s The Revolution : A Manifesto is , to the establishment , rather like the man who shouts out in the middle of the show how the magician is really sawing the woman in half .
What does it cover ?
Oh , just the Constitution , war , terrorism , the economy , trade , civil liberties , the war on drugs , the dollar , gold , abortion , executive orders , taxation , the housing bubble , the Federal Reserve , education , health care , the environment , conservatism , entitlements , foreign aid , regulation , and presidential war powers .
In order to make progress toward liberty , economist and libertarian Murray Rothbard used to say , the benign façade of the state has to be dramatically torn down .
The people must be made to understand that this institution , which they ’ve been taught to venerate since elementary school as the expression of the popular will , is ripping them off .
Well , this is the book Murray was waiting for .
After describing the income tax as merely a species of forced labor , for example , Dr. Paul concludes : " Strip away the civics - class platitudes about u2018contributions ’ to u2018society , ’ which are mere obfuscations designed to engineer the people ’s consent to the system , and that is what the income tax amounts to . "
The word " exploited " appears several times in the book — to refer to government ’s treatment of its subject population .
He likewise writes , after having shown how the so - called distribution effects of inflation hurt the middle class and the working poor , that " the average person is silently robbed through this invisible means , and usually does n’t understand what exactly is happening to him .
And almost no one in the political establishment has an incentive to tell him . "
One of the things that frustrated me most during 2007 was the way Ron Paul ’s enemies employed predictable " anti-American " and " appeasement " rhetoric against his foreign policy views .
Dr. Paul gets the last laugh here : his chapter on foreign policy is the most persuasive short statement of the non-interventionist position I have ever read .
It turns the tables completely : suddenly it is the neoconservatives who are on the defensive , and Ron Paul the knowledgeable and wise statesman steering his country to safety .
As a former neocon myself — who knew my enthusiasm for this book would elicit that awful confession ? —
I can confidently say that I would have changed my mind a lot sooner if I had been exposed to arguments like these .
It ’s also a little unusual for an American presidential candidate to refer to and quote from Alexis de Tocqueville , Frdric Bastiat , Thomas Aquinas , Robert Nozick , Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , George Washington , John Adams , Daniel Webster , John Quincy Adams , Henry Clay , Russell Kirk , Richard Weaver , William Graham Sumner , Ludwig von Mises , and other figures of comparable renown .
Now trust me that I am not doing this book justice , but here ’s a sample of its style and content .
On the conservative movement :
A substantial portion of the conservative movement has become a parody of its former self .
Once home to distinguished intellectuals and men of letters , it now tolerates and even encourages anti-intellectualism and jingoism that would have embarrassed earlier generations of conservative thinkers .
On blowback :
The question [ CIA bin Laden expert Michael ]
Scheuer and I are asking is not who is morally responsible for terrorism — only a fool would place the moral responsibility for terrorism on anyone other than the terrorists themselves .
The question we are asking is less doltish and more serious : given that a hyper - interventionist foreign policy is very likely to lead to this kind of blowback , are we still sure we want such a foreign policy ? …
I have [ n ] ever said or believed that Americans had it coming on 9/11 , or that the attacks were justified , or any of this other nonsense .
The point is a simple one : when our government meddles around the world , it can stir up hornets ’ nests and thereby jeopardize the safety of the American people .
That ’s just common sense .
But hardly anyone in our government dares to level with the American people about our fiasco of a foreign policy .
On the idea of a " living " Constitution :
A " living " Constitution is just the thing any government would be delighted to have , for whenever the people complain that their Constitution has been violated , the government can trot out its judges to inform the people that they ’ve simply misunderstood : the Constitution , you see , has merely evolved with the times .
Thus , as in Orwell ’s Animal Farm , " no animal shall sleep in a bed " becomes " no animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets , " " no animal shall drink alcohol " becomes " no animal shall drink alcohol to excess , " and " no animal shall kill any other animal " becomes " no animal shall kill any other animal without cause . "
On civil liberties :
We have allowed the president to abduct an American citizen on American soil , declare him an " enemy combatant " ( a charge the accused has no power to contest , which is rendered by the president in secret and is unreviewable ) , detain him indefinitely , deny him legal counsel , and subject him to inhumane treatment … .
Have we been so blinded by propaganda that we have forgotten basic American principles , and legal guarantees that extend back to our British forbears eight centuries ago ?…
Claims that these powers will be exercised only against the bad guys are not worth listening to .
On propaganda :
Toward the end of 2007 , Senator Jeff Sessions declared , " Some people in this chamber love the Constitution more than they love the safety of this nation .
We should all send President Bush a letter thanking him for protecting us . "
What kind of sheep must politicians take Americans for if they expect them to fall for creepy propaganda like this ?
On neoconservatives :
Every last prediction they made about the Iraq debacle — e.g. , it would be a cakewalk , the cost would be paid by oil revenues , the prospect of sectarian fighting was slim — has been resolutely falsified by events , and yet they continue to grace the pages of major American newspapers and appear regularly on cable television talk shows .
Instead of being disgraced , as common sense might lead us to expect , they continue to be exalted for a wisdom they obviously do not possess .
I am reminded of George Orwell ’s reference to " the streamlined men who think in slogans and talk in bullets . "
On our foreign - policy debate :
The possibility that we should avoid bleeding ourselves dry in endless foreign meddling is not raised .
For heaven ’s sake , what kind of debate is it in which all sides agree that America needs troops in 130 countries ?
On Iraq :
The leadership of al Qaeda hoped to lure us into a " desert Vietnam , " an enormously expensive war that would deplete our resources and help their own recruitment by stirring up the locals against us .
And that is just what happened .
The war ’s ultimate cost is being estimated in the trillions .
The dollar is collapsing .
And more terrorists are being created .
According to a study by the Global Research in International Affairs Center in Herzliya , Israel , the vast bulk of the foreign fighters in Iraq are people who had never been involved in terrorist activity before but have been radicalized by the U.S. presence in Iraq — the second - holiest place in Islam .
The terrorists , in short , have played us like a fiddle .
On the Federal Reserve :
Even if the Fed chairman really possessed the singular genius our media and politicians regularly ascribe to him , what if things have reached a point at which the Fed simply cannot stop the collapse ?
What if economic law , which the Fed can no more defy than it can repeal the law of gravity , is about to hit the Fed and the American people like a tidal wave , before which little rate cuts here and there are like the tiny umbrella Wile E. Coyote puts over his head to protect himself from falling boulders ?
This book will change minds .
Of that I am absolutely certain .
That ’s why our chief task right now is getting it into people ’s hands .
This is the next major grassroots mission : thinking up creative ways to distribute this book , in the process making it an unavoidable part of current - day political discourse .
Nothing would be more satisfying than to disrupt the lead - up to the establishment ’s November bore - a- thon with — gasp — a discussion of things that actually matter , aimed at the non-catatonic segment of the population .
In the short run , buy copies for yourself and your friends .
Of course , lending the book also works , but actually buying them copies serves two useful purposes : 1 ) boosting Ron Paul ’s bestseller status ( dare we hope for a debut at # 1 ? ) and 2 ) guilting your friends into actually reading it , since they know you put down your own money on it .
The prospect that by means of this book hundreds of thousands , perhaps even millions , of Americans may be exposed to these ideas — which this book explains and defends more compellingly than any other book of its length I have ever read — is among the happiest and most exciting developments I can recall in years .
I ’d say more about the book ’s potential , but everything I write comes out like a cliché .
This time , though , believe the clichés .
Ron Paul has taken the gloves off , and the result is a thing of beauty .
Toward the very end , Dr. Paul writes :
Ours is not a fated existence , for nowhere is our destiny etched in stone .
In the final analysis , the last line of defense of freedom and the Constitution consists of the people themselves .
If the people want to be free , if they want to lift themselves out from underneath a state apparatus that threatens their liberties , squanders their resources on needless wars , destroys the value of their dollar , and spews forth endless propaganda about how indispensable it is and how lost we would all be without it , there is no force that can stop them .
The book ’s dedication page is striking , and fitting :
To my supporters :
I have never been more humbled and honored than by your selfless devotion to freedom and the Constitution .
The American Revolutionaries did the impossible .
So can we .
The Revolution : A Manifesto makes one thing abundantly clear : anybody who thought Ron Paul ’s moment was over is sorely mistaken .
He ’s just getting started .
Note :
The book ‘s official release date is April 30 , when its publicity campaign will get under way , but it will be in stores and shipping from Amazon by next week .
The Best of Tom Woods
Since 2005 , the American Psychological Association ( APA ) has steadfastly asserted that psychologists participating in detainee interrogations protects detainees by helping to keep these interrogations “ safe , legal , ethical , and effective . ”
Last week , the APA ’s Ethics Director Stephen Behnke seized upon newly released portions of an official investigation of US detainee abuse , called the Church Report , as an opportunity to reinvigorate support for the APA policy of psychologist participation in interrogations .
In a letter to the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , The APA ’s Dr. Behnke stated :
In carefully reviewing the documents , we note that according to the information obtained by the ACLU , psychologists supporting interrogations ’ emphasized their separation from detainee medical care , ’ and that a psychologist who suspected abuse ‘ recommended the interrogation not proceed and brought in medical personnel to evaluate the detainee . ’
According to these documents , APA ’s policy of engagement served the intended purpose : to stop interrogations that cross the bounds of ethical propriety .
To give Dr. Behnke credit , he did acknowledge the abuses described in the newly released material as “ abhorrent . ”
However , any unbiased “ careful review ” of the documents falls far short of supporting Dr. Behnke ’s conclusion .
Quite the contrary , the report raises new concerns about the roles of psychologists in US interrogations .
Dr. Behnke ’s letter to the ACLU was widely distributed within the APA as a defense of the association ’s long - contested policy .
It therefore important to carefully examine his claims in the context of what is known about interrogation abuses in Iraq .
In a separate article , Trudy Bond responded to Dr. Behnke ’s claims in the same letter , questioning his assertions that the APA is willing to adjudicate reports of psychologists participating in detainee abuse .
I will focus instead here on examining Dr. Behnke ’s claim that the Church Report supports the APA ’s policy of participation in detainee interrogations .
In this process I briefly revisit previous justifications for APA policy .
Newly Released Church Report Materials
On May 30 , 2008 , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) announced the release , under the Freedom of Information Act , of previously redacted portions of the Church Report on US military detainee abuses .
This material contains numerous reports of physical and mental abuse , including several detainee deaths .
The report makes clear that :
[ M]edical personnel often have exposure to the circumstances of detainee treatment .
In discussing a number of these deaths the report states :
We do not know if medical personnel reported suspicions of detainee abuse in this case , but the circumstances probably should have led them to consider detainee abuse .
Although the language is sanitized , this statement nevertheless strongly points to the failure of medical personnel to take appropriate action in the face of likely interrogation abuse .
Yet , in only one of eight deaths judged “ suspicious for abuse ” is there evidence that an Army physician reported the abuse .
Thus , even in the face of potential homicide , medical personnel , for the most part , appear to have remained silent .
With regard to psychologists , the report stated :
In Iraq , we interviewed two military personnel and one civilian serving in this capacity .
All three emphasized their separation from detainee medical care .
Only one believed he had observed or suspected detainee abuse .
No details were offered , except that , when this occurred , he recommended the interrogation not proceed and brought in medical personnel to evaluate the detainee .
The newly released material also reports that interrogation techniques [ authorized by a September 2003 memorandum from commanding General Ricardo Sanchez ] continued to be widely used until at least July 2004 , well after some techniques were retracted in October 2003 .
Other techniques were banned in May 2004 [ in the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal ] .
These included :
Isolation .
Environmental Manipulation : Altering the environment to create moderate discomfort ( e.g. adjusting temperature or introducing an unpleasant smell ) ….
[ Caution : Based on court cases in other countries , some nations may view application of this technique in certain circumstances to be inhumane .
Consideration of these views should be given prior to use of this technique . ]
Presence of Military Working Dog : Exploits Arab fear of dogs while maintaining security during interrogations .
Yelling , Loud Music , and Light Control : Used to create fear , disorient detainee and prolong capture shock .
Sleep Management : Detainee provided minimum 4 hours of sleep per 24 hour period , not to exceed 72 continuous hours .
Stress Positions :
Use of physical postures ( sitting , standing , kneeling , prone , ect. ) for no more than 1 hour per use .
Use of technique(s ) will not exceed 4 hours and adequate rest between use of each position will be provided .
As was confirmed by the just released Justice Department Inspector General report on FBI involvement in abusive interrogations , these techniques were derived from the military ’s Survival , Evasion , Resistance , Escape ( SERE ) program to train US military personnel how to resist breaking under torture .
As the Defense Department Inspector General reported , these techniques were “ reverse engineered ” by military and intelligence psychologists into US interrogation techniques .
Authorization to use these techniques was hidden as , even after the Abu Ghraib scandal , the administration refused to release the Sanchez memo for nearly a year .
These techniques , according to the Church Report , continued in widespread use long after their use had been retracted .
Special Forces
According to accounts by individuals like former Iraq Army interrogator Tony Lagouranis , these SERE techniques were regularly used by Special Forces in Iraq .
Other interrogators learned of them , directly or indirectly , from Special Forces and attempted to imitate the techniques used by these revered units .
Abuses by the Navy SEALS , a Special Forces unit , were reported by Lagouranis :
They would actually have the detainee stripped nude , laying on the floor , pouring ice water over his body .
They were taking his temperature with a rectal thermometer .
We had one guy who had been burned by the navy SEALs .
He looked like he had a lighter held up to his legs .
One guy ’s feet were like huge and black and blue , his toes were obviously all broken , he could n’t walk .
Further reports of abuse by Special Forces include the New York Times ‘s March 19 , 2006 article chillingly entitled “ In Secret Unit ’s ‘ Black Room , ’ a Grim Portrait of U.S. Abuse “ :
American soldiers made one of the former Iraqi government ’s torture chambers into their own interrogation cell .
They named it the Black Room .
In the windowless , jet - black garage - size room , some soldiers beat prisoners with rifle butts , yelled and spit in their faces and , in a nearby area , used detainees for target practice in a game of jailer paintball … .
Placards posted by soldiers at the detention area advised , “ NO BLOOD , NO FOUL . ”
The slogan , as one Defense Department official explained , reflected an adage adopted by Task Force 6 - 26 : ‘ If you do n’t make them bleed , they ca n’t prosecute for it . ’
This unit combined elements from throughout the Special Forces :
The task force was a melting pot of military and civilian units .
It drew on elite troops from the Joint Special Operations Command , whose elements include the Army unit Delta Force , Navy ’s Seal Team 6 and the 75th Ranger Regiment .
There are numerous other reports of pervasive abuse by troops across Iraq .
Thus Capt .
Ian Fishback and two other members of the 82nd Airborne Division told Human Rights Watch in 2005 that the abuse in their unit was routine .
As reported in the New York Times :
In separate statements to the human rights organization , Captain Fishback and two sergeants described systematic abuses of Iraqi prisoners , including beatings , exposure to extremes of hot and cold , stacking in human pyramids and sleep deprivation at Camp Mercury , a forward operating base near Falluja .
Capt .
Fishback also quoted an Army Ranger , a Special Forces unit , as saying ( after the Abu Ghraib scandal broke in April 2004 ) :
I talked to an officer in the Ranger regiment and his response was , he would n’t tell me exactly what he witnessed but he said “ I witnessed things that were more intense than what you witnessed , ” but it was n’t anything that exceeded what I had heard about at SERE school .
Military Intelligence
Military Intelligence units in Iraq were also involved in much of the detainee abuse .
Thus , the International Committee of the Red Cross [ ICRC ] inspected detention facilities across the country and , in a leaked February 2004 report , described systematic abuse by military intelligence throughout Iraq .
It states :
persons deprived of their liberty under supervision of the Military Intelligence were at high risk of being subjected to a variety of harsh treatments ranging from insults , threats and humiliations to both physical and psychological coercion , which in some cases was tantamount to torture , in order to force cooperation with their interrogators ( p. 3 - 4 ) .
The ICRC further reported :
In certain cases such as in Abu Ghraib military intelligence section , methods of physical and psychological coercion used by the interrogators appeared to be part of the standard operating procedures by military intelligence personnel to obtain confessions and extract information .
Several military intelligence officers confirmed to the ICRC that it was part of the military intelligence process to hold a person deprived of his liberty naked in a completely dark and empty cell for a prolonged period to use inhumane and degrading treatment , including physical and psychological coercion ( p. 11 ) .
It is important to note that no one was prosecuted or convicted at Abu Ghraib for isolating or humiliating prisoners , or for putting prisoners in ‘ stress positions . ’
These were considered standard operating procedures by the prosecution .
The convictions were handed down for taking the infamous photographs or when there was evidence of physical abuse that went beyond these techniques .
The Church Report
It is relevant to understand that the Church Report is widely viewed as an attempt to whitewash detainee abuse through sidestepping the extent to which abuse was standard operating procedure and thus reducing command responsibility for that abuse .
Thus Human Rights
Watch characterizes the Church Report as a partial cover - up containing patent falsehoods :
The Church report was supposed to be the definitive report on the development of interrogation techniques and detainee abuse in the “ global war on terror ” but the unclassified summary suggests a careful attempt – months after the Schlesinger and Fay / Jones report put the Pentagon on the defensive – to present a version of the facts that would not cause any trouble for the hierarchy .
Time and again , the summary goes out of its way to rebut any inference that government policy was to blame , to the point of straining credibility and flatly contradicting the earlier reports .
The report concluded that there was ‘ no single , overarching explanation ’ for the ‘ few ’ cases in which detainees had not been treated humanely .
Although Secretary Rumsfeld and General Sanchez both approved the use of guard dogs to strike fear in detainees , and although guard dogs were featured prominently in the Abu Ghraib photos , the Church executive summary states that ‘ it is clear that none of the pictured abuses at Abu Ghraib bear any resemblance to approved policies at any level , in any theater . ’
Indeed , the only mention of dogs in the entire summary is the patently false statement that in Afghanistan and Iraq ‘ interrogators clearly understood that abusive practices and techniques – such as … terrorizing detainees with unmuzzled dogs … – were at all times prohibited . ’
Given the nature of this report , it should be taken as a statement of what cannot be denied , and not as a definitive account of the nature or the extent of detainee abuse .
Previous APA Policy Justifications
The APA has utilized many questionable arguments and deceptive tactics to justify psychologists ’ participation in interrogations .
In 2005 , the APA appointed a Presidential Task Force on Psychological Ethics and National Security ( PENS ) .
This Task Force was given the mandate to determine APA policy on psychologists ’ participation in detainee interrogations .
The majority of the Task Force membership , it turns out , consisted of military and intelligence psychologists who played roles in post 9/11 interrogations at Guantánamo , Afghanistan , Iraq , and the CIA ’s “ black site ” torture centers .
Not surprisingly , this task force emphasized psychologists important role is aiding national security by participating in these interrogations .
In support of its policy the APA has highlighted every available report of psychologists resisting interrogation abuses .
While finding small pockets of resistance would hardly defend the policy , the APA has been able to offer only three incidents of psychologists ostensibly opposing the abusive interrogation policy .
This despite the central role of psychologists in interrogations at Guantánamo and the CIA black sites and their participation in interrogations in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
The most noteworthy example offered thus far has been that of Michael Gelles , a Navy Criminal Investigative Service psychologist .
Gelles forcefully opposed opposed some of the worst abuses committed at Guantánamo and reported them to his commander , leading to policy changes .
While Dr. Gelles acted honorably and may have helped change policies , one should remember that , long after these interventions the ICRC found conditions at Guantánamo continued to be abusive .
As the New York Times described the ICRC findings during their June 2004 visit :
[ I ] nvestigators had found a system devised to break the will of the prisoners at Guantánamo , who now number about 550 , and make them wholly dependent on their interrogators through ‘ humiliating acts , solitary confinement , temperature extremes , use of forced positions . ’
Investigators said that the methods used were increasingly ‘ more refined and repressive ’ than learned about on previous visits .
The construction of such a system , whose stated purpose is the production of intelligence , cannot be considered other than an intentional system of cruel , unusual and degrading treatment and a form of torture , ’ the report said .
It said that in addition to the exposure to loud and persistent noise and music and to prolonged cold , detainees were subjected to ‘ some beatings . ’
The report did not say how many of the detainees were subjected to such treatment .
Thus , whatever successes Dr. Gelles ’ achieved , they did little to dismantle the abusive system , described in the ICRC report as “ tantamount to torture . ”
Even Dr. Gelles ’ valiant attempt to oppose these interrogation techniques did little , in the end , to keep interrogations “ safe , legal , ethical , and effective . ”
The APA has also at times pointed to Col. Larry James as an example of a psychologist successfully opposing torture .
But there is simply no evidence to support this claim .
Col. James was the Chief Psychologist on the Joint Intelligence Task Force in charge of the Behavioral Science Consultation Team ( BSCT ) at Guantánamo in early 2003 .
As the Red Cross noted when they returned to Guantánamo a year after col .
James ’ departure , conditions had only become increasingly “ more refined and repressive ” since Col.
James was stationed there .
Additionally , during Col. James ’ tour at Guantánamo , the Camp Delta Standard Operating Procedures were adopted mandating a minimum of four weeks isolation for all new detainees :
to enhance and exploit the disorientation and disorganization felt by a newly arrived detainee in the interrogation process .
It concentrates on isolating the detainee and fostering dependence of the detainee on his interrogator .
The Joint Intelligence Task Force , of which Col. James was the Chief Psychologist , was in fact assigned the role of deciding when a detainee had been sufficiently disoriented , disorganized , and dependent on his interrogator enough to be released from this isolation .
When this policy was described in Harpers online , Dr. Behnke , the APA ’s Ethics wrote a letter agreeing that this use of isolation was unethical for psychologists :
With the recent posting on the Internet of what has been identified as the U.S. military ’s 2003 operating manual for the Guantánamo detention center , attention has been directed to the use of isolation and sensory deprivation as interrogation procedures .
APA policy specifically prohibits using any such technique , alone or in combination with other techniques for the purpose of breaking down a detainee .
Nonetheless , even after this information became public , APA officials have continued to cite Col.
James to audiences as an anti-torture hero .
APA and the Newly - Released Materials
Contained in the newly released sections of the Church Report is an official acknowledgement that psychologists in so - called Behavioral Science Consultation Teams ( BSCTs ) functioned in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
But what had not been clear before is that these BSCTs are “ mostly within Special Operations , where they provide direct support to military operations . ”
That is , the BSCT psychologists were , as described above , within the units especially known for using brutal means for dealing with detainees ( Arrigo & Bennett , 2007 ) .
Given this context , it is especially misleading that the APA ’s Ethics Director points to two vague sentences in the report to argue that this material supports the APA ’s policy of “ engagement ” with the Bush administration ’s interrogation regime .
Here are the relevant sentences from the Church report :
In Iraq , we interviewed two military personnel and one civilian serving in this capacity .
All three emphasized their separation from detainee medical care .
Only one believed he had observed or suspected detainee abuse .
No details were offered , except that , when this occurred , he recommended the interrogation not proceed and brought in medical personnel to evaluate the detainee .
Given that these BSCT psychologists are “ mostly within Special Operations ” and are assigned to military intelligence , a curious reader might wonder about the routine nature of interrogations witnessed or participated in by the BSCT psychologists .
These routine interrogations likely included techniques approved by the September 2003 memorandum from Gen.
Sanchez which the very same Church Report materials document were still in widespread use through at least July 2004 .
Given this background , there is a more plausible reading of these sentences .
It is most likely that what was “ abuse ” to a BSCT psychologist were interrogation tactics that went beyond those authorized by the September 2003 memo as ‘ standard operating procedure . ’
That is , given the “ No Blood , No Foul ” attitude of many Special Forces units , “ abuse ” would very likely be tactics that led to serious and visible physical harm .
The fact that the BSCT “ brought in medical personnel to evaluate the detainee ” also supports such an interpretation .
In years of reading and writing about detainee abuse in Iraq and elsewhere , I have never seen accounts of medical personnel being brought in to examine victims exposed “ merely ” to psychological abuse such as isolation , stress positions , sleep deprivation , or exposure to loud noises or freezing temperatures .
It is unlikely that this sole report of a psychologist reporting abuse was referring to these widespread , but standard , abuses .
Can I prove my interpretation of this passage is the correct one ?
No .
The wording is ambiguous and “ no details were offered . ”
But Dr. Behnke ’s claim that these newly released materials provide evidence that “ APA ’s policy of engagement served the intended purpose – to stop interrogations that cross the bounds of ethical propriety ” – is totally unsupported .
In contrast , my interpretation is grounded in knowledge about detainee abuse in Iraq and about the Church report .
Dr. Behnke ’s “ careful ” review of these documents does not attempt to understand the role of psychologists in abuse of detainees but , like U.S. “ intelligence ” about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , fixes the data around established APA policy .

Because . . . Colonel Saul Tigh is John McCain .

The similarities are just so striking , and not just the uncanny physical resemblance between the actor and the Arizona senator .

Also — this is the clincher —
Tigh has a secretary named Kennedy , and McCain has a secretary named Lincoln .
Seriously , though , this is pretty amazing all around .
I ’ll try not to write about the election in this space again — but only if the election tries harder to not freak me out with its staggering likeness to Battlestar Galactica .

Bilan is one of Russia 's biggest pop stars and his heartfelt ballad Believe , produced by US R&B star Timbaland , gave Russia its first ever Eurovision win .
Ukraine 's Ani Lorak came second with her energetic disco track Shady Lady , followed by Greece with upbeat pop song Secret Combination by Kalomira .
But British talent show runner - up Andy Abraham came last with his song Even If , gaining just 14 points .
EUROVISION TOP FIVE 1 . Russia : 272 points
2 . Ukraine ( above ) : 230 3 . Greece : 218 4 . Armenia : 199 5 . Norway : 182 Germany and Poland also received 14 points each , but they officially finished above the UK because their top scores in a single round were higher .
Dima Bilan won with a stage show that included Olympic figure skating champion Evgeni Plushenko performing on a small ice circle .
Bilan is a well - known performer throughout Russia and beyond , having been named best artist at the country 's MTV Awards for the past three years in a row .
He took part in Eurovision in 2006 , finishing second behind Finnish rock monsters Lordi .
He has recorded an album in English with Timbaland , including a duet with Canadian singer Nelly Furtado , and hopes to use it to break into the international market later this year .

In May , Jewish organisations will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel .
This is understandable in the context of centuries of persecution culminating in the Holocaust .
Nevertheless , we are Jews who will not be celebrating .
Surely it is now time to acknowledge the narrative of the other , the price paid by another people for European anti-semitism and Hitler 's genocidal policies .
As Edward Said emphasised , what the Holocaust is to the Jews , the Naqba is to the Palestinians .
In April 1948 , the same month as the infamous massacre at Deir Yassin and the mortar attack on Palestinian civilians in Haifa 's market square , Plan Dalet was put into operation .
This authorised the destruction of Palestinian villages and the expulsion of the indigenous population outside the borders of the state .
We will not be celebrating .
In July 1948 , 70,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes in Lydda and Ramleh in the heat of the summer with no food or water .
Hundreds died .
It was known as the Death March .
We will not be celebrating .
In all , 750,000 Palestinians became refugees .
Some 400 villages were wiped off the map .
That did not end the ethnic cleansing .
Thousands of Palestinians ( Israeli citizens ) were expelled from the Galilee in 1956 .
Many thousands more when Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza .
Under international law and sanctioned by UN resolution 194 , refugees from war have a right to return or compensation .
Israel has never accepted that right .
We will not be celebrating .
We cannot celebrate the birthday of a state founded on terrorism , massacres and the dispossession of another people from their land .
We cannot celebrate the birthday of a state that even now engages in ethnic cleansing , that violates international law , that is inflicting a monstrous collective punishment on the civilian population of Gaza and that continues to deny to Palestinians their human rights and national aspirations .
We will celebrate when Arab and Jew live as equals in a peaceful Middle East .

The U.S. Department of Energy plans to digitally copy , then destroy 500 boxes of documents related to the former Rocky Flats nuclear - weapons plant , prompting vigorous objections from a local coalition and two Colorado congressmen .
The decision is “ extremely troubling , ” U.S. Reps .
Mark Udall and Ed Perlmutter said in a recent letter to the DOE Office of Legacy Management .
“ These documents , which have been part of the public record for years , are critical to understanding the history of Rocky Flats and cleanup activities and should be preserved , ” the congressmen said .
The Rocky Flats Stewardship Council , which provides local government and community oversight of Rocky Flats since the plant closed in 1989 , also expressed “ deep concern ” about the decision .
Despite repeated requests , “ DOE has yet to specify in writing the legal and regulatory basis for destroying these documents , ” council chairwoman Lorraine Anderson wrote in a May 5 letter to the department .
Phone and e-mail messages seeking comment from the Office of Legacy Management were not returned .
At issue are documents not in the formal administrative record , which outlines the plant ’s $ 7 billion cleanup , completed in 2005 .
Until September , the documents were housed at the Front Range Community College library .
Gary Morrell , librarian for the Rocky Flats Reading Room at Front Range , said the documents include community studies , state health records , geologic information , aerial radiological surveys , monitoring data , and accident and incident reports .
“ Some of the documents probably do n’t exist anywhere else , ” Morrell said , adding that a “ great deal of the material does n’t have much to do with Rocky Flats as a nuclear - weapons plant . ”
Visitors to the reading room have included DOE lawyers , which Morrell said could indicate that the information is n’t available elsewhere ; scientists investigating a fault line under the plant ; and former workers trying to build cases for illness compensation .
DOE officials planned to give the documents to the archives at the University of Colorado at Boulder , which has numerous Rocky Flats documents .
But late last year , the department discovered personal information — including Social Security numbers — on a few documents and declared that all the boxes posed a risk of identity theft .
Morrell believes the offending documents are limited and could be easily narrowed .
The DOE has plans to make electronic copies available on the Internet , but archivists , the congressmen and the council argue that electronic formats change and paper files are permanent records .
Keeping the documents in one Colorado location will make research more convenient for scholars , public officials and the public , said CU archivist Bruce Montgomery .
The DOE ’s decision comes , Democrats Udall and Perlmutter noted , as former workers try to gather information needed to link illnesses with work - related exposures at the plant northwest of Denver .
“ Not having this information available in Colorado in a publicly accessible format will make it conceivably more difficult for workers doing research on their cases for compensation , ” said Jennifer Thompson , a 14 - year Rocky Flats worker who led last year ’s effort to gain compensation and health benefits for sick former plant workers .
David Abelson , executive director of the stewardship council , said that while the situation is frustrating , “ I also think it ’s totally resolvable . ”
What ’s in the boxes
Documents the Department of Energy plans to remove from Colorado and destroy after making digital copies include :
• Geologic and seismologic investigations for the Rocky Flats plant for U.S. Department of Energy .
• Sitewide Geoscience Characterization Study , 1995 .
• An archaeological and historical survey of selected parcels at the plant in northern Jefferson County dated Jan. 1 , 1989 .
• Aerial radiation surveys of the plant from 1981 and 1989 .
• City of Broomfield environmental - monitoring reports , 1988 to 1993 .
• Radiation data monthly reports ( city of Westminster ) , 1988 to 1997 .
• Final report of the Governor ’s Rocky Flats Scientific Panel on Monitoring Systems , October 1990 .
• Standley Lake fish toxics - monitoring report , January 1990 .
• Chemical inventories .
• Newspaper clippings pertaining to Rocky Flats from January 1989 through last fall .

The basic ingredients for life -- warmth , water and organic chemicals -- are in place on Saturn ’s small moon Enceladus , scientists said on Wednesday in detailing the content of huge plumes erupting off its surface .

The scientists described observations made by the Cassini spacecraft when it flew over the surface of Enceladus on March 12 as part of an ongoing exploration of Saturn and its moons .
Scientists working on the joint U.S. - European mission did not say they had detected any actual evidence of life on this moon where geysers at its south pole continuously shoot watery plumes some 500 miles off its icy surface into space .
But they said the building blocks for life were there , and described the plumes as a surprising organic brew sort of like carbonated water with an essence of natural gas .
“ Water vapor was the major constituent .
There was methane present .
There was carbon dioxide .
There was carbon monoxide .
There were simple organics and there were more complex organics , ” Hunter Waite of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio , Texas , told reporters .
Organic molecules contain carbon - hydrogen bonds and can be found in living things .
Waite said the material bursting out of the geysers was very much like a comet ’s chemistry .
Comets are celestial bodies orbiting the sun made of rock , dust and ice with characteristic tails of gas and dust streams .
“ The question that one would ask is : where did the organics come from ? ”
Waite said .
“ Of course , natural gas comes from decaying biological matter on Earth .
But this is not the conclusion we reached for Enceladus .
Another possibility is the geochemistry going on in the interior can also produce organics , ” Waite added .
Scientists are eager to learn whether conditions exist in our solar system other than Earth to support life , even in merely microbial form .
Mars has been the subject of a lot of investigation , but some moons also are seen as candidates .
“ We see on Enceladus the three basic requirements for the origin of life , ” Larry Esposito of the University of Colorado said .
“ We see water , although it may not be liquid .
We see organic compounds ... and we also have a source of heat . ”
“ Now we do n’t yet see , nor can we tell or state , whether the interior of Enceladus contains liquid water , and if that water might be a habitat for life , ” Esposito added , adding that future fly - bys will examine that question , starting in August .
Some scientists think the source of the geysers may be heated liquid water -- perhaps even an ocean -- under the surface of Enceladus ( pronounced en- SELL - ah - dus ) .
The scientists said Cassini found higher temperatures than previously known at the south pole surface , although still frigid at minus - 135 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus - 93 degrees C ) .
Cassini was about 120 miles above the surface as it flew through a plume .
Enceladus has a diameter of 310 miles
and is one of Saturn ’s innermost moons .
MARCH 6-- An international call girl ring that solicited wealthy male clients via a web site that rated its hookers on a scale of diamonds ( and charged accordingly ) has been busted by federal agents .
The operators of the New York - based Emperors Club were named in a felony complaint unsealed today in U.S. District Court in Manhattan .
Before the Emperors Club web site was taken down this afternoon , TSG grabbed a screen shot showing part of the firm 's hooker menu .
Another page from the site described how its rates were based on a woman 's rating ( which ranged from three to seven diamonds ) and noted that " Gift Certificates Available Upon Request . "
A detailed FBI affidavit provides other details about the Emperors Club operation , which charged up to $ 5500 an hour for one of its 50 prostitutes , who operated in New York , Washington , D.C. , Los Angeles , London , and Paris .
The affidavit notes that one prospective hooker , who declined to work for the company because it did not pay enough , complained that a friend of hers had sex twice in an hour with an Emperors Club john who did not even spring for dinner beforehand .
In one wiretapped conversation , Mark Brener , the ring 's leader , complained that one of his hookers looked like a " butcher . "
During another call , Emperors Club employees discussed the " baggage " a hooker carries when she is a mother who has to leave appointments early to pick up her kids from school .
The affidavit also includes the musings of one self - aware prostitute who remarked in a phone call , " I know what my purpose is .
I 'm not a ... moron . " ( 6 pages )
Click to viewStar Trek was relevant twice : in the 1960s , and then in the late 80s - early 90s .
But now , it 's become a microcosm of everything that 's wrong with science fiction .
Here 's our list of reasons Star Trek should rest in peace .
Advertisement
6 . Trek is a poison dart of nostalgia aimed at the hearts of aging fan - dudes .
The franchise caters to a fearsomely loyal cadre of dorks who recite Shatner 's Promise Margarine commercials to each other .
They also obsess over every minor detail from the show 's 40,000 year history , leading to ...
5. Obsessive continuity and reveling in cheese .
Rumor has it the new Trek movie will feature tribbbles and the Guardian of Forever , and god knows what other callbacks to ancient episodes .
Trek also groans under the weight of cliches it can never outgrow , from " beam me up " to " warp nine " to " shields down to 59 percent . "
Advertisement
4 . It 's an out - of - date news flash .
Trek 's format is a Cold War relic , from the original show 's running Soviets =Klingons metaphor to the post - Cold War " new order " of TNG and DS9 .
Most storylines relate to " our " superpower , the Federation , facing off against other superpowers or coping with third - world planets .
Take away the Cold War as a reference point , and you have boring space opera .
3 . It 's no longer looking ahead .
Like Star Wars ,
Trek is trapped in prequel - land .
Enterprise bored us by filling in pointless backstory on the early days of Starfleet , but the J.J. Abrams movie looks to be twice as pointless .
We already know everything we need to about young Kirk and the other Trek tots .
Mining your own past is a prime symptom of idea bankruptcy .
2 . We 're tired of the clueless wanker with Aspergers who teaches us what it means to be human .
Spock was sort of cute , so nu-Trek served up Data , Odo , that holographic doctor , Seven of Nine and T'Pol .
It 's not Trek without Rain Man trying to understand our human ways .
We prefer the Cylons , who school us about humanity by screwing and killing us .
1. Sanctimonious preaching is in Trek 's DNA .
From the Prime Directive to the Captain 's Log , the franchise was made for droning voices giving us lectures .
Starfleet Academy must give would - be captains a special course in holding forth about the moral lesson in every conceivable situation .
We 're also sick of constantly hearing about how our heroes are too noble to share their advanced technology with other cultures .

In a nutshell , the only Star Trek we 've liked in ages was Galaxy Quest , and that was mostly for Sigourney Weaver , Alan Rickman and Veronica Mars ' dad .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
An experimental gene therapy treatment appears to have helped eight children with a rare and incurable neurological disorder , although it may have been responsible for the death of one , researchers reported on Tuesday .
A strand of DNA is seen in an undated handout image .
REUTERS / National Institutes of Health / Handout
They said the treatment appeared safe and effective enough to try in more children with late infantile neuronal ceroidlipofuscinosis , or LINCL , a form of deadly Batten disease .
The treatment , in which a virus carrying the corrective gene was infused directly into the brain , appeared to slow the decline of eight out of 10 children treated , Dr. Ron Crystal of New York - Presbyterian Hospital / Weill Cornell Medical Center and colleagues reported .
“ We are encouraged by this .
It ’s not a cure , ” Crystal said in a telephone interview .
Like all forms of gene therapy , the hope is that the mutant cells will take up the new gene and start working normally .
Children with LINCL start showing symptoms at about age 4 .
They lose coordination , vision and speech and usually die unable to breathe on their own , between 10 and 12 .
One child suffered an epileptic seizure weeks after treatment and died and another child died of unknown causes two years after treatment .
Eight of the children showed a measurable slowing of the inevitable decline usually seen in the condition .
Only about 200 children are alive with the disease globally at a given time .
“ The disease is caused by mutations in the CLN2 ( ceroid lipofuscinosis , neuronal 2 ) gene , ” Crystal and colleagues wrote in their report , which was published in the journal Human Gene Therapy .
INTERNATIONAL TRIAL
The researchers chose 10 children from the United States , Britain , Australia and Germany , five severely affected by the disease and five moderately affected .
Tiny glass tubes infused the adeno - associated viruses carrying the corrective gene into the brains of the children .
Crystal ’s team watched the 10 children for 18 months , comparing them to four untreated children with the same condition .
“ The primary variable was a clinical rating scale based on the number of seizures , language skills , motor skills and so on , ” Crystal said .
“ That ’s where we saw what appeared to be statistically significant . ”
Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain also appeared to show slowing of the disease but this was less clear , he said .
“ You ca n’t give back more brain cells .
You ca n’t improve it .
All you can hope to do is to delay progression , ” Crystal said .
One child suffered a seizure and died after 49 days .
“ We know it ’s related to what we did , ” Crystal said .
“ But we do n’t know whether it related to the virus or not . ”
He said there was no evidence the virus caused an immune reaction and noted that putting a glass tube into the brain could have caused a seizure .
Children with Batten ’s often have seizures as a manifestation of the disease .
Crystal said the dangerous and experimental therapy was justified for the children .
The mutations affect a mechanism that rids nerve cells of waste materials .
“ It ’s like the garbage man of the cell is not able to do its job , ” Crystal said .
“ The trash keeps getting backed up inside the cell until the cells can no longer function properly and then eventually die throughout the entire brain . ”
Gene therapy is a controversial field but last month doctors reported a gene therapy approach improved the vision in four patients with a blinding condition .
In 1999 an 18 - year - old volunteer died during a gene therapy experiment and in 2002 gene therapy cured two French boys with a fatal immune disorder but gave then leukemia -- which was also treated .
Nouri Maliki ( left ) has demanded nations reopen embassies UN chief Ban Ki-moon has praised progress in Iraq at a UN forum in Sweden on the situation in the country .
Mr Ban said Iraq was " stepping back from the abyss that we feared most " but warned the situation " remains fragile " .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki called for debt cancellation , mainly from Arab nations .
Nearly 100 countries are taking part in the forum , which is aimed at supporting Iraq 's efforts to restore stability and rebuild a functioning economy .
Correspondents say progress in these areas remains fragile .
The UN called the conference to review a five - year package it brokered last year , called the International Compact with Iraq .

" Iraq is not a poor country .
It possesses tremendous human and material resources , but the debts of Iraq ... which we inherited from the dictator , hamper the reconstruction process , " he said .
Iraq owes more than $ 60 bn ( £ 30.4 bn ) debt in total , with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia among the biggest creditors .
It also owes about $ 28bn in compensation claims dating from the 1991 Gulf War .
Swedish officials had earlier played down the possibility of new initiatives at the meeting , and Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said debt was not its subject .
Meanwhile US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged countries to stand by Iraq during reconstruction .
She said Iraq was " making good progress " but " challenges " remained .
But Iran 's foreign minister blamed the US - led coalition 's " mistaken policies " for the " grave " situation in Iraq , the Associated Press reported .
' Hope ' Mr Ban opened the conference , in Upplands Vasby , about 25 km ( 15 miles ) north of Sweden 's capital , Stockholm , with an upbeat assessment .
" If we had to use one word to describe the situation in Iraq today I would choose ... hope , " he said .

"
On the eve of the forum the largest Sunni Muslim bloc suspended talks on rejoining Iraq 's Shia - led government .
A number of demonstrations were planned in the Stockholm area and close to the conference centre against the continued US presence in Iraq .
The gathering follows up on a conference in May 2007 at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el - Sheikh , where the Iraq Compact was launched .
On security , optimism has been growing in Iraq that progress is at last being made , with ceasefires in Sadr City and Basra still holding , and the Iraqi government claiming some success in clearing al - Qaeda from the northern city of Mosul .
The US military says violence in Iraq is at its lowest levels for four years .
The conference was expected to put pressure on Mr Maliki 's government to push ahead with political reconciliation between Sunni Arabs , Shia and Kurds , while continuing the clampdown on both Sunni and Shia extremism .
Anti-terrorist police were brought in as part of the security preparations
But on the eve of the conference the leader of the largest Sunni bloc suspended talks on rejoining the government , saying there was a dispute over which posts his followers would be given .
Adnan al - Dulaimi , who heads the Sunni Accordance Front in the Iraqi parliament , said Mr Maliki had refused to allow his bloc to resume leadership of the planning ministry .
Between them , the three parties that make up the bloc hold 44 of the 275 seats in parliament .
Ali al - Adeeb , a Shia MP close to Mr Maliki , played down the bloc 's decision , saying it was " not a big step backward " .

Former White House press secretary Scott McClellan continued to press his case Thursday that the Bush administration manipulated intelligence to justify the war in Iraq , and responded to a growing chorus of criticism from other former administration officials .
Appearing on NBC ’s Today show , Mr. McClellan said that the administration ignored evidence that contradicted its position on Iraq , and he sharply criticized some of Mr. Bush ’s closest advisers .
He said Vice President Dick Cheney “ was given a lot of deference by the president , ” and said “ in a number of ways , he has not served the president well . ”
He said Mr. Cheney was known as “ the magic man ” in the White House for his ability to get things done .
Mr. McClellan said that Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice did not challenge the president or other top officials when she should have .
“ Too often she was too accommodating ” to the president ’s views , he said .
She was also too deferential to Mr. Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld .
It is early morning in Barcelona 's La Boqueria market and the fish stallholders are setting out their wares .
Mounds of pink and grey glisten down the dim alleys - shoppers and tourists peering at the fins and tentacles .
It is not like any fish shop in Britain - some stalls sell five different species of squid and cuttlefish , half a dozen types of shrimp and prawn , 10 different cuts of salt cod .
It is a fish eater 's haven in the heart of a city that eats and sells more fish than anywhere else in Europe .
Anyone who cares about where their fish come from - and this should mean anyone who wants to go on eating them - should take two tools when they visit the fishmonger .
One is the handy guidance provided by the Marine Conservation Society , Fish to Avoid and Fish to Eat ( the latter is still the longer ) ; the other is a ruler .
My ruler is the type handed out to commercial fishermen by the international advisory body , Incofish , and has pictures of key species with marks indicating when they can be considered mature ( and , thus , OK to catch ) .
So I set about lining up my ruler against the La Boqueria fish , starting with the mackerel ( should be 34 cm ) , the plaice ( 39 cm ) and the redfish ( 45 cm ) .
All turn out to be mere babies .
The mackerel is half the designated length .
A glance around the stalls shows 10 or more species on the MCS 's Avoid list , including hake , swordfish , monkfish , bluefin tuna and , of course , cod .
I do n't spend much time doing this because the Catalan fishmongers do n't like my ruler - or me .
They do n't want to talk about why they are selling tiny hake ( one of Europe 's most endangered species ) and why not a single fish in the market has any ' sustainable ' labelling .
One old lady asks me what I 'm after .
' I want to know why the Spanish are eating so many undersized fish from populations that are running out , ' I say .
' It 's simple , ' she says .
' We like fish and small fish taste better . '
Is anyone not aware that wild fish are in deep trouble ?
That three - quarters of commercially caught species are over - exploited or exploited to their maximum ?
Do they not know that industrial fishing is so inefficient that a third of the catch , some 32 million tonnes a year , is thrown away ?
For every ocean prawn you eat , fish weighing 10 - 20 times as much have been thrown overboard .
These figures all come from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) , which also claims that , of all the world 's natural resources , fish are being depleted the fastest .
With even the most abundant commercial species , we eat smaller and smaller fish every year - we eat the babies before they can breed .
Callum Roberts , professor of marine conservation at York University , predicts that by 2050 we will only be able to meet the fish protein needs of half the world population : all that will be left for the unlucky half may be , as he puts it , ' jellyfish and slime ' .
Ninety years of industrial - scale exploitation of fish has , he and most scientists agree , led to ' ecological meltdown ' .
Whole biological food chains have been destroyed .
Many of those fish you can see in such glorious abundance in Spanish markets - and on our own supermarket shelves - come not from European seas but from the coasts of the continents of the poor : Africa , South America and parts of Asia .
Fishermen have always roamed far afield - the Basques began fishing the great cod populations off Newfoundland at least 500 years ago .
And when serious shortages in traditional stocks around Europe began to be commercially apparent 30 years ago , the trawler fleets began to move south .
Strangely one of the first international attempts to conserve fish stocks , especially for the more easily exploited nations , also became part of the disaster .
The United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea , signed in 1979 , extended national rights over fisheries to 200 miles from a country 's coasts .
But it included a provision that , if fish stocks in that zone were surplus to national needs , the country could sell its rights to outsiders .
That convention allowed cash - strapped and sometimes corrupt countries in west Africa to raise funds by letting the industrial trawler fleets in .
Since 1979 the EU has negotiated deals on fishing rights with a string of impoverished African countries .
Despite the EU's own studies indicating massive and quite possibly irreversible damage to fish stocks off west Africa , these deals continue to be struck .
In 2002 , the year an EU report revealed that the Senegalese fish biomass had declined 75 per cent in 15 years , Brussels bought rights for four years ' fishing of tuna and bottom - dwelling fish on the Senegal coasts , for just $ 4 m a year .
In 2006 , access for 43 giant EU factory fishing vessels to Mauritania 's long coastline was bought for £ 24.3 m a year .
It 's estimated that these deals have put 400,000 west African fishermen out of work ; some of them now take to the sea only as ferrymen for desperate would - be migrants to the Canary Islands and Europe .
And among the millions of Africans who depend on fish as their main source of protein , consumption has declined from 9 kg per year to 7kg .
North Atlantic fish stocks have been in decline for well over a century .
Callum Roberts points out in his recent book The Unnatural History of the Sea that it was obvious from the 1880s that fish stocks were in decline .
Fish catch records from the 1920s onwards show that , despite the enormous improvements in boat design and trawling technology and better refrigeration , catches of the great Atlantic species , such as haddock , cod , hake and turbot , remained constant or slowly declined .
As they have ever since .
Unlike global warming , the science of fish stock collapse is old and its practitioners have been pretty much in agreement since the 1950s .
Yet Roberts can think of only one international agreement that has actually worked and preserved stocks of an exploited marine animal - a deal in the Arctic in 1911 to regulate the hunting of fur seals on the Pribilof Islands .
So why has the international community failed so badly in its attempts to stop the long - heralded disaster with our fish ?
' Quite simply , ' Roberts says , ' agreements and deals brokered by politicians will never be satisfactory .
They always look for the short - term fix . '
He and his team at York University did a survey of the last 20 years of EU ministerial decisions on fish catches and found that , on average , they set quotas for fishing fleets 15 to 30 per cent higher than those recommended as safe by scientists .
' What that figure does n't tell you is that often , for less threatened species like mackerel or whiting , they have set quotas 100 per cent higher than the science recommended .
So , in their efforts to pacify the industry , they are bringing populations that could be sustainably fished into the risk zone , ' he said .
The fishing industry , Roberts feels , has exerted excessive influence on politicians in Europe 's Atlantic nations since the 18th century - when it was necessary to keep the fleets well manned , as a source of seamen for their navies when war broke out .
Europe is by far the worst criminal among the developed nations .
It is in the Far East , in Japan and Korea , that most fish are eaten , per head - the Japanese eat 66kg each a year , as opposed to Spain 's 44kg and Britain 's 20kg .
But the Chinese ( at 25 kg ) alone eat around a third of the world 's fish , and , as with meat , the fish proportion of their diet is soaring as the population gets more wealthy .
( The fact that much Asian fish is farmed is little consolation - their feed may often be derived from wild fish . )
According to Greenpeace , Chinese fishing fleets are among the most rapacious when it comes to hoovering up the stocks of small nations in the Pacific and Atlantic .
But in no Asian country is the notion of sustainable fishing much developed among consumers - and it is from consumers that any demand for change must come .
Because , as Roberts and all the green lobby groups note , the structures and organisations set up by politicians and industry to control fisheries , or even preserve the most endangered species , have entirely failed .
The Observer went to see one of these bodies in action in Tokyo a few weeks ago .
ICCAT , the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas , is an obscure - if you 're not in the tuna business - Madrid - based organisation that spends some € 2.3 m ( £ 1.8 m ) of EU taxpayers ' money a year collating and commissioning scientific research , and holding meetings for the 45 nations with an interest in the tuna - type species in the Atlantic and Mediterranean .
These include the US , Japan , China and the UK .
If you work for ICCAT , it 's a high air miles life : Tokyo in March , Florianopolis , Brazil , next month .
This is all in the cause of conserving tuna , of course .
Which ICCAT , all observers agree , has utterly failed to do .
In fact , the commission is a joke : known in the business as the International Conspiracy to Catch All Tunas .
Sergi Tudela , the World Wildlife Fund 's head of fisheries for the Mediterranean , does n't find it funny .
' ICCAT is a treaty , and some of its contracting parties pervert the spirit of it to ensure their overfishing of tuna continues , ' he says .
Roberts agrees .
' ICCAT does n't do what it says it does - it does n't conserve .
Instead it presides over the decline and collapse of tuna stocks . '
After the first day's talks the Japanese government threw an ICCAT party .
Delegates - fishermen , industry moguls , scientists , lobbyists and fisheries ministry reps - stood around chatting politely , sipping their drinks , in a grand carpeted conference room .
Some very senior EU fisheries people were there , but not Mitsubishi , the enormous Japanese company that buys most European tuna .
It pulled out at the last moment .
Silver plates in hand , the delegates tackled the buffet .
Among the crabmeat pilaf and stewed chicken , there were several platters of sushi .
There were nigiri rolls with slivers of raw - red belly meat on top - probably bluefin tuna , the most endangered commercially exploited fish in the world and most likely brought to Japan by Mitsubishi .
Bluefin is also the world 's most expensive fish - a tuna that was sold in Tokyo's Tsukiji market this year went to a Hong Kong - based trader for the price of a top - of - the - range Mercedes .
Tudela , who'd been hopeful of this meeting , seemed depressed when we caught up with him in Tokyo .
The Japanese had talked of reining back their Mediterranean operations .
It is they who buy much of the bluefin tuna which is caught in the eastern Atlantic , often outside quotas ; or caught young and fattened in cages in the Mediterranean .
' The Atlantic bluefin fishery is unsustainable in every way - economically , socially and ecologically , ' said Tudela .
' But the fishing fleet keeps getting bigger .
There are six new reefers [ large tuna - catching boats ] linked to the Japanese in the region .
I think the fishing industry is starting to feel really hijacked by the Japanese . '
ICCAT may be the most ineffective international organisation of all time .
In the course of its 42 - year life , several tuna species in the Mediterranean and Atlantic have come near disappearing , and nearly all are in grave danger .
Despite the endless conferences and scientific studies sponsored by ICCAT and member nations , WWF 's analysis shows that catches of bluefin tuna , a ' critically endangered species ' , according to the standards of the respected World Conservation Union , are ' dramatically higher ' than the quotas set .
And that catches are consistently under - reported , or not reported at all .
While EU ministers promise action on illegal fishing of tuna , they also continue to underwrite the tuna fishing industry through massive subsidies : € 16 m ( £ 13.1 m ) has been spent in recent years on the European purse seining fleet alone , according to the international lobbying group Oceana .
Xavier Pastor , its director in Europe , says bluntly : ' The over - exploitation of the bluefin tuna has been promoted and financed by European taxpayers and continues through the subsidising of operating costs , such as fuel . '
The problem for many observers is not just that ICCAT is ineffectual , but that it may be doing more harm than good .
' If you announce , as ICCAT did two years ago , an " emergency fisheries recovery " plan , then you are telling the concerned public that something is being done about the problem .
But it is n't - the fisheries recovery plan is a misnomer , ' says Roberts .
ICCAT refused requests for an interview , telling us to go and look at its website instead .
Is there any hope for fish ?
If we can not sort out the problem of bluefin tuna - a highly prized fish , whose life cycle is well understood , and whose fishing is closely monitored - what hope is there for the other stocks ?
Will our children eat wild fish or only farmed ?
Tudela sees some encouraging movement in Europe - the French , major tuna fishers , have for the first time prosecuted some quota - busting fishermen .
At European Commission level , he thinks the problems are being taken a little more seriously .
Roberts has one solution : marine reserves .
Protecting up to 40 per cent of the world 's oceans in permanent refuges would enable the recovery of fish stocks and help replenish surrounding fisheries .
' The cost , according to a 2004 survey , would be between £ 7bn and £ 8.2bn a year , after set - up .
But put that against the £ 17.6 bn a year we currently spend on harmful subsidies that encourage overfishing .'
Reserves must not be ruled by politicians , says Roberts .
' The model of industry - political control for regulatory bodies just does n't work .
It 's like central banks - put them under politicians ' control and they make dangerous , short - term decisions that result in economic instability .
Put them under independent control , and they make better - judged , more strategic decisions . '
The Newfoundland cod fishery , for 500 years the world 's greatest , was exhausted and closed in 1992 , and there 's still no evidence of any return of the fish .
Once stocks dip below a certain critical level , the scientists believe , they can never recover because the entire eco-system has changed .
The question is whether , after 50 years of vacillation and denial , there 's any prospect of the politicians acting decisively now .
' It is awful and we are on the road to disaster , ' says Tudela .
' But the collapse - in some , not all the situations - is still reversible .
And it 's worth trying . '
The U.S. dollar hit a record low against the euro after the European Central Bank played down the prospects of an interest rate cut and did not express concerns about the euro 's strength .
The dollar also fell to a fresh three - year low against the yen .
Oil prices held near a record $ 106 a barrel , fueling concerns of higher inflationary pressures at a time of slowing economic growth .
Japan's Nikkei 225
Average finished down 3.3 percent at a fresh six - week low , with investors dumping blue - chip exporters like Honda Motor on a stronger yen and fears of a U.S. recession , while silicon wafer maker Sumco Corp tumbled more than 10 percent after predicting weaker profits .
In a broad selloff tracking sharp falls on Wall Street , in addition to Mitsubishi UFJ other banks such as Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group took a beating .
South Korea 's KOSPI ended 2 percent lower on local inflation fears after the Bank of Korea said inflation could exceed a previous forecast , adding raw materials costs were rising faster than expected .
Shares that were sensitive to raw material costs such as POSCO and Daewoo Shipbuilding also retreated .
Australian shares dropped 3.1 percent , also hitting a six - week low , with financials leading declines .
Worries abounded that Australian banks would be hit by further bad debts after National Australia Bank warned it would book a provision on its A$ 110 million ( US $ 101.8 million ) loan secured by Allco Finance Group shares .
Allco slumped 16.7 percent after margin lenders took back a 14 percent stake in the troubled asset manager as collateral for unpaid debt .
Hong Kong 's Hang Seng Index sank 3.6 percent as further signs that the U.S. was headed into recession sent investors running for cover , souring the debut of Chinese oil rigs manufacturer Honghua Group .
Oil refiner Sinopec skidded on a broker downgrade , which comes after China earlier this week ruled out increases soon in oil product prices .
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing , a barometer of investor sentiment , sank to levels not seen since August .
Singapore 's Straits Times Index dropped 1.8 percent after U.S. markets tumbled on fears that a slowdown in the world 's biggest economy would drag on global growth .
Financials such as United Overseas Bank and SGX led the losses .
China 's Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.4 percent as shares in Ping An Insurance tumbled , almost erasing the big gain which they posted on Thursday after shareholders approved the company 's plan for a $ 17 billion equity issue .

US - based companies could be held liable for helping officials in other countries censor the Internet , if a bill proposed by House Representative Chris Smith ( R - NJ ) is approved .
Smith recently announced his plans to push the Global Online Freedom Act ( HR 275 ) to the House floor for voting after having lobbied human rights organization Reporters Without Borders for support .
Among other things , the Global Online Freedom
Act will bar US companies from disclosing personally - identifiable information about a user , except for " legitimate foreign law enforcement purposes . "
" American high - tech firms have produced the technology and know - how that has led to a modern - day information revolution , " Smith said in a statement .
" Sadly , however , instead of working to allow everyone to benefit from these advancements , these same high - tech firms are colluding with dictators and tyrannical regimes such as China to suppress human rights information and punish pro-democracy advocates . "
Among other things , the Act appears to be a direct response to the furor over Yahoo's involvement in outing a number of Chinese dissidents to the government , resulting in their arrest and imprisonment .
At least two Chinese pro-Democracy advocates have filed lawsuits against Yahoo for turning over their e-mails to the government , but Yahoo has said repeatedly that it simply complied with the requests of local law enforcement and was not aware of the nature of the investigations .
Yahoo was embarrassed by human rights group Dui Hua soon thereafter after the group published a translation of the Chinese government 's request for one dissident 's information that clearly stated the nature of the investigation .
This infuriated members of Congress , as it appeared to show that Yahoo had lied about what it knew .
Yahoo apologized for the " misunderstanding , " but Congress remained unimpressed .
Rep. Chris Smith
The Global Online Freedom
Act would not only prevent companies like Yahoo from giving up the goods to totalitarian regimes , but would also prohibit US - based Internet companies from blocking online content from US government or government - financed web sites in other countries .
When it comes to non-government sites , the Act would require companies to disclose to the newly - created Office of Global Internet Freedom the terms that they do filter , and for the Office to continually monitor these filtered terms .
If the companies violate any of these new restrictions , they could face civil and criminal penalties of up to $ 2 million , and aggrieved citizens ( those who have suffered from the companies ' violations , like the Chinese dissidents discussed above ) are free to pursue punitive damages and other legal remedies from the offenders .
There are just a couple of catches that make this bill not quite as great as Smith and the handful of human rights groups that support it make it out to be .
For one , the term " legitimate law enforcement " is extremely vague , and is left up to the US Department of Justice to decided on a case - by - case basis .
If complying with the requests of law enforcement officials to turn over information on what they consider illegal in specific countries does not count as legitimate , then what does , exactly ?
Secondly , you guessed it — the bill has a convenient exit plan for anyone who tries to apply its rules to the United States .
The President would have the authority to waive the provisions of the Act as long as " the important national interest of the United States requires the exercise of such waiver authority . "
As TechDirt points out , the US has done its own share of requesting data for questionable purposes , such as when it subpoenaed Google for 1 million random web addresses and all search records from an unspecified one - week period .
It would n't be surprising to see the US waive the Act in the name of national security at the drop of the hat , so it seems dubious that our government would be take on the responsibility of holding others to these standards .

1 . Do not run .
The snake is faster than you are .
2 . Lie flat on the ground , put your arms tight against your sides and your legs tight against each other .
3 . Tuck your chin in .
4 . The snake will being to nudge and climb over your body .
5 . Do not panic .
6 . The snake will begin to swallow your feet first .
7 . You must lie perfectly still .
This will take a long time .
8 . When the snake has reached your knees , reach down , take your knife , slide it into the side of the snake 's mouth between the edge of its mouth and your leg .
Quickly rip upward , severing the snake 's head .
9 . Be sure you have your knife .
10 .
Be sure your knife is sharp .
This is the long way for me to say that I 've some stories from this past week that I might tell , or at least hint at , but rather than do so tonight , I thought this piece would remind us that , as bad as things may be going , they could be much worse .
You could be panicking with a snake consuming you from the head down , with your dull knife forgotten back in your room .
That would suck .
There are many things you do n't think you 're capable of that you manage to do once you thrust into the situation .
For instance , just this past weekend I not only survived going to church twice back in Fargo , ND without the wrath of god coming down from heaven and consuming me , I did so to 1 ) attend the wedding of the last woman I loved and 2 ) attend the baptism of her child , all while under the watchful eye of her father , a man who once threatened to kill me if I ever hurt her or broke her heart .
Which I 'd done in the intervening time since he ( the father ) and I ( the non-husband / father ) had last seen each other .
And then there are some things you really know you 're completly incapable of doing , no matter how much you 'd like to survive .

A man has been jailed for his part in a plot to kidnap and torture a London tycoon using a woman as a " honey trap " .
But did Patrick " Dutchy " Holland murder Irish investigative journalist Veronica Guerin ?
Holland was once named in court as Guerin 's killer Veronica Guerin was a heroine to many people in her native country in the mid-1990s for her tireless exposure of the drug barons who were undermining its " Celtic tiger " image .
The Irish investigative journalist was shot dead in June 1996 by the pillion passenger on a motorbike as she stopped at traffic lights at Naas , just outside Dublin .
Three men were later put on trial for murder .
One - Dublin drug dealer John Gilligan - was acquitted .
The prosecution had claimed he ordered Ms Guerin be killed after she wrote about him in the Sunday Independent .
But the judge , Mr Justice O'Donovan , said while the court had great suspicions about Mr Gilligan 's involvement in the murder , it had not been persuaded beyond reasonable doubt .
A second man was convicted but cleared on appeal .
Only one man was convicted .
Brian Meehan is believed to have been riding the motorbike and he is still in jail for the murder .
But the actual gunman has escaped justice .
The man who pulled the trigger is widely believed to be Patrick " Dutchy " Holland , who was jailed on Friday , for his involvement in a kidnap conspiracy .
MURDER OF VERONICA GUERIN 26 June 1996 : Investigative journalist Veronica Guerin shot dead in Naas , near Dublin 1997 : Eugene " Dutchy " Holland named as her killer during an Irish court case July 1999 : Brian Meehan jailed for life for his involvement in the murder Mar 2001 : John Gilligan , acquitted of ordering Ms Guerin 's murder , is jailed for 28 years on drugs charges May 2008 : Holland jailed for eight years after being convicted of conspiring to kidnap a tycoon in London Holland , a 69 - year - old career criminal , was named in court by a Garda officer as being the killer during a trial in the Irish Republic a decade ago .
But he was never tried for the crime .
The crime editor of Ireland 's Sunday World newspaper , Paul Williams , has no doubt that Holland was the killer and says he has seen documents which prove it .
He said : " There were several witnesses who named Dutchy as the gunman but they were too terrified to stand up in court and give evidence . "
In his book , The Evil Empire : The Irish Mob and the Assassination of Veronica Guerin , Mr Williams described why she was killed .
" A major Irish criminal wanted to shut her up and he considered himself untouchable .
But he did n't realise what a big story it would become and how much pressure the state would come under to react , " Mr Williams told the BBC News website .
' Honey trap '
Holland was jailed for possession of cannabis by an Irish court in 1997 but in April 2006 he walked out of Portlaoise prison .
He moved to London and a few months later was getting involved in another criminal enterprise .
In early 2007 he teamed up with fellow Irishmen John McDonnell and Gerard Booth and London villain Simon Young , and cooked up an ambitious " honey trap " kidnap plot which they hoped would raise £ 10 m .
After several attempts were made to follow tycoon Nasir Zahid to his home address the gang came up with the " honey trap " idea .
The gang planned to use 24 - year - old secretary Khan Coombs as " sex bait " to lure Mr Zahid from the office of his company , Tradex Limited , in Chiswick , west London , so they could kidnap and torture him .
The trial heard Mr Zahid 's kidnap was ordered and financed by a Belgian businessman called Patrick van Cantfort , known as " The Banker " , who felt Mr Zahid had double crossed him over a deal .
But police heard about the plot and bugged the gang .
I have n't killed anybody ever - there is no blood on my hands
" Dutchy " Holland
They overheard McDonnell telling Miss Coombs : " We 're going to send you into the office and you 're going to try to flirt with this bastard to see if he 'll ask you out - which he will , that 's the type of dog he is .
" If he comes out we 're going to grab him .
If this comes off there 's £ 10 m involved in this job .
When you bring him out we can take him to the slaughterhouse . "
The plan began to collapse on 30 April 2007 when Miss Coombs , wearing a £ 500 Cerutti jacket , arrived at Mr Zahid 's import / export firm asking about job vacancies but was turned away without being able to speak to him .
Drug barons Police swooped before the gang could try again and in March Holland , McDonnell , Booth , Young and Coombs were convicted of conspiracy to kidnap .
But the question remains - did Holland kill Veronica Guerin ?
In a television interview 10 years ago Holland said : " I have n't killed anybody ever .
There is no blood on my hands . "
Mr Williams says the Irish state cracked down on the drug barons for about a year after the Veronica Guerin killing but he said things were now as bad , if not worse , than in the mid-1990s with large - scale drug dealing and frequent gang violence .
" The situation is arguably worse than it was when Veronica was writing her stories , " he said .
Last year there were 84 murders in the Republic of Ireland , the highest number since the civil war .

What are these ?
... Obama seems to have brought peace to the Niger Delta .
No joke .
Reuters :
Rebels who have stepped up attacks on Nigeria 's oil industry in the last month said on Sunday they were considering a ceasefire appeal by U.S. presidential hopeful Barack Obama .
The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( MEND ) has launched five attacks on oil facilities in the Niger Delta since it resumed a campaign of violence in April , forcing Royal Dutch Shell to shut more than 164,000 barrels of oil per day ( bpd ) .
" The MEND command is seriously considering a temporary ceasefire appeal by Senator Barack Obama .
Obama is someone we respect and hold in high esteem , " the militant group said in an e-mailed statement .
Petraeus said Iraq was " exceedingly complex and challenging "
Petraeus statement
The top US military leader in Iraq , Gen David Petraeus , has recommended a suspension of troop withdrawals after July to protect gains in Iraq .
Gen Petraeus praised " significant " but " uneven " improvements in security and said troop levels would need a period of evaluation over the summer .
He also said the recent Iraqi operation in Basra was " not adequately planned " .
He and Ambassador Ryan Crocker gave an update to Congress on the Iraq " surge " , on the first of two days of hearings .
They also came face to face with the three senators vying to succeed George W Bush as president this November .
Graph of US troops and military deaths John McCain , the Republicans ' choice as candidate , was positive about the situation in Iraq while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , the rivals for the Democratic candidacy , pressed for withdrawal .
' Evaluation period ' Gen Petraeus and Mr Crocker began on Tuesday by testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee , then moved on to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Our allies , Arab countries , the UN and the Iraqis themselves will not step up to their responsibilities if we recklessly retreat
Senator John McCain
In quotes : Candidates react Hearing in pictures Gen Petraeus said security was better than the situation at the time of his last report to Congress in September and significantly better than before the start of the US troop surge at the beginning of last year .
But while there had been real progress , it was " fragile and is reversible " , he said .
The planned " drawdown " of about 20,000 troops should continue to July but afterwards there should be a 45 - day " period of consolidation and evaluation " , he said .
He could not say how many US troops would be in Iraq at the end of the year .
The US currently has 160,000 troops in Iraq .
Mr McCain said he believed there was a genuine chance of success in Iraq and that a withdrawal could result in a failure that might require the US to return later for a far more costly war .
" Our allies , Arab countries , the UN and the Iraqis themselves will not step up to their responsibilities if we recklessly retreat , " he said .
When he asked Gen Petraeus about the recent Iraqi - led operation against militias in Basra , the US commander said it had not been " adequately planned or prepared " .
Iraq sent thousands of troops to Basra in a failed attempt to force the Shia Mehdi Army militia into submission .
Hundreds died in heavy fighting .
' Massive blunder ' Ambassador Crocker said progress in Iraq had been " uneven and often frustratingly slow " but the US and Iraq were negotiating a long - term agreement on their relations that would cover the US troop presence .
The withdrawal of US troops is a key issue in the presidential campaign
He insisted the deal did not envisage permanent US bases in Iraq and that it would " not tie the hands of the next administration " .
Mrs Clinton , who serves on the armed services committee , condemned the decision not to submit the deal to the US Congress .
She said it was time for the " orderly process of withdrawing troops " as Iraqi leaders had failed to deliver .
The Iraq deployment , she argued , was stretching the military 's resources while the Bush administration was ignoring the costs being incurred by continuing a failed policy .
Gen Petraeus accused Iran of funding and training Shia militias through cells the US terms " special groups " .
Speaking as a member of the foreign relations committee , Mr Obama said the US " should be talking to Iran [ as it could ] not stabilise the situation without them " .
He repeated his view that the US invasion had been a " massive strategic blunder " and called for a timetable for withdrawal .

The Practice of Mathematics
There are several central mathematical problems , or complexes of problems , that every mathematician who is eager to acquire some broad competence in the subject would like to understand , even if he has no ambition to attack them all .
That would be out of the question !
Those with the most intellectual and aesthetic appeal to the lecturer are in number theory , classical applied mathematics and mathematical physics .
In spite of forty years as a mathematician , he has diffculty describing these problems , even to himself , in a simple , cogent and concise manner that makes it clear what is wanted and why .
As a possible , but only partial , remedy the professor thought he might undertake to explain them to a lay audience .
He shall try for a light touch including , in particular , some historical background .
Nevertheless the lectures are to be about mathematics .
In the first set , there will be geometrical constructions , simple algebraic equations , prime numbers , and perhaps an occasional integral .
Every attempt will be made to explain the necessary notions clearly and simply , taking very little for granted except the good will of the audience .

In an unusual nod to the popularity of free music online , the rock act Nine Inch Nails is offering its new album , “ The Slip , ” through its Web site  for nothing .
In a post on the band ’s Web site , www.nin.com, the band ’s leader , Trent Reznor , said , “ Thank you for your continued and loyal support over the years  this one ’s on me . ”
The album , which became available for download just after 3 a.m.
Eastern time on Monday , appears to represent the first time a superstar act has distributed an entire album without any opportunity for people to pay for it .
Its release comes two months after the band issued the instrumental album “ Ghosts I - IV ” and allowed fans to obtain a portion of it for free or the entire recording for $ 5 .
Before that , the British rock act Radiohead broke with convention by offering its 2007 album , “ In Rainbows , ” online under a tip - jar - style setup in which people could name their own price  including zero .
Mr. Reznor ’s new offer could serve as another test of how the easy availability of free music online affects subsequent CD sales and other money - making opportunities .
“ The Slip ” will not be sold on CD or vinyl until at least July , according to representatives for the band .
But the free digital version could stoke interest for Nine Inch Nails ’ recently announced concert tour .
Already , radio stations have shown interest in “ Discipline , ” a song from “ The Slip ” that was released about two weeks ago .
About 40 percent of African - Americans have a genetic variant that can protect them after heart failure and prolong their lives , according to research conducted at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and collaborating institutions .
The genetic variant has an effect that resembles that of beta blockers , drugs widely prescribed for heart failure .
The new study offers a reason why beta blockers do n't appear to benefit some African - Americans .
" For several years a controversy has existed in the cardiovascular field because of conflicting reports about whether beta blockers helped African - American patients , " says senior author Gerald W. Dorn II , M.D. , professor of medicine , associate chairman for translational research and director of the Center for Pharmacogenomics at Washington University .
" By mimicking the effect of beta blockers , the genetic variant makes it appear as if beta blockers are n't effective in these patients , " he explains .
" But although beta blockers have no additional benefit in heart failure patients with the variant , they are equally effective in Caucasian and African - American patients without the variant . "
Co-author Stephen B. Liggett , M.D. , professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and director of its cardiopulmonary genomics program says the discovery adds to the accumulating evidence that genetic differences contribute to the way people respond to medications and should encourage the use of genetic testing in clinical trials to identify people who can benefit from therapy tailored to their genetic makeup .
About 5 million people in the United States have heart failure , and it results in about 300,000 deaths each year .
Beta blockers slow heart rate and lower blood pressure to decrease the heart 's workload and prevent lethal cardiac arrhythmias .
While Caucasians with heart failure participating in clinical studies of beta blockers have shown clear benefit from the drugs , the evidence for benefit in African - Americans has been ambiguous .
The current study , reported online April 20 , 2008 , in Nature Medicine , identified one particular race - specific gene variant that seems to account mechanistically and biologically for these indeterminate results .
The gene codes for an enzyme called GRK5 , which depresses the response to adrenaline and similar hormonal substances that increase how hard the heart works .
Adrenaline is a hormone released from the adrenal glands that prompts the " fight - or - flight " response — it increases cardiac output to give a sudden burst of energy .
In heart failure , decreased blood flow from the struggling heart ramps up the body 's secretion of adrenaline to compensate for a lower blood flow .
Overproduction of the hormone makes the weakened heart pump harder , but eventually worsens heart failure .
Beta blockers alleviate this problem by blocking adrenaline at its receptor in the heart and blood vessels .
GRK enzymes mimic this effect by serving as " speed governors " that work like the governor in an engine to prevent adrenaline from over - revving the heart , says Dorn .
The researchers — including three equally contributing co-authors : Liggett , Sharon Cresci , M.D. , assistant professor of medicine in the Cardiovascular Division at Washington University and a cardiologist at Barnes - Jewish Hospital , and Reagan J. Kelly , Ph.D. , at the University of Michigan — found that 41 percent of African - Americans have a variant GRK5 gene that more effectively suppresses the action of adrenaline than the more common version of the gene .
People with the variant gene could be said to have a natural beta blocker , Dorn says .
The variant is extremely rare in Caucasians , accounting for its predominant effects in African - Americans .
The researchers showed that African - American heart failure patients with this genetic variant have about the same survival rate even if they do n't take beta blockers as Caucasian and African - American heart failure patients who do take beta blockers .
" That does n't mean African - Americans with heart failure need to be tested for the genetic variant to decide whether to take beta blockers , " Dorn says .
" Under the supervision of a cardiologist , beta blockers have very low risk but huge benefits , and I am comfortable prescribing them to any heart failure patients who do not have a specific contraindication to the drug . "
" This is a step toward individualized therapy , " Cresci says .
" Medical research is working to identify many genetic variants that someday can ensure that patients receive the medications that are most appropriate for them .
Right now , we know one variant that influences beta blocker efficacy , and we are continuing our research into this and other relevant genetic variants . "
The human heart has two forms of GRK : GRK2 and GRK5 .
The researchers meticulously searched the DNA sequence of these genes in 96 people of European - American , African - American or Chinese descent to look for differences .
They found most people , no matter their race , had exactly the same DNA sequence in GRK2 or GRK5 .
But there was one common variation in the DNA sequence , a variation called GRK5 - Leu41 , the variant that more than 40 percent of African - Americans have .
To determine the effect of the GRK5 - Leu41 variant , the team studied the course of progression of heart failure in 375 African - American patients .
They looked for survival time or time to heart transplant , comparing people with the variant to those without .
Some of these patients were taking beta blockers and some were not .
In patients who did not take beta blockers , the researchers found that those with the variant lived almost twice as long as those with the more common version of the GRK5 gene .
Beta blockers prolonged life to the same degree as the protective GRK5 variant , but did not further increase the already improved survival of those with the variant .
" These results offer an explanation for the confusion that has occurred in this area since clinical trials of beta blockers began , " Dorn says .
" Our study demonstrates a mechanism that should lay to rest the question about whether beta blockers are effective in African - Americans — they absolutely are in those who do n't have this genetic variant . "

Cowardly men become boot lickers . "

Note :
Of course , real women stand up to fascists , also .

This essay focuses solely on men who lack confidence , and who fall for a " quick fix " for their insecurities , because they are the ones who tend to rally around authoritarians .
Women who are confident in their femininity do n't tend to fall for the authoritarian trap , and so this essay does not address them .
The fascists ' view of masculinity is that -- to be aAmerican man -- you have to rally around the " strong leader " , you have to talk tough about the " war on terror " , you have to get pleasure out of watching " our team " ( the sole superpower ) beat the stuffing out of a bunch of third - rate armies like Iraq and Afghanistan .
Are they right ?
Well , psychologists tell us that rallying around the authoritarian leader is actually a very infantile way to affirm one 's masculinity Okay , listen up guys .
Real men do n't bluster like George W. Bush or Bill O'Reilly .
Real men stand up to fascists .
Our forefathers stood up to the British king and fought for our freedom .
Our forefathers stood up to tyrants and won their liberty and freedom .
THAT 's what masculinity really means .
That 's where the pedal hits the metal and the rubber meets the road .
It is the dictators running our country who are the danger , who are stealing the future from us , and our kids , and our grandkids .
Come on , buddy . . . stop posing .
And start acting like a real man .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - NASA scientists have identified the smallest black hole ever found -- less than four times the mass of our sun and about the size of a large city .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
But the mini - black hole , dubbed J1650 , could still stretch a person into a “ strand of spaghetti ” with its pull , the researchers told a meeting in Los Angeles .
“ This black hole is really pushing the limits .
For many years astronomers have wanted to know the smallest possible size of a black hole , and this little guy is a big step toward answering that question , ” Nikolai Shaposhnikov of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland , said in a statement .
It would likely be stronger than bigger black holes found at the centers of galaxies .
Shaposhnikov said if someone ventured too close to J1650 , its gravity would “ stretch your body into a strand of spaghetti . ”
Like other black holes , it was formed by a star that ran out of fuel and shut down , collapsing due to its own gravity .
Shaposhnikov and his Goddard colleague Lev Titarchuk used NASA ’s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite and a new method to estimate the size of the black hole , found in a system in the southern constellation Ara , in our own Milky Way Galaxy .
It measures the oscillation of hot gas piling up near the black hole as it sucks in matter , they told a meeting in Los Angeles of the American Astronomical Society High - Energy Astrophysics Division .
The new black hole has a mass of 3.8 Suns and would be about 15 miles across , they estimate .
“ This makes the black hole one of the smallest objects ever discovered outside our solar system , ” Shaposhnikov said .
The smallest black hole previously identified was GRO 1655 - 40 , with a mass of about 6.3 Suns .
“ Amazingly , equations from Albert Einstein predict that a black hole with 3.8 times the mass of our Sun would be only 15 miles across -- the size of a city , ” NASA said in a statement .
A collapsing star that was much smaller than J1650 would likely form a neutron star and not a black hole , the researchers said .

Software developer Unison has launched what it claims is the world 's first fully - unified communications suite based on Linux .
Announced at CeBIT , the suite ( also simply called Unison ) combines IP telephony , e-mail and instant messaging with diary , address book and presence capabilities , all in a single Linux server .
It is available free as a public beta .
" You can get all these elements separately on Linux , but this is the first time they have all been in one server , " said Rurik Bradbury , Unison 's chief marketing officer .
Other unified communications ( UC ) schemes , such as Microsoft 's Office Communications Server ( OCS ) can require three or more servers to do the same thing , he added .
" If you 're reasonably familiar with Linux , you can deploy Unison in a couple of hours , and have a complete system running for a company of perhaps 50 or 60 people in half a day , " he said .
The server software works with a Unison client program for Windows PCs .
This provides a genuine alternative to Microsoft 's combination of Exchange and Outlook , Bradbury claimed .
" We 're amazed no - one has done this before -- build both a client and a server .
Others have either one or the other , " he said .
He added that a Linux version of the client will come later this year .
Unison is aimed at 20 - to 300 - seat organizations , but the US - based company plans to add server clustering in the future to support more .
It is partly based on open source technology , such as Thunderbird for email and Jabber for instant messaging , and partly developed by Unison 's own programmers .
The software is initially offered as a free beta version but is already fit for use , Bradbury claimed .
" It is almost finished -- it is relatively stable software , " he said , joking that he uses commercial software that 's less robust .
Once the beta program is complete there will be a free " community " version for up to 20 users , and per-user or perpetual licences will be sold for larger systems , although pricing for those is not yet fixed .

MONTERREY , Mexico ( Reuters Life ! ) - Mexico ’s Manuel Uribe , once the world ’s most obese man , is now vying for a different record : the human who has lost the most weight .
Manuel Uribe chats with a reporter during an interview at his home in the suburb of San Nicolas de los Garza , in Monterrey May 9 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Tomas Bravo
Uribe , who weighed as much as a small truck at more than half a tonne , is dieting while confined to a reinforced bed that he has not left for the past six years because he is so heavy .
He has lost 518 pounds since March 2006 on a diet of grapefruits , egg - white only omelets , fish , chicken , vegetables and peanuts .
Now weighing 717 pounds -- the size of three hefty men -- Uribe is still unable to move his swollen legs but hopes to get out of the house next month for only the third time in six years to celebrate his 43rd birthday .
He will still be in bed , hauled onto a tow truck for a trip to the mountainous countryside outside his home city of Monterrey in northern Mexico .
It will be a rerun of a failed attempt in March that was thwarted when his bed hit an overpass .
“ It ’s a miracle I ’ve got this far .
I was going to kill myself two years ago when my wife left me , but God sent me excellent doctors , ” said Uribe , his torso still huge with flaps of puffy white skin and sagging , fatty bulges .
Uribe spent the 1990s eating pizzas and burgers in the United States where he worked as a computer repairman .
Addicted to junk food , he eventually tipped the scales at 1,235 pounds back in Mexico , bingeing on greasy tacos .
His bulk made him the world ’s heaviest man and won him a place in the 2008 edition of the Guinness World Records .
Photos of his time in Florida and Texas show the transformation of a once chubby man to a bloated , whale - like figure .
“ At the Big n ’ Tall store in Dallas , they no longer had my size .
Then I got tailor - made pants and I grew out of those too , ” said Uribe from his bed by the open door at street level , where he likes to chat with his neighbors to stop the boredom .

TEARFUL TV APPEAL
In Mexico , Uribe underwent a tummy tuck operation but it caused massive , permanent swelling , and did not reduce his weight .
Abandoned by his wife , his health failing and with no income , Uribe pleaded for help on Mexican television , stirring up intense international interest .
Uribe , cared for by his mother Otilia , turned down offers of gastric bypass surgery in Italy .
Instead he took free medical help from U.S. doctor Barry Sears .
He lost weight following the Zone Diet , which is high in protein and low in carbohydrates .
“ I was impotent before , but now everything ’s working again .
Ask my girlfriend , ” he said happily , his Guinness World Records certificate hanging on the wall .
Uribe , who relies on his family ’s small wholesale clothes business and the generosity of friends to survive , said people at Guinness have spoken to him about his rapid weight loss and could eventually put him in the record books .
Rosalie Bradford , an American woman who died in 2006 , recorded the greatest weight loss for a female after she shed 907 pounds .
The record for a man is held by Jon Brower Minnoch who lost 924 pounds , according to Guinness World Records .
Uribe , who became an Evangelical Christian during his weight loss drive , said his goal is to weigh 285 pounds by 2010 , meaning he would have lost 950 pounds .
Records aside , Uribe just wants to get out of bed and make a living from preaching the benefits of healthy eating .
“ I get lots of e-mails from people saying they are inspired by my progress and I want to get the word out about healthy eating .
I ’m not against people who sell junk food , but you ’ve got to be informed not to eat it , ” he said .
Five years after their son was fatally shot by an Israeli soldier in Gaza , the parents of the British student Tom Hurndall are still pressing the Israeli government for compensation and a formal apology as they try to build a criminal case against senior Israeli army officers .
Hurndall , a 22 - year - old photography student , was shot five years ago today during a demonstration in Rafah , in the southern Gaza Strip .
This week his parents , Jocelyn and Anthony Hurndall , wrote to the Israeli ambassador in London , Ron Prosor , asking for an urgent meeting .
As well as compensation and an apology , the family are still trying to gather sufficient evidence to bring war crimes charges in Britain against several Israeli army officers .
The family has not revealed the amount of compensation they are seeking .
A report in the Israeli press last week put the amount at £ 500,000 , although the correct figure is believed to be higher .
In their letter to the ambassador , Hurndall 's parents wrote : " We claim that the denial to the family of fair and just compensation amounts to supporting a policy of indifference and disregard for ... innocent civilians .
This can lead to an international criminal responsibility for whoever acknowledges such an attitude . "
They said they had faced a " wall of deceit and fabrication over the shooting " before the trial and were now facing " a further debilitating and prolonged battle to get meaningful compensation " .
It is thought that the Israeli government argues that only the soldier convicted for the shooting was responsible for the death , not any of his senior commanders .
Yet the family still hopes to secure the arrest and trial of a number of senior officers .
" There is no question that this is very much still on the cards , " Anthony Hurndall said .
On April 11 2003 Tom Hurndall attended a demonstration in Rafah organised by a group called the International Solidarity Movement .
Shots were fired from an Israeli army watchtower and Hurndall , who wore a fluorescent jacket , was helping to pull a group of Palestinian children to safety when he was shot in the head .
He suffered a severe brain injury and died nine months later in hospital in London .
At first the Israeli military denied responsibility .
However , in August 2005 an Israeli soldier , Taysir Heib , was sentenced to eight years jail for manslaughter .
The following year a British inquest jury ruled that the soldier had shot Hurndall " with the intention of killing him " .
" In the last five years we have had nothing but barriers and obstruction from the Israelis , " said Jocelyn Hurndall .
She said the family hoped to negotiate a settlement in private with the Israeli authorities .
So far they have received around £ 8,000 to cover his repatriation - the first cheque sent for this sum bounced - and then last year a payment of £ 50,000 .
Late last year , after negotiations failed to bring an agreement , they began a civil claim in the Israeli courts .
Arye Mekel , Israel 's foreign ministry spokesman , said : " This issue is under legal negotiations between the family and the ministry of defence .
These contacts are ongoing . "
Every so often , Bob B. observed that his company 's e-commerce site would crash - hard .
No one had any clue as to why it happened , but everyone knew how to fix it .
Restart both the IIS and SQL Server processes and , voilà , within a minute , the site was up and running again .
Like an old car with a few quirks , the company worried that tinkering with the application might make things worse .
But after a few months and a handful of customer complaints , Bob was permitted to investigate the issue so long as he was n't too intrusive .
Waiting for Failure
The first problem Bob encountered was with the home - grown logging module .
Whenever the application crashed , it would crash too , leaving Bob with a log filled with " error occurred while logging an error " messages .
A few weeks and a crash or two later , Bob fixed the logging code and deployed it to production .
It did n't take too long for another crash to occur .
Bob dove right into the log files and saw the dreaded " Server Out Of Memory " error coming from SQL Server .
A Google search revealed that a Service Pack installation would most certainly fix things .
So , after cajoling the bosses to let him upgrade SQL Server , Bob had the service pack installed .
Now it became a waiting game to see what the real problem was .
A tense few weeks passed with out a single crash reported , and Bob assumed the Service Pack had fixed the problem .
Then the site crashed again with the same error message : " Server Out Of Memory . "
Bob started digging further and noticed that the server was , indeed , out of memory .
The reason was pretty clear , too : there were nearly 2,000,000 active visitor sessions open .
For a niche e-commerce Web site with an average of a thousand shoppers a day , 2 million visitors were far out of the ordinary .
Bob wondered about a Denial of Service ( DoS ) attack , but quickly ruled that out .
No one would possibly bother to DoS their site .
Going Around in Circles
Bob started looking through IIS log files from around the time of the crash , but saw no promising leads .
It looked like an everyday log file .
After a half hour of reading line after line , Bob held the PageDown key while he tried to think of a better approach .
And that 's where he noticed a slew of requests from the same IP address .
Checking other resources to see request headers , he saw the IP address belonged to an AOL user that seemed to be browsing from somewhere in Ohio .
66.77.93.50 - [ 08:34:29 ] " GET /access?action= _ _ forward&uri=%2Ferror.aspx HTTP/1.1 " 302 - " - " " - " " - " 66.77.93.50 - [ 08:34:29 ] " GET /error.aspx _ _ HTTP / 1.1 " 302 - " - " " - " " - "
Pieces started coming together .
Some Web surfer from
Ohio got into an infinite redirect loop that was creating a new session with each iteration .
Apparently , the AOL user was patient enough to let that loop continue for almost 11 hours .
By disabling cookies in his browser and typing in a specially crafted URL , Bob confirmed that he could trigger an endless loop of redirection as well .
But the mystery was how the loop was initiated .
Bob dug until he found the first log entry from the user :
66.77.93.50 - [ 08:34:29 ] _ _ " GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1 " 302 - " - " " - " " - "
It was for the favicon , that small icon that appears next to the address browser .
Even stranger , it was the Ohioan 's first and , aside from the redirects , only request .
In the end , Bob figured out exactly how the problem had happened : some random visitor using an older version of AOL bookmarked their site .
The user was n't trying to visit the site , let alone waiting 11 hours for a page to come up .
He or she just happened to have the AOL browser open , which would then periodically attempt to update the favicons for its bookmarked sites , and then diligently follow the endless redirects as ordered .
Bob quickly added a favicon.ico to the root folder and patched up the infinite redirection problem .
The crashing problem went away and never returned .
But , for some time , the company 's Web site was at the mercy of the browsing habits of some random family living in Ohio .
Connecticut doctors have provided circumstantial evidence that Tasers do affect the heart - backing critics ' claims that the use of the " less - than - deadly " incapacitator may in fact prove resolutely deadly .
In the case of the belligerent 28 - year - old patient admitted to Hartford Hospital , however , the end result of a light tasering was a swift recovery from atrial fibrillation , possibly provoked by his jumping into a freezing lake while attempting to escape pursuing cops back in April .
Cardiologist Dr Kyle Richards , who treated the unnamed perp in the hospital 's emergency room , said : " I do n't know exactly what he had done but he fled capture from them and he hid in a lake . "
Richards noted in the Annals of Emergency Medicine that an electrocardiogram indicated the patient was suffering from the aformentioned irregular heart rhythm , " possibly as a result of the cold and shock " .
Following treatment , the man became " very combative and started yelling in my face and that 's when I left the room and got security " , Richards continued .
Police and security operatives quickly followed the increasingly - popular hospital subjugation protocol and whipped out a Taser , administering a " low - voltage charge meant to cause pain " rather than the full - fat 50,000V shock .
A further electrocardiogram on the man " showed his heart rhythm was normal " .
Richards noted : " This is the first report of a patient receiving a shock of this kind and having a positive outcome . "
Sounding a note of caution , though , Richards admitted the patient " was not hooked up to the electrocardiogram at the precise moment of being shocked " , and stressed : " People can spontaneously go from atrial fibrillation into a normal rhythm without any intervention at all .
You cannot conclusively say that the Taser did it . "
Richards said he believed it did , concluding : " It 's just one more thing that says , hey , Tasers can actually affect the heart . "
Reuters notes that Amnesty Inetrnational has fingered the Taser in 290 North American deaths since 2001 .
Taser insists there is " no evidence the gun directly caused the deaths " , as Reuters puts it .
The UN's Committee Against Torture disagrees , and back in November last year issued a statement on the TaserX26 , which read : " The use of TaserX26 weapons , provoking extreme pain , constituted a form of torture , and that in certain cases it could also cause death , as shown by several reliable studies and by certain cases that had happened after practical use . "
Among several notable Taser - related fatalilties is the case of 21 - year - old Christian Allen , who was was pulled over by cops in Jacksonville , Florida , " because his [ car ] radio was too loud " .
When he and a passenger " took off running " , as ABC put it back in November , an officer gave chase , caught Allen and " used a Taser gun at least three times before [ he ] was taken into custody " .
Allen was put in the back of a police car , " suffered a cardiac arrest and died later at a hospital " . ®
Then it came to pass that I stumbled across this story from Forbes magazine , which is officially called " Forbes " but is actually called " Forbes oh my God we worship ruthless CEOs like shiny meth in the summertime , " and among the glittering ads for luxury intergalactic travel and sleek private jets and $ 50 K Rolexes and big phallic yachts and surreal 20 - page ad inserts for Abu Dhabi megadevelopments , there was an article about the new home being built in Mumbai right now for Mukesh Ambani , the fifth wealthiest man in the world .
Behold , you and your puny little life and your minuscule little salary and tiny little human skeleton are mere scraps , crumbs , dust mites on a dog when compared to this giant petrochemical stud .
Forbes estimates Ambani's net worth at about $ 43 billion , below Bill Gates and Warren Buffett but above God and Shiva and most of the major planetary constellations , and his wealth is almost enough to power the entire Iraq war for a month .
So you know it 's a lot .
Of course it 's all from petrochemicals .
Of course it 's all in Mumbai .
Of course you 've never heard of him or his company , Reliance Industries , because it's one of those nefarious megapower supercorporations that block out all life and own entire governments and hold presidents in their pockets and yank the levers that make the world spin and tilt and groan .
Therefore plebes like us know as much about its true weight and influence as an army ant knows about a whirlpool galaxy .
Here 's what you need to know about Ambani 's new home :
It is no home at all .
It is actually a tower , 27 stories high , ultramodern gleaming glass and steel and completely unprecedented weirdness .
Oh yes , and here 's the other thing :
It is the world 's first billion - dollar personal residence .
Actually , $ 2 billion .
Imagine the fanciest , most ridiculously overpampered , seriously egomaniacal hotel you can possibly think of , and dip it in solid gold .
Then sprinkle it with diamonds and Bugatti Veyrons and the fine , tender pelts of a million baby seals .
That 's the parking garage .
Bill Gates ' cute little 66,000 square - foot spread in Seattle ?
Oprah 's lavishly bloviated $ 43 million palace in Montecito ?
Larry Ellison's $ 300 million orgy of land in Woodside and Malibu ?
Pshaw !
Child 's play .
Barely enough to pay for the unicorn - skin hand towels stacked in the bathrooms of Ambani 's shiny little stick in the ground .
Two billion dollars .
This is not " money is no object . "
This is " money is the only object , " so ostentatious and obscene it quickly flies past arrogance and absurdity and becomes this fascinating case study , a bizarre artifact of extreme capitalism , otherworldly and strange , like some sort of giant bioluminescent octopus that dominates the ocean floor and swallows sperm whales whole and tries to scare all the other little fishies but is still just , you know , a big ugly cephalopod .
So you stare at these photos and read the article 's details and you start getting dizzy from the sheer scale of it all , from the lack of perspective and coherence and reality , as you realize just one of the sofas on just one of the floors of Ambani 's tower costs what you make in an entire year , and your head begins to spin and the nausea begins to swell until you close the damnable magazine and slam yourself back to the reality , shaking and mumbling , yes , well , but is there anything at all resembling happiness there ?
It 's the thing you have to ask , lest you go just a little insane : Really , is n't a life like Ambani 's just a bit silly , a glittery charade , full of backslapping and sly business deals and giant inheritances , and do you really want that ?
Really ?
Here is your billion dollars to spend on your new home .
Fun !
For about a week .
Then it 's all , OK , so I can line my nine pools in solid Venetian marble and own 40,000 plasma TVs and have one entire floor dedicated to my taxidermied giraffe collection .
Yawn .
It all makes delightful contrast to the recent , awkwardly titillating article in this very newspaper that revealed the annual salaries of various Bay Area workers , from the head of the University of California school system ( $ 591K ) to the San Francisco police chief ( $ 250 K ) to all those surprisingly well - paid firefighters ( well over $ 200 K ) , on down to the guy who runs the city 's pothole - filling crew ( over $ 100 K and absolutely worth every penny because oh my God , potholes ) , and on back up to one of the pitchers for the Giants , Barry Zito , who rakes in a cool $ 14 million per season because , well , he 's a pro athlete .
They 're supposed to be caricatures of real humans .
So , you get to compare and contrast .
You get to look up and down and sidelong , from Ambani to the local police lieutenant to your local barista and then down at your own paycheck , or trust fund , or stock portfolio , or complete lack thereof , and wonder how you fit in and what it all means , and with any luck you quickly realize the futility and the danger of measuring yourself in this way because , well , what then ?
Do you measure your success , your life against Ambani ?
Against the guy who administers the San Francisco Health Department ?
The average American ?
Or how about the average citizen of India , Ambani 's homeland ?
Because here is the bottom line , same as it ever was :
No matter what you do in life and no matter where you go and how much you make and how many harems of strippers you can afford to have standing by , there 's always someone who makes and does and lives far more exotically and expensively and ridiculously than you .
I mean , obviously .
And at the same time , if you 're reading this column right now with your $ 5 latte and your clean running water and functioning limbs and intact teeth , you can rest assured that there are roughly 3 billion people on the planet who subsist on about a dollar a month who see you just about exactly as you see Ambani .
Which is to say : pampered and wealthy in the extreme .
And then you realize , of course , that money is no measure of anything that truly matters , really .
It 's merely another form of energy , a nice expression of ego , either all - consuming and destructive or capable of tremendous joy and good .
Often , it 's both .
And while dumping $ 2 billion on a single home is certainly a curious and perhaps slightly sad ethical choice — despite how it is , of course , the ultimate expression of capitalist ego — to me , tattooing a dollar sign anywhere on your life pretty much guarantees you a life lived on Macbethian terms : a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury and diamond - crusted toilet seats , signifying nothing .

JULY 11 -- If The Smoking Gun is known for anything , it 's our diligent efforts to point out the dangers of gentlemen 's clubs .
Our latest cautionary tale of pleasure 's pitfalls comes from Jacksonville , Arkansas , where a trio of strippers is facing criminal charges for the onstage beating of a male patron with a wood paddle and a leather whip .
According to a Pulaski County Sheriff 's Office report , truck driver Keith Lowery told investigators that he was handcuffed to a pole at the Sensations club and set upon by the dancers during a June 17 visit .
Lowery , who was celebrating his 31st birthday with pals who paid $ 25 for his ceremonial birthday whuppin ' , said that he was injured when the 4:30 AM stunt went too far .
He claimed that he " begged " management to stop the paddling / whipping , but that his plea was rejected .
After a bruised Lowery contacted cops , three dancers and two Sensations managers were each arrested and charged with a felony count of obscene performance in a public place ( the strippers also were hit with a misdemeanor battery count ) .
At left you 'll find mug shots of the three dancers and a female manager ( sorry , we did n't have space for the male manager 's picture ) .
The women , scheduled for an August 4 District Court appearance , are , clockwise from upper left , Kelly Eslick , 21 ; Lisa Nolen , 23 ; Charlene Smith , 23 ; and manager Dena Mitchell , 30 . ( 2 pages )
The computer attackers who took down Comcast 's homepage and webmail service for more than five hours Thursday say they did n't know what they were getting themselves into .
In an hour - long telephone conference call with Threat Level , the hackers known as " Defiant " and " EBK " expressed astonishment over the attention their DNS hijacking has garnered .
In the call , the pair bounded freely between jubilant excitement over the impact of their attack , and fatalism that they would soon be arrested for it .
" The situation has kind of blown up here , a lot bigger than I thought it would , " says Defiant , a 19 - year - old man whose first name is James .
" I wish I was a minor right now because this is going to be really bad . "
The two hackers are members of the underground group Kryogeniks .
The interview was arranged by Mike " Virus " Nieves , an 18 - year - old New Yorker who pleaded guilty as a minor last year to hacking AOL .
Neives , who was on the call , is also a member of Kryogeniks , though he and his compatriots say he 's stopped hacking .
Nieves vouched for the identities of the hackers .
Threat Level also confirmed Defiant 's identity over AOL instant messenger , on a handle that 's known to belong to Defiant .
Neither hacker would identify their full names or locations .
Defiant 's MySpace profile lists him in Cashville , Tennessee , but he says that 's incorrect .
His girlfriend lists herself in New York .
Threat Level expects both hackers ' names and locations will emerge soon .
The hackers say the attack began Tuesday , when the pair used a combination of social engineering and a technical hack to get into Comcast 's domain management console at Network Solutions .
They declined to detail their technique , but said it relied on a flaw at the Virginia - based domain registrar .
Network Solutions spokeswoman Susan Wade disputes the hackers ' account .
" We now know that it was nothing on our end , " she says .
" There was no breach in our system or social engineering situation on our end . "
However they got in , the intrusion gave the pair control of over 200 domain names owned by Comcast .
They changed the contact information for one of them , Comcast.net , to Defiant 's e-mail address ; for the street address , they used the " Dildo Room " at " 69 Dick Tard Lane . "
Comcast , they said , noticed the administrative transfer and wrested back control , forcing the hackers to repeat the exploit to regain ownership of the domain .
Then , they say , they contacted Comcast 's original technical contact at his home number to tell him what they 'd done .
When the Comcast manager scoffed at their claim and hung up on them , 18 - year - old EBK decided to take the more drastic measure of redirecting the site 's traffic to servers under their control .
( Comcast would neither confirm nor deny the warning phone call . )
" If he was n't such a prick , he could have avoided all of that , " says EBK .
" I was n't even really thinking .
Plus , I 'm just so mad at Comcast .
I 'm tired of their shitty service . "
" They called me back five minutes later and said , ' We got Comcast ' , " recalls Nieves .
The defacement message was short and simple : " KRYOGENICS Defiant and EBK RoXed Comcast , " it read .
" sHouTz to VIRUS Warlock elul21 coll1er seven . "
A screenshot taken during the Comcast . net hijacking shows Defiant in control of the company 's domain names .
Courtesy DefiantComcast boasts 14 million subscribers nationwide , and handling the massive traffic aimed at Comcast .
net was no easy task .
The hackers stayed up most of the night opening new webhosting accounts , and constantly moving the DNS to follow them .
In all , they claim , they burned through 50 different hosts to keep their defacement alive .
" You know how hard it is to find hosting handling that kind of traffic ? " says EBK
" The first one went in two minutes . "
The attack began at around 11:00 p.m. Eastern time , and the hackers owned Comcast . net until 4 or 5 a.m .
Even when Comcast regained control , it took hours longer for the change to fully propagate through the DNS , leaving some customers without webmail access as late as 11:30 Thursday morning .
EBK slept for an hour Wednesday night ; Defiant for 20 minutes .
Even as the attack was in progress , the hackers began to feel the weight of their actions .
Both say they 've been raided by law enforcement before .
" I slept in my clothes , because the last time they came , I was in my underwear with my dong hanging out and shit , " says Defiant .
" I feel like he did it for the publicity , " says Luis " Auto " Alicea , a former member of Kryogeniks , who runs a website hosting screenshots of hacks in progress .
" The fame . "
Defiant began hacking about three years ago , when he was kicked out of high school for possession of narcotics at the age of 16 .
" I wound up assaulting the school resource office , " he says .
He entered a home schooling program , but did n't take to it , and gravitated to the internet .
There he " bumped into the wrong people . "
EBK , too , says he dropped out of high school .
Thursday , the pair were dealing with their newfound fame , laughing over the press coverage with a mix of glee and nervous excitement .
Some reports have speculated that the hackers were retaliating for Comcast 's recent sabotage of BitTorrent traffic ; Defiant and EBK say that 's false : they just hate Comcast in general .
" I 'm sure they hate us too , " says Defiant .
" Comcast is just a huge corporation , and we wanted to take them out , and we did , " he says .
Fellow hackers , relying on press reports claiming that customer data may have been compromised , are hitting up the duo for passwords to Comcast e-mail accounts , which they say they do n't have .
" Nobody was listening in on the ports to try and get usernames and password , " says Defiant .
" We could have , but we did n't . "
( On this point , Comcast and the hackers agree ) .
The hackers say the flaw they exploited still exists , and that other large websites are equally vulnerable .
Asked if they plan to attack anyone else , EBK says , " Who knows .
Only Kryogeniks knows "
The elder hacker in the team says he was reluctant to use his access to take over Comcast.net , and emphasizes that the pair tried to warn Comcast about the flaw .
" I was trying to say we should n't do this the whole damn time , " says Defiant .
" But once we were in , " adds EBK , " it was , like , fuck it . "

The Augustan Games of Naples April 30 , 2008 by Malin Banyasz and Mark Rose
A look at one of the ancient world 's most prestigious competitions , held in honor of one of the ancient world 's biggest sports fans
Augustus : The Sebasta were celebrated in his honor
Even as all eyes turn to Beijing and the 2008 Olympics , archaeologists are examining newly found Greek inscriptions for clues to the Sebasta , one of the classical world 's most important competitions .
The discovery , made during excavations in advance of subway construction in Naples ( ancient Neapolis ) , is providing the first new information about the Sebasta since an inscription describing the games was found at Olympia more than a century ago .
Scholars are excited by the prospect of learning more about these competitions , which , according to the first - century A.D. geographer Strabo , " rivaled the most famous games of Greece . "
Founded at Naples in A.D. 2 , the Sebasta were held in honor of the emperor Augustus ( sebastos is Greek for augustus ) .
The inscription from Olympia gives their full name as the Italic Roman Augustan Isolympic Games and Festivals .
It sets out rules for the Sebasta and establishes that the athletic events were held under the same regulations as those at Olympics , hence the term " isolympic " or " equivalent to the Olympics . "
Later additions to the Sebasta , probably after the death of Augustus in A.D. 14 , included musical and dramatic contests and a sacrifice to him .
Julius Caesar : Multi - tasked during games , alienating sports fans
It 's not surprising that the emperor Augustus ( 27 B.C. - A.D. 14 ) would be honored in this way .
Augustus cultivated his image as a " regular guy . "
In part this was calculated to ensure he was seen as head of the greater Roman family , the leader of a society based on traditional Roman family values with his own family as an example for all to see and imitate .
But it was also genuine , reflecting the emperor 's own character and interests .
He reformed the gladiatorial games , and his hobbies included fishing .
In short , he was passionate about sports .
Had bowling been invented , he might well have joined a league .
In a telling passage , the Roman biographer Suetonius recorded both the emperor 's real love for competitions and a concern that he not be seen as an elitist , aloof from the common people as his granduncle and adoptive father Julius Caesar had been :
Once in his seat ... he watched the proceedings intently ; either to avoid the bad reputation earned by Julius Caesar for reading letters or petitions , and answering them , during such performances , or just to enjoy the fun , as he frankly admitted doing .
... His chief delight was to watch boxing , particularly when the fighters were Italians -- and not merely professional bouts , in which he often used to pit Italians against Greeks , but slogging matches between untrained roughs in narrow city alleys .
Claudius : Produced a play at the Sebasta written by his brother
Nero : Performed in Naples many times , possibly at the Sebasta
Still a sports fan in his late seventies , Augustus himself attended the Sebasta in A.D. 14 , shortly before his death : " he next crossed over to Naples , although his stomach was weak ... and watched an athletic competition which was held in his honor " ( Suetonius ) .
Later emperors continued to patronize the games .
In A.D. 42 , Claudius ( A.D. 41 - 54 ) presided over the games and produced a Greek comedy written by his deceased brother Germanicus , who had been wildly popular with the Roman people and army .
The play , of course , won .
Claudius ' successor Nero ( A.D. 54 -68 ) performed for the first time at Naples according to Suetonius :
His first stage appearance was at Naples where , disregarding an earthquake , which shook the theater , he sang his piece through to the end .
He often performed at Naples , for several consecutive days , too ; and even while giving his voice a brief rest , could not stay away from the theater , but went to dine in the orchestra where he promise the crowd in Greek that , when he had downed a drink or two , he would give them something to make their ears ring .
Though the date of Nero 's first appearance , A.D. 64 , does n't match with a year in which the Sebasta was held , it is possible that he competed in A.D. 66 .
Nero 's performances were legendary , and not for the right reasons .
No one was allowed to leave the theater and the gates were kept locked .
There are stories of women giving birth in the audience and men being so bored that they would sneak out by jumping off the wall at the back of the theater or by playing dead so that they would be carried out .
In A.D. 67 , Nero went to Greece on what scholars refer to as his " concert tour . "
He won 1,808 victories at various festivals , and concluded " The Greeks alone are worthy of my genius ; they really listen to music . "
The emperor 's return to Italy , as described by Suetonius , emphasized the Greek character of Naples and the Sebasta : " Nero disembarked at Naples , where he had made his debut as a singer , and ordered part of the city wall to be razed -- which is the Greek custom whenever the victor in any of the Sacred Games comes home . "
Titus : Attended the Sebasta when his father Vespasian ruled
Domitian : Created the Capitoline Games in A.D. 86
After a period of contention following Nero 's assassination , the general Vespasian won the struggle for the throne in A.D. 69 .
His son and successor Titus ( 79 - 81 ) showed a continued interest in the Sebasta , probably presiding there in 74 and 78 before he became emperor .
It was only in 86 , when Titus ' brother Domitian ( A.D. 81-96 ) established the Capitoline Games in Rome , that the Sebasta lost its place as the premiere games of the western Mediterranean .
Until now , the main evidence we had for the Sebasta was the inscription found at Olympia , supplemented by a few gleanings from ancient authors such as Strabo and Suetonius .
But archaeologist Beatrice Roncella , while excavating at the Piazza Nicolo Amore in advance of subway construction , found inscriptions that read " we are the Roman Augustan games equal to the [ games ] in Olympia . "
Roncella realized that the inscription referred to the Sebasta and came from a temple of " Divus Augustus , " the divine emperor Augustus .
In all , Roncella recovered more than 400 pieces of Greek inscribed marble panels that once covered the walls of a large portico , at least 40 feet long and more than nine feet high , in front of a temple of Augustus .
Of the temple itself , the podium , pavement , architectural fragments , and column pieces have now been found .
The temple 's portico inscriptions will undoubtedly add much more to our knowledge of the Sebasta .
According to Roncella , the dramatic and musical contests of the Sebasta must have taken place in a theater , likely the one whose remains can now be seen of the Via dell ' Anticaglia , and the equestrian events in the hippodrome in Piazza Garibaldi .
That the inscriptions relating to the winners of the games are found near Piazza Nicola Amore suggests to Roncella that the procession of the winners must have ended at the temple .
How did the Sebasta fit in the overall history and cultural context of games in the ancient world ?
The modern Olympics were inspired by the games held every four years at Olympia in Greece , but there were many athletic competitions throughout the classical world .
Most were small affairs in which only local citizens could participate , but there were four major , international ones known as the Sacred Games .
In addition to the Olympics , these included the Pythian Games , held at Delphi every four years , and games held every two years at Nemea in southern Greece and at Isthmia near Corinth .
Victors at these games received wreaths or crowns , for example made of olive leaves at Olympia , celery at Nemea , and pine at Isthmia .
Of the games held by individual cities , the most prominent was the Panathenaic Games staged by Athens .
The Hellenistic period , from the death of Alexander in 323 B.C. until the expansion of Rome , saw a proliferation of games as cities in the Greek world tried to convert what had been local competitions into international ones .
Some were modeled on the Olympics and were called " isolympic " ( equal to the Olympics ) , others followed the Pythian Games ( " isopythian " ) , and so forth .
Hosting such games -- like hosting the Olympics today - - was a source of civic pride and could be an economic windfall if they attracted large crowds from outside .
Remains of the Temple of Augustus were uncovered during excavation ahead of subway construction in Naples .
( Pasquale Sorrentino )
Augustus followed this pattern when , in commemoration of his victory over the fleet of Antony and Cleopatra off the coast of northwestern Greece at Actium in 31 B.C. , he established Nikopolis ( " Victory City " ) and , according to Strabo , expanded existing local games dedicated to the god Apollo to international status .
First probably held in 27 B.C. , the Aktia took place every five years and included athletic and equestrian events and were considered isolympic , but also had musical competitions .
The institution of other games , by Herod , is recorded by Josephus in his Jewish Antiquities .
When he completed his new capital , Caesarea Sebaste in 10 B.C. , Herod initiated games with athletic , equestrian , and musical competitions for which victors were crowned , plus gladiatorial events .
Held every four years , the games , also called the Sebasta , were dedicated to Augustus .
So , the Sebasta in Naples reflect both the proliferation of games in the classical world as well as the association of Augustus with such festivals , either as patron or as honoree .
The Olympia inscription , our main source for the Sebasta , sets out the rules of the competition , and may have been intended both to publicize them and establish that the competitions were indeed " isolympic . "
In 1935 , the scholar Russel Mortimer Geer published an analysis of the evidence that has for lack of any new evidence , been the final word on the Sebasta , and the following summary of the inscription is based on his study .
The Olympia inscription gives eligibility rules : " let no one younger than 17 take part in the Italian Isolympic games .
Let those athletes aged 17 to 20 participate in the boys events , those others in the men's events . "
It then mentions the prizes awarded for the athletic competitions , crowns of wheat for men and of now unknown material for boys .
Contestants were given an allowance of 1 drachma per day beginning 30 days before the competition , which was raised to 2 drachmae for boys and 3 for men in the days just before the games .
The registration deadline was 30 days before the start of the games , when contestants had to appear at the gymnasium .
Geer notes that , " Late registration was permitted only if excused by illness , highway robbery , or shipwreck .
Failure to give the correct name was punished by fine or beating . "
The inscription indicates that the Sebasta had standard Olympic events .
The foot races were the stadion ( on a track of about 190 meters ) , diaulos ( two laps of the track ) , and a race in which runners wore a helmet and shin guards and carried a shield .
There was boxing and wrestling , as well as the pancration ( a sort of extreme fighting ) .
The pentathlon was another standard event .
More unusual was a race , the apobatai , which was known also in the Panathenaic Games .
In it , in which two men started in a chariot but one got out and finished on foot .
Horse races and two - and four - horse chariot races are mentioned next on the inscription .
Newly found inscriptions record winners at the Sebasta .
( Pasquale Sorrentino )
According to the inscription , the athletic events were followed by musical and dramatic contests , each taking a day .
These competitions were not part of the Olympic Games and winners were awarded cash prizes rather than honorary crowns .
Trumpeters , lyre players , and flutists , as well as comic and tragic actors , received 3,000 drachmae .
Pantomine dancers were awarded 4,000 drachmae .
A prize was also given for the best musical and dramatic performance .
The inscription ends , and perhaps the games closed with , equestrian events including races for colts and horses .
Geer summarizes the games , as laid out in the Olympia inscription : " [ they ] seem to have consisted of two distinct parts , the first athletic and equestrian with crowns as prizes , the second , musical and dramatic with money prizes followed by more equestrian events and that each part was preceded by its own sacrifices , those before the second part including sacrifice to Augustus . "
It seems likely , as Geer noted in 1935 , that the Sebasta changed after the death of Augustus .
Both Suetonius ( noted above ) and the historian Velleius Paterculus refer only to athletic events in describing the events Augustus saw in A.D. 14 :
Augustus Caesar ... was on the point of sending his son Tiberius to Illyricum ....
With the double purpose of escorting him on his way , and of being present at an athletic contest that the Neapolitans had established in his honor , he set out for Campania .
Although he had already experienced symptoms of growing weakness and of a change in his health for the worse , his strong will resisted infirmity and he accompanied his son .
But the description by Strabo , whose Geography records events that took place almost a decade after Augustus ' death , is different : " At the present time they celebrate ... public games for music and gymnastic exercises during many days , which rival the most famous games of Greece . "
If the musical and dramatic events were added then , it may that the sacrifice to Augustus , who was deified after his death , was added at the same time .
For games that were so significant in the classical world , we know very little about the Sebasta , despite the list of regulations from the inscription found at Olympia .
But the new - found texts might add valuable insights .
There are already some initial results , and the panels , a catalogue of the names and hometowns of the winners , have given archaeologists two surprises .
" First , we did not know that so many of the athletes were from Asia Minor , which may tell us something about the makeup of the city in the first and second centuries A.D. , " says Beatrice Roncella .
The second major surprise , she notes , was that " contrary to our beliefs , women were winning prizes on equal footing with men , " noting especially one Thalassia , a female competitor from Ephesus in modern - day Turkey .
Before now , it was known only that there was a race for daughters of magistrates at the Sebasta .
Naples ' new subway has brought the Sebasta back from the brink of total obscurity outside the small number of scholars who have studied ancient athletics .
Not that the Italic Roman Augustan Isolympic Games and Festivals are going to be a hot conversation topic this summer as the events in Beijing unfold .
But as you watch the Olympics this year - - something Augustus would approve of - - do n't forget the Sebasta !

There are many on - going themes in the large discussion of global warming and replacing fossil fuels with renewable , clean energy .
One of the dominant ones is that alternative fuels such as solar are much more expensive than fossil fuels .
This argument is often put forth by those entrenched in the status quo of the fossil fuel industry .
The general argument is that our entire economic world will take a hit if we use solar as it is so much more expensive that oil .
There was a recent news story here at ScientificBlogging saying that it will take another ten years for solar energy to be price - competitive with fossil fuels .
That may or may not turn out to be true .
What is clear is that we must support innovation on all fronts to shorten that time line .
At the same time we must support all efforts to make the solar industry scalable .
Solar power today is in many ways like petroleum of the 19th century .
How so ?
When petroleum was first extracted from the ground in 1861 , it was much more expensive than the energy sources that were dominant , wood and coal .
It was only when the market was scaled up that petroleum became price competitive .
Sound familiar ?
That is exactly the situation today with solar and other alternative sources of energy .
When looking at the real price of oil , adjusted for inflation to 2006 dollars it cost $ 100 a barrel in 1865 , a price it briefly attained again in 1981 and of course in 2008 .
In other words , the price of oil when it first came to market in the 19th century was extremely expensive , more so that the competing sources of energy .
Due in part to the relentless drive and ambition of the early oil men , such as John D. Rockefeller , the oil market was dramatically expanded to a scale market that helped to bring down the price .
It has been , along with coal , one of the cheapest sources of energy ever since .
So , we should all keep a historical perspective on solar , wind , biomass and all other forms of energy .
Whenever a new energy source comes to market it will always be extremely expensive and will remain so until innovation and market scalability is attained .
We must be vigilant in supporting all forms of alternative energy in the marketplace as the expansion of that marketplace will drive down costs .
It has been postulated that a 50 mile by 50 mile grid of solar panels in the Sahara desert could generate as much energy in a year as the annual output of Middle Eastern oil .
That would certainly bring down the price of solar , as would innovation in the production of all forms of solar panels .
We just need to commit to do what is necessary to create scale in the solar power marketplace .
There is an incredible amount of wealth that will be created by those who bring scalability to the solar marketplace .
Who will be the Rockefellers of solar power ?

Crucifixions are an annual event in the Philippines
They have urged them to get tetanus vaccinations before they flagellate themselves and are nailed to crosses , and to practise good hygiene .
On Good Friday dozens of very devout Catholics in the Philippines re-enact the crucifixion of Jesus Christ .
It is something that has become a huge tourist attraction , although the Church frowns on the practice .
Disinfect
The health department has strongly advised penitents to check the condition of the whips they plan to use to lash their backs , the Manila Times newspaper reports .
Real nails are used in the re-enactments
They want people to have what they call " well - maintained " whips .
In the hot and dusty atmosphere , officials warn , using unhygienic whips to make deep cuts in the body could lead to tetanus and other infections .
And they advise that the nails used to fix people to crosses must be properly disinfected first .
Often people soak the nails in alcohol throughout the year .
Every Good Friday , in towns across the Philippines , people atone for sins or give thanks for an answered prayer by re-enacting the crucifixion of Jesus Christ .
Giving thanks
In the northern city of San Fernando alone there will be three separate improvised Golgothas - the biblical name for the hill where Jesus was crucified .
Four people there have pledged to have their feet and hands nailed to wooden crosses , while others will flog themselves while walking barefoot through villages .
Sometimes people repeat the penance year after year , like the fish vendor who will be nailed to the cross for the 15th and last time on Friday to give thanks for his mother 's recovery from tuberculosis .
With long hair and a beard , wearing sandals and a crown of thorns , he is tied with cloth to the cross but also has nails driven through the flesh of his hands and feet , avoiding the bones .
The incomes of every Italian citizen were published on the web without any prior warning by the government , just days before it was due to leave power .
Claiming it was part of a crackdown on tax evasion , the finance ministry yesterday put details of the declared taxable income of every citizen on the country 's tax website .
The site proved hugely popular .
Surprised Italians , delighted at the chance to find out how much their neighbours , colleagues , and high - profile celebrities were earning , bombarded the site within hours of it going live .
Critics condemned the publication , however , saying it was an outrageous breach of privacy as the government did not have consent to make the information public .
" It 's a clear violation of privacy law , " ADOC , the Italian consumer group , told Reuters .
" There is a danger for an increase in crime and violence as the data are an irresistible source for criminals . "
The treasury finally suspended the website last night after the country 's privacy watchdog issued a formal complaint .
Tax evasion is rife in Italy and both Silvio Berlusconi , the incoming prime minister , and the man he succeeds , Romano Prodi , pledged to tackle tax cheats .
Prodi's finance ministry described the move as a bid to shine a light on people 's murky tax returns .
The tax minister , Vincenzo Visco , was quoted in Italy 's Corriere della Sera saying : " It 's all about transparency and democracy .
I do n't see the problem . "
But the timing of the release of the information has been viewed with scepticism .
It was one of the last acts of Prodi 's centre - left government before it leaves office next week , sparking accusations the move was motivated by spite .
" It 's a very strange thing to do on the last day before clearing off , " Guido Crosetto , a member of Berlusconi 's party , said .
" Taxpayers need to pay less tax , not to know how much all the other Italians are paying . "

For years , the grey squirrel held sway - driving its red cousin into the remotest corners of the country .
But now the black squirrel has arrived - and is rampaging through parks and woodlands .
Scientists say the testosterone - charged black is fitter , faster and more fiercely competitive than both reds or greys .

Cute but deadly :
They may look harmless , but ' mutant ' squirrels have left the grey squirrel population in fear
It has already taken over in parts of England and appears to be spreading .
Its rise means the greys now have serious competition for the first time since they were introduced to Britain from America in the 1870s .
The black squirrel is also likely to make life even harder for our native red squirrels .
A study by Cambridge scientists shows that black squirrels now make up half the squirrel population in some parts of the UK .
The upstarts are genetic mutations of greys , but have a darker fur and higher levels of the male sex hormone testosterone - making them more aggressive and more successful .

Making a run for it :
There are fears the black squirrels could wipe out the greys
Geneticist Helen McRobie and Dr Alison Thomas , a professor of life sciences , both from Anglia Ruskin University , Cambridge , conducted the first UK study of black squirrels .
" The population is expanding across the region and is spreading further every year , " said Dr McRobie .
" They could overrun most of the Eastern counties within ten years . "
The black squirrel is the result of a single mutation in the DNA of greys , giving them higher levels of the pigment melanin in their fur .
Sex selection is also boosting their numbers because female greys appear to prefer them as mates .
Dr Thomas , who completed the year - long study last week , used DNA samples taken from squirrels across East Anglia .

Fury fight : Red , grey and black squirrels
She said : " There has been a recent population boom .
They are due to overtake the grey squirrel population in some parts of the country .
" The first sighting was in 1912 , but sightings were very rare until the last few years .
They were first spotted around Letchworth Garden City , near Royston , Hertfordshire - currently home to the UK 's largest colony .
" But since then they have migrated northwards , penetrating Cambridge city boundaries in the 1990s .
Now they make up 50 per cent of the squirrel population in the villages around Cambridge and they are spilling into Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire . "
The rise of the black is the biggest change in squirrel demographics since the indigenous red squirrels almost disappeared 50 years ago from most of England .
Lindsey Maguire , 50 , who has co-ordinated the National Squirrel Rescue team for the last 12 years , agreed that blacks were becoming a more common sight .
He added : " The irony of it is the blacks were first spotted in a similar area to where the greys were introduced to Britain .
" Now they may well get their just deserts .
I wonder how long it would be before we see a " save the grey " campaign . "
It would motivate them to hold their representatives accountable for making it happen .
That is , after all , the only way to get us out of Iraq , to address global warming , to make us energy - independent .
It 's the only way to resist the forces arrayed against providing universal health care , rebuilding our infrastructure and returning our schools to world - class status .
It 's the only way to give our children the means to compete with children in other parts of the world who are healthier , better - educated and have more opportunities than many of our own .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A man who said he lost his wife and a son to reactions from tainted heparin made with ingredients from China urged U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday to protect patients from other unsafe drugs .
Families of the victims of Heparin reactions testify during a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on Heparin imports from China on Capitol Hill , April 29 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jim Young
Leroy Hubley said his wife , Bonnie , and son , Randy , had undergone kidney dialysis at an Ohio clinic and were given heparin that was later recalled by Baxter International Inc .
Both had reactions to the blood thinner and died within one month of each other .
“ Now I am left to deal not only with the pain of losing my wife and son , but anger that an unsafe drug was permitted to be sold in this country , ” Hubley , who frequently choked back tears and wiped his eyes , told a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee hearing .
A U.S. Food and Drug Administration probe found a contaminant in some batches of Baxter ’s heparin .
Officials said tests showed the chemical could have caused the reactions reported in 81 deaths of patients treated with some brand of heparin since January 2007 .
Lawmakers questioned Baxter and its ingredient supplier , Scientific Protein Laboratories LLC ( SPL ) , about why they failed to detect the heparin contamination .
Both companies said it appeared the chemical was deliberately added before either company received the ingredients .
Baxter , which had supplied about half of the U.S. heparin market , recalled most of its heparin products in February .
The action followed a string of U.S. recalls linked to China last year , ranging from tainted pet food and toothpaste to excessive lead in paint that swept millions of toys from stores .
The heparin contaminant has been detected in 13 countries , FDA officials have said , but only the United States and Germany have seen reports of an increase in allergic reactions .
The FDA says all heparin imported into the United States is now tested for contamination and the current supply is safe .
NEW STEPS URGED
Hubley and other relatives of heparin victims urged new steps to keep medicines free of contamination .
“ I want to know what is going to be done to rectify the matter .
I want to know if my daughter , Dawn , and the millions of others who continue to receive dialysis are safe , ” Hubley said .
Baxter Chief Executive Robert Parkinson said the company was “ alarmed that one of our products was used , in what appears to have been a deliberate scheme , to adulterate a life - saving medication , and that people have suffered as a result . ”
“ We deeply regret that this has happened , and I feel a strong sense of personal responsibility for these circumstances , ” he said .
Heparin -- used in dialysis and some surgeries to prevent blood clots -- is derived from pig intestines and often collected from small , mostly unregulated farms in China .
FDA tests found the recalled drug contained an altered form of chondroitin sulfate that mimics raw heparin .
Chinese officials have said the chemical was present but is not to blame for the reactions or deaths .
Rep. Bart Stupak , a Michigan Democrat , said it remained uncertain whether the contamination was intentional or accidental .
He said both companies should have done more to assure their products were safe .

“ Both Baxter and SPL have failed the American public , ” said Stupak , chairman of the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee ’s oversight and investigations panel .
Using the contaminant would be about 100 times cheaper than real heparin , said committee investigator David Nelson .
FDA CRITICIZED
Lawmakers attacked the FDA for failing to inspect SPL ’s plant in Changzhou , China , before approving Baxter ’s heparin .
Agency inspectors found a series of manufacturing problems during a visit in February , after Baxter ’S recall .
Baxter officials audited the facility five months earlier and said they found acceptable conditions , Nelson said .
“ I ’m really baffled by that .
How is it you can have two divergent findings from the same plant ? ”
Stupak asked .
Baxter ’s Parkinson said the visits happened at different times , and the drug maker ’s audit was routine while the FDA visit was in response to a specific problem .
Dr. Janet Woodcock , director of the FDA ’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , said the agency needed more tools and better technology to hold companies accountable .
“ FDA needs the help of Congress to make sure that a tragedy like this does not happen again , ” Woodcock said .
Woodcock said it would cost about $ 225 million annually for the FDA to inspect , every other year , all pharmaceutical plants around the world that supply the U.S. market .
Lawmakers are considering legislation that would charge drug and device makers fees to boost inspections .
So the McCain campaign is starting to pushback against Cliff Schecter and his book The Real McCain .
In response to the charges first brought at Huffington Post that he got into a physical altercation with Rep. Rick Renzi , McCain appeared on Fox ( naturally ) to say this :
Oh , okay , McCain , if you say it did n't happen ... well , then , that 's all the proof the media needs .
But if you listen carefully , McCain never actually denies it ... even with Renzi , he says there were witnesses and Renzi is a friend , but not that he never came to blows .
The classic non-denial denial .
But that did n't stop Jill Hazelbaker , a McCain spokesperson and professional internet concern troll , from calling Cliff 's book " trash journalism " and that " The story is completely fabricated . "
And then it hit me ... for all their talk about balance and bringing on Republican strategists and talking heads when a liberal appears , there 's no similar inclination when it 's a Republican .
The media will talk to McCain or his mouthpieces like Hazelbaker all by themselves with absolutely no balance from the other side of the aisle .
In fact , I talked to Cliff today and asked him if he had been able to land any TV appearances to promote The Real McCain , maybe to refute Hazelbaker or some other Republican strategist who wants to minimize McCain 's nasty temper and disrespect of others .
Not one .
Is n't that amazing ?
A few months ago , Jonah Goldberg writes this vitriolic piece of tripe without a single fact or even a basic high school understanding of sociology and civics and he gets on all the major networks to pimp his fact - free ( and really badly written ) drivel , especially since he targeted liberals generally and Hillary Clinton specifically .
That 's good television , apparently .
But Cliff , who is no stranger to TV , can't find a single outlet willing to take a look at a book that may not show McCain -- the Republican candidate for the highest office in the land -- in a less than glowing light .
God forbid the voters hear about McCain 's negatives when the media is busy talking about Hillary 's lies and Obama 's ties to controversial figures .
They 'll put on McCain to refute a book that they wo n't talk about , but not bring on the actual author of the book .
That 's what I call teflon , baby .
If you are of the mind to , in addition to supporting one of our progressive voices by purchasing his book , consider please using the " Spotlight " function at the bottom this post to contact members of the media and ask them to get Cliff 's book in the spotlight and stop giving McCain a pass .
And for your enjoyment , Max and the Marginalized has come up with a new song using some of the revelations that Cliff has in his book : John McCain is a Hotheaded Coot Who is Unfit to Lead , and We Wrote a Song About It .
The lyrics are great :
It 's so funny everyone forgot to laugh
At your temper even shorter than the shelf life of a gaffe
From your lips to no one 's ears , somehow disappears into the past
If it came from my side no one would ignore
That stupid joke about Barbara Ann , or when you called that wife of yours --
a country needs a whole lot better
than the mixed up words and letters , evermore
Bot the nonsense only echoes for about three seconds long
They 've got their fingers in their ears , they can't point out where you 're wrong
Teflon John , is this thing on ?
All the microphones are broken
And the lines that you 've misspoken
Are met with nothing but a token nod-along
They just move on , so move along
I never ever would 've guessed
That when you ride for half the price on the old Straight Talk Express
You get the Denny 's senior special
And it comes with a free pass from the press
So let 's not put no huffy hotheads where they really do n't belong
I 'd so much rather see you feeding ducks down at the pond
You knew they were in the United States .
You were warned by the CIA .
You knew in July they were inside the United States .
You were told again by briefing officers in August that it was a dire threat .
And what did you do ?
Nothing , so far as we could see on the 9/11 Commission .
The Fed is watching inflation risks , fuelled by high oil prices and a weak dollar
The US central bank , the Federal Reserve , is widely expected to trim interest rates to 2 % from 2.25 % this week to lift the troubled US economy .
Policy makers will begin their two - day meeting later amid signs that economic growth has stagnated , or even shrunk .
It is thought that this could be the last cut for a while , after bold action from the Fed and White House has led to hopes that the worst could be over .
Rising inflation risks could also lead to a rate cut pause , analysts say .
" We expect this to be the last cut , but the Fed will be flexible in responding to economic conditions , " said Peter Berezin , global economist at Goldman Sachs .
Pause imminent ?
The Fed has been slashing rates - on occasion between its official meetings - to bring them down from their peak of 5.25 % last summer to their current level of 2.25 % amid increasing signs that the US is sinking into a recession .
The only part of the policy transmission mechanism that is working is the weaker dollar helping to sustain solid export growth
Ethan Harris , economist , Lehman Brothers
But rate cuts take a number of months to have any effect and the Fed has voiced hope they could help to spark a recovery in the second half of the year .
It has also been lending billions of dollars to banks that are wounded from the sharp fall in the value of investments linked to the slumping US mortgage market and keen to sit on their cash .
This has caused the sharp increase in the rate that banks charge each other for money , which many have passed on to their customers in the form of higher mortgage rates and personal and business loans .
Meanwhile , the first of $ 100bn of tax rebates to cash - strapped US households were sent out on Monday as part of an economic stimulus package passed by Congress and signed into law by US President George W Bush in February to boost flagging consumer spending .
In view of these measures , combined with the risk of rising inflation , the Fed is likely to be cautious about further aggressive downward moves , analysts say .
Balancing act The Federal Reserve , like its UK and European central bank counterparts , faces a fine balancing act between lifting the heavy financial strain on banks , businesses and consumers to encourage economic growth - and keeping the lid on spiralling inflation .
With oil prices at near $ 120 a barrel and the cost of staple foods , including wheat , corn and rice , vaulting ever higher , the Fed is likely to be paying close attention to inflationary pressures , analysts said .
" The Fed 's hope that falling oil prices will ease inflation pressures looks something of a remote one at this time , " said John Ryding , Bear Stearns chief economist .
" In short , fears of inflation are likely to limit the Fed 's generosity on the rate front and we only expect a quarter - point cut on 30 April , " he added .
But others highlight a gloomy government report on new US home sales for March , with sales the lowest since 1991 and prices tumbling by 13 % on the previous year , and argue that the Fed cannot afford to stop cutting rates - though perhaps at a slower pace .
Ethan Harris , an economist at Lehman Brothers , considers that rates could fall to 1.25 % by next year .
" The only part of the policy transmission mechanism that is working is the weaker dollar helping to sustain solid export growth , " he said .
" The other channels of policy - market interest rates , asset prices , and bank lending - are either clogged or working in reverse , " he added .

What are these ?
A recent survey among Swedish musicians has found that 38 % of the artists want filesharing to be be legalized .
The artists argue that sharing their files on p2p - networks could promote their work , especially in the early stages of their career .
There is a difference in age when it comes to the outcome of the survey , which was conducted by Sydsvenskan .
Older artists who have been around for some years , long before filesharing even existed , tend to be more critical , saying they ’ve lost 80 % of their sales with no increase in revenue from another sources .
Younger artists that broke through in the era of filesharing are more positive and see it as something that actually helps their career .
One of the artists said : “ Where I am now , filesharing is positive and makes good PR .
If I were to get bigger , I believe it would affect me negatively . ”
There are older artists who think that filesharing could benefit them , one of them noted : “ You can look upon filesharing as a way of promotion , a way of putting new stuff out there . ”
One of the Swedish artists who definitely profited from file - sharing is the Swedish glam rock band “ Lamont ” .
The band was featured on on The Pirate Bay frontpage last year .
Not without success , over 100,000 people downloaded their album in less than 24 hours , numbers that other artists can only dream of .
At the time Brokep told TorrentFreak that they love to support bands who are willing to share their music using BitTorrent .
And indeed , a little later The Pirate Bay supported Familjen , which resulted in a Grammy win for the band .
Perhaps these might be two extreme examples , but there is ample evidence that most artists actually profit from filesharing , even without The Pirate Bay .
The survey further found , and this might also come as a shock to the record labels , that a majority of the artists , 59 % , admit to having downloaded copyrighted music themselves .
Although nearly half of the respondents had a favorable opinion towards filesharing , 58 % of the artists still think that that sharing copyrighted material should be illegal .
One of the artists was rooting for a pirate crackdown , as he said : “ My wish is that the punishment will be harder and that it will become easier to catch filesharers .
I think all musicians should go to parliament and grab those politicians . ”
The survey further showed that a majority of the participants in the survey are angry at the record companies .
One of the musicians said : “ For 50 years , the sole purpose of record companies has been trying to grab as much money away from the artists as possible .
Now , suddenly they ’ve become some kind of interest group for the artists and that ’s not true . ”
Microsoft is lying and intentionally screwing up your log files ( FORM=LVSP|LIVSOP )
I 'd been noticing some weird referrals for several months now .
It 's relatively easy for me spot bogus or odd referrals or changes in traffic patterns since I get pretty minimal traffic ( this site is for fun , not profit or even self - promo . )
Then WebmasterWorld and Search Engine Roundtable started reporting on the issue .
So others were noticing the same strange referrals and were starting to discuss them .
The discussion was started by WMW member confuscius .
Several WMW members had tracked the user IP addresses to be within Microsoft 's Redmond WA offices .
In fact , the strange referrals contained a few unique characteristics :
* All used Search .
Live .Com as the referrer
* All came from within Microsoft ( IPs : 65.55.165 . * and 131.107.0 . *)
* All had super - general query terms ( like " airline " and " nokia " and " cash " ) as the referring query term
* All had the url parameter of FORM=LVSP or , now , FORM=LIVSOP
Here are a few sample referring URL I 've seen here at this website :
http://search.live.com/result.aspx?q=cash&mrt=en-us&FORM=LVSP
http://search.live.com/result.aspx?q=payday+advance&mrt=en-us&FORM=LVSP
http://search.live.com/result.aspx?q=airline&mrt=en-us&FORM=LVSP
http://search.live.com/result.aspx?q=ultracet&mrt=en-us&FORM=LVSP
http://search.live.com/results.aspx?q=search&mrt=en-us&FORM=LIVSOP
Obviously , nothing on this site would or should rank for such terms .
I had originally assumed that these were spoofed IPs or HTTP_Referer attributes were faked .
Someone must be doing some scraping and blaming it on MS ?
But now , after 11 years of trusting that my logs files were telling me the truth and providing the most accurate data about my visitors possible , Microsoft has taken it upon themselves to ruin that truth and to lie to me .
And they admit it via WMW 's msndude :
Thanks for all the feedback on this thread .
First , we appreciate the concerns and issues that have been raised and apologize for any incovenience this might have caused .
Second , we want to explain what this is all about .
The traffic you are seeing is part of a quality check we run on selected pages .
While we work on addressing your conerns , we would request that you do not actively block the IP addreses used by this quality check ; blocking these IP addresses could prevent your site from being included in the Live Search index .
Please keep the feedback and thoughts coming as we will use this to help improve this process and make sure that it impacts your sites as little as possible .
Log file data is something that I consider sacred and not to be messed with .
I 've been managing websites since 1996 and I often even read raw log files for fun !
( LOL - I know . )
This is absolutely the wrong way for MS / Live to gain supporters !
We as marketing consultants will not be the only to notice this issue .
Clients of web marketing consultants and employers will notice the same thing via their analytics tools and they 'll ask us " what 's up ?
Am I really ranking well for payday and cash ? "
Or worse , they could ask " should I go after that term via SEO or PPC ? "
We 'll have to tell them NO ... sorry , Microsoft is lying to you !
Update :
This issue has been occuring for months now .
Microsoft has made no further efforts to alert the webmaster community as to what they are up to nor have they tried to use another ( non-lying ) method to interact with websites that they desire to spider .
As such , I still consider their methods to be completely disrespectful and given that they are one of the " big 3 " of advertisers I 'm shocked that they can't figure our some means to review sites without using trickery and the worst of cloaking methods .

The Science of Swine
Pigs not only inspire scientists via delicious , brain - sustaining pork products .
See the latest pig- influenced developments in medicine and tech , from diabetes treatments to pig-urine - flavored cigarettes
This diagram shows a comparison of the sizes and strangely elliptical shapes of the orbits of the pulsar J1903+0327 and its possible Sun - like companion star with the orbit of the Earth around the Sun .
The sizes of the Sun and the possible companion star have been exaggerated by a factor of about 10 , while that of the Earth has been exaggerated by a factor of about 1000 .
The pulsar , with its magnetic field and beams of radiation , is too large by a factor of about 100,000 .
Pulsars are like cosmic lighthouses sending out sweepingbeams that blink at us across the galactic expanse .
Now scientists have spotteda wacky pulsar that doesn?t behave exactly like its fellows : Instead of circlinga white dwarf star , this one orbits a sun- like star along an oval path .
All other known pulsarsthat rotate as quickly as this one seem to have picked up speed by pulling offmass from a companionstar that has reached the advanced stage of red giant , when its gaseouslayers bloat out prior to the end - stage of life as a very compact , dim , whitedwarf .
" The fact that it 's around a sun - like star isfascinating because if that is the companion to this pulsar , then it certainlydidn ?t accrete matter from that star ?
it has n't been a red giant yet , " said David Champion , an astronomer at Canada 's McGill University .
To account for this odd duck , called PSR J1903+0327 , scientists have concocted a few new ideas , including the possibility that thepulsar originated in a globular cluster with a different companion , but waskicked out by a near - miss with another star .
" The reason why we 're so excited about this is theimpact it might have on our understanding of where the pulsars that we look atare coming from , " Champion told SPACE.com .
" We 've never seenanything like this before . "
Champion and his colleagues detail their findings in the May15 issue of the journal Science .
Quite a surprise
Pulsars are thought to form when a massive star reaches theend of its life and explodes in a supernova .
The remnants of these starssometimes collapse into neutron stars , so - called because they are so dense thatthe protons and electrons that formed the star 's atoms have been squashed intoneutrons ( if the original star was even more massive , it would collapse into ablack hole ) .
Not only is the star 's matter tightly - packed after all thissquashing , but the star 's magnetic field is compressed into a tiny space aswell .
Scientists think this powerful field accelerates charged particles aroundthe star , causing them to emit radiation that is focused into a beam by themagnetic field lines .
As these neutron stars rotate , so too do their light beams .
If a neutron star happens to be shooting out its jet in our direction , we callit a pulsar , because we see a pulse every time the rotating beam reaches us .
Usually , pulsars slow down in their rotation over time asthey lose energy .
When one attains a speed as fast as PSR J1903+0327 , whichrotates every 2.15 milliseconds , scientists think it has " recycled " itself by sucking up mass from a companion red dwarf .
When this happens , scientists usually see a quickly spinning pulsar orbiting around a white dwarf ( the end stage of a red giant ) in a circular orbit ( the red giant 's tidalforces stabilize the pulsar 's orbit into a circle ) .
" This new pulsar is quite a surprise , " Championsaid , referring to the new object 's oblong orbit around a sun-like star .
Cozy origins
The scientists speculate that the strange pulsar may havestarted out in a globular cluster , where stars are much closer to each otherand interact more often than in the rest of the galaxy .
In this case , it wouldhave originally gone through the normal recycling process , but lost its agedred giant companion when a younger sun- like star came flying in and knockedit away .
Another hypothesis is that the pulsar originated in a triplestar system , but its main red giant companion was destroyed .
The team hopes further study of this unique object will helpsolve the mystery and teach us more about how pulsars form .
" It 's always the most unusual objects that advance ourunderstanding the most in these cases , " Champion said .
Shattering the Conventional Wisdom on Growing Inequality
Inequality is growing in the United States .
The data say so .
Knowledgeable experts like Ben Bernanke say so .
Ask just about any economist and they will agree .
( They may or may not think growing inequality is a problem , but they will acknowledge that there has been a sharp increase in inequality . )
According to two of my University of Chicago colleagues , Christian Broda and John Romalis , everyone is wrong .
Inequality has not grown over the last decade — at least not very much .
What we think is a rise in inequality is merely an artifact of how we measure things .
As improbable as it may seem , I believe them .
Their argument could hardly be simpler .
How rich you are depends on two things : how much money you have , and how much the stuff you want to buy costs .
If your income doubles , but the prices of the things you consume also double , then you are no better off .
When people talk about inequality , they tend to focus exclusively on the income part of the equation .
According to all our measures , the gap in income between the rich and the poor has been growing .
What Broda and Romalis quite convincingly demonstrate , however , is that the prices of goods that poor people tend to consume have fallen sharply relative to the prices of goods that rich people consume .
Consequently , when you measure the true buying power of the rich and the poor , inequality grew only one - third as fast as economists previously thought it did — or maybe did n’t grow at all .
Why did the prices of the things poor people buy fall relative to the stuff rich people buy ?
Lefties are n’t going to like the answers one bit : globalization and Wal - Mart !
China is able to produce clothes , electronics , and trinkets incredibly cheaply .
Poor people spend more of their income on these sorts of things and less on fancy cars , expensive wine , etc. According to Broda and Romalis , China alone accounts for about half of their result .
So if the sorts of people who break store windows in Davos care about the poor , they might need to rethink some of their ideas about globalization ’s impacts .
MIT economist Jerry Hausman ( who taught me econometrics in my first year of graduate school ) and co-author Ephraim Leibtag have analyzed the impact of the entrance of a Wal - Mart superstore on local food prices .
Not only are Wal - Mart ’s prices lower , but its entry also induces competitors to lower prices .
The impact is much larger on the poor than the rich , both because the poor are more likely to shop at Wal - Mart and because they spend more of their income on food .

The basic idea behind the lab is to rely on randomized trials  similar to the ones used in medical research  to study antipoverty programs .
This helps avoid the classic problem with the evaluation of aid programs : it ’s often impossible to separate cause and effect .
If aid workers start supplying textbooks to schools in one town and the students there start doing better , it could be because of the textbooks .
Or it could be that the town also happened to hire a new school administrator .
In a randomized trial , researchers would choose a set of schools and then separate into them two groups .
The groups would be similar in every respect except for the fact that one would receive new textbooks and one would n’t .
With a test like this , as Vinod Thomas , the head of independent evaluation at the World Bank , says , “ You can be much more accurate and much more clear about the effect of a program . ”
The approach can sound cruel , because researchers knowingly deny help to some of the people they ’re studying .
But what , really , is the alternative ?
It ’s not as if someone has offered to buy new textbooks for every child in the world .
With a randomized study , you at least learn whether your aid money is well spent .
Ms. Duflo , who ’s 35 , and Mr. Banerjee , 46 , came to economics from opposite ends of the intellectual spectrum .
She was studying history at the École Normale Supérieure , one of the most prestigious colleges in France , when she decided that the more scientific approach of economics offered a better way to address global poverty .
He dropped out of the similarly prestigious Indian Statistical Institute after two and a half months of studying math ; he found the subject too abstract .
By 2003 , they were both working on development at M.I.T .
At the time , randomized trials were becoming more popular in the United States , but they were still fairly rare in the developing world .
So along with Sendhil Mullainathan , a colleague , Ms. Duflo and Mr. Banerjee founded the lab .
( It ’s named for the father of an M.I.T. alumnus , who owned the exclusive right to sell Toyotas in Saudi Arabia . )
Day to day , the lab is now run by Rachel Glennerster , who came from the International Monetary Fund , and it has become a magnet for some of the world ’s best development economists , including Marianne Bertrand , Michael Kremer and Edward Miguel .
Mr. Kremer and two other economists , in fact , did the textbook experiment  and found that textbooks did n’t improve test scores or graduation rates in rural western Kenya .
( The students were probably too diverse , in terms of preparation and even language , to be helped by a single curriculum . )
On the other hand , another randomized trial in the same part of Kenya found that treating children for intestinal worms did lift school performance .
That study has led to an expansion of deworming programs and , as Alan Krueger of Princeton says , is “ probably improving millions of lives . ”
Mr. Banerjee estimates , very conservatively , that $ 11 billion a year  out of roughly $ 100 billion in annual development aid worldwide  could be spent on programs that have been proved to work .
Unfortunately , nowhere near $ 11 billion is being spent on such programs .
“ Right now , we do n’t have a lot of things that have been taken up by the policy world , ” he said .
“ But the policy lag is usually substantial .
Now that we have a lot more results , I expect that in the next 10 years we will have a lot more impact . ”
In a top - secret intelligence memo headlined ' Bin Laden determined to strike in the US ' , the President was told on 6 August that the Saudi - born terrorist hoped to ' bring the fight to America ' in retaliation for missile strikes on al - Qaeda camps in Afghanistan in 1998 .
Bush and his aides , who are facing withering criticism for failing to act on a series of warnings , have previously said intelligence experts had not advised them domestic targets were considered at risk .
However , they have admitted they were specifically told that hijacks were being planned .
The news comes as unease about prosecution of the war in Afghanistan grows .
British troops deployed near the eastern Afghan city of Khost failed yesterday to locate any of the al - Qaeda fighters who , it is claimed , ambushed an Australian SAS patrol .
Senior sources at the Ministry of Defence said yesterday that the al - Qaeda or Taliban fighters who were being pursued were numbered in ' tens ' .
Escape routes have been cut off by coalition forces , the sources said .
' There has been no combat .
We have established a forward operating base and are now clearing the area , ' said Lt - Col Ben Curry , spokesman for the Royal Marines at Bagram air base .
MoD sources also said that the mystery illness which has struck British troops at Bagram has been identified as the winter vomiting disease which swept Britain earlier this year .
The disease is common around the world and is caused by poor sanitation and hygeine .
One possibility is that food brought in by civilian contractors through Pakistan may be to blame .
An American operation in the east of Afghanistan has also been criticised after hundreds of troops deployed after a series of missile attacks on US troops in Khost failed to find the enemy or to prevent new attacks .
For the first time in the war on terrorism , which has pushed his popularity levels to almost unheard of heights , Bush and his administration are on the defensive .
The White House has revealed that Bush asked for an intelligence analysis of al - Qaeda attacks within the US because most of the information presented to him over the summer focused on threats to targets overseas .
However , there are growing demands for an independent investigation .
The intelligence services have already been heavily criticised for failing to act on a series of clues that might have led them to the hijackers .
Sources quoted by the Washington Post and ABC TV said that at least two names listed in a July 2001 FBI memo about an Arizona flight school had been identified by the CIA as having links to al - Qaeda .
But the memo was not acted on or distributed to outside agencies .
And , while administration officials have said repeatedly that intelligence analysts never imagined that terrorists would use planes in a suicide attack , a 1999 report for the National Intelligence Council warned that fanatics loyal to bin Laden might try to hijack a jetliner and fly it into the Pentagon .
The memo received by Bush on 6 August contained unconfirmed information passed on by British intelligence in 1998 revealing that al - Qaeda operatives had discussed hijacking a plane to negotiate the release of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman , the Muslim cleric imprisoned in America for his part in a plot to blow up the World Trade Centre in 1993 .
Plans for ousting the Taliban and dismantling the al - Qaeda network were already under way when the terrorists struck in New York and at the Pentagon .
One option was to arm Afghanistan 's Northern Alliance - a ploy eventually used successfully during the war last autumn .
My previous article on extending Tamarin Tracing with native methods described how to implement the native methods in C .
It 's also possible to implement native methods in Forth .
Methods implemented in JavaScript are compiled to ABC bytecode by a compiler ( currently the asc.jar provided by the Flex SDK ) .
These are compiled to the basic Forth instructions by the Tamarin Tracing engine and those Forth instructions are run by the interpreter .
' Hot ' areas of the Forth instructions are traced and compiled to native machine code as needed .
Methods implemented in Forth do n't need to be compiled from ABC to Forth .
They are immediately available for interpreting and JITing via the tracing mechanism .
I'm a little unsure of the exact pros and cons of implementing things in Forth vs C vs JavaScript and would be interested in comments if anyone can help .
As an example of a method in Forth I 'm going to use the same fibonacci function in my previous article .
A Forth method is marked ' native ' just like a method implemented in C .
But it has some metadata associated with it to say it is implemented in Forth , and to give the name of the Forth word ( in Forth terminology a ' word ' is a ' function ' ) :
package testing { public function fib( n ) { if ( n <= 1 ) return 1 ; else return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 ) ; } public native function fib2 ( n:int ) :int ; [ forth ( word = " forth_fib3 " ) ] public native function fib3 ( n:int ) : int ; }
Notice the forth ( word = " forth_fib3 " ) metadata annotation .
This tells the asc.jar compiler that the following native function is implemented in Forth by the word forth_fib3 rather than in JavaScript or C.
I placed this code in ' fib.as ' in the ' shell ' subdirectory and modified ' shell.py ' to build it in exactly the same manner as my previous article .
The forth_fib3 word needs to be written .
The Tamarin Tracing Forth compiler is implemented in ' utils / fc.py ' .
It is a ' whole program ' compiler in that it needs to have all Forth files listed on the command line so it can analyse and compile everything .
The invocation of this compiler is done in ' core / builtin.py ' .
This means any Forth extensions really need to be added to the ' core ' subdirectory and build files .
I added a ' core / fib3.fs ' as follows :
: fib3 ( n -- n ) DUP 1 <= IF DROP 1 ELSE DUP 1 - fib3 SWAP 2 - fib3 + THEN ; EXTERN : forth_fib3 ( obj n argc=1 -- int ) DROP NIP fib3 ibox ;
The forth_fib3 word is implemented using EXTERN : .
This marks it as a word that is an available entry point by external code .
The arguments it receives on the stack will be ( obj arg1 arg2 argn argc=n -- result ) .
In the fibonacci case there is one argument , the number passed to fib .
The argc argument is the count of the number of arguments provided , in this case 1 .
The bottom argument on the stack is the object the method is called on .
Since our fib function is ' global ' and not part of an object this is not used hence the NIP to remove it .
Note that the stack effect names ( the obj , n , argc=1 , etc ) are for documentation purposes and are not used by the compiler at all - just like most other Forth systems ) .
So forth_fib3 removes the argc and obj arguments and uses just ' n ' .
It calls a helper function ' fib ' which does the actual fibonacci calcuation , leaving the result of that on the stack .
The call to ' ibox ' tags the final result as an integer number .
' fib ' is a pretty standard Forth implementation of fibonacci .
It uses IF / ELSE / THEN to do the testing of the number .
IF / ELSE / THEN is implemented by the Forth compiler directly ( fc.py ) since the Tamarin Tracing Forth system does n't have parsing words .
' core / builtin.py ' needs to be modified to include ' fib3.fs ' as an argument to the compiler :
os.system ( " ../utils/fc.py - c vm_fpu prim.fs fpu.fs vm.fs e4x.fs fib3.fs " )
There are multiple invocations of the compiler for different variants of the virtual machine ( without fpu , minimal VM , full VM , etc ) .
Each of these should be changed .
Running ' core / builtin.py ' will compile the Forth code and generate the necessary code .
Follow this up with running ' shell / shell.py ' to compile the fib.as and other code and build Tamarin Tracing as per my previous article .
Some simple test code :
import testing .*; print ( " fib3 30 = " + fib3 ( 30 ) ) ;
With equivalent test functions for the other implementations of fib you can compare the different runtimes :
$ time shell / avmshell fib.abc fib 30 = 1346269 real 0m0.298s user 0m0.252s sys 0m0.032s $ time shell / avmshell fib2.abc fib2 30 = 1346269 real 0m0.063s user 0m0.024s sys 0m0.028s $ time shell / avmshell fib3.abc fib3 30 = 1346269 real 0m0.192s user 0m0.144s sys 0m0.024s
As can be seen in the times the C implementation smokes the other two with the Forth code being faster than the JavaScript code .
The Forth implementation has features I have n't explored in this article .
This includes different ways of declaring words to take advantage of various optimisations and automatic generation of superwords .
It is a ' static ' Forth compiler in that it does n't allow the execution of Forth words at parse or compile time so features like parsing words , CREATE DOES > , interactive development , etc are not available .
This makes the implementation of Forth words a bit more verbose than in more full featured Forth implementations .
If you have any tips on using Forth in Tamarin Tracing please leave a comment .
I 'm keen to see more features of the Forth system is use .
A little more than three years ago there was a thread in comp.lang.lisp about what people were working on in Common Lisp .
I found the replies , some summarized here , quite inspirational ; they were from people doing practical stuff ( even Real Work ) with Common Lisp , beyond things like going through Project Euler or doing exercises from SICP .
( Not that those are n't fine things to do , but . )
Let 's update this .
What are you using Common Lisp for in 2008 ?
What are you using to do it ?
I 'll start :
I mostly use Common Lisp to make graphics toys at Wigflip.com .
To that end I 'm always looking for new ways to produce or consume graphics - related things .
For example , I 'm adding support for processing OpenType fonts to ZPB - TTF and making a hybrid of Skippy and Vecto to produce simple vector - oriented animations .
I 'd also like to add APNG support to ZPNG .
I primarily use SBCL on Linux , x86 and x86 - 64 , with Emacs and SLIME .
For deploying all my website stuff I use Edi-ware extensively : Hunchentoot , HTML - TEMPLATE , and CL - WHO .
I use CLSQL for a few things too .
For graphics work , I use mostly my own libraries .
How about you ?
Leave a comment and let me know .
If you ’ve been working as a professional software developer for some time , you must have come across a “ Spec Coder ” .
Spec Coders are usually well - educated , have good grades and know every detail about dozens of specs .
Frequently , they come with social skills well above the level of the average ( nerdy ) coder .
They are – therefore – a human resource manager ’s dream .
Alas , what they ca n’t do is write decent code , I mean , readable , reusable , efficient , elegant code .
Sure , they ’ve read “ Kernighan & Ritchie ” and they might have taken a three - day Java course , but between their excellent domain knowledge and their ( basic ) knowledge of a programming language is a big gap in every Spec Coder : a total lack of design capabilities due to a total lack of passion for software development .
This lack of passion clearly shows in their “ if - this - do - that - else - do - another - thing ” style of programming .
You wo n’t find abstractions , base classes , function pointers , recursion .
Just a plain translation of boring spec words into code that sucks .
Here ’s an example .
Let ’s assume our Spec Coder is assigned the task to write some code for a file system and that THE SPEC says :
3.2 File selection behavior
…
After selecting a file , the file ’s record marker shall be undefined , except for ‘ blue ’ files , in which case the record marker shall point to the first file record .
…
Our Spec Coder will immediately turn this into code like this ( do n’t worry about the use of global variables here – it ’s just an example ) :
void SetCurrentFile ( FILE_REF ref , FILE_TYPE type ) { ... g_CurrentFile = ref ; if ( type != FILE_TYPE_BLUE ) { //
Record marker undefined .
g_CurrentRecord = - 1 ; } else { //
Record marker at first record .
g_CurrentRecord = 0 ; } ... } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 void SetCurrentFile ( FILE_REF ref , FILE_TYPE type ) { . . .
g_CurrentFile = ref ; if ( type != FILE_TYPE_BLUE ) { //
Record marker undefined .
g_CurrentRecord = - 1 ; } else { //
Record marker at first record .
g_CurrentRecord = 0 ; } . . . }
So far so good , at least until someday THE SPEC gets extended ( obviously by a non-programmer ) :
3.2 File selection behavior
…
After selecting a file , the file ’s record marker shall be undefined , except for ‘ blue ’ files , in which case the record marker shall point to the first file record .
If the file system is in state ‘ raw ’ , the record marker shall always be undefined .
…
Again , the Spec Coder will directly translate this to code :
... g_CurrentFile = ref ; if ( type != FILE_TYPE_BLUE ) { g_CurrentRecord = - 1 ; } else { g_CurrentRecord = 0 ; } if ( g_FileSysMode == FILE_MODE_RAW ) { g_CurrentRecord = - 1 ; } ... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 . . .
g_CurrentFile = ref ; if ( type != FILE_TYPE_BLUE ) { g_CurrentRecord = - 1 ; } else { g_CurrentRecord = 0 ; } if ( g_FileSysMode == FILE_MODE_RAW ) { g_CurrentRecord = - 1 ; } . . .
How disgusting !
Our Spec
Coder did n’t take the time to refactor the code logic according to the new requirement .
In fact , a typical Spec Coder would n’t even think that refactoring this code was a sensible thing to do .
Why ?
Because there would n’t be a 1:1 mapping between the code and THE SPEC anymore .
Arrrgh !
Any true software developer would have jumped at the chance .
A true software developer would have mentally rephrased THE SPEC to read “ A file ’s record marker is always undefined , except for ‘ blue ’ files when the system state is not ‘ raw ' ” :
... g_CurrentFile = ref ; g_CurrentRecord = ( g_FileSysMode != FILE_MODE_RAW && type == FILE_TYPE_BLUE ) ?
0 : - 1 ; ... 1 2 3 4 . . .
g_CurrentFile = ref ; g_CurrentRecord = ( g_FileSysMode != FILE_MODE_RAW
&& type == FILE_TYPE_BLUE ) ?
0 : - 1 ; . . .
This code is definitely more efficient and readable .
If you do n’t like the ternary operator , just use an if - else statement ( are you a Spec Coder , by any chance ? ) :
... g_CurrentFile = ref ; g_CurrentRecord = - 1 ; if ( g_FileSysMode != FILE_MODE_RAW && type == FILE_TYPE_BLUE ) { g_CurrentRecord = 0 ; } ... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . . .
g_CurrentFile = ref ; g_CurrentRecord = - 1 ; if ( g_FileSysMode != FILE_MODE_RAW
&& type == FILE_TYPE_BLUE ) { g_CurrentRecord = 0 ; } . . .
Are Spec Coder ’s really dangerous ?
I think so !
Because of their attitude , with every change they make , the code gets slightly more complicated – little by little – until it ’s such a mess nobody understands anymore .
Once the critical mass is reached , even otherwise decent developers tend to implement their changes by adding little “ ifs ” here and there .
But there is another problem with Spec Coder ’s :
It is usually difficult to get rid of them , because their usually good spec knowledge makes them indispensable for a company .
Weird , is n’t it ?
BERKELEY , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- Shareholders of Yahoo Inc. are now being confronted by Carl Icahn and the slate of directors he has to replace the current board .
The thinking is that the company 's directors screwed up an opportunity to sell to Microsoft Corp .
I 've looked over the current directors of Yahoo and Icahn 's proposed replacements .
Here 's what I think of them , keeping in mind that to be on this board it might be useful if you knew something ( anything ) about computers and the Internet .
In some cases , I seriously doubt that the person named even knows how to turn on a computer .
The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past It ? Sept. 15 , 1998 by Robin Hanson
Humanity seems to have a bright future , i.e. , a non-trivial chance of expanding to fill the universe with lasting life .
But the fact that space near us seems dead now tells us that any given piece of dead matter faces an astronomically low chance of begating such a future .
There thus exists a great filter between death and expanding lasting life , and humanity faces the ominous question : how far along this filter are we ?
Combining standard stories of biologists , astronomers , physicists , and social scientists would lead us to expect a much smaller filter than we observe .
Thus one of these stories must be wrong .
To find out who is wrong , and to inform our choices , we should study and reconsider all these areas .
For example , we should seek evidence of extraterrestrials , such as via signals , fossils , or astronomy .
But contrary to common expectations , evidence of extraterrestrials is likely bad ( though valuable ) news .
The easier it was for life to evolve to our stage , the bleaker our future chances probably are .
Introduction
The Great Silence must force us to revise a standard view in one or more area of biology , astronomy , physics , or the social sciences .
And some of these revisions strongly suggest that humanity be much more wary of possible disasters .
To clarify these points , this paper will first review how our standard understandings in these areas would lead us not to expect a Great Silence , and will then consider a variety of possible revisions we might consider .
Life Will Colonize
Similarly , humanity has continued to advance technologically , and to fill new geographic and economic niches as they become technologically feasible .
For example , while imperial China closed itself to exploration for a time , other competing peoples , such as in Europe , eventually filled the gap .
This phenomena is easily understood from an evolutionary perspective .
In general , it only takes a few individuals of one species to try to fill an ecological niche , even if all other life is uninterested .
And mutations that encourage such trials can be richly rewarded .
Similarly , we expect internally - competitive populations of our surviving descendants to continue to advance technologically , and to fill new niches as they become technologically and economically feasible .
Colonization has been a consistent experience with life on Earth over the long run , and our best understanding of human social systems suggests this will continue .
While humans evolve within complex co-evolving organizational , cultural , memetic , and genetic systems , all of these systems show long - term tendencies to make use of reproductively - useful resources .
Thus we should expect that , when such space travel is possible , some of our descendants will try to colonize first the planets , then the stars , and then other galaxies .
And we should expect such expansion even when most our descendants are content to navel - gaze , fear competition from colonists [ Benford 81 ] , fear contact with aliens , or want to preserve the universe in its natural state .
At least we should expect this as long as a society is internally - competitive enough to allow many members to have and act on alternative views .
After all , even navel - gazing virtual reality addicts will likely want more and more mass and energy ( really negentroy ) to build and run better computers , and should want to spread out to mitigate local disasters [ Zuckerman 85 ] .
A million years is a cosmologically short period , yet it is much more than enough for historic population growth rates (> .001 % /yr. ) to overwhelm fundamental physical limits on the amount of computation possible within the observable universe [ Zaslavskii 96 ] .
This remains true even using black holes for negentropy and quantum computers for computation , each of which squares the available resources relative to standard approaches .
Thus we have good reasons to expect unused resources to be colonized on cosmological time scales , even if we find other civilizations to communicate with or to " teleport to " [ Scheffer 94 ] .
Evolutionary theory even suggests [ Hansson & Stuart 90 ] that competitive pressures among colonists should encourage a maximum feasible economic growth rate , as those who travel too slow , linger too long , or choose not to replicate [ Stephenson 79 ] become outnumbered by others .
Increasingly fast and high risk colonization probes may be sent on increasingly long journeys , all for a chance at being the first to colonize vast virgin territory .
Technically , such space colonization seems feasible , even if it is well beyond our current abilities , since even now we can envision the enabling technologies .
Slow self - sufficient interstellar boats would be nearly feasible now , if we were rich enough to construct them .
And fast less - than - kilogram - sized [ Forward 85,87 ] self - reproducing [ Tipler 80 ] nanotech - based [ Drexler 92b ] space - traveling machine intelligences ( artificial or uploaded [ Hanson 94 ] ) seem possible within a few centuries .
There are no obvious limits to spacecraft speed ( other than lightspeed ) , given sufficient resources .
And with full ( nanotech - based ) control over the atomic structure of matter [ Drexler 92a ] , colonists should mainly be interested in the atoms and negentroy they can extract from a colonization site [ Dyson 66,79 ] , and the convenience of its location .
The Data Point
We expect such an explosion to fill most every available niche containing usable mass or negentroy resources .
And even if the most valuable resources are between the stars or at galactic centers , we expect some of our descendants to make use of most all the matter and energy resources they can economically reach , including those in " backwater " solar systems like ours and those near us .
Once an explosion goes beyond the scale where a single disaster , such as a supernovae , could destroy it , to become a " lasting " explosion of advanced life , it should only be stopped by meeting another explosion of similarly - advanced life .
After that , if disaster befalls some long - established colony , others should soon return to try again .
Without FTL travel to mediate conformity , we would also not be surprised by a great diversity among the different parts of an explosion , and especially among different explosions [ Hoerner 78 ] .
We would expect , for example , different cultures , languages , and body form details .
We expect much less diversity , however , regarding choices which would put a civilization or entity at a strong competitive reproductive disadvantage .
For example , while one can imagine predatory probes sent to search and destroy other life [ Brin 83 ] , it is harder to understand why such probes would not also aggressively colonize the systems they visited , if such colonization were cheap .
Aggressive colonization would give them all the more probes to work with , and deny resources to competitors .
If this colonization effort could hide its origins from those who might retaliate , what would they have to lose ?
Similarly , while some groups might plausibly leave some places " fallow " as information - generating " nature preserves " [ Fogg 87 ] , it is much harder to imagine that most places would be so preserved .
There should be diminishing returns to such information , and groups that use more of their resources should be at a competitive advantage .
And given the vastness of space , substantial resources should be required to keep " poachers " from slipping in to colonize such a preserve .
Finally , we expect advanced life to substantially disturb the places it colonizes .
Whenever natural systems are not ideally structured to support colonists , we expect changes to be made .
And unless ideal structures always either closely mimic natural appearances or are effectively invisible , we expect advanced life to make visible changes .
For example , it only takes a small amount of nuclear waste dropped into to visibly change its spectra [ Whitmire & Wright 80 . ]
And a civilization might convert enough of a star 's asteroids into orbiting solar - energy collectors to collect a substantial fraction of this star 's output , thereby substantially changing the star 's spectral , temporal , and spatial appearances .
Even more advanced colonists may disassemble stars [ Criswell 85 ] or enclose them in Dyson spheres well within a million years of arrival .
Galaxies may even be restructured wholesale [ Dyson 66 ] .
If such advanced life had substantially colonized our planet , we would know it by now .
We would also know it if they had restructured most of our solar system 's asteroid belt ( though much smaller colonies could be hard to detect [ Papagiannis 78 ] ) .
And they certainly have n't disassembled Jupiter or our sun .
We should even know it if they had aggressively colonized most of the nearby stars , but left us as a " nature preserve " .
Our planet and solar system , however , do n't look substantially colonized by advanced competitive life from the stars , and neither does anything else we see .
To the contrary , we have had great success at explaining the behavior of our planet and solar system , nearby stars , our galaxy , and even other galaxies , via simple " dead " physical processes , rather than the complex purposeful processes of advanced life .
Given how similar our galaxy looks to nearby galaxies , it would even be hard to see how our whole galaxy could be a " nature preserve " among substantially - restructured galaxies .
These considerations strongly suggest that no civilization in our past universe has reached such an " explosive " point , to become the source of a light speed expansion of thorough colonization .
( That is , no civilization within the past light cone of a million years ago for us ; see Technical Appendix below ) .
Much follows from this one important data point [ Hart 75 , Tipler 80 ] .
The Great Filter
The right star system ( including organics ) Reproductive something ( e.g. RNA ) Simple ( prokaryotic ) single - cell life Complex ( archaeatic & eukaryotic ) single - cell life Sexual reproduction Multi-cell life Tool - using animals with big brains
Where we are now Colonization explosion
The fact that our universe seems basically dead suggests that it is very very hard for advanced explosive lasting life to arise .
And if there are other radically different paths to expanding lasting life [ Shapiro & Feinberg 82 ] , that only makes the problem worse , by implying that the filter along our path must be even larger .
Someone 's Story is Wrong
Together these plausible explanations have persuaded countless teams to construct relatively high estimates of the probability that any one planet will eventually produce intelligent life such as ourselves , by estimating relatively low values for each filter term in the famous " Drake Equation " [ ] .
Similarly , technological " optimists " have taken standard economic trends and our standard understanding of evolutionary processes to argue the plausibility of the story I gave above , that our descendants have a decent chance of colonizing our solar system and then , with increasingly fast and reliable technologies of space travel , colonizing other stars and galaxies .
If so , our descendants have a foreseeable chance of reaching such an explosive point within a cosmologically short time ( say a million years ) .
Of course many other folks do n't consider this scenario particularly " optimistic " - they prefer that our descendants choose a more stable path , less likely to " disturb the universe " .
But I will continue to use the word " optimistic " to describe this scenario , because even fans of stability should be concerned about the implications of humanity not living long enough or free enough to have even a one in a million chance , for example , that any descendant of ours will escape to colonize space .
It would seem that any reasonably non-pessimistic scenario would include a non-trivial chance that at least some of our descendants will choose the explosive path over the next million years .
While all of these stories are at least minimally plausible , our main data point implies that at least one of these plausible stories is wrong -- one or more of these steps is much more improbable than it otherwise looks .
If it is one of our past steps , such as the development of single - cell life , then we should n't expect to see such independently evolved life anywhere within billions of light years from us .
But if it is a step between here and a choice to explode that is very improbable , we should fear for our future .
At the very least , our potential would have to be much less than it seems .
Optimism ( as defined here ) regarding our future is directly pitted against optimism regarding the ease of previous evolutionary steps .
To the extent those successes were easy , our future failure to explode is almost certain .
Note that this cause for concern has a different basis than the simple statistical arguments of Gott [ Gott 93 ] and Leslie [ Leslie 96 ] that all else equal we should n't expect many more future humans than there have been past humans .
While those arguments should n't be ignored , their strength depends much more on the auxiliary assumptions one makes about other relevant information .
In contrast , the conclusion that the Great Filter is very large is relatively insensitive to other assumptions .
It Matters Who's Wrong
For example , if our prospects are likely bleak we should search out and take especially seriously any plausible scenarios , such as nuclear war or ecological collapse , which might lead to our future inability to explode across the universe .
A long list of such scenarios for concern can be found in [ Leslie 96 ] .
Our main data point , the Great Silence , would be telling us that at least one of these scenarios is much more probable than it otherwise looks .
With such a warning in hand , we might , for example , take extra care to protect our ecosystems , perhaps even at substantial expense to our economic growth rate .
We might be even especially cautious regarding the possibility of world - destroying physics experiments .
And we might place a much higher priority on projects like Biosphere 2 , which may allow some part of humanity to survive a great disaster .
To find out whether such sacrifice is called for , humanity would do well to study this whole area much more carefully , considering all plausible explanations of the Great Filter .
To encourage such study , the rest of this paper will attempt to review the current status of our understanding , considering in turn various possibilities regarding who might be wrong , and the various types of evidence which might clarify the matter .
Reconsidering Biology First , let us review and reconsider our biological expectations , keeping an eye out for prior evolutionary steps which may be more improbable than they look .
Many theoretical stories have been offered to make various prior evolutionary steps seem relatively likely , at least over a long term .
Given the complexity of the subject matter , however , these stories are understandably sketchy .
Thus the simplist way such theories might be wrong is by having ignored some important factors and details .
As a general rule , simple plausible models quite often fail to capture the essence of complex phenomena .
It should also be noted that many biologists expect a large , not small , filter between dead matter and intelligent tool - using life like us .
They have complained that astronomers who estimate Drake equation terms do not know enough biology , and they note in particular that substantial tool use such as we see in humans has only evolved once , and may well be a very unlikely evolutionary accident [ Simpson 64 , Mayr 85,95 ] .
In any case , it turns out that the very idea that a significant portion of the Great Filter might reside in our past evolutionary steps has important implications which can aid us in evaluating this hypothesis [ Carter 83 , Hanson 96 ] .
First , let us distinguish between two different kinds of evolutionary steps .
Let a " discrete " evolutionary step be one which must succeed within certain a short time period ; failure then implies failure forever after .
For example , if a certain type of solar system is required , then success here can only happen when the solar system forms .
In contrast , let a " trial and error " step be something like search across a mostly flat fitness landscape , where failure today does not much affect the chances for success tomorrow .
The main Great Filter implications are regarding trial and error type steps .
Consider a situation where a certain number of trial and error steps must be completed in a certain order within a certain total time window .
That is , for each step there is some constant probability per unit time of completing that step , given that the previous step has been completed .
If the probability of completing all the steps within the time window is low , then it turns out that for the cases where all the steps are in fact completed , the average time to complete each " hard " step is unrelated to how hard that step is !
For example , say you have one hour to pick five locks by trial and error , locks with 1,2,3,4 , and 5 dials of ten numbers , so that the expected time to pick each lock is .01,.1 , 1 , 10 , and 100 hours respectively .
Then just looking at those rare cases when you do pick all five locks in the hour , the average time to pick the first two locks would be .0096 and .075 hours respectively , close to the usual expected times of .01 and .1 hours .
The average time to pick the third lock , however , would be .20 hours , and the average time for the other two locks , and the average time left over at the end , would be .24 hours .
That is , conditional on success , all the hard steps , no matter how hard , take about the same time , while easy steps take about their usual time ( see Technical Appendix ) .
And all these step durations ( and the time left over ) are roughly exponentially distributed ( with standard deviation at least 76 % of the mean ) .
( Models where the window closing is also random give similar results . )
We can apply this model to the evolution of life on Earth , by examining the fossil record for roughly equally spaced apparent major innovations .
Such an analysis can complement other attempts to find hard steps by intrinsic difficulty , necessity , and uniqueness in evolutionary history , such as attempted in [ Barrow & Tipler 86 ]
The fossil record shows about five roughly - equal periods between major evolutionary changes since the Earth was formed [ Schopf 92 , Skelton 93 ] .
Specifically , the earliest known clear fossils of simple single - cell life appeared 0.9 billion years after the earth cooled ( 4.5 billion years ago ) , though other evidence suggests life after only 0.5 billion years [ Balter 96 ] ) .
The earlist known large complex single - cell fossils ( " eukaryotic " in appearance ) then appear about 2.0 billion years after this early evidence .
0.8 billion years later the tempo of evolution picked up dramatically , perhaps with the invention of sex [ Schopf 95 ] , and then 0.5 billion years later we see the first substantial fossils of multi-cellular life [ Knoll 95 ] .
Finally , 0.6 billion more years brings us to where we are today .
While these periods are not exactly equal , they are roughly consistent with the ( roughly exponential ) distribution of actual durations between hard steps predicted by the above model of trial and error steps .
Some important complications and caveats , however , must be considered .
First , assuming the first step happened on Earth , all we really know is that it must have happened sometime between when the Earth cooled enough to support life , and the age of the the earliest known fossils , which also happen to be the earliest known rocks where one could possibly see such fossils .
Thus all we can say is that this first step took between 0.0 and about 0.5 billion years .
And since the environment of early Earth was unusual , there may have been a special window of opportunity within which several discrete steps took place .
Second , the appearance of the earliest known large complex single - cell fossils corresponds closely with Earth 's transition to an oxygen - dominated atmosphere , a transition which seems to have been awaiting the slow oxidation of all the ocean 's iron .
Since eukaryotes need oxygen to breathe , they likely could not have been widespread before this point .
Thus a hard trial - and - error step likely did not happen at this point in time .
One or more hard steps might have taken place before this , however , within populations too small to show up in the fossil record .
The " potential " created by these hard steps might have required an environmental change in order to " flower " .
Third , the famous Cambrian explosion of about 0.6 billion years ago was also simultaneous with some independent environmental changes , such as the breaking up of a supercontinent and the end of the Earth 's worst ice age ever .
If we think of environmental event as random , we can model this as a double biological / environmental hard step :
Some biological hard step first created a potential , a potential which could not be realized without a compatible later environmental hard step .
Finally , brain size relative to body size has been increasing somewhat steadily for both mammals and birds ever since the mass extinction of 65 million years ago ( most likely also caused by an external event such as an asteroid ) eliminated the dinosaur competition [ Russell 83 , Jerison 91 ] .
Thus if large brains were the most recent hard step then this step would have to be placed at least about 0.3 billion years ago , where we find the most recent common ancestor of mammals and birds soon after the invention of the Amniote egg ( which allowed animals to colonize land ) [ Ostrom 92 ] .
Alternatively , perhaps the most recent hard step was the development of a language potential in mammals , and not in birds , a potential which was n't exploited until brains got large enough .
( Mayr seems to think birds were not up to the task [ Mayr 85 ] ) .
Putting all this together , a better guess of the hard steps would be as follows .
First one or more hard steps happened within the first 0.5 billion years after Earth cooled .
Then zero or more hard steps happened while waiting for the ocean 's iron to oxidize .
Next , one or more hard steps occurred over the next 0.8 billion years , the last of which ( perhaps the invention of sex or perhaps of archaeatic cells ) finally released the potential to affect the fossil record about 1.2 billion years ago .
A double biological / environmental step then occurred over the next 0.5 billion years to create widespread multi-celled life , and then 0.3 billion years later a hard step of the invention of the Amniote egg occured .
Finally , over the last 0.3 billion years , there have either been no hard steps , just the steady working out of new possibilities , or there has been a single or double hard step , something like the invention of a mammal language potential , which required a random ( but perhaps not hard ) environmental event 65 million years ago to begin to be released .
A typical expected hard step duration of about 0.3 billion years seems a simple fit to this data .
And with this fit , it is then natural to estimate one life hard step at the beginning , then zero to eight steps leading to complexity , two to three steps leading to sex , a double step to society , a single cradle step , and then perhaps a final language step .
Overall , we might estimate a total of roughly seven to nine hard steps here .
This model suggests a number of predictions which may help confirm or disconfirm it .
For example , this model predicts that the expected time remaining until the window of opportunity for life on Earth closes is about 0.3 billion years [ Carter 83 ] .
This model could therefore be confirmed by astronomical analysis regarding expected durations until the Earth suffers a runaway greenhouse effect , runaway glaciation , too high an oxygen content for land life to persist , a serious instability in the sun , a nearby supernovae , a massive asteroid impact , or by some other disaster ahead in the sun 's travels through the galaxy [ Barrow & Tipler 86 , Leslie 96 ] .
This model also implies that as long as some evolutionary step took sufficiently long , the actual time taken does not indicate how hard the step was .
Thus we 'll have to use other cues to find the hardest steps among the hard ones .
Finally , this model strongly suggests that our ancestors passed through at most one hard trial and error step in the last hundred million years .
This last step might , however , have required some special conjunction of features , such as large brains and good hands , to appear in the same animal at once .
( These further predictions of this model have not been published elsewhere , to my knowledge . )
To these roughly nine biological hard steps we might add two other discrete ( random but not trial and error ) type steps : an initial step of getting the right sort of planet around the right sort of star , and a final step of humanity either succeeding or destroying itself soon .
Together , these eleven steps could explain the Great Filter if the ( logarithmic ) average filter per step was at least a factor of one hundred .
That is , either there might be , on average , a one percent chance of passing a discrete step , or about a thirty billion years expected time to complete a trial and error step .
Of course the Great Filter need not be distributed evenly among these steps - just how much of the filter rests in the last step is the ominous question that motivates our analysis .
The recent evidence of simple single - cell Mars life [ McKay et. al. 96 ] is relevant for reconsidering the steps prior to single - cell life .
If there really was single - cell life early in Mars ' history , and if we find that it was different enough to imply that it probably evolved independently from life on Earth , then unless Earth and Mars shared some special unusual environment , the total step from dead matter around the right sort of star to simple single - cells must be pretty easy .
Future optimism would then have to be based on other past steps .
If life evolved on one of these planets and was spread to the other via a local panspermia , then we do n't know much more than we did before .
But if single - cell life started before our solar system , and spread here via a wider panspermia [ Crick 73 , Weber & Greenberg ] , then that could help .
It would allow there to have been many more trial and error hard steps taking perhaps ten billion years .
This seems especially plausible given the amazing complexity of the earliest life we see , and that this life has survived virtually unchanged to this very day .
This wider panspermia scenario also allows steps prior to our single - cell life to be more improbable for any one region of space , but at the expense of making the next step that much more probable , by providing more places for it to start from .
Wide panspermia of complex single - cell life could also be possible , but seems less likely given that such life seems less robust to extreme environments , and more tuned to Earth 's environment [ Crick 81 ] .
Radio signals from extraterrestrial intelligences would of course be strong information regarding the size of the entire filter up to the point where such signals are possible .
Not only would this information help pin down our biological expectations , but it would also seem to be bad news regarding our explosive future .
And the nearer such signals originated , the worse this news would be ( though see the zoo - hypothesis discussion below ) .
Conversely , negative findings would be good news , and the prospect of this should encourage such research .
Note this is the opposite of the usual justification offered by SETI researchers , who usually focus on the valuable information extraterrestrials might send us .
Research into SETI and the evolution of life does much more than satisfy intellectual curiosity - it offers us uniquely long - term information about humanity 's future .
Reconsidering AstroPhysics
There are also several ways in which we might reconsider our understanding of physics and astronomy to help explain the Great Filter .
One possibility is that fast space travel and colonization between stars and galaxies is much harder than it looks , and effectively impossible , even for nanotech - based machine intelligence .
The interstellar medium , for example , may be much harsher than we realize .
This would suggest we have good chances of surviving , but little prospect of leaving our solar system at any substantial speed .
The slower the maximum speed , the smaller is the Great Filter that needs to be explained .
Another possibility is that the universe is very much smaller than it looks , perhaps because of some non-trivial topology , so that our past light cone contains much less than it seems .
This would also reduce the size of the Great Filter needing to be explained .
Perhaps the most optimistic physics alternative is that it is relatively easy to create local " baby universes " with unlimited mass and negentroy , and that the process for doing this very consistently prevents ordinary space colonists from escaping the area , perhaps via a local supernovae - scale explosion .
The amount of the Great Filter this could explain would depend on just how consistently such escaping colonists are prevented .
There are also three " save stellar appearances " astrophysics alternatives which could explain why an apparently dead universe is really alive , with our system an isolated " zoo " [ Ball 73 ] .
First , large - scale engineering such as orbiting solar collectors made from asteroids , Dyson spheres , and stellar disassembling might be effectively impossible , explaining why nearby stars look so natural .
Second , structures that best use such resources might happen to almost always preserve natural spectra and other appearances .
Third , our understanding of astrophysics might just be very wrong , so that the apparently dead stars and galaxies around us really are very alive .
Yet another possibility is that advanced life mainly colonizes " dark matter " , mainly leaving fallow the stars and other ordinary matter we see .
This scenario would require a stronger version of the zoo social hypothesis , which I call a " common zoo " , discussed below .
Our understanding of dark matter as simple dead matter is progressing rapidly , however , and may soon help confirm or deny this possibility .
Recent gravitational lensing observations [ Bennett , et. al. 96 ] indicate that about half ( and perhaps all ) of the dark matter in our galactic halo consists of objects from one solar mass to one tenth this , and relatively little is in the range below this down to Earth size objects .
The smallest independent object in this range yet seen , a brown dwarf of 20 - 50 Jupiter masses , has an understandable Jupiter - like spectra [ Savage , Sahli , & Villard 95 ] .
Rethinking Social Theories
I personally think that most of the Great Filter is most likely to be explained by the steps I think we understand the least about : the steps in the biological evolution of life and intelligence .
However , many physical scientists focus on explaining the filter via the area they seem to think we understand the least : social science .
Astronomers Sagan and Newman , for example , claim that either we will destroy outselves with nuclear weapons , or learn to " live with other groups in mutual respect " by losing " our own predispositions to territoriality and aggression .
...
This adaptation must apply ... with very high precision , to ... every individual within the civilization " , so that we become the " least likely to engage in aggressive galactic imperialism " [ Sagan & Newman ] .
Similarly , Papagiannis claims that " those that manage to overcome their innate tendencies toward continuous material growth and replace them with non-material goals will be the only ones to survive this crisis , " implying a galaxy " populated by stable highly ethical and spiritual civilizations " [ Papagiannis 84 ] .
And Stephenson claims that " for a truly advanced intelligence the drive for quality rather than redundant quantity would be paramount " [ Stephenson 82 ] .
Now of course if a substantial fraction of civilizations followed such scenarios , these theories could explain a small part of the Great Filter .
But to explain a substantial part of the Great Filter , such scenarios would have to follow from situations like ours with a very high reliability .
While this is logically possible , these authors offer no reasons for expecting such a situation .
These theories thus seem more like wishful thinking than serious attempts to explain the phenomena using our best understanding of the social sciences .
To the contrary , while one expects temporarily powerful groups to have temporarily stronger tendencies toward both colonization and combat aggressiveness , controlling for this there is no known correlation between these factors , nor any known theoretical reason to expect such a correlation .
And even if a one - time event did select for low colonization tendencies , we would expect stronger tendencies to eventually be selected back if variation was still allowed .
Social scientists have good reasons for expecting competitive populations to both generically fill new niches , and to shy away from wars with severe consequences , and social scientists who have considered the subject have expected substantial interstellar migration [ Finney & Jones 85 ] .
Given the confusion this topic seems to produce , it seems worth mentioning that one should n't put great hopes on the idea that now that we have control over genetic processes , intelligence can free itself of " biological imperatives " and choose new purposes .
Crabgrass does not colonize because it has a purpose to fulfill a biological imperative .
Biological organisms have always been free to pursue whatever purposes they want , and to invent new ones .
The point is that in general the creatures whose purposes lead to the most reproduction end up dominating the future .
Similarly , human control over genetics will change the way variation is encoded , and greatly speed up the variation process , but will by itself not let humans escape the basic evolutionary process of variation and selection .
Avoiding this process would require global control over reproduction , implying at least a strong world government regulating child - bearing , local economic growth , and even the spread of ideas , with a political process undemocratic enough to avoid variation and selection working through the political process .
The following social hypotheses , though still seemingly unlikely , are at least minimally plausible and are at least grounded in our understanding of social science .
The most pessimistic social scenarios are scenarios like massive nuclear war or ecological disaster .
Such devastating war would likely need to be prior to dispersal across the solar system , unless it could destroy our sun .
And an ecological failure would need to be prior to an ability to transcend our biological inheritance , such as via machine intelligence ( uploaded or artificial ) .
It seems possible , though unlikely , that only one in a million worlds at our stage avoids such a fate .
While even this would still leave most of the Great Filter to be explained in some other way , the prospect of such a possibility is a strong motivation for studying the Great Filter .
A related scenario would be some sort of unspecified social collapse , of the sort that lead to the fall of a variety of relatively isolated ancient civilizations ( such as Easter Island ) , only much more severe , so that nothing was left to rise from the ashes and try again .
When we better understand these historical events , perhaps we will be in a better position to dismiss this possibility .
A devastation scenario is implicit in the usual formulation of the Drake equation .
For prior evolutionary steps the equation asks for the probability that the system will reach the next step , but at our level of evolution , the equation asks for the expected time until the civilization disappears , and once gone it is assumed to never return .
Another approach to alternative social theories is to note that if our descendants are no longer sufficiently internally competitive , the evolutionary model need no longer apply .
For example , if one is willing to assume a closed universe and that FTL travel out from an explosion point is possible , one might hypothesize that the first civilization anywhere to reach an explosion point happened to have a strong stable central government ( like Imperial China ) which placed a very high ideosynchratic value on preserving the natural appearance of the universe [ Freiheit 93 , Crawford 95 ] .
By being first and spread out very fast , these conservationists might enforce their preferences on all late - comers .
The FTL could be via a " warp " drive , as in [ Alcubierre 94 ] .
Constructed wormholes would not be sufficient to expand faster than lightspeed , because the hole ends must move normally .
Pre-existing " long " wormholes might be sufficient though .
Without FTL travel , a conservationist scenario would require that a strong vast majority of civilizations somehow obtain a conservationist preference , and that a conservationist policy not put a leave - it - be conservationist civilization at a substantial military disadvantage to pave - it - over competitors .
The average size and density of non-conservationist powers would also need to not conflict with our apparent lack of observing such differing cosmological regions .
No special social theory would be required for a " zoo " hypothesis [ Ball 73 ] which is bundled with one of the astrophysics alternatives listed above which would imply that aggressively colonized systems look just like natural ones .
It is natural enough to suppose that some small fraction of places would be left as nature preserves .
One seems to need a special social theory , however , to explain a " common zoo " hypothesis , that most all matter visible to us has been set aside as nature preserve .
The common patterns of visible matter across the observable universe would have to be explained by a remarkably common preferences for the density and nature of such preserves , and a common lack of preference for any visible partially - restructured " gardens " .
There would also need to be a remarkably widely coordinated effort to punish deviant powers who might attempt to send radio signals or self - reproducing probes to such wildlife preserve stars .
Consider , for example , that the energy of a single star might power an intermittent very narrow - band signal detectable to pre-explosive life like ours across the entire universe [ Gott 82 ] .
I mention this common zoo hypothesis not because I find it especially plausible , but because it is among the most plausible scenario I can construct without also invoking astrophysics alternatives like FTL travel .
It thus illustrates the extremes required to construct self - consistent purely social explanations of the Great Filter .
Conclusion
To support optimism regarding our future , we must find especially improbable past evolutionary steps .
And in fact we can find a number of plausible candidates for groups of hard trial - and - error biological steps : life , complexity , sex , society , cradle and language .
Presuming there are about nine hard steps total here , the Great Filter could be explained if the expected time for each of these steps averaged ( logarithmically ) to about thirty billion years , if only one percent of stars could support such steps , and if we have only about a one percent chance of not destroying ourselves soon ( or permanently banning colonization ) .
While one might also explain parts of the Great Filter via unusual approaches to astrophysics or social science , such assumptions seem less plausible to me than thirty billion year expected times for the identified biological steps .
There is ample room for disagreement , however .
The larger the remaining filter we face , the more carefully humanity should try to avoid negative scenarios .
To inform such choices , we would do well to analyze all these issues more carefully , and to collect more relevant data .
Fortunately , rapid progress is being made in several relevant empirical areas .
Dark matter astronomy may soon confirm or deny the common zoo hypothesis .
Mars life evidence may soon indicate the ease of the earliest steps in evolving life .
Other progress also continues , at a slower but still encouraging pace .
A wide variety of research continues to illuminate the early history of life on earth .
Theoretical physics is closing in on whether FTL travel is possible .
And speculative engineering is helping to estimate the feasibility of interstellar travel and large scale solar system constructions .
Astronomers and global modelers are working to evaluate how long the Earth should remain hospitable to life ( if we do n't destroy it ) .
And social scientists continue to improve our understanding of what might effect colonization and self - destruction tendencies .
It may not be too long before spacecraft can test theories of wider panspermia , perhaps by looking for single - cell life within comets .
And SETI researchers continue to test the hypothesis that life at our stage is dense , so that we still face an enormous filter .
( They might also consider looking for common - zoo renegade broadcasters from across the universe . )
Finally , we would do well to keep a in mind a few unusual aspects of this Great Filter puzzle .
First , let us keep in mind the interdisciplinary nature of the this puzzle .
While it may comforting for each discipline to claim that the Filter must surely lie in some other discipline of ( in their eyes ) lessor repute , such claims should surely be backed up by detailed analysis using our best understanding of that discipline .
It will no more do for astronomers to simply claim , without further supporting analysis , that people will lose their tendency to colonize , than it would do for biologists to simply declare that astronomers could not possibly know that the universe is as big as they claim .
Second , we must be wary of the " God of the Gaps " phenomena , where miracles are attributed to whatever we do n't understand .
Contrary to the famous drunk looking for his keys under the lamppost , here we are tempted to conclude that the keys must lie in whatever dark corners we have not searched , rather than face the unpleasant conclusion that the keys may be forever lost .
Finally , we should remember that the Great Filter is so very large that it is not enough to just find some improbable steps ; they must be improbable enough .
Even if life only evolves once per galaxy , that still leaves the problem of explaining the rest of the filter : why we have n't seen an explosion arriving here from any other galaxies in our past universe ?
And if we can't find the Great Filter in our past , we 'll have to fear it in our future .

Regarding the data point , consider the cumulative probability F( t , dv ) that a given ( cosmologically co-moving ) volume of space dv will have contained the earliest origin of an evolutionary path that results in an explosion ( arriving ) there by time t since the big bang , and moving out to colonize and visibly alter most of the visible universe .
( More precisely , let this probability be contingent on the universe surviving this long in its familiar physical state , rather than for example suffering a destructive transition to a lower vacuum ground state . )
If these probabilities are independent for small volumes , the expected number of other explosions reaching here by T = the age of universe minus one million years ago is at least the integral of F ( t , dv ) across the surface of a past light cone starting from a million year old event in our history .
Using a homogeneous space approximation ( surely valid on cosmological scales ) , so that F ( t , dv ) = F ( t ) * dv , this is :
Integral from t = 0 to T of 4 pi F ( T - t ) t2 dt
Now consider N hard trial and error steps which must be completed in a certain order within a time window W .
If the probability that step i takes less than time t i is 1 - exp ( - f i *t i ) or about f i *t i for f i *t i small , then assuming all f i * W are small , the joint probability density over the various hard step durations t i is about Product i f i , independent of all t i .
Conditional on Sum i t i < W and all t i > 0 , this distribution therefore treats all i the same , regardless of f i .
Thus conditional on success , all hard steps have roughly the same distribution over durations , regardless of how hard they are .

For months , the White House and Senate Republicans have been content to let a political impasse over vacancies at the Federal Election Commission persist , sidelining the regulatory agency in the throes of a heated presidential campaign .
But on Tuesday , President Bush suddenly announced three new nominees to the commission .
He also backed away from Republicans ’ insistence that the nomination of Hans von Spakovsky , a former Justice Department official who faces vigorous opposition from Democrats , be voted upon with other nominees to the commission .
The reason for the about - face ?
Several Democratic officials familiar with the negotiations and watchdog groups said they believed that Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , had been pressing the White House and Senator Mitch McConnell , the minority leader , to resolve the issue .
Although Mr. McCain has been a longtime champion of campaign finance reform , he also has an urgent pecuniary interest in the matter .
The agency , which monitors compliance of federal election laws , has had only two commissioners out of a normal complement of six for months , leaving it without a quorum and powerless to act .
Without a functioning commission , campaign finance experts said , Mr. McCain ’s ability to collect $ 85 million in federal money for the general election through the country ’s public financing system would be severely complicated .
“ Without an act of the commission , you do n’t get the money , ” said Kenneth Gross , a campaign finance lawyer with Skadden , Arps .

There has been a lot of moaning in the UK press that the Eurovision song contest is rigged .
Specifically that countries are voting for each other in geographical blocs , with little regard for the merit of the songs .
But are they ?
It is hard to see any patterns from looking at a table of voting results :
2008 results from Eurovision.tv , click to enlarge .
So I created a simple visualisation of the data [ 1 ] , similar to one of the approaches I use in my table planner software , PerfectTablePlan .
In this visualisation I draw a line from each country to the country that it gave the highest points to .
The closer the country is geographically , the thicker and bluer the line .

Looking at the diagram , there does appear to be bloc voting going on in the Balkans , Scandinavia & the former Soviet Union .
But what would the voting look like if there was no bloc voting ?
To find out I randomly swapped columns in the table .
For example votes made by the UK I assigned to Belarus and votes made by San Marino [ 2 ]
I assigned to the UK .
So each finalist now has the same number of incoming votes , but from random countries .
Assuming they are voting for the best ( or least awful ) song , not by geography , the results should look similar .
The randomised version looks more , well , random .

These results are suggestive , but not conclusive .
But
If I put the last 3 year ’s results together with their randomised versions , I think there is little doubt that geography is the key factor in determining Eurovision voting patterns .
The actual voting patterns look remarkably similar year - on - year and the difference between the actual and randomised results are quite marked .

Maybe if the western European countries liked each other a bit more , the UK would n’t have come last this year ?
But I ca n’t really see Britain , Spain , France and Germany voting for each other any time soon .
;0 )
Does it really matter whether Eurovision song contest voting is based on merit ?
It certainly wo n’t keep me awake at night .
But I think it is a nice illustration of how you can use simple visualisation techniques ( even something hacked together in a few hours ) to turn raw data into usable information .
The human brain has incredibly powerful visual processing hardware .
Have you optimised your software to run on this platform ?
[ 1 ] I wrote some throwaway code to generate these images in C++ and Qt over a few hours on a wet bank holiday Sunday .
QA amounted to ‘ that looks about right ’ .
[ 2 ] I ’ve never heard of it either – but apparently it gets as many votes as the UK .
ABOUT ASUS ABOUT ASUS • Based : Taipei , Taiwan .

Asus plans to be the No. 3 laptop maker in the world in six years .
Pretty ambitious , considering that many Americans probably have never heard of the Taipei , Taiwan - based company .
Asus ' big goal rides on a tiny product : a hugely successful , itty - bitty laptop called the Eee PC .
It 's a bit larger than a tissue box , weighs just 2 pounds and starts at the bargain - basement price of $ 299 .
There 's nothing quite like it on the market .
Buyers — many of them early adopters — are snapping up Eee PCs almost as fast as Asus can make them .
The company expects to sell nearly 2 million in the first six months of the year .
They 're available at Best Buy , Amazon and many local retailers .
This week , Asus launches a $ 549 version with a bigger screen and more features .
A desktop version is on the way , probably this summer , says Jackie Hsu , president of Asus ' U.S. division .
More Eee products are on the drawing board .
The company has helped create a new type of computer — a laptop that 's both small and inexpensive , says tech analyst Bob O'Donnell at researcher IDC .
Asus made 81 % of the laptops that sold for less than $ 500 last year , but its good times probably wo n't last , O'Donnell says .
Just about every PC maker is considering its own tiny , inexpensive laptop .
That means that little Asus — the No. 9 PC maker in the world — could soon face competition from giants Hewlett - Packard ( HPQ ) , Dell ( DELL ) and Acer , he says .
The market will grow , but not fast enough to generate numerous big successes , O'Donnell says .
" Asus has gained a lot of mindshare … for such a little company .
But they 're going to be under a lot more pressure . "
Big leap for small laptops
The market for sub -$ 500 laptops was marginal until 2007 , when 430,000 were sold , O'Donnell says .
That number is expected to jump to 3.6 million this year , with the vast majority of sales in the USA and Asia .
That 's a surprise .
Cheap , small laptops were rare until a non-profit group , One Laptop Per Child , started cranking out student - size computers in 2007 that sold for about $ 200 .
They were designed for a limited market , mainly schools in developing nations .
So were similar computers from a rival project , Classmate PC .
In the USA , Japan and other developed nations , most small laptops remained high - end business models that sold for a premium .
Lenovo's 2.4 - pound IdeaPad U110 starts at $ 1,899 , while Sony's ( SNE ) 1.2 - pound Vaio UX starts at $ 2,500 , for example .
Asus changed that .
It took the same low - cost model employed by OLPC and used it to create a computer that shoppers in developed countries wanted to buy .
Hsu says few tech - savvy Americans would use the Eee PC as their primary laptop .
One midrange , $ 399 model has a 7 - inch screen and a keyboard that feels cramped to adult hands .
Its 900 - MHz Intel Celeron processor is much less powerful than those found in most laptops .
And its 4 - GB hard drive is only as big as Apple 's ( AAPL ) smallest iPod .
But it 's just fine for e-mail or simple Web surfing — which makes the Eee PC a great backup laptop to take on the road , Hsu says .
It 's also a good gift for kids or elderly parents , he says .
Asus tried to compensate for the Eee PC 's technical shortcomings with an easy - to - use interface that appeals to this audience .
The original Eee PC offered games , Web browsing and other features on a simple screen layout , based on the open - source Linux operating system .
The company later released a version running Microsoft 's Windows XP .
What 's ahead for Asus Asus ' parent company , AsusTek , used to be best known for making motherboards , a crucial if unsexy component in every PC .
AsusTek also manufactured computers for Apple , Sony , Hewlett - Packard and others behind the scenes .
That 's fairly common .
Many brand - name companies focus on design and marketing , and hire outside factories to do at least part of the manufacturing .
AsusTek also sold laptops under its own name .
But that market was limited , partly because its manufacturing customers did n't want the competition .
AsusTek addressed that issue this year by becoming a holding company , with three separate firms underneath .
Pegatron makes components and does manufacturing for other companies .
Unihan makes plastic computer cases and other parts .
And the renamed Asus builds products it sells under its own name , such as the Eee PC .
The change has n't alienated manufacturing customers so far , Hsu says .
" We think it 's OK .
Orders have n't fallen , " he says .
Asus has also rolled out cellphones , Global Positioning Systems ( GPS ) and home networking gear .
It 's considering expanding into any product that combines computing , communications and electronics .
" We want to grow , " Hsu says .
But rivals will soon start moving onto Asus ' turf , says tech analyst Martin Reynolds at researcher Gartner .
One potentially huge threat : Apple .
The company behind the iPod " has been looking really hard at the future , " Reynolds says .
" You could see Apple notebooks getting really low in price . "
It 's unlikely that Asus will be able to win by cutting costs .
Even cheap laptops cost about $ 200 to make , O'Donnell says .
( Asus ' non -Eee laptops sell for an average price of $ 1,250 . )
Hsu , a longtime Asus executive who came to the USA last year , already knows how to sound like an American business leader .
" We hope to see more competitors come in .
We want a big pie , " he says .
The question is how big the pie will get .
O'Donnell says many companies are overestimating it .
But O'Donnell and others agree that the PC market will never be the same again .
" Low - cost laptops are here to stay , " Reynolds says .

In my interview with Don Imus last Wednesday , I finally got around to talking about something I rarely get to – black immigrants .
More on that in a minute .
It ’s amazing how much we fawn over Senator Obama ’s being ‘ black ’ without displaying any interest in that blackness , as if being a half - Kenyan mostly ex-pat tells us all we need to know about him .
All that ’s interesting .
That ’s what I was trying to get at generally in my book , The End of Blackness , and in this infamous piece .
I finally got to it on , of all places , the Don Imus show .
That interview with Imus was so unbelievable , you simply have to listen to it .
Here ’s part 1 and part 2 .
Damned if Imus has n’t been doing yeoman ’s work in moving America ’s neurotic race obsession forward .
I ’ve been talking and writing about race for 12 years now , but I was gobsmacked on the air .
Imus schooled a sister .
When he said he was through apologizing for Rutgers , I took that to mean he was through talking about it .
But he ’s certainly not through thinking about it , and he ’s been doing his homework .
Usually , people have me on for conversations that go like this : “ I ’d really like to know what you think about X race topic . ” [ I attempt to address the question ] .
“ Uh , excuse me , I do n’t mean to interrupt and I really want to know what you think , but what I think is _. ”
Then the person orates for a long time on the dusty , pre-conceived , self - justifying notion they ( black or white , liberal or conservative ) have no intention of changing .
The ‘ question ’ always turns out to be , “ Have n’t I just brilliantly ended the whole race thing ? ”
With rare exceptions , I ’ve long known I ’m invited on by “ enemies ” ( liberals and conservatives , blacks and whites ) as a mere visual aid “ proving ” their open - mindedness .
I might as well be wearing an evening gown , smiling and vamping in the background like Vanna White .
I ’m just window dressing for a soliloquy .
All I can do is hope that somewhere in the audience someone is actually listening , and will actually go back and read what I said and might have talked about if allowed to .
Print interviews with ‘ liberal ’ black journalists ( they ’re really quite conservative ; you must be black in exactly the way they demand ) are the worst .
They already ‘ know ’ I ’m a Tom and talking to me serves two purposes , none of them reportorial : it proves they ’re ‘ objective ’ even though nothing I say or write ever makes a difference and it gives them fodder to dine out on with the other ‘ real ’ black people .
“ You would n’t believe how self - hating she is . ”
They call me names but they do n’t engage in actual debate .
Kneejerk does n’t begin to cover it .
Don seems to have done the impossible and moved beyond that .
Of course , it must be said that Imus sandbagged me .
I was , let ’s say , surprised ’ by the invitation and mulled it over for a week .
When I thought I could be professional and said yes , it was supposed to be about the election and it was supposed to be short .
It was neither ; homey went straight to Black History month , everything I ’d ever written about race , everything in the black canon about race and — unbelievably — Rutgers .
See how The Man is always setting us up ?
Two kids , two books , two cities , and about 15 jobs ago , I wrote a Washington Post column that I can’t now find , pleading for someone in public life to admit to sexism or racism or immorality so that the rest of us could .
Two of my examples where Justice Thomas admitting to having been a pig towards Anita Hill and Rev. Sharpton admitting that he ’d been wrong about Tawana Brawley and paying what he owed to the man whose life and career he ’d ruined with his ultimately false accusations .
Until someone in public life manned up in that way , we ’d all just have to go on lying about our all too human failings , waiting in vain for an example of confession and atonement .
Until then , no one could be forgiven , publicly or privately , for our momentary - ism ’s and we all are guilty of something sometime .
Never thought that person in public life would be Don Imus and damned if the whole forgiving thing is n’t much , much harder than I could have possibly imagined .
What is it they say about being careful what you ask for ?
Offended as I initially was to be asked , I ’m glad I did the show .
He made a mistake , he took responsibility , he asked for forgiveness .
Done , Don .
Now , black immigrants .
At The Root , a new black site from the Washington Post , Meri Danquah , a Ghanaian immigrant , writes all too briefly about the invisibility that black immigrants face in America .
When , that is , they are not facing outright hostility , mostly from slave - descended blacks .
She writes :
… Excited by the fact that I , a newly naturalized citizen , was about to vote for the first time , I asked my editor if he would be supporting Sen.
Barack Obama , my chosen candidate .
“ He does n’t do nothing for me , ” my editor said .
“ When I vote for a black man , I want it to be somebody who ’s really black , somebody who knows the black American experience , somebody whose great - great granddaddy was a slave , like mine .
You know , those Africans come over here and just reap the rewards of everything we ’ve worked for .
They think they ’re better than us and white folks love ’em because they ’re … ”
I bit my lip and listened to his diatribe against African immigrants .
Surely , I thought , he ’s forgotten who he ’s talking to .
That did n’t come as much of a surprise .
I find that a lot of people forget I ’m an immigrant ; more precisely , an African immigrant .
This , simply , is what I meant when I said Obama is n’t black .
The way the term is used , all it means is : descendant of West African slaves brought here to labor for whites against their will .
How many times can I say this : I ’m describing a politico - cultural reality which I reject .
Yes , Shirley Chisholm and Malcolm X were of West Indian immigrant stock .
They achieved mainstream black power because they kept that side of themselves out of the public eye and focused on the battle with whitey .
Had they not , we ’d not know their names .
( My hero , W.E.B. DuBois , cruelly mocked and isolated the ostentatiously West Indian Marcus Garvey precisely because he was so ostentatiously West Indian . )
I ’m critiquing the notion that all that ’s important about us is our historic relationship of antagonism with American whites , a relationship that immigrant blacks do not have ( however similar their histories are to ours ) .
I ’m critiquing the notion that knowing someone , at some point , came from Africa provides us any useful information , if they are not descended from slaves .
That , we know but we do n’t know diddly about black immigrants and we do n’t care to , black or white .
I reject this .
What , exactly , do I and an immigrant Nigerian cab driver with a doctorate he can’t use here in common beyond the label ‘ black ’ ?
Only they know , because they ’re not allowed to be ‘ black ’ outside of our binary slavery / Jim Crow / police brutality / segregation continuum .
Native blacks see to that : when have we ever advocated for immigrant blacks unless they stray into Jim Crow territory ( Diallo , etc ) .
Our hostility to immigration is legendary ; if we ’re all ‘ black , ’ why have n’t we carved out a protective exemption for black immigrants ?
Because we do n’t feel a kinship , we do n’t want them talking outside the box , we do n’t want them changing the subject to entrepreneurship and immigration reform .
And we certainly do n’t want them taking ‘ our ’ jobs and affirmative action slots .
Too bad for ‘ us ’ they do n’t need them .
As Clarence Page points out , black immigrants are America ’s true ‘ model minority , ’ not that anyone , outside of admissions offices and hiring offices , cares .
Do African immigrants make the smartest Americans ?
The question may sound outlandish , but if you were judging by statistics alone , you could find plenty of evidence to back it up .
In a side - by - side comparison of 2000 census data by sociologist John R. Logan at the Mumford Center , State University of New York at Albany , black immigrants from Africa average the highest educational attainment of any population group in the country , including whites and Asians .
That trend continues in their offspring .
From The Guardian :
The joint University of Pennsylvania - Princeton report found that although immigrant - origin black students make up only 13 percent of the black population in the US , they now comprise 27 percent of black students at the 28 top US universities surveyed .
And in a sample of the elite Ivy League universities the figures were even more dramatic .
More than 40 percent of black students in the Ivy League now come from immigrant families .
Overall , however , black students still make up only 6 percent - 7 percent of Ivy League students , while 12 percent of the general US population is black .
In the non-ivy league selective colleges studied , such as Berkeley , Emory , Stanford , Tufts , Wesleyan , Barnard and Smith , black students make up between 3 percent and 9 percent of the population .
This should cause jubilation at the NAACP , right ?
Wrong .
Also from The Guardian ( emphasis added ) :
“ Immigrant and second - generation blacks are over - represented at these schools , while overall black students are still too few , ” says Dr. Camille Charles , sociology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the report ’s co-authors , “ which means the problem of access for African - Americans – that group which has the longest history of oppression in the US – is of even greater concern than we thought . ”
Charles does n’t want immigrant black students to have less access , but she is concerned that African - Americans whose families have been in the US since before the civil war and whose forefathers were slaves are doubly losing out .
There is a worry that selective , usually private , universities are taking an “ any black student will do ” approach to diversity .
If we ’re all ‘ black ’ , why wo n’t any black student do ?
You have to read the piece to have your mind blown .
The words do n’t even cohere as ‘ black , ’ ‘ African , ’ and ‘ African American ’ try to make sense of themselves .
Blacks who run affirmative action programs are quoted being incensed by the ‘ over representation ’ of immigrant blacks , and that ‘ blacks ’ who ’ve fled war and rape in Haiti are seen as having ‘ sexier ’ admission essays than ‘ blacks ’ who ’ve overcome South Central .
‘ Black ’ is simply a label which obscures more than it illuminates .
That ’s all I was trying to say .
May 28 , 2008 at 07:38 Tags Book reviews , SICP
I have the habit of writing reviews for the books I 've read , and recently I noticed that something is missing .
SICP .
I 've definitely read it , so I should probably write a review , eh ?
The real reason for my writing this review is , however , its Amazon entry .
Although the first page shines with glimmering reviews by , no less , Peter Norvig and Paul Graham , the book has a 3.5 star average , which is really inexplicable .
Many far inferior books have higher grades !
So I want to make my small contribution by writing SICP the review it deserves , give it the grade it deserves ( 5 !!!! ) , and post it to Amazon as well .
Lets get started , then .
My first encounter with SICP was in the second year of university , where I took a course named " SICP 1 " .
I already had working programming experience by that time , so the course was n't hard , but I was struck by the beauty of the subjects it taught , by the Scheme language it used and by the long and interesting homework assignments it had .
This course woke my curiosity about functional programming , and the Lisp family of languages in particular .
A few years later , with much more experience behind my back , I 've decided to tackle SICP seriously and read the whole book , solving the vast majority of the exercises .
This endeavor took about 10 months , and I enjoyed it immensely .
I think SICP is a wonderful book , a seminal work in the field of programming .
It is one of those rare books every programmer should read .
In this review I 'll try to explain why .
In contrast with most introductory books about programming that just teach you a language , SICP takes a far better approach .
The main goal of the authors is not to teach Scheme , it is to teach programming .
From the beginning , the book takes an integrative path , where the basic axioms of programming are presented , and later are fortified with examples and exercises .
SICP teaches about computational processes - iterative and recursive .
How to use them best in each situation , and how to implement them .
It also explains abstraction by functional composition .
These are topics rarely presented in programming books , but SICP puts them rightly in the first chapter , because they are the real stuff programming is based on .
The example programs developed in the book are real , large , and exciting .
You 'll get to develop a powerful picture language , a generic object - oriented arithmetic package including complex and polynomial arithmetic , a simulator for digital circuits , a symbolic differentiation package , an interpreter for Scheme written in Scheme , an interpreter for a logic programming language similar to Prolog , a virtual machine for a simplified pseudo - assembly DSL , an interpreter for Scheme written in this pseudo - assembly , and finally a compiler from Scheme to the assembly language .
All these examples are real , well - thought out exercises for skill , taken from beginning to a very complete end .
In no other book such a wealth of topics is addressed in an accessible manner .
A word about exercises in SICP .
They are numerous , some of them are hard , but the exercises are the best way to really understand what the book tries to teach .
In a manner , they 're as integral part of the book as the text itself .
The exercises are very well prepared and lead the reader through the examples coded by the authors into greater understanding of the topics taught .
At times , it feels like the exercises are specifically designed to force you to think about the essence of the topics , and not just grasp them superficially .
SICP commonly suffers from the criticism that it 's too hard for beginners .
Maybe this criticism is rightful , and universities should give a simpler introductory course to programming before SICP .
But this is an aspect of the educational systems , not pertaining to the book itself .
I would n't know , I never read SICP as a beginner .
However it is being taught , SICP is an amazing book .
It is by far the best programming book I have ever laid by hands on , and I seriously doubt that it will be surpassed any time soon .
Reading SICP will enlighten you as a programmer , and make you a better one .
I can't imagine one programmer who wo n't gain something important by reading SICP .
Women who use mobile phones when pregnant are more likely to give birth to children with behavioural problems , according to authoritative research .
A giant study , which surveyed more than 13,000 children , found that using the handsets just two or three times a day was enough to raise the risk of their babies developing hyperactivity and difficulties with conduct , emotions and relationships by the time they reached school age .
And it adds that the likelihood is even greater if the children themselves used the phones before the age of seven .
The results of the study , the first of its kind , have taken the top scientists who conducted it by surprise .
But they follow warnings against both pregnant women and children using mobiles by the official Russian radiation watchdog body , which believes that the peril they pose " is not much lower than the risk to children 's health from tobacco or alcohol " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The research – at the universities of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) and Aarhus , Denmark – is to be published in the July issue of the journal Epidemiology and will carry particular weight because one of its authors has been sceptical that mobile phones pose a risk to health .
UCLA 's Professor Leeka Kheifets – who serves on a key committee of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection , the body that sets the guidelines for exposure to mobile phones – wrote three and a half years ago that the results of studies on people who used them " to date give no consistent evidence of a causal relationship between exposure to radiofrequency fields and any adverse health effect " .
The scientists questioned the mothers of 13,159 children born in Denmark in the late 1990s about their use of the phones in pregnancy , and their children 's use of them and behaviour up to the age of seven .
As they gave birth before mobiles became universal , about half of the mothers had used them infrequently or not at all , enabling comparisons to be made .
They found that mothers who did use the handsets were 54 per cent more likely to have children with behavioural problems and that the likelihood increased with the amount of potential exposure to the radiation .
And when the children also later used the phones they were , overall , 80 per cent more likely to suffer from difficulties with behaviour .
They were 25 per cent more at risk from emotional problems , 34 per cent more likely to suffer from difficulties relating to their peers , 35 per cent more likely to be hyperactive , and 49 per cent more prone to problems with conduct .
The scientists say that the results were " unexpected " , and that they knew of no biological mechanisms that could cause them .
But when they tried to explain them by accounting for other possible causes – such as smoking during pregnancy , family psychiatric history or socio- economic status – they found that , far from disappearing , the association with mobile phone use got even stronger .
They add that there might be other possible explanations that they did not examine – such as that mothers who used the phones frequently might pay less attention to their children – and stress that the results " should be interpreted with caution " and checked by further studies .
But they conclude that " if they are real they would have major public health implications " .
Professor Sam Milham , of the blue - chip Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York , and the University of Washington School of Public Health – one of the pioneers of research in the field – said last week that he had no doubt that the results were real .
He pointed out that recent Canadian research on pregnant rats exposed to similar radiation had found structural changes in their offspring 's brains .
The Russian National Committee on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection says that use of the phones by both pregnant women and children should be " limited " .
It concludes that children who talk on the handsets are likely to suffer from " disruption of memory , decline of attention , diminishing learning and cognitive abilities , increased irritability " in the short term , and that longer - term hazards include " depressive syndrome " and " degeneration of the nervous structures of the brain " .
MAHALLA EL - KOBRA , Egypt - Egypt rushed yesterday to grant bonuses to workers after two days of deadly riots over high food prices and low wages racked this northern industrial city , fueling government fears that economic angst might boil over across the country .
A top United Nations official warned that many poor nations are in danger of such unrest as inflation heats up around the globe .
Rising prices have struck hard in Egypt , a US ally where 40 percent of the people live in or near poverty .
This Nile Delta factory city has seen a wave of strikes for more than a year , and the anger exploded into rioting Sunday and Monday .
Protesters tore down a billboard of President Hosni Mubarak and fought with police in clashes that left one person dead in the worst unrest since Egypt 's 1977 riots over increased bread prices .
Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif hurried to Mahalla al - Kobra yesterday with several top economic ministers to meet with workers at the 50 - year - old , state - owned Misr Spinning and Weaving factory complex that employs 25,000 people .
" We know Mahalla is suffering and you have passed through many crises , " Nazif told them .
" But it is through crises that men prove their mettle . "
He announced they would receive a bonus of 30 days ' pay and promised to address their demands for better healthcare and higher wages .
Workers in the hall cheered .
But afterward , many were skeptical .
" What Nazif has said , we 've heard it all before - what 's new ?
They really have no idea how we suffer here , " said Rashad Fathi , a factory worker who said his monthly wage of $ 34 was not enough to feed his four children .
The chief of UN humanitarian operations , John Holmes , said yesterday that poor people around the world are facing worsening hardship because of the expense of food .
He said food prices had risen an average of 40 percent over the last year .
Egypt 's economic woes overshadowed yesterday 's municipal elections , in which voter turnout was meager .
At polling stations in Cairo , only a few people were seen drifting in to cast ballots over several hours .
" Bread is getting more expensive .
People are worried about that and most do n't care about politics , " said Medhat Abdel Nasser , a 20 - year - old student who walked by a polling station in Cairo without a pause .
The government 's soft approach to workers contrasted with its treatment of its top political competitor , the Muslim Brotherhood , which shocked authorities in 2005 with a strong showing in Parliament elections .
Hundreds of Brotherhood members were arrested in recent months , and nearly 10,000 of its candidates were not allowed to run .

How big is a five - gallon jug ?
Office water coolers in the United States commonly take five - gallon jugs of water .
You are probably familiar with these jugs , but here is a picture of a jug , to refresh your memory .
A random graduate student has been provided for scale :
Here 's today 's riddle :
Can you estimate the volume of the jug in cubic feet ?
" Estimate " means by eyeballing it , not by calculating , measuring , consulting reference works , etc .
But feel free to look at an actual jug if you have one handy .
Once you 've settled on your estimate , compare it with the correct answer , below .
Answer :
It is about 2/3 of a cubic foot .
One gallon contains about 231 cubic inches .
Five gallons contain about 1155 cubic inches .
One cubic foot contains 12 × 12×12 = 1728 cubic inches .
Hard to believe , is n't it ?
( " Strange but true . " )
I took one of these jugs around my office last year , asking everyone to guess how big it was ; nobody came close .
People typically guessed that it was about three times as big as it actually is .
This puzzle totally does not work anywhere except in the United States .
The corresponding puzzle for the rest of the world is " Here is a twenty - liter jug .
Can you guess the volume of the jug in liters ? "
I suppose this is an argument in favor of the metric system .

Artist uploads latest album to What.cd , blames music industry for piracy
Benn Jordan , also known under his electronica moniker The Flashbulb , has uploaded copies of his newest album " Soundtrack To A Vacant Life " to What.cd The Pirate Bay and other torrent trackers in order to bypass the ineffective means of traditional distribution .
The album download comes complete with an info file that addresses the readers with " hello listener...downloader...pirate...pseudo-criminal ... " , and then continues : Instead , Jordan emphasizes with downloaders , asking why anybody would bother to buy CDs anyway anymore in the age of iPods and MP3 - filled hard disks .
Jordan believes the answer is that people still like to support their favorite artists , but that they really do n't have the right options to do so .
Jordan hopes that his newfound file - sharing fans will instead donate , and maybe buy his and other albums as FLAC downloads directly from his label 's website .
He wo n't reveal how many people have donated so far , but first reactions seem to be encouraging .
The download has been promoted to the front page of What.cd , and the site 's admins actively encourage their users to donate .
Jordan does n't seem to be too sure that his experiment will pay out , but he believes that new models like these are inevitable and that holding on to the old ways of doing business will actually increase piracy .
From his blog :

Warning !
These historical wartime images are sexually explicit .
This is a military reference site for adults only .
Note : Portions of this article on wartime sexual propaganda first appeared in the magazines : Sir - September 1967 ; Soldier of Fortune - May 1981 and Oui - September 1983 .
At the time , many publishers were seeking articles about the use of sex in war propaganda .
I turned down a half - dozen others because I got tired of writing articles on the same subject .
I was later interviewed and my material was depicted in the long - running British Channel Four television documentary series Secret History on two occasions .
In 1999 , it broadcast Sex and the Swastika , and in 2004 , Sex Bomb .
In 2006 I took part in the Canadian Chum Limited TV documentary Sex and PSYOPs .
In 2013 , parts of the article were used for reference by the Talkback Company on the popular BBC quiz show QI ( Quite Interesting ) .
In addition , the information in this article has been used as source material in a number of books such as Professor Dagmar Herzogs Brutality and Desire : War and Sexuality in Europe 's Twentieth Century .
In 2015 , I was contacted by Zagreb Pride , an NGO based in Croatia that wanted to publish Sexuality in Europe in Croatian .
Permission was granted to use my data .
To the average person , the connotations of the word " Pornography " have always brought forth a mental picture of a depraved person leering at filthy pictures .
To the scholar , the word meant simply " The description of prostitutes and their trade " .
Later , other definitions were added , attempting to encompass the term " obscene " .
We now consider Webster 's " Writing and pictures intended to arouse sexual desire " as an appropriate statement of meaning .
Would it surprise you to know that all the major combatants involved in World War II used pornography as part of their psychological operations ( PSYOP ) strategy ?
Professor Paul M. A. Linebarger stated the justification for this effort in his book Psychological Warfare ( Infantry Journal Press , Washington D.C. , 1948 ) .
Young human beings , especially young males , are apt to give considerable attention to sex .
In areas of military operations , they are removed from the stimuli of secondary sex references , which are ( in America ) an accepted part of everyones daily life : bathing beauty photos , magazine covers , semi-nudes in advertising , etc .
Our enemies tried to use the resulting pin-up craze for propaganda purposes , hoping that a vain arousal of oestrum would diminish morale .
In German Psychological Warfare ( Arno Press , New York , 1972 ) Ladislas Farago states :
Since young soldiers are in a state of hyperactive bodily development , their immediate problems are related to appetite and sex .... Sexual deprivation may be a motive for a soldiers suicide attempt .
Both the Axis and the Allies printed aerial propaganda leaflets using sexual themes in an attempt to demoralize enemy soldiers at the front .
Did these leaflets work ?
Did the finders become emotionally crippled and unable to carry on their duties and responsibilities ?
Just the opposite occurred .
The " pin - up " pictures became collectors items sought after by the troops who greedily collected and swapped them .
If anything , the leaflets raised morale .
There is no doubt that they were the most heartily appreciated propaganda leaflets used in World War 2 .
We can probably state that they were the most widely read and circulated enemy documents of any war .
A member of the 10th Mountain Division points out the reason that the sex leaflets increase rather than decrease morale .
They clearly fail in their mission .
The comment is found in Climb to Conquer , Peter Shelton .
Simon and Schuster , NY , 2003 .
Bud Winter , who had returned to his outfit , wounds healed , in late March , noted in a letter to his mother that at least some of the enemy doggerel was appreciated :
The Jerries shell us with leaflets with a picture of a beautiful girl on one side and a skull and cross bones on the other .
One side says Life and the other Death Well , anyway , it seems to raise the morale of most of the fellows because they hang the side up with the beautiful girl for a pinup say to Hell with the other side .
More evidence is found in Beyond the Beachhead  the 29th Infantry Division in Normandy , Joseph Balkoski , Stackpole Books , Mechanicsburg , PA , 1989 :
The enemys leaflets were nothing more than appeals to the American soldiers sexual instincts .
A typical leaflet featured a sketch of an attractive and scantily clad woman in the arms of a happy male civilian .
The caption asked what the G.I.s though they would be doing if they were home instead of in the army .
The 29ers chuckled and hoped the Germans would send more over the lines .
The leaflets were a lot safer than real artillery shells , and the sketches were fairly interesting .
The same sort of things was happening on the Japanese front where sex leaflets were being dropped by the enemy on Allied troops .
Some comments from Prisoners of the Japanese , Gavan Daws , William Morrow and Company , NY , 1994 , on the subject :
The Japanese were dropping propaganda leaflets
And for the friendliest of friendly persuasion , pictures of a beautiful blonde stripper , private parts and all :  You too can enjoy this is you surrender . 
The propaganda bombers came droning over every day .
It was like having the paper delivered .
Some of the troops started trading the leaflets like baseball cards .
So , why were they used ?
Edward Donnerstein says in The Journal of Personality and Social Behavior ( Vol. 39 , 1980 , p. 269-277 ) :
When males have not been angered or have been exposed to mild erotica , aggressive behavior has been reduced
In summary , the present results suggest that highly arousing nonaggressive - erotic stimuli can be a mediator of aggressive behavior by males toward other males under certain condition .
Could it be that our enemies believed that the sexual leaflets would take the " fight " out of the American soldier ?
I once interviewed the top British forger of the war .
He was the man in charge of printing the black British leaflets .
He said about the sex leaflets :
They did nothing to the enemy , but they were popular among the " adolescents " working for me .
They did not demoralize the enemy , but they were excellent for the morale of the British agents who handled and distributed them .
An American propagandist once told me that he did not like to disapprove these strange and exotic concepts because it tended to stifle the creativity of his artists .
It seems that on the Allied side at least , sex leaflets were produced mostly because the bosses thought it was a good way for their people to stretch their imaginations and remain creative .
For the purposes of this article , we are interested only in the propaganda leaflets built around a sexual message .
Of course , they only make up a small percentage of the millions of leaflets that were dropped during the Second World War .
Probably less than one percent of all the leaflets produced by the opposing powers were of a sexual nature .
For that reason they are scarce today , highly collectable , and only rarely seen at auction .
Professor Linebarger noted that obscene pictures showing naked women , designed to make the celibate troops so desirous of women that they surrendered was a Japanese idea that did not work .
The troops kept the pornography and despised the Japanese as queer little people for having sent it .
One American soldier assigned to the 35th Infantry Division in February of 1945 told of receiving pornographic leaflets in an artillery barrage .
He told me :
We used the leaflets for toilet paper .
This is a telling statement and seems to bolster a comment once made by Sir Arthur Harris , Air Marshall of the Royal Air Force during WWII .
My personal opinion is that the only thing achieved ( by dropping leaflets ) was largely to supply the continents requirement of toilet paper for the five long years of the war .
Who first used sexually themed leaflets in WW2 ?
Author Leo J. Margolin says in Paper Bullets ( Frozen Press , New York , 1946 ) :
In the briskness of the winter air on 1939 - 1940 , the French soldiers  will to fight evaporated like his breath .
The Germans asked , " Where are the British troops ? "
Millions of leaflets showing a vivid drawing of tired and dirty French soldiers in forward positions while a French woman lay in the arms of a British soldier was the answer that Goebbels provided .
He points out that German loudspeakers constantly repeated that message that The British troops were not in the Maginot Line and that they were instead back in Paris with French women .
Sefton Delmer , a reporter with the French Army who would later become an official of the British wartime propaganda agency , recalls his visit to the French front in 1939 .
He was shown a leaflet :
... Which consisted of a small picture on a thin piece of paper showing a French soldier doing his duty at the front .
However , if one held the picture to the light , the scene underwent a complete change .
In place of the Brave poilu one now saw in minute salacious detail , a British Tommy fornicating with what the caption told us was the Frenchmans fiancée .
The Germans loved these " divide and conquer " themes .
They often attempted to drive a wedge between the American and British troops , soldiers and civilian " slackers " at home , Christians and Jews , and even African - Americans and Caucasians .
We find many written references of these campaigns .
John Baker
White tells us in The Big Lie ( Pan Books Ltd. , London , 1958 ) that :
Goebbels had a wonderful theme for the bitter winter of 1939 - 1940 .
The British forces were back , well away from the Germans , on the Franco - Belgian frontier .
He was not slow to paint to the French a picture of drunken soldiery living in comfort , seducing their wives and daughters .
Many French soldiers were found to be passing from hand - to - hand a postcard which was the photograph of the then Secretary of State for War , sitting between two scantily - clad cabaret artistes in a Paris nightclub .
Actually it had been taken months before the war started , but all the Germans had to do was print on the back :  While you sit in the line this is what the British are doing with your wives  .
German Sexual PSYOP
Where is Tommy Staying ?
 First Type
We will first discuss and illustrate German sexual propaganda leaflets .
There are a number of different variations of the see - through type leaflet .
The best - known types are a series produced on cardboard about the same size as a postcard ( 11 x 15 cm ) .
All of these see - through cards were produced by German military propagandists .
I first wrote about these cards in an article entitled  Postcards to the Enemy ,  the Society of Philatelic Americans Journal , July 1971 .
In April 1940 , French soldiers along the Maginot Line received a German airdrop of thousands of colorful cardboard leaflets , which showed brave troops fighting and dying in front of a barbed - wire emplacement .
Above the men is a clear area of the sky and the words " Ou le Tommy est - il Reste ? "
( " Where is Tommy staying ? " ) .
When one holds this card to the light , a second scene appears .
It shows British officers and soldiers cavorting behind the lines with French women .
There are six known varieties of this card .
The see - through sexual scenes depict a soldier and woman in a salon ; three women and 5 soldiers on a street ( all fully clothed ) ; four women and 4 men in a cabaret ; four women and 3 soldiers on a staircase ; four women and 3 soldiers in a cabaret ; and five women and 5 soldiers in a cabaret .
The initial printing at the beginning of April 1940 was about 133,000 of each card .
On 5 April 1940 , an additional 1,000,000 of each were ordered .
The cards were airdropped on the French troops from early April to early June 1940 .
Bernard Wilkin and Maude Williams say in German Wartime Anglophobic Propaganda in France , 1914 –1945 published in Wartime History :
On 3 September 1939 France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany .
The following eight months would see no major offensive on the Western Front , a period known as the phony war .
There was little violence but German propaganda aimed at French soldiers and civilians was in full swing , using radio broadcasts and launching more than 90 million leaflets .
German psychological warfare was produced by various military and civilian units competing against each other : the Reichsministerium fur Volkserklarung und Propaganda ( the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda ) , the Auswartiges Amt ( the German Foreign Office ) and the Propagandakompanien ( propaganda companies inside the German army ) .
For the next eight months , Anglophobia would feature prominently in German psychological warfare .
Sexual references were also extremely common in 1939 – 40 .
The ‘ Tommies ’ sought out married French women , especially those who had a husband in the army .
Where is Tommy Staying ?
- Second Set
A second set of six see - through cards depicts French soldiers dying of wounds , with one soldier holding a photo of a woman .
The initial printing was about 400,000 of each card and they were dropped from early May to early June 1940 .
The see - through sexual scenes depict a soldier and a nude woman sitting on a bed ; a soldier and nude woman lying on a bed ; a smiling soldier and a crying woman sitting on a bed , both partially clothed ; a soldier sitting on a couch with a woman on his lap ; a soldier standing and nude woman sitting in a salon ; and a soldier , nude girl , and angry mother standing in a room .
A third set of six German propaganda see - through cards for French troops were inscribed  Les mylords a letape (  Gentlemen at rest  ) , and depicted dead or dying French soldiers on the ground , with hidden pictures showing nude or partially nude women when held to the light .
These cards were prepared but never disseminated .
A fourth set of five  Les mylords a letape see - through cards depicted three French soldiers crushed under rubble and the usual scenes of French women with British soldiers when held to the light .
These cards were prepared but never disseminated .
A sixth card might exist but has not been found as yet .
In Sefton Delmers article HMG's Secret Pornographer ,  published in The Times Literary Supplement , 21 February 1972 , Delmer , head of a special section of the British Political Warfare Executive suspects these leaflets might have been a waste of time .
He points out that :
The walls in the underground corridors of the Maginot forts were covered with so many erotic graffiti that I unkindly denounced the Maginot line as " a fortified urinal Unquestionably the morale of the troops in most of the Maginot forts I visited was poor
They just lounged and sulked But I would not put this sulkiness down to the effect of the German transparencies .
The German propaganda pornography , as I saw it , was merely exploiting a situation which already existed , not creating it .
I therefore doubted whether the transparencies  prepared with such zeal by Dr. Goebbels  pornographers repaid in subversive effectiveness the substantial production costs involved .
Frenchmen !
Another divide and conquer leaflet depicts a British Army officer holding the breast of a semi- naked French woman while her husband is shown in a front - line trench peeping out from behind barbed wire .
These leaflets were produced during the  Phony War of 1940 in an attempt to convince the French that they were being sacrificed at the Front while the British vacationed with their women behind the lines .
Frenchmen !
Distrust the enemy  who claims to be your friend !
Colored Soldiers !
Throw down your Weapons !

The Germans also prepared sexual - themed leaflets for the French territories of North Africa .
The uncoded leaflet above was dropped about June 1940 .
It depicts French colonial troops marching off to war closely watched by a French soldier .
In the next panel a soldiers wife or girlfriend watches the ship sail away .
In the third panel she is grabbed by the French soldier and dragged into a building to be raped .
In the final panel the soldier is shown in the middle of an enemy bombardment .
The text is :
Colored soldiers !
Throw down your weapons !
You are being shipped as cannon fodder
They take you away from your beautiful country , to the slaughter house !
Your wives are at your oppressors mercy , who
To save their blood , will poor out yours !
The Germans produced another two sets of see - through leaflets in 1940 .
The first consisted of seven cards and the text " Les mylords a letape , " ( " Gentlemen at rest . " ) .
Once again , the cards show dying French troops and British soldiers with French women .
A second set of five cards shows three French soldiers crushed under rubble while the British officers play with the French women .
Two ways of spending the war see - through leaflets
The Germans produced similar see - through leaflets by rocket for use against the Americans advancing near the  Siegfried Line about December 1944 .
The front of the 10 x 14 cm leaflet depicts a dead American corporal in the foreground and a second soldier draped over the barbed wire in the background .
The text at the top of the leaflet is  Two ways of spending the war and at the bottom ,  Fighting . 
The back of the leaflet is blank except for text at the lower left which reads and ?  and the series number , for instance ;  No . 1 Series : Rich mans war , poor mans fight .
Only four numbers have surfaced in the past 50 years .
We know that number 1 , 3 , 4 and 9 exist .
There may be others that have never been found , or the Germans may have just used some random numbers hoping to confuse the Americans and make them search for leaflets that were never printed .
The use of the propaganda slogan  Rich mans war , poor mans fight by the Germans is very interesting because it was first used by the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War .
At that time , any southerner with 20 slaves or more was allowed to return to the plantation while those with less than twenty or none at all had to stay and fight .
The poor southerners who were forced to remain on the front lines were the first to say  Rich mans war , poor mans fight . 
There are two major differences between the leaflets aimed at the Americans and those aimed at the French .
The American leaflets are much cruder and the pictures not nearly as well drawn .
The second difference is that while the leaflet to the French showed British soldiers with the women , thus attacking an ally , the leaflet aimed at the GIs showed American civilians with the wives and girlfriends , so the propaganda theme might be considered more anti-slacker  or anti - draft - dodger .
The Germans also produced see - through pornographic leaflets for use in Poland to reinforce anti-Bolshevik feelings .
Considering the German treatment of the occupied Poles , the success of these leaflets is doubtful .
Could the Russians mistreat or murder the Poles to a greater extent than the Germans ?
" Carefree youth  or cruel fate ? "
Two leaflets are known .
The first shows a beautiful smiling polish girl , lying on her stomach in an open field with a flower in her mouth .
Text at the top of the leaflet is , " Carefree youth  or cruel fate ? "
When held to the light a beast - like Russian soldier is shown ravishing the nearly naked girl .
" Beginning of success - or forbidden future ? "
The second leaflet depicts a wedding scene with a bride and groom kneeling at the altar in church before a priest .
Text at the top of the leaflet is , " Beginning of success - or forbidden future ? "
When held to the light , an ape - like Russian soldier is seen tearing the young bride 's clothes off .
A Small Donation

Off course , the Poles retaliated in kind .
Klaus Kirchner says in Erotic Leaflets in Europe in the 20th Century that the Polish Underground produced several leaflets using sex in their anti-Nazi propaganda campaign .
This uncoded leaflet believed to have been produced sometime in 1942 depicts a semi nude woman sitting on the lap of a man I assume is a Nazi official .
A poor widow is begging for alms and the Nazi is very annoyed at the disturbance .
The widow says :
I beg for a small donation .
My husband fell in the World War , my son near Stalingrad
The Nazi answers :
 Damned , Kätchen , these old women should be sent to the factories ; then they will not bother us any longer .

Even if plasma speakers are n’t new in any way ( they ’ve been around since the late 1950 ’s ) , it does n’t make them look any less cool .
Just like regular speakers , plasma speakers work by creating compression waves in the air .

NEW BEDFORD , Mass . 
A firearms instructor in southern Massachusetts has been assigned to other duties after his gun accidentally went off while he was teaching a class on weapons safety .
Officials say the Glock handgun discharged while Maj .
Donald Lamar was demonstrating to Bristol County deputy sheriffs how to safely holster the weapon .
The bullet ripped a hole in Lamar 's pants but missed his leg and foot .
Sheriff Thomas Hodgson says the officer made a " gross error in judgment " by not emptying the weapon before the class last week .
Lamar , a certified firearms instructor since 2005 , was transferred to another division and will not carry a firearm while the incident is being investigated .

Paxton bought himself a wife and invited Jesse and me over for dinner .
" Tell me what you think , " he said .
" If you do n \'t like it , we can take it back , get a new one . "
He laughed and nudged me with his elbow till I laughed too .
When we got to the door Jesse said , " I do n \'t like him .
He thinks he\ 's funny but you never know where to put a man like that . "
She was holding the pudding she spent the afternoon making .
Jesse and Paxton\ 's ex-wife Dolly were good friends before she ran off to Arizona .
The pudding was something Dolly taught her ; she figured she was making some kind of point .
" Damn it , " I said .
I was going to say more but Paxton opened the door .
He kissed Jesse on the cheek .
" How are ya , darlin\ ' ? " he said and laughed like it was all some big joke .
" Where can I put this ? " asked Jesse .
" Here , give me that , " he said .
" Bernice ! " he called out .
" Bernice !
Get your butt out here .
My friends are here .
" He went into the kitchen with the pudding under his arm .
From the hallway , a plump Asian woman came out in a robe .
She had a plain face and long hair that she kept together with a rubber band .
" Hello , " I said .
She nodded her head slightly .
Jesse shook her hand and she folded one palm over the other almost like a prayer .
" Ah , there you are . "
Paxton came back into the room .
" Well , here she is folks , what do you think ? "
" It \'s nice to meet you , " Jesse said .
I did n\'t say anything .
What was there to say ?
Paxton popped open a bottle of wine and poured four glasses .
" Bernice is n\'t her real name of course .
Her real name has got a bunch of x\'s and z\'s .
I was the one who gave her Bernice .
It was my mother \'s middle name , " he said .
We all said cheers , clinked the glasses and drank .
" Anyways , that \'s the first thing I give her .
I give her the name . " " Bernice Paxton , " I said . " Mrs. Bernice Paxton , " he said .
He put his arm around her and tugged her close till her shoulder went up against her face .
" Well , what \'s the second thing ? " I said .
He took Bernice\ 's hand and held it up to the light .
" That looks familiar , " Jesse said .
She tilted the glass into her mouth .
She licked her purple lips a few times .
" Jesse , " I said .
" No , no .
It \'s all right . "
He kissed Bernice\ 's hand and folded it into his lap .
" It \ 's the same jeweler , that \'s all .
The guy behind the counter even remembered my face . " " You definitely have a style , " Jesse said .
She lifted the empty glass lightly into the air and then set it back down .
We all stared at Bernice for a little bit and she looked at the floor .
" Where are you from ? " Jesse asked .
" Some island in the South Pacific , " Paxton said .
" Or China or something .
I do n\'t remember . "
He took a deep gulp and then wiped his lips .
" Does she speak any English ? " I asked .
" A little .
All the basic stuff -- yes , no , hello , good morning .
Not bad for twenty thousand , I do n\'t think .
" Jesse coughed a little of her wine out .
It spilled on her blouse .
" Oh , " Bernice said .
She got up and went into the kitchen .
" No no please .
It \'s all right , " Jesse said .
Bernice came back out with a rag .
She took an inch of Jesse\ 's blouse between her fingers and pressed the rag against the stain .
" Please .
It \'s old .
It \'s okay . "
" She knows all sorts of tricks , " Paxton said .
He laughed and slapped Bernice\ 's behind .
She cleared her throat and pressed harder on the stain .
" Hon , do n \'t you think you ought to get started on dinner ?
" Bernice looked at him and then smoothed out the blouse .
The stain was still there , but pink and faint .
She smiled and went into the kitchen .
" I \'ll go help , " Jesse said .
She got up and went with her .
" She\ 's not the greatest cook , " Paxton said .
" Bernice cooks all this oriental crap .
Stuff wrapped in other stuff .
All these sauces .
I can \'t stand it .
It took me a month to teach her how to grill a steak .
"
" She seems nice , " I said .
He drained his glass and then filled it up again .
" Let \ 's go have a cigar . "
He went into a cabinet and clipped off two Havana Souls .
" Not in here , " he said .
" Bernice gets asthmatic when I smoke inside .
" We headed over to the back of house and puffed on our cigars .
The yard looked like it had n\'t been dealt with in years .
The grass was slumped over and the weeds had gotten thick .
Past the weeds , I could make out the faint outline of a flower box .
The mosquito lamp zapped a few times as a pair of moths flicked towards and away .
"
You know , when I first moved in here , I always thought about having a pool put in . "
He spread his hand out over a stretch of grass and made a frame with his fingers .
" An in - ground pool , right there .
Go out in the summer , strip down and just lay there all day with the radio going .
Hire someone to take care of it .
Scoop out the leaves and bugs and things .
" " That sounds like something , " I said .
I blew out a puff of smoke and watched it fall apart .
" Dolly and me , after we saved up enough , we were going to do it in installments .
We even had a guy come in .
He took a dirt sample , stuck it in an envelope , ran a big yellow tape measure across this way .
Gave us a real good deal too .
But we told him we needed time .
We \'ll talk it over and in a week or two we \'ll get back to you .
Boy , to hear us , that pool was practically ours .
Dolly went out and got herself a new bathing suit and I got me one of them inflatable rafts , so I can sit in and drink my beer . "
He let out a laugh .
" Shit , " he said .
I let the cigar burn in my hand for a while before putting it back in my mouth .
" Well , you \'ve got Bernice now .
" He shook his head .
" She can \'t swim .
She\ 's practically a stone . "
He sighed through his cigar .
A big chunk of ash fell on his shirt .
" Jesse\ 's been giving me the daggers all night . "
He looked at me as if he was trying to read something on my face .
" She\ 's just ... " " Hey , it \'s all right .
I can live in a world where Jesse doesn\'t like me . " " Her and Dolly were just real close .
" He laughed up a gray cloud .
" Sure sure , " he said .
He twisted his cigar into the wall .
" Me too . " Jesse came out of the kitchen with a tray full of hamburgers .
Paxton looked at the tray .
" Where \'s Bernice ? " " She\ 's washing up , " Jesse said .
" Well , do n\'t bother waiting , " he said .
He grabbed a burger from the center of the table .
" She\ 's getting better with the burgers , but she makes them bland as hell .
I tell her she\'s got to salt the damn things , but I do n\'t think she understands .
I think it \'s cause all they eat is rice over there .
" Bernice came in with a change of clothes , with her face done up with make - up .
It made her look puffy and swollen .
" This is really good , " Jesse said .
" I have to get your recipe .
" Bernice smiled and looked down at her lap .
" Yeah , it \'s very good .
Never had a burger like this before , " I said .
She nodded again at me .
Paxton turned over a big chunk in his mouth .
" Hmm , " he said .
He chewed for a little while more , moving the bulge against his cheek .
After he swallowed it down , he said " Baby , this tastes like shit . "
He put his burger down and flicked his fingers over his plate .
" But I love you anyway .
" Nobody talked much during dinner .
After Bernice had cleared away the plates , Paxton suggested we all go out for a drink .
" Something to wash down these patties , " he said right before he planted a loud kiss on Bernice\ 's cheek .
We got into Paxton\ 's van and took it down to Bobby Porcelain\'s on seventh .
We ordered up a round and we toasted the two of them : " To Max and Bernice .
To a long and happy marriage , " I said .
Jesse took my hand under the table and squeezed it .
We finished our beer and Paxton went and bought us all another round .
A few drinks in , a song kicked on in the jukebox and Jesse said , " I love this song . "
She hummed a little to it and sang a few lines from the verse .
" Dance with me , " she said .
We slid out of the booth and I danced her on the aisle .
I could feel the bones of her hips swaying to the music .
Her fingers started pulling on the buttons of my shirt .
Paxton and Bernice came out and started dancing too .
Bernice danced stiff and out of rhythm , stepping from side to side .
Paxton slid his body down and hugged her around the waist and her face flushed a deep red .
" Come on , baby , " he said .
" Show me what you can do .
" Jesse put her lips to my ears and said , " I \'m tired , Jim .
" I nodded into her shoulder .
" You want to stop dancing ? " " Let \ 's get out of here . " " Now ? " I said .
" Now , " she said .
" We can leave all these crazy people behind .
I \'m done with them .
" " We came in Max \ 's car . " " To hell with Max , " she said .
" We \ 'll go to bed early and sleep in late .
I \'m so tired , Jim . " " You\ 're just a little drunk is all .
" She looked at me when I said that like she didn\'t understand it .
Then she put her head on my shoulder and just left it there for a while .
" How did we get here ? " she said .
" We took Max\ 's car , " I said .
" That \'s not what I mean , " she said .
She leaned into me and muttered , " ... stupid .
" Bernice shrieked and I could see that Paxton had tried to dip her .
He looked over at me and said , " Let \ 's switch .
" I looked into Jesse\ 's pleading eyes .
" Oh what the hell , " I said and handed her over .
I danced with Bernice for a while .
Her fingers were cold and strong .
They went tight against my palms .
She kept glancing up at my face and then away , as if she were embarrassed by something .
It was n\'t long before I gave it up and we sat back down .
" You dance lovely , " I said .
She nodded and a few hairs fell across her face .
She tucked it back behind her ear and looked into the bottom of her cup .
Paxton and Jesse were still dancing .
He said something to her and then laughed .
They danced through the whole song .
" You\ 're a lucky man , " Paxton said when it was over .
Jesse slid back into the booth .
She leaned into my ear and said , " I need to use the bathroom .
" She looked at Bernice and the both of them headed to the bathroom .
" They \'re getting to be quite a pair , " I said .
Paxton smiled and drank his beer .
" This is fun , " he said .
" We do n \'t do this often enough .
" I nodded .
" It has been a long while . " " Do you remember the last time ?
The last time we were here ? " " Sure , sure . " " Dolly threw that beer all over that poor kid\ 's face .
She was going to rip his eyes out .
" I smiled and sucked the taste of beer off my teeth .
" The first Mrs. Paxton , " I said .
I felt like raising up my glass but I was too tired to do it .
" You know I wrote her .
This was months back .
I was trying to explain things , you know ?
Just really piece it all together and show her that I figured it all out . "
He leaned away from the table and pulled his cheeks down .
" I met her lawyer outside his building and I almost broke his fucking arm getting the address .
But I got it . "
His fingers went tight into a fist and he rubbed at the knuckles .
" So what happened ? " I said .
He shrugged his shoulders .
" Nothing .
She never wrote back . " " Forget about it , " I said .
" It does n \'t matter now . " " I talk too much , " he said .
We sat quiet for a while .
He was rubbing the tips of his fingers like there was an itch he could n\'t get at .
I went ahead and said it .
" This is a green card thing .
" He looked up at me as if he were trying to put together what I had just said .
Then he smiled and shook his head .
" For her , maybe . " " And you \ 're okay with that ?
" He shrugged .
He traced a shape against the side of his head and rubbed at his hair .
" You see this ?
Not so long ago , it used to be all brown .
And I had a lot more of it too .
I got out of the shower one morning , and I cleared the steam off the mirror and I thought , that man ought to be married . "
He rubbed something between his fingers and looked down at the tips .
" I do n\'t know .
What \'s it matter , anyway ? " " What kind of way is that to talk ? " I said .
" I remember when she showed up at my door , we got into the van and I took her up to the mountain .
She had these short - sleeves on and these big sunglasses and I had to give her my coat cause she was shaking the whole time .
She looked so tiny in it and I thought , hell , I could pitch her off this ledge here and no one would even know .
We hiked along the Eastern Trail till we got to this cliff .
She was so afraid to go near it .
But it looked out over the town , and you could see the saw mill and the water plant -- and I said , Welcome to America .
I do n\'t know if she knew what I was saying , but she walked up right next to me , right on the edge of it and we stood there for a while just looking at the whole damn place .
" I nodded .
" It sounds like a good start , " I said .
Jesse and Bernice came back from the bathroom .
" Those guys over there are creeps . " " Where ? " I asked .
She pointed towards the bar .
There were two young guys slouched up against the counter .
They had their hair tucked into baseball caps and there were marks all up their arms .
Paxton\ 's face went flat .
He said , " Excuse me , " and walked over .
He was a good foot taller than them and he put his arm around one of the guys .
They were saying something to each other but I could n\'t hear what .
After a few minutes , he came back to the table .
" What happened ? " I said .
He looked at me and shook his head .
" Not a damn thing .
" On the ride back to the house , Jesse had fallen asleep at my neck .
" We forgot to have dessert , " Paxton said .
" That \'s all right , " he said .
" I \'m too far gone . " " You guys brought dessert and we did n\'t have it . " " You keep it , " I said .
" We should have a little before you go , " he said .
When we got there , we sat around the table with our eyes half - open and our bodies slumped over .
Bernice went into the kitchen to get the pudding .
" You guys can stay over if you like .
We can clear off some space , " Paxton said .
" We should be getting back , " Jesse said .
Paxton laughed .
" If Dolly had asked you , it would be a different story would n\'t it ?
" Jesse picked her head up and tightened her eyes together .
She was about to say something but Bernice came into the room with bowls of pudding .
" Looks good , " Paxton said .
He rubbed his hands together .
We all started eating .
Bernice took a spoonful and slipped it into her mouth .
Then she set the spoon down and folded her hands together .
" What \'s the matter , you do n\'t like it ? "
Paxton wiped his lips .
She said something low and foreign .
" It \ 's fine , " Jesse said .
" I used too much vanilla . " " It \ 's delicious , " Paxton said .
He looked at Jesse and then at Bernice .
" It \ 's delicious .
Say it .
" Bernice stared at him , confused .
" Say it \'s delicious .
" Her lips opened a little .
" It \ 's delicious .
Say it . " " Max , " I said .
She picked up her spoon and he smacked it away .
" Now you listen , " he said .
" It \ 's delicious .
" She squeaked out the words .
" Again ! " " Max , " I said .
He picked up his bowl and pitched it against the wall .
The bowl came apart in pieces and Bernice let out a sharp yell .
I stared at the yellow stain where the bowl had landed .
I could n\'t take my eyes off it .

YANGON , Myanmar 
The directors of several relief organizations in Myanmar said Wednesday that some of the international aid arriving into the country for the victims of Cyclone Nargis was being stolen , diverted or warehoused by the country ’s army .
The United States military ’s Joint Typhoon Warning Center said there was a possibility that “ a significant tropical cyclone ”  a second big storm  would form within 24 hours and head across the Irrawaddy Delta , the region that suffered most from the first storm , which struck May 3 .
Thailand ’s prime minister , Samak Sundaravej , flew to Yangon on Wednesday to try to persuade Myanmar ’s leaders to allow more foreign aid workers into the country .
The members of the military junta told him they were in control of the relief operations and had no need for foreign experts , he told reporters after returning to Bangkok , The Associated Press reported .
The government said there were no outbreaks of disease or starvation among the hundreds of thousands of people affected by the cyclone .
In Yangon , Mr. Samak met with the prime minister , Lt. Gen .
Thein Sein , The A.P. report said .
The Economics of Teeth , and Other Beauty Premiums
I ’ve been thinking a lot about teeth lately .
First I read this post by Ian Ayres on the value of getting a tooth cleaning .
Then I was out in Salt Lake City to give a lecture at the University of Utah , and the student who drove me around was a very nice guy whose father is a dentist , and we fell to discussing whether dentists ’ offspring have better teeth than average ( yes , he said ) , and whether that difference is genetic or behavioral ( behavioral , he said ) .
Then I came across an interesting working paper by Sherry Glied and Matthew Neidell called “ The Economic Value of Teeth ” ( abstract here or download here ) .
The paper asks whether good teeth improve a person ’s labor - market outcome , which is a basic but important question , especially since teeth ( unlike height or looks in general ) are something that can be fixed .
Glied and Neidell used a clever methodology to measure the impact of teeth on earnings : whether and / or when a certain city ’s population had access to fluoridated water .
As they explain in the abstract : “ The politics surrounding the adoption of water fluoridation by local water districts suggest exposure to fluoride during childhood is exogenous to other factors affecting earnings . ”
They found that women who grew up drinking fluoridated water earn about 4 percent more than women who did n’t , although they found no effect for men .
“ Furthermore , ” they write , “ the effect is almost exclusively concentrated amongst women from families of low socioeconomic status . ”
Knowing what we know about various “ beauty premiums , ” this strikes me as a not -very - surprising but still interesting result .
The one surprise may be that there is no good - teeth effect for men , since the research of Dan Hamermesh ( who ’s been doing great guest blogging here lately ) showed that looks actually matter more for men than for women .
To quote a recent Economist article on the subject :
Just over a decade ago Dr. Hamermesh presided over a series of surveys in the United States and Canada which showed that when all other things are taken into account , ugly people earn less than average incomes , while beautiful people earn more than the average .
The ugliness “ penalty ” for men was - 9 percent while the beauty premium was +5 percent .
For women , perhaps surprisingly considering popular prejudices about the sexes , the effect was less : the ugliness penalty was - 6 percent while the beauty premium was +4 percent .
Since then , he has gone on to measure these effects in other places .
In China , ugliness is penalized more in women , but beauty is more rewarded .
The figures for men in Shanghai are - 25 percent and +3 percent ; for women they are - 31 percent and +10 percent .
In Britain , ugly men do worse than ugly women ( - 18 percent as against - 11 percent ) but the beauty premium is the same for both ( and only +1 percent ) .
Any way you look at it , the teeth paper is yet another reminder that , as much as we might like to think that wages are perfectly correlated with talent and effort , more trivial factors always come into play .
There is , for instance , the famous argument by three Penn researchers that tall people earn more money than shorter people , although their explanation included the fact that you had to be tall as an adolescent , not the beneficiary of a later growth spurt .
Why ?
Because , their argument went , lifetime self - esteem is heavily formed in adolescence , and you gathered up extra self - esteem if you were a tall adolescent .
Interestingly , that explanation — which always struck me as fascinating , though a bit too fantastic — has recently been challenged in a paper by Anne Case and Christina Paxson called “ Stature and Status : Height , Ability , and Labor Market Outcomes ” ( forthcoming publication in the Journal of Political Economy ) .
Their explanation is brutally simple :
In developed countries , researchers have emphasized factors such as self esteem , social dominance , and discrimination .
In this paper , we offer a simpler explanation :
On average , taller people earn more because they are smarter .
As early as age 3 — before schooling has had a chance to play a role — and throughout childhood , taller children perform significantly better on cognitive tests .
…
Furthermore , we show that taller adults select into occupations that have higher cognitive skill requirements and lower physical skill demands .
So what does all this research mean if you are a short , not - so - attractive person with bad teeth ?
It means you should get your teeth fixed .
This , by the way , is a big part of the reasoning behind the charity Smile Train , which we wrote about here .
Smile Train realizes that something as relatively minor as a cleft palate can put a huge drag on your future , especially in developing countries :
Fixing a child ’s cleft lip or palate is a relatively cheap procedure with outsize payoffs : cleft children in many countries are ostracized and have a hard time going to school , getting jobs and marrying , and the surgery reverses those disadvantages .
Indeed , when pitching a reluctant government , [ Brian ]
Mullaney refers to cleft children as “ nonperforming assets ” who can soon be returned to the economic mainstream .
If all this talk of beauty premiums and ugly penalties has you down , there ’s at least one piece of good news : having a ridiculous first name , be it Fido or Loser or LemonJello , does n’t seem to affect career earnings at all .
[ Note : I ’ll be discussing this subject tomorrow ( Tues. ) morning on The Takeaway . ]
Aschwin de Wolf continues to republish important writing from the early days of the modern healthy life extension community at Depressed Metabolism .
Those were the years of the late 1960s , in which the seeds were laid for the cryonics community on the one hand and pro-longevity supplement and " anti-aging " groups on the other .
There 's really a deep divide between the two factions in terms of fundamental philosophy : on the one hand aiming a few more years ( or decades , as they overoptimistically thought at the time ) of healthy life via applied pharmacology , on the other the engineer 's path to defeating death completely .
Quite different worlds of ambition - and as it turned out , rationality .
The cryonicists , with visions of immortality in their sights , were far more correct about the bounds of the possible , given scientific knowledge at the time .
Once vitrified and stored at low temperature , a cryopreserved individual has time and the astounding curve of scientific progress on his side .
The laws of physics and our present understanding of brain biochemistry place no obstacles in the path of restoring cryopreserved people - it's a matter of developing the necessary medical technology , and remaining well - stored until that time comes to pass .
Now " immortality " is a much abused term , cast widely and with many colloquial meanings .
Linguistic drift has come to put it somewhere between " long - lived " and " ageless but vulnerable to accident " in all but more precisely spoken communities .
But it was much used by the early cryonicists in a way closer to the dictionary definition , and that more than anything else I think captures their excitement at having envisioned the scientific doorway out of the trap - a tool that could provide a possible way around death .
For example , the early cryonics book " Immortality : Physically , Scientifically , Now " by Ev Cooper , subtitled " A reasonable guarantee of bodily preservation , a general discussion , and research targets " :
Though few , if any , cryonicists today can retrace their personal interest in cryonics to Ev Cooper , and despite the broader recognition of Robert Ettinger ’s later - published work , “ The Prospect of Immortality , ” Ev Cooper ’s privately published 1962 manuscript , “ Immortality : Physically , Scientifically , Now , ” represents the first major treatise on what would later become known as cryonics .
Soon afterward Ev also started the first cryonics organization , the Life Extension Society ( LES ) , from which several other cryonics societies eventually emerged .
... A handful of prophets : H. G. Wells , G. B. Shaw , Jules Verne , Capek , and Tsiolkovsky made some startlingly accurate predictions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
The more sober members of mankind never held to them seriously , neither then nor now , passing them off as the successes amongst the law of chance .
No matter how it came about - and some of these men were of acute scientific understanding and broad perspective - many of the possibilities they spoke of did come to pass : rocket travel , atomic energy , automatons that work in offices and run factories - too many to list .
Now in the last half of the 20th century , to take seriously that physical immortality , here on earth , is scientifically possible is almost as much as dream can encompass , certainly more than sobriety can allow .
This is perhaps a necessity , for it is only more absurd to chase after every South Sea bubble .
And , ever since prehistoric man first imagined the possibility of life forever , the countless rolling centuries have not given him one shred of material verifiable evidence .
Now , however , when some of the scientific possibilities appear on the horizon , someone has to form the question , consider a reversal of the skepticism engendered by centuries of disappointment and prepare the way for the reality of the incredible .
Why was cryonics envisaged as the step directly to immortality ?
Because , should the plausible outline of the process work , it is a gate to the future of far more capable technology .
A future after the biotech revolution , in which our biochemistry does our bidding , aging can be repaired , and molecular manufacturing is in full swing .
An age of bioartificial bodies , minds transferred to new and more robust mechanisms , strong artificial intelligences , and indeed , anything you might imagine that the laws of physics permit and enough time has passed to develop .
I 'm not going to try to convince you that the future will be a golden , wondrous place : either you accept the implications of the present rate of progress towards what the laws of physics make possible , in which case you 've probably thought this all through at some point , or you do n't .
Life , space travel , AI , the building blocks of matter : we 'll have made large inroads into bending it all to our will within another half century .
Many of us will live to see it even without the benefits of medical technology to come : growing up in a 1970s urban area will be the new 1900s farmboy youth come 2040 ; a strange and primitive near - past erased by progress , for all that so many people still alive actually lived it , time travellers in their own lifetimes .
In any case , I think it 's interesting to ponder why cryonics is no longer seen quite so stridently as the gate to immortality , despite the fact that cryonics technology has advanced steadily since the 1960s , as has our understanding of our brain 's biochemistry .
Could it be because that the horizon for successful restoration has pulled in - perhaps as early as the 2040s ?
Cryonics advocates no longer expect to be restored to a time massively different to our own , because the journey will likely be one of decades rather than centuries .
The vision of immortality can still be conjured just as stridently , should we so wish , but it 's somewhat fashionable at the moment to distance oneself from talking about immortality .
There are practical aspects too .
Now that we have serious , scientific work taking place aimed at the repair of aging , and fundraising for faster progress is an earnest endeavor , one can't afford to be throwing around words that can be easily misconstrued .
The path to moderation of the vision is hard to avoid once money starts flowing in .
I started on the path that led to the Longevity Meme and Fight Aging !
from the position that immortality was a good thing , and knowing that the laws of physics did not disallow a damn good attempt at actual immortality - the " no death , ever " dictionary definition - or at least a life span of millions of years on the way to that end goal .
If that 's not long enough to figure out the aspects of the problem that cannot be answered today , I 'm not sure what would be .
If I 'd been born two decades earlier , I 'd have been a cryonics advocate and volunteer .
As it is , it looks like these first decades of the 21st century are the era in which step one ( of thousands , no doubt ) of simply remaining alive forever - continuously repairing aging in these bodies of ours - can be achieved .
A philosophy of first things first is a good way to temper visions of steps two through however many thousand , and explains why I spend my time talking about the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence and the biotechnology revolution .
If we do n't complete the first step , sufficient control over our biochemistry to repair aging , then it 's all for nothing .
So , the million year life span : how could that be achieved ?
The short , and not terribly informative answer is that you get it done by using advancing technology to dramatically reduce your vulnerability to fatal accidents , murder , and the like .
If you project out the accident rates for life today , you 'll see that an ageless human , sustained by forseeable biotechnologies of cellular and biochemical repair , has a life expectancy in the 1000 to 5000 year range .
Sooner or later that piano is going to fall on you hard enough that even advanced medical technology can't fix you up .
Once you start looking at living for 100,000 years in much the same shape as you are today , it becomes apparent that almost any activity bears a level of risk that 'll jump up and kill you .
Eating , swimming , reading ... breathing .
Stretch out the time for long enough and the improbable and fatal will happen to you .
The answer is to change the shape you are .
Getting past step one , the repair of aging , gives you a few hundred years of comparative statistical safety .
I can't imagine that much of the technology needed for step two will remain beyond the human civilization of the 2200s .
Your step two will no doubt vary , but I would get my neurons replaced ( slowly , one at a time over time , to ensure continuity of the self ) with some form of much more robust , easily maintained nanomachinery .
That allows these sorts of engineering possibilities :
Swapping out the body for whatever machinery of transport and support best minimizes risk
Moving most of the business of life into simulation
Physically separating my neurons while still remaining alive , conscious and active
It 's that last point that 's key , as physical locations have the same sort of issues with time , probability and bad events as people do .
Meteorites happen , as do landslides , earthquakes and volcanoes .
The way to reduce your risk function dramatically is to spread out .
You can imagine a wireless brain ( using whatever the most robust communications technology of the time happens to be be ) scattered in a thousand separate locations across a continent , or the whole planet .
That should be good for 10,000 years of falling pianos of various types .
However , once you start digging back into the geological and astrophysical history of the solar system , it 's clear that spreading out over an entire planet still leaves you at risk on longer timescales .
Probably not from impacts : I 'll be surprised if we can't solve that problem within few centuries from now .
There 's always war , nearby supernovae , massive unexpected solar flares , and other unpleasant items , however .
The supernovae are the biggest of the known concerns , given that I expect it 'll be a long , long time before preventing them is a practical and ongoing business for the civilizations that follow man .
Spreading out is an option again : boost up the size of your components and neuromachinery for worst - case - scenario radiation projections , provide them with the means to move about the solar system , and become a spacefaring entity , spread out over a sizeable selection of orbits .
By that point in time , your physical presence resembles a small country of nanomachinery , automation and delegation .
The trade - off for spreading out and further greatly reducing your long - term risk of death is that you slow down .
The speed of thought is determined by the speed of communication between neurons in components in different orbits .
If your brain is light hours wide , you will live very slowly indeed - but for so long , that you come out ahead .
There are other paths forward , of course , with varying degrees of risk and invention .
I have n't touched living very fast in simulation by running your brain on faster hardware , for example .
The practicality and possibilities as determined by the laws of physics and what we have invented to date have been debated well over the past decades of the transhumanist community ; if you head out there online to look , you 'll find a wealth of fascinating material .
Is immortality impractical ?
Given the risk functions and uncertainty in the timeline for completing the repair of aging , it might be unlikely for most of us alive today because we wo n't get past step one .
But it 's far too early to say whether immortality , the " no death , ever " version , is actually impossible for all of us .
Give it a million years and ask me again .
The slope of technology and possibility is curving up ahead of us to great heights , and it 'll be a wild ride either way .
Hagee 's apocalyptic support of Israel
When Sen. John McCain was forced to distance himself from Pastor John Hagee earlier this year , he denounced the pastor ’s attacks on Catholicism .
But asked why he would n’t “ repudiate ” Hagee ’s endorsement of him , McCain found something to praise .
“ I 'm grateful for his commitment to the support of the state of Israel , and I 'm very grateful for many of his commitments around the world , including to the independence and freedom of the state of Israel , ” he told CNN ’s Campbell Brown on April 29 .

Hagee ’s commitment to Israel , however , is itself controversial :
It ’s rooted in the belief that the Jewish state will — soon — be the site of Armageddon .
Hagee , who leads the evangelical group Christians United for Israel , is a proponent of U.S. aid and support for Israel , and he is a major ally of Israeli conservatives who reject any “ land for peace ” formula in dealing with the Palestinians .
But Hagee is viewed with distrust by some Jews and Israelis because his brand of Christian Zionism closely links support for Israel to the end of the world and the conversion of the Jews to Christianity .
Hagee ’s predictions are very clear .
Armageddon , the final battle , could begin , he wrote in his 2007 book " Jerusalem Countdown , " “ before this book gets published . ”
The Antichrist “ will be the head of the European Union , ” he writes .
Using geographical calculations based on the Book of Revelation , he writes that Israel will be covered in “ a sea of human blood ” in the final battle .
The Jews , however , will survive the battle , Hagee says , long enough to have “ the opportunity to receive Messiah , who is a rabbi known to the world as Jesus of Nazareth . ”
“ They will be blessed beyond their wildest imagination , ” he writes .
A spokesman for McCain , Brian Rogers , said , “ John McCain ’s commitment to the state of Israel is clear , and he respects Pastor Hagee 's commitment as well .
“ As he has said many , many , many times , when folks endorse John McCain it does n't mean he endorses all of their views , ” Rogers said .
Many Jewish political leaders have also embraced Hagee .
Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) spoke to Hagee 's group last year , and Hagee has been invited to speak to the lobbying organization American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
Other Jewish groups have more nuanced views of the pastor .
“ Support for Israel is something that we should welcome and yet be very much aware of where that support comes from and cautious about it , ” said Michael Salberg , the director of international affairs for the Anti-Defamation League .
Salberg said Hagee ’s political stance on Israel “ seems to us to be sincere , genuine and welcome . ”
But Hagee has also been criticized , most recently by the president of the Union for Reform Judaism , Rabbi Eric Yoffie .
“ Christian Zionists , and especially Christians United for Israel , do not offer unconditional support for the Jewish state .
They offer support for a particular religious vision , particular Israeli leaders , and particular political factions , all of which reflect their own prophecy - driven view of the Middle East , ” Yoffie said in an April speech , calling Hagee and his group “ extremists . ”
Yoffie thinks that Hagee “ is not the kind of friend that Israel needs , ” said spokesman Donald Cohen - Cutler .
Indeed , although McCain praised Hagee ’s stance on Israel , he does n’t appear to share it .
Hagee has written that Israel ’s plan to give up the West Bank and Gaza — a two - state solution backed by President Bush and Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton , as well as McCain — “ violates the word of God . ”
“ McCain can say he ’s a great friend of Israel , but he clearly does n’t understand Hagee ’s position on Israel , ” said Ira Forman , the executive director of the National Jewish Democratic Council , a partisan group .
“ Hagee ’s opposed to McCain ’s own policy — he opposes the peace process . ”

Print This Email This Jon Stewart commented Thursday on Mitt Romney 's suspension of his presidential campaign , suggesting that " perhaps it 's a smart move . "
" Mitt Romney 's a businessman , " Stewart continued , " and after discovering he spent $ 35 million of his own money to buy himself 269 delegates , Romney has finally accepted the reality that he is New Coke . "
" So who was Mitt Romney , now that it 's over ? "
Stewart mused .
" Throughout his campaign , he 'd seemed to many a cipher , devoid of principle , a salt - and - pepper , man - shaped polymer casing for a spiritual vacuum . "
Stewart then played a clip of Romney announcing his withdrawal by saying , " I feel I have to now stand aside for our party and for our country . "
" Mitt Romney loves America so much that he could not and would not subject it to a Mitt Romney presidency , " said a choked - up Stewart .
" I 'd be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win , " Romney continued .
" In this time of war , I simply cannot let my campaign be a part of aiding a surrender to terror . "
" So if Mitt Romney keeps running for president , the terrorists win , " Stewart concluded .
But that comment may not have seemed trenchant enough to him , because he asked for the clip to be played a second time .
After apologizing for not having his writers there to help him , Stewart offered , " Let me just see if I can very quickly just whip something up here -- ooh , ooh , I 've got something .
Fuck you ! "
Stewart next played a collage of Romney soundbites warning that " the liberals have n't given up " and that " the attack on faith and religion " along with " tolerance for pornography ... and sexual promiscuity , combined with the twisted incentives of government welfare " mean that we have to " fortify marriage through constitutional amendment so liberal judges cannot continue to attack it " or else run the risk that " we could become the France of the 21st century . "
" Is this out of a conservative speech Mad Lib book ? "
Stewart asked in dismay .
Stewart then turned to senior correspondent Jason Jones and asked , " What happened to the Romney campaign ? "
" He was well - funded , and he certainly looked the part , " answered Jones , " but I do n't think the Romney camp ever recovered from the fact that Mitt Romney is a douchebag . "
" So you 're suggesting in the end , America will not elect a douchebag ? "
Stewart asked .
Jones clarified his analysis , explaining , " Many of America 's presidents have been huge douchebags , but in those cases they had the support of their base -- you know , the other douchebags . "
" But Romney ... " prompted Stewart .
" Even the douchebags did n't go for him . "

I ’ve spent a fair amount of time the last couple of weeks with conservatives of all ages and leanings .
Call it my very own listening tour .
It began with a series of conversations with a group of Weekly Standard subscribers .
Then , last week , I had lunch with the only three conservatives in Cambridge , Mass . ; participated in an event in New York with the leadership of Vets for Freedom ; mixed and mingled with Republicans before a speech in Michigan ; and , on Friday , attended a reception for friends of Bill Buckley after his memorial service at St. Patrick ’s , then discussed politics that evening with conservative college students at Georgetown University .
Apart from accumulating a few frequent flier miles , what do I have to show for my travels ?
I can report that lots of conservatives and Republicans expect Barack Obama to be our next president .
Some Republicans are grasping at the idea that a long , bitter fight for the Democratic nomination will weaken Obama .
Their hopes are about to be dashed .
After the results are in from Pennsylvania on April 22 , or from Indiana and North Carolina on May 6 , it should become clear that Hillary Clinton wo n’t be able to catch Obama in the overall popular vote .
Without that possibility , Clinton wo n’t have a shot at persuading superdelegates to break her way .
In the US , it 's mostly assumed that when you work for a company , your e-mail , web , and chat traffic may be monitored by IT staff .
This is usually meant to ensure that you 're not leaking company information , wasting too much time e-flirting with the person the next cube over , or downloading porn on company time .
Still , most people ( who do n't work in government ) operate under the assumption ( mistaken at times ) that , unless something goes horribly wrong at work , they have some level of privacy in their office communications .
That may no longer be the case in Australia , though , if certain changes go into effect that will give companies and law enforcement the right to snoop on all employee communications whenever they please , without employee consent .
The legislation , if enacted , is n't intended to stop e-flirting — or at least not on the surface .
Instead , Australian Attorney General Robert McClelland told the Sydney Morning Herald that it would be for the purposes of fighting terrorism .
McClelland said that he had been advised that a cyberattack that could impact the stock exchange , electric , or transportation systems would cause more economic havoc than a physical terrorist attack : " It 's unquestionable that it 's necessary from time to time for network supervisors to open emails addressed to people to identify viruses and the like , " he told the paper .
" There needs to be protocols and guidelines developed so companies can protect their own networks .
It will need new legislation . "
Some of that new legislation could come by way of modifications to Australia 's Telecommunications Interceptions
Act , which currently only allows security companies and those who deal with the government to monitor employee communications without permission .
In fact , Parliament has been attempting to modify the Act for years now — Electronic Frontiers Austria said last July that it was continuing a four - year - long fight to ensure that law enforcement agencies would not have full access to people 's stored communications without cause .
It 's not surprising , then , that EFA chairman Dale Clapperton was skeptical of the changes proposed by McClelland .
He told the Herald that such freedom would not only enable employers to abuse the system by snooping on things that are not threatening , but also slow down efforts to truly secure Australia 's IT networks .
" These new powers will facilitate fishing expeditions into employees ' e-mails and computer use rather than being used to protect critical infrastructure , " he said .
McClelland cited last year 's DDoS attacks on Estonia as an example of debilitating cyberattacks that Australia wants to avoid .
( The attacks severely impacted Estonia 's businesses and government for several weeks . )
Although officials in Estonia originally blamed the Russian government for the incident , it turned out that the whole thing was carried out by an Estonian student that authorities believe was acting alone .
The 20 - year - old launched the attacks using his own PC and the help of a botnet — a fact that turned out to be both cause for relief ( the Russians were , in fact , not attempting to take down Estonia 's network infrastructure ) and unsettling ( a single person should not be able to cause such havoc so easily ) .
Despite all this talk , though , none of the proposed changes are going into effect ... yet .
McClelland said that he planned to discuss any new legislation with privacy experts and civil rights groups before making any changes .
Of course , " discussing " does n't necessarily translate to " taking their concerns seriously , " and the fact that the government is open to discussions may not be enough to mollify Australian civil rights groups .
And if even if the proposal becomes law , we do n't think we 're alone in feeling that if there are terrorists working at companies scattered throughout Australia , they are probably not trying to coordinate attacks on the country and its infrastructure through their work e-mail .
Government Failure Is Endemic

Before the Joint Economic Committee , April 2 , 2008 : Hearing on “ The Economic Outlook ”
Mr. Chairman , I have never been opposed to regulation , although my idea of regulation differs from that of many people in Washington .
The free market and its forces of supply and demand are the most effective regulator of the private sector , and have never been known to fail absent government intervention .
But piling more public sector regulation on the private sector will have a detrimental effect on the health of our financial system and sow the seeds for the next financial meltdown .
What we in Washington should be discussing is increased regulation and scrutiny of public sector regulatory and oversight agencies such as the Federal Reserve Board , the SEC , and others .
The Federal Reserve ’s actions got us into at least one depression in the last century , and have led to continued cyclical difficulties , including the current economic slowdown .
Back in the 1970s , government - caused inflation reached levels high enough that the Nixon administration decided to implement wage and price controls .
Placing blame on greedy speculators , unscrupulous mortgage originators , or panicky investors , is a common reaction on the part of government .
The solution called for , despite the numerous documented failures of government regulation , is always more regulation , more government involvement in and control over the economy , and less free enterprise .
Never is the blame placed squarely where it belongs , which is on the shoulders of legislators and regulators whose actions distort the market , prohibiting legitimate market activities and encouraging the development of labyrinthine and opaque financial schemes .
The latest regulatory plan from the Treasury Department , with the potential to turn the Federal Reserve into a super - regulator overseeing state - chartered banks and bank holding companies , and acting as a guarantor of market stability , is another in a long line of half - baked government responses to financial difficulty .
Recession after recession has not impressed upon government leaders the reality that the Federal Reserve ’s monetary policy activities are what lead to market instability .
The business cycle , contrary to what Secretary Paulson and others seem to believe , is not endemic to the free market .
It is always and everywhere the result of monetary inflation and subsequent malinvestment , which when it is discovered must of necessity be liquidated in order for a true recovery to occur .
Delaying the liquidation will only prolong the crisis and ensure that the next crisis will be more severe .
Every government intervention will result in a distortion of the market and a subsequent shock somewhere down the line in the future .
It is about time that we recognize the failure of government intervention , get our hands out of the private sector , and for once allow the market to function .

In every town in every part of this sprawling country you can find a faceless sprawling strip mall in which to do the shopping .
Rarely though would you expect to find a medical miracle working behind the counter of the mall 's hobby shop .
That however is what Lee Spievak considers himself to be .
" I put my finger in , " Mr Spievak says , pointing towards the propeller of a model aeroplane , " and that 's when I sliced my finger off . "
I think that within ten years that we will have strategies that will re-grow the bones , and promote the growth of functional tissue around those bones
Dr Stephen Badylak
University of Pittsburgh
It took the end right off , down to the bone , about half an inch .
" We do n't know where the piece went . "
The photos of his severed finger tip are pretty graphic .
You can understand why doctors said he'd lost it for good .
Today though , you would n't know it .
Mr Spievak , who is 69 years old , shows off his finger , and it's all there , tissue , nerves , nail , skin , even his finger print .
' Pixie dust ' How ?
Well that 's the truly remarkable part .
It was n't a transplant .
Mr Spievak re-grew his finger tip .
He used a powder - or pixie dust as he sometimes refers to it while telling his story .
Mr Speivak 's brother Alan - who was working in the field of regenerative medicine - sent him the powder .
For ten days Mr Spievak put a little on his finger .
" The second time I put it on I already could see growth .
Each day it was up further .
Finally it closed up and was a finger .
" It took about four weeks before it was sealed . "
Now he says he has " complete feeling , complete movement . "
The " pixie dust " comes from the University of Pittsburgh , though in the lab Dr Stephen Badylak prefers to call it extra cellular matrix .
Pig 's bladder
The process he has been pioneering over the last few years involves scraping the cells from the lining of a pig 's bladder .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It can be turned into sheets , or a powder .
It looks like a simple process , but of course the science is complex .
" There are all sorts of signals in the body , " explains Dr Badylak .
" We have got signals that are good for forming scar , and others that are good for regenerating tissues .
" One way to think about these matrices is that we have taken out many of the stimuli for scar tissue formation and left those signals that were always there anyway for constructive remodelling . "
In other words when the extra cellular matrix is put on a wound , scientists believe it stimulates cells in the tissue to grow rather than scar .
If they can perfect the technique , it might mean one day they could repair not just a severed finger , but severely burnt skin , or even damaged organs .
Clinical trial
They hope soon to start a clinical trial in Buenos Aires on a woman who has cancer of the oesophagus .
The normal procedure in such cases is often deadly .
Doctors remove the cancerous portion and try to stretch the stomach lining up to meet the shortened oesophagus .
In the trial they will place the extra cellular matrix inside the body from where the portion of oesophagus has been removed , and hope to stimulate the cells around it to re-grow the missing portion .
So could limbs be re-grown ?
Dr Badylak is cautious , but believes the technology is potentially revolutionary .
" I think that within ten years that we will have strategies that will re-grow the bones , and promote the growth of functional tissue around those bones .
And that is a major step towards eventually doing the entire limb . "
That kind of talk has got the US military interested .
They are just about to start trials to re-grow parts of the fingers of injured soldiers .
Skin burns
They also hope the matrix might help veterans like Robert Henline re-grow burnt skin .
He was almost killed in an explosion while serving in Iraq .
His four colleagues travelling with him in the army Humvee were all killed .
He suffered 35 % burns to his head and upper body .
His ears are almost totally gone , the skin on his head has been burnt to the bone , his face is a swollen raw mess .
So far he has undergone surgery 25 times .
He reckons he has got another 30 to go .
Anything that could be done in terms of regeneration would be great he says .
" Life changing !
I think I 'm more scared of hospitals than I am of going back to Iraq again . "
Like any developing technology there are many unknowns .
There are worries about encouraging cancerous growths by using the matrix .
Doctors though believe that within the so called pixie dust lies an amazing medical discovery .

What are these ?
At RailsConf on Friday , Avi Bryant and Bob Walker of GemStone revealed plans for the MagLev project .
MagLev will run Ruby on Rails within GemStone 's distributed object technology .
The MagLev VM , although only partially implemented , so far outperforms MRI 1.8 .
MagLev is a Ruby VM based on the GemStone S64 VM , which runs Smalltalk .
The Smalltalk VM has been extended with special byte codes to make it Ruby compatible .
GemStone 's Smalltalk VM has been used for over 20 years in sectors such as real time financial markets and the worldwide shipping industry .
It as a mature , fast , stable , distributed , and transactional data store which can hold over a trillion objects or 17PB ( Petabytes ) worth of information .
The goal of the MagLev project is to bring this distributed object technology to the world of Ruby on Rails .
Avi Bryant , core team member on Dabble DB and SeaSide , demonstrated MagLev 's distributed object technology running Ruby .
Using an irb session on one Ruby VM , he was able to share object data to an irb session in another VM by simply instantiating global objects .
Avi then demonstrated the BEGIN , COMMIT , and ABORT keywords that provide a fully transactional and ACID compliant concurrency strategy .
He was also able to access persistent data storage using this same mechanism .
In essence , MagLev was filling the roles not just of the VM but also the caching and persistent storage layers .
Bob Walker , who is the project manager for the MagLev project at GemStone , then spoke about the progress of the effort .
As of today , Bob Walker 's team has MagLev running about 36 of the Ruby Shootout Benchmarks significantly faster than MRI 1.8 .
They plan to use the Rubinius project 's Ruby Specs in order to verify compatibility .
They are currently three months into implementation .
Portions of the project will be open source , but the core VM , which is written in C , will likely remain closed source .
GemStone is still pondering a pricing model for MagLev. Bob Walker did state that there will be a free version available .
GemStone management speculates that a two or three tier pricing model is possible with either storage size or number of transactions defining the tiers .
GemStone has set up a project page where they promise ongoing information about the project will be available soon .
Read InfoQ's exclusive interview with Gemstone 's Bob Walker on MagLev
Q . The mayor of Miami said today that he would withhold any assistance from the city , including police , if federal authorities decide to return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba , and that if there were any violence in the streets he would hold you and Attorney General Reno personally responsible for that .
That seems to sound like an invitation for the community to block federal authorities and an assurance to them that the Miami police will stand aside .
A . Well , I like the mayor very much , but I still believe in the rule of law here .
We all have to , whatever the law is , whatever the decision is ultimately made , the rest of us ought to obey it .
Gun Control
Q. Mr. President , Charlton Heston is on the college speaking circuit and he said last night it amazes me that the president is so stubborn when it comes to guns .
And he notes that there are already 22,000 gun laws on the books by his count , which he says that the administration does not enforce .
Could you do more to enforce existing gun laws ?
And how do you feel about the attack that the N.R.A. has mounted on you and your administration ?
A . Well , let me answer the question on the merits .
Gun prosecutions are up under our administration and I have asked in this budget for a significant increase to enforce the laws , including more prosecutors , more A.T.F. agents .
But , again , I would make the main point , the N.R.A.'s position is that if somebody does something wrong , throw the book at them , but do not have any preventive measures when it comes to guns .
They believe that unlike every other area of our life , there should be no prevention .
So they say , they did n't want us to have the Brady bill .
They said it was too burdensome , but it has n't been burdensome .
They do n't want us to close the gun-show loophole , they say it 's too burdensome .
They 're not even for the research into smart - gun technology or for banning large - ammunition clips .
There 's a case where we have a law on the books , it can't be effectively enforced .
These assault weapons are illegal , but the big ammunition clips can be imported because of a loophole in the law , so a law we have can't be effectively enforced .
You know , I think that it 's just wrong to say that because of the Second Amendment and because there are a lot of people that like to hunt and sport shoot , that prevention plays no role in this .
How would you feel if I said , for example , the following : you know , all these people that go through airport metal detectors , 99.999 percent of them are law - abiding , good people , and it is really a pain to go through those metal detectors if you got a money clip in your pocket or a rodeo belt buckle on or something else , and you have to go through two or three times and take your belt off or whatever .
It 's just too burdensome and I 'm just sick and tired of it and I 'm going to take these metal detectors down in the airports .
And the next time a plane blows up , we 're going to throw the book at them .
Now , you 're laughing , but what if I said , you know , most people who drive are good , honest , responsible people .
And we should just , we ought to repeal the laws , the driver 's license laws and repeal the speed limits , and the next time somebody does something wrong and has a 25 - car pile - up , we 'll just throw the book at them .
I mean , a sensible society has a balance between prevention and punishment .
. . .
And in terms of their attacks on me , you know , that 's what I get hired to do , that 's part of the president 's job description , being attacked by people who disagree with him .
That does n't matter .
I still think Charlton Heston is a great actor and I love his movies and I still watch him every time I get a chance .
And I loved having him here at the White House not very long ago when he got one of the Kennedy Center Awards .
But that 's irrelevant to me .
The only question is , what is best for the safety of the American people ?
And guns are no different than any other area of our life .
We need a balance between prevention and punishment .
Q. A federal judge with whom you have disagreed in the past today said it was his opinion that you had committed a criminal violation of the Privacy Act by releasing those Kathleen Willey letters during the independent counsel investigation .
What do you think of that ruling and do you agree with the take of one of your legal advisers earlier today who called this judge '' a loose cannon ' ' ?
A. Did one of my legal advisers do that ?
Well , he does seem to have somehow acquired a significant percentage of the cases involving the White House .
That 's an interesting story , but anyway .
You know , obviously we do n't agree with the ruling and I can say that when the decision was made to release those letters , I did n't even have any conversation with anybody about the Privacy Act .
I never thought about it , never thought about whether it applied or not , and decided to do it reluctantly only because it was the only way I knew to refute allegations that were made against me that were untrue .
And I think they plainly did that , and I would not have done it otherwise .
But , I think in terms of the law , there are other reasons that I disagree with the law , with the idea that the Privacy Act , which was generally designed to protect people who had business with the federal government or were complaining about something that the government was doing or had reasons for confidentiality and having to give the government records .
There are all kinds of reasons for the Privacy Act .
And so I just do n't believe that .
I think that the opinion of our counsel 's office and many other judges who 've ruled on this is that act does not apply to this kind of correspondence in the White House .
And so we disagree and we 'll proceed accordingly .
I can't think of a clip that more perfectly illustrates the difference between conservative and liberal philosophy than this one from today 's " This Week . "
After George
Will pretty much gives the finger to the scores of American homeowners now choking under the weight of their massive mortgages , Paul Krugman and Robert Reich smack him down and set him straight .
Krugman offers an incredibly appropriate comparison to Herbert Hoover 's Treasury Secretary and a spot - on analogy to Hurricane Katrina .

Will :
The Republicans have now put themselves in a bind because people now say look if you have Wall Street socialism , whereby you save Bear Sterns , or at least save JP Morgan to buy Bear Sterns , and you are thereby socializing the losses and keeping the profits private , why not help everybody .
Soon we 'll hear from everyone in the country who has a student loan .
This is , it 's a burden , help me .
Krugman :
When I listened to McCain give that speech I immediately thought of Herbert Hoover 's Treasury Secretary .
Liquidate farmers , liquidate workers , liquidate real estate , purge the rottenness from the system .
You can't do this .
This is a major financial crisis .
You 've got to do something and that does include helping homeowners who were sucked in .
You know it would be a little different if Alan Greenspan had n't said you should all take out adjustable rate mortgages .
It would be a little different if the administration had n't said housing prices are going up .
If they had n't said there is no bubble .
So this is a situation where a lot of people have been hurt .
It 's a natural disaster in effect .
It 's like Katrina , and to say oh let people suffer is like saying let those people who made the mistake of staying in New Orleans suffer .

Die in ihrem Ortsverein Neustadt wegen Nacktfotos im Internet umstrittene SPD - Kommunalpolitikerin Birgit Auras darf für die Kommunalwahl im Mai nicht kandidieren .
Dies ist das Ergebnis einer mehrstündigen Diskussion im Ortsverein .
Es sei versucht worden , aufeinander zuzugehen und eine Lösung zu finden , aber es habe keine Bewegung gegeben , sagte Auras .
Die Modedesignerin musste vor kurzem auf Druck vorwiegend weiblicher Ortsvereinsmitglieder die Kandidatur zurückziehen , weil sie auf ihrer Homepage kaum bekleidet und in lasziven Posen für ihre Mode wirbt .
Auras hatte nach Bekanntwerden der Querelen angekündigt , doch zu kandidieren , wenn sich die Angreiferinnen – darunter laut Auras die Ortsvereinsvorsitzende Margit Giszas – entschuldigen würden .
Der Grund seien aufmunternde und zustimmende Worte vieler " auch wichtiger " Menschen gewesen .
Die 50 - Jährige hatte nach ihren Angaben bergeweise E - Mails bekommen , nachdem die Affäre um die Aufnahmen in der vergangenen Woche bekannt geworden war .
Laut Auras habe es auf der Mitgliederversammlung am Freitagabend jedoch keine Entschuldigung gegeben .
" Ich bin enttäuscht und habe später zu Hause bittere Tränen vergossen " , sagte die 50 - Jährige .
Sie wolle der SPD aber treubleiben .
Der Ortsverein sei ja nicht die Partei .

" Wir haben 2008 , nicht 1908 "
Giszas sagte , sie brauche sich bei Auras nicht zu entschuldigen , da sie sie nicht angegriffen habe .
Sie habe nur Beschwerden über den Internetauftritt weitergeleitet .
Sie betonte , dass sich bei der Versammlung der größte Teil der Mitglieder nicht hinter Auras gestellt habe .
Zuvor hatte Giszas " klar und deutlich gesagt " , dass sie nicht kandidieren werde , wenn Auras aufgestellt werde .
Sie wolle nicht mit solchen Fotos in Zusammenhang gebracht werden .
In eine eher konservative Kleinstadt wie Neustadt passe ein Verhalten wie das von Auras nicht .
Die Modedesignerin ist erst 2007 in die Hafenstadt mit rund 16500 Einwohnern gezogen und in die SPD eingetreten .
Kritik an der Posse aus Neustadt kam vom SPD - Landesvorsitzenden Ralf Stegner .
" Wir haben 2008 und nicht 1908 " , sagte er. Auch der Ehrenvorsitzende des Ortsvereins Neustadt , Hermann Benker , sah es als " absolut unangemessen " an , dass Auras vom relativ unaussichtsreichen Listenplatz elf gestrichen werde .
Seiner Ansicht nach , hätte die Liste unverändert bleiben und seine Partei der politischen " Newcomerin " Auras eine Chance geben sollen .
" Man kann nicht zufrieden sein mit dem Ergebnis der Veranstaltung , aber man muss hinnehmen , wie die Mitglieder abgestimmt haben " , sagte er .
Deus Ex Coming to GameTap's Free Game Roster Next Week
Often regarded as one of the most influential shooters ever developed , Deus Ex blended first - person shooter gameplay with a branching , complicated storyline , upgradable stats and skills and extensive character interaction .
A sequel , Deus Ex : Invisible War , was released in late 2003 .
The title will be playable via the service 's free - to - download launcher program , which allows users to browse and download a variety of PC and emulated console games .
Those players who do n't shell out the $ 9.95 per month for the " Gold " - level subscription can expect a 15 second video advertisement to air before each play .
In addition to Deus Ex , GameTap also offers Ion Storm 's Thief : Deadly Shadows and Doublefine 's Psychonauts among some 120 other titles in its free game roster .
WASHINGTON , April 22 ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon 's budget chief on Tuesday said she expects the total cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in fiscal 2009 to be less than the $ 170 billion estimate given earlier this year by Defense Secretary Robert Gates when pressed by U.S. lawmakers .
" I expect it to be less , " Pentagon Comptroller Tina Jonas told Reuters after a speech to a conference sponsored by Jane 's Information Group .
Jonas said she would meet with Gates later on Tuesday to discuss whether to give lawmakers a total estimate for war spending needs .
The Bush administration has already requested $ 70 billion in war funds for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 , and says it will need more .
Asked about the prospect that Congress might combine fiscal 2008 and 2009 war spending , Jonas told the conference she was confident that lawmakers would " come to some accommodation . "
Jonas said her concern was ensuring that the Pentagon had sufficient funds to pay soldiers and keep operations running .
The White House has warned Congress that it must approve additional war funds by the end of May or risk the start of Defense Department layoff notices .
Jonas said the Pentagon was working on contingency plans , just in case those funds were not approved .
" I think we 'll get there , " she said .
COST PRESSURES WEIGH
Jonas said total U.S. defense spending , including base budgets and supplemental war spending , was around 4.7 percent of U.S. gross domestic product , but said that was still lower than during other major conflicts .
For instance , defense spending totaled 8.9 percent during the Vietnam War and reached 6 percent during the defense buildup under former President Ronald Reagan .
She acknowledged defense spending had soared 71 percent in recent years , but said that rise was only 34 percent in nominal terms .
Rising operating costs remained a huge concern , given a tripling of fuel costs and steady increases in health care costs , she said .
In constant fiscal year 2009 dollars , the Pentagon budget was expected to decline 3.3 percent by fiscal 2013 , she said .
She noted that procurement spending was expected to increase 9 percent over the same period , when measured in constant 2009 dollars , but said research and development spending would decline nearly 14 percent .
She warned that pressures on defense spending were mounting given growth in U.S. entitlement programs such as health care for the poor and elderly and the next administration could be facing a possible " train wreck . "
Jonas also expressed concern about cost increases and schedule delays in major defense acquisition programs .
She said 17 programs had breached congressional cost overrun thresholds and required certification if they were to continue .
The portfolio of major defense programs had grown by 900 billion to $ 1.7 trillion since fiscal year 2001 , but cost growth accounted for 44 percent of that , Jonas said .
" That is a stunner .
We have got to do better in managing costs , " she said , noting that would be a big challenge for the next administration .

Over the last 24 hours , news about U.S. torture in Iraq has been leaking out :
The FBI was so disturbed at what they saw at Guantanamo that FBI staff created a " war crimes file " to document accusations against American military personnel at Guantanamo .
For example , the head of the FBI 's national security law unit wrote in July 2003 : " Beyond any doubt , what they are doing ( and I do n't know the extent of it ) would be unlawful were these enemy prisoners of war "
The U.S. military not only tortured prisoners for themselves , but also did the " dirty work " of " softening up " prisoners for Chinese interrogators
The U.S. has also tortured prisoners to death in Guantanamo , Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere .
Not bad enough for you ?
Well , the U.S. has imprisoned 2,500 children since 9/11 as " enemy combatants " , in violation of the Geneva Convention against classifying children as POWs .

If you 're not sick to your stomach by learning that your government has been killing and torturing people - including children - then you are a psychopath or a pervert .
Do n't try to tell me that torture is a necessary evil .
It is well - known by professional interrogators that torture does n't work .
Experts on interrogation say that torture actually interferes with the ability to gather useful information .
“ A few years ago people looked at L.N.G. as a solution to North America ’s gas needs , ” said Nikos Tsafos , an analyst with PFC Energy , a consulting firm .
“ But today we see that there is less L.N.G. around than people expected , and there is more competition for that L.N.G. from markets that are willing to pay more than the United States . ”
Not long ago , Cheniere was a darling of Wall Street .
It was widely praised for having the vision to plan four new liquefied gas terminals around the Gulf of Mexico to connect the country with supplies of natural gas from places like Nigeria and Egypt , gas once considered so worthless it was burned off .
Now the company ’s stock price has sunk from $ 40 to just over $ 5 since last fall .
“ The question that people ask is if L.N.G. does n’t come to the United States for another year or two or three , what is going to happen to Cheniere , ” acknowledged Charif Souki , the chief executive officer of the company .
While natural gas prices in the United States have spiked to over $ 11.80 per thousand cubic feet from $ 7.50 at the beginning of the year , the price that gas producers can draw in many other countries in the world is several dollars higher .
All they need are terminals in producing countries that can chill natural gas to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit for shipping across oceans and terminals in consuming countries that can regasify cargoes .

Just about the only place where demand for L.N.G. seems not to be growing is the United States , an abrupt shift from expectations as little as one year ago .
The Sabine Pass terminal was part of an estimated $ 7 billion construction of eight new L.N.G. receiving terminals being built around the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Coast over the last five years to guarantee plentiful domestic supplies .
With imports about 40 percent of the level of a year ago , and national receiving terminal capacity poised to double this year , the excess construction of import capacity has alarmed industry executives .

A Toronto youth has been charged with child pornography after allegedly threatening a girl online .
The girl told police the suspect , 15 , threatened her over the Internet and asked her to perform sexual acts .
The suspect contacted her through her computer and text phone messages for a month , she said .
Police executed a warrant at a Toronto home Thursday and seized three computers and a cellphone believed to contain evidence related to images of child pornography and threats made by the accused .
The accused has been charged with one count of extortion , one count of invitation to sexual touching , one count of possession of child pornography and criminal harassment .
A consortium of missile companies has announced a successful test firing of a sophisticated new " loitering munition " intended for service with the British Army .
According to Steve Wadey , UK boss of pan-European missile group MBDA :
" The successful Fire Shadow firing provides tangible evidence that the UK Complex Weapons Industry , led by MBDA , has responded to the challenges of MoD's Defence Industrial Strategy ...
This firing is an outstanding achievement for all those involved in Team Loitering Munition and also underpins the strategic partnering relationship with MoD for the Complex Weapons sector . "
The Loitering Munition is so called because it gets fired off into the sky and then lurks about for up to ten hours .
At any time , it can be ordered to suddenly plunge down onto a target and explode .
If no target crops up , it will self - destruct before running out of fuel .
According to the British Army , targets for the Fire Shadow lurker - bombs would be found by various means , including the use of the future " Watchkeeper " surveillance drone .
Loitering Munitions is a keystone of Indirect Fire Precision Attack , IFPA , the Royal Artillery 's plan to avoid being driven out of business by its rivals in the blowing - things - up - from - afar sector .
For almost a century now , artillerymen the world over have competed against airmen for work .
During much of that time , the cannoneers have felt safe in the knowledge that aircraft laboured under several terrible handicaps : they could n't operate in bad weather , they could n't stay overhead for very long , and they could n't normally get their bombs anywhere near the target - certainly not without flying so low they 'd quite likely be shot down .
But since the early 1990s technology has started to seriously change the game .
Smart bombs or missiles can hit with pinpoint accuracy from on high , in many cases regardless of weather .
Better yet , they can be carried by unmanned aircraft which can provide a presence overhead for long periods with comparative ease .
At the moment this still involves a serious manpower burden , but much of the manpower in question need never leave its home countries , and the rest does n't need to go further than a nice secure airbase in theatre .
Against this sort of background , the idea of putting a 700 - person artillery regiment - or even a battery of guns - outside the wire somewhere like Iraq or Afghanistan is starting to look seriously unattractive .
The soldiers and their huge fleets of heavy vehicles need vast amounts of fuel , ammo and supplies .
They and their logistics convoys are all targets for local insurgents , and the guns - while able to open fire quickly and keep firing for a long time - can't move about fast and safely the way aircraft can * .
There are artillerymen in Afghanistan , and occasionally the big guns do go out into the field and get fired .
But the gunners , as tends to happen nowadays , are spending a lot of time in the infantry role - and a lot of time operating drone aircraft .
Meanwhile , Coalition troops are tending to call for air cover more and more , and there is huge demand for " orbits " - permanent overhead patrols kept up by unmanned Predator drones , able to watch round the clock and strike at a moment 's notice .
An armed Predator orbit is a loitering munition and Watchkeeper combo writ large - and it's already in service .
But Predator - type armed platforms are run by the air force , in both the UK and America .
The British army gunners are hoping they can sideline the idea of having drone aircraft which can drop their own weapons .
Rather , you would have unarmed Watchkeepers teamed with loitering munitions - both systems operated from within theatre , by soldiers rather than airmen .
The soldiers have certain points in their favour here .
It 's very hard to make air forces devote resources to things like Predator orbits at the expense of lovely sexy fast jets - the US defense secretary has lately described the process as " like pulling teeth " , and the RAF has barely bestirred itself at all .
Air forces worldwide , when they see a rival service operating an aircraft of any type , tend first to seize control of it and then strangle it in favour of something they 'd like better .
The Army way of operating drones is potentially a lot cheaper , too , as they do n't feel a need to have everything done by expensively trained wings - on - chest officers .
So one can sympathise with the Royal Artillery and their IFPA Watchkeeper 'n' loiter - bomb scheming to some extent .
But overall , for us taxpayers the whole spectacle is an unedifying one .
It would be nice to see the armed forces simply buying lots of the new US Army Predator version - the " Sky Warrior " , which flies itself and needs no shifts of expensive pilots .
Sky Warriors should cost less than £ 10 m a pop - that , after all , is said by the UK MoD to be the replacement cost of a much bigger Reaper .
Unarmed Watchkeepers , by contrast , are to cost £ 17 m each - and then you need several daily salvoes of Fire Shadow lurking - death to back them up .
The cost of Fire Shadow ?
Hard to say , but IFPA is expected to cost a cool £ 500m .
Why do n't Her Majesty 's cannoneers just order a hundred - odd Sky Warriors instead of their 54 puny Watchkeepers ?
It would cost the same .
Then they would n't really need Fire Shadow , and the army could spend that half - billion on something else .
Like some desperately - needed Chinook helicopters for instance .
Or maybe paying their soldiers decently , so that people would actually join up .
Why do n't they do that ?
Because the RAF would n't let them , that 's why .
Even if the slug - balancers relented , it would mean a lot of people in various arms plants here in Europe having to go and find honest work . ®
* Except when slung under a helicopter - but this does tend to make people think you might as well cut out the middleman and have the aircraft drop the munitions itself .

Here 's what you need to know ...
Ignore the rampant misinformation about bench pressing .
These twelve steps are all you need .
Train triceps .
The bench press is n't really about pec strength .
Forget any " J - shape " BS you 've been taught .
Push the bar straight up .
Pull the shoulder blades tight and keep the elbows tucked .
Use compensatory acceleration to break through sticking points .
To bench big , you must train the lats on the horizontal plane .
That means you must do barbell rows .
Chasing 600 Pounds
I 'm supposed to be preparing for an upcoming seminar I 'm teaching , but there 's a problem :
All I can think about is my bench press .
You see , I train at Westside Barbell , which is renowned for producing world - caliber strength athletes .
I 've been a part of this group since 1990 .
Before that , I had spent five years stuck at a 1955 pound total in powerlifting .
Then I tore my right pectoralis major tendon while trying to bench 500 at a bench press competition .
I figured that was the end of competition days and thought about retiring from the sport .
Then I thought to myself , retire from what ?
I have n't done anything yet !
I had two options : keep training the way I always had and totally fall apart , or move to Columbus to train under the watchful eye of Louie Simmons .
It was n't that difficult a decision .
After the surgery I packed the car and moved to Columbus .
That was over 10 years ago .
Since then , my lifts have increased to a 935 - pound squat , 585 - pound bench and a 740 - pound deadlift .
This was after my surgeon told me I 'd never bench over 400 again .
Although my bench press has increased 85 pounds , it 's still a far cry from where it should be .
At Westside we have 34 guys benching over 500 pounds and eight benching over 600 .
( In fact , six of those eight guys press over 650 ! )
My bench pretty much sucks when compared to the others in the gym .
When people ask me for bench advice , I cringe because I 'm still chasing 600 .
I 've missed that mark five times in competition at the time of this writing .
I felt the need to write this because of the vast amount of misinformation out there on benching .
There are twelve steps to a great bench press .
If we follow them , perhaps you and I both will reach our bench press goals .
12 Steps to a Bigger Bench
1 – Train the Triceps
Years ago , if you had asked Larry Pacifico how to get a big bench , he'd have told you to train the triceps .
This same advice applies today .
This does n't mean doing set after set of pushdowns , kickbacks , and other so - called " shaping " exercises .
Training your triceps for a big bench has to involve heavy extensions and close - grip pressing movements such as close - grip flat and incline bench presses , close - grip board presses , and JM presses .
Various barbell and dumbbell extensions should also be staples of your training program .
Do n't let anyone try to tell you the bench press is about pec strength .
These people do n't know the correct way to bench and are setting you up for a short pressing career with sub -par weights .
You can find articles in major muscle magazines on how to increase your bench press , and the advice they 'll give will be to train your pecs with crossovers and flies .
This makes me wonder how authors like this ever get published , or better yet , how much the authors can bench themselves .
I believe articles should go under a peer review board before they get published .
I 'd like many of my peers to review these authors in the gym or on the bench to see how much they really know .
Bottom line : Train triceps !
2 – Keep Your Shoulder Blades Pulled Together and Tight
This is a very important and often overlooked aspect of great bench pressing .
While pressing you have to create the most stable environment possible .
This can't be done if most of your shoulder blades are off the bench .
The bench is only so wide and we can't change this , but we can change how we position ourselves on the bench .
When you pull your shoulder blades together you 're creating a tighter , more stable surface from which to press .
This is because more of your body is in contact with the bench .
The tightness of your upper back also contributes .
These techniques also change the distance the bar will have to travel .
The key to pressing big weight is to press the shortest distance possible .
3 – Keep the Pressure on Your Upper Back and Traps
This is another misunderstood aspect of pressing .
You want the pressure around the supporting muscles .
This is accomplished by driving your feet into the floor , thereby driving your body into the bench .
Try this :
Lie on the bench and line up so your eyes are four inches in front of the bar ( toward your feet ) .
Now using your legs , drive yourself into the bench to put pressure on the upper back and traps .
Your eyes should now be even with the bar .
This is the same pressure that needs to be applied while pushing the barbell .
4 – Push the Bar in a Straight Line
Try to push the bar toward your feet .
The shortest distance between two points is a straight line , right ?
Then why in the world would some coaches advocate pressing in a " J " line toward the rack ?
If I were to bench the way most trainers say to – with my elbows out , bringing the bar down to the chest and pressing toward the rack – my barbell travel distance would be 16 inches .
Now , if I pull my shoulder blades together , tuck my chin and elbows , and bring the bar to my upper abdominals or lower chest , then my pressing distance is only 6.5 inches .
Now which would you prefer ?
If you want to push up a bar - bending load of plates , you 'd choose the shorter distance .
Here 's another important aspect of pressing in this style .
By keeping your shoulder blades together and your chin and elbows tucked , you 'll have less shoulder rotation when compared to the J - line method of pressing .
This is easy to see by watching how low the elbows drop in the bottom part of the press when the barbell is on the chest .
With the elbows out , most everyone 's elbows are far lower than the bench .
This creates a tremendous amount of shoulder rotation and strain .
Now try the same thing with the elbows tucked and shoulder blades together while bringing the barbell to your upper abs .
For most people , the elbows are usually no lower than the bench .
Less shoulder rotation equals less strain on the shoulder joint .
This means pressing bigger weights for many more years .
I 've always been amazed at trainers that suggest only doing the top half of the bench press , i.e. stopping when the upper arms are parallel to the floor .
This is done to avoid the excess shoulder rotation .
All they have to do is teach their clients the proper way to bench in the first place !
5 – Keep Elbows Tucked , Bar Directly Over Wrists and Elbows
This is probably the most important aspect of great pressing technique .
The elbows must remain tucked to keep the bar in a straight line .
Keeping the elbows tucked will also allow lifters to use their lats to drive the bar off the chest .
Football players are taught to drive their opponents with their elbows tucked , then explode through .
This is the same for bench pressing .
Bench pressing is all about generating force .
You can generate far more force with your elbows in a tucked position compared to an " elbows out " position .
The most important aspect of this is to keep the barbell in a direct line with the elbow .
If the barbell is behind the elbow toward the head , then the arm position becomes similar to an extension , not a press .
6 – Bring the Bar Low on Your Chest or Upper Abdominals
This is the only way you can maintain the barbell - to - elbow position as described above .
You may have heard the advice , " Bring it low " at almost every powerlifting competition .
This is the reason why .
Once again , the barbell must travel in a straight line .
7 – Fill Your Belly With Air and Hold It
For maximum attempts and sets under three reps , hold your air .
Everyone must learn to breathe from their bellies and not their chests .
If you stand in front of the mirror and take a deep breath , your shoulders should n't rise .
If they do you 're breathing the air into your chest , not your belly .
Greater stability can be achieved in all the lifts when you learn how to pull air into the belly .
Try to expand and fill the belly with as much air as possible and hold it .
If you breathe out during a maximum attempt , the body structure will change slightly , thus changing the groove in which the barbell is traveling .
8 – Train with Compensatory Acceleration
Push the bar with maximal force .
Whatever weight you 're trying to push , be it 40 % or 100 % of your max , you must learn to apply 100 % of the force to the barbell .
If you can bench 500 pounds and are training with 300 pounds , you must then apply 500 pounds of force to the 300 - pound barbell .
This is known as compensatory acceleration and it can help you break through sticking points .
These sticking points are known as your " mini maxes , " or the points at which you miss the lift or the barbell begins to slip out of the groove .
What if the barbell gets stuck four to five inches off the chest ?
Everybody wants to know what exercise will help them strengthen this area , or what body part is holding them back .
The answer :
It is n't about what you do to strengthen the area where it sticks , but what you can do to build more acceleration in the area before the mini max .
If you can get the bar moving with more force , there wo n't be a sticking point .
Instead , you 'll blast through it .
Compensatory acceleration will help with this .
9 – Squeeze the Bar and Try to Pull It Apart
Regardless of the lift , you have to keep your body tight .
You 'll never lift big weights if you 're in a relaxed physical state while under the barbell .
The best way to get the body tight is by squeezing the bar .
We 've also found that if you try to pull the bar apart or " break the bar , " the triceps become more activated .
10 – Devote One Day a Week to Dynamic - Effort Training
According to Vladimir Zatsiorsinsky in his text Science and Practice of Strength Training , there are three ways to increase muscle tension .
These three methods include the dynamic - effort method , the maximal - effort method , and the repetition method .
Most training programs being practiced in the US today only utilize one or two of these methods .
It 's important , however , to use all three .
The bench press should be trained using the dynamic - effort method .
This method is best defined as training with sub-maximal weights ( 45 to 60 % ) at maximal velocities .
The key to this method is bar speed .
Percentage training can be very deceiving .
The reason for this is because lifters at higher levels have better motor control and recruit more muscle than a less experienced lifter .
For example , the maximal amount of muscle you could possibility recruit is 100 % .
Now , the advanced lifter – after years of teaching his nervous system to be efficient – may be able to recruit 70 to 80 % of muscle fibers , while the intermediate might be able to recruit only 50 % .
Thus , the advanced lifter would need less percent weight than the intermediate .
This is one of the reasons why an advanced lifter squatting 80 % of his max for 10 reps would kill himself while a beginner could do it all day long .
If you base the training on bar speed , then the percentages are no longer an issue , only a guideline .
So how do you know where to start ?
If you 're an intermediate lifter , start at 50 % of maximal and see how fast you can make it move for three reps .
If you can move 20 more pounds with the same speed then use the heavier weight .
Based on years of experience and Primlin 's charts for optimal percent training , we 've found the best range to be eight sets of three reps .
Based on Primlin 's research , the optimal range for 70 % and less is 12 to 24 repetitions .
We 've also found it very beneficial to train the bench using three different grips , all of which are performed within the rings .
This may break down into two sets with the pinky fingers on the rings , three sets with three fingers from the smooth area of the bar and three sets with one finger from the smooth area .
11 – Devote One Day a Week to Maximal - Effort Training
For the second bench day of the week ( 72 hours after the dynamic day ) you should concentrate on the maximal - effort method .
This is best defined as lifting maximal weights ( 90 % to 100 % ) for one to three reps .
This is one of the best methods to develop maximal strength .
The key here is to strain .
The downfall is you can't train above 90 % for longer than three weeks without having adverse effects .
Try performing a max bench press every week for four or five weeks .
You may progress for the first two , maybe three weeks , then your progress will halt and begin to work its way backward .
We 've combated this by switching up the maximal - effort exercises .
We rotate maximal - effort movements such as the close - grip incline press , board press , floor press , and close - grip flat press .
These exercises are all specific to bench pressing and all have a very high carryover value .
12 - Train the Lats on the Same Plane as the Bench
I 'm talking about the horizontal plane here .
In other words , you must perform rows , rows , and more rows .
If you want to bench big then you need to train the lats .
When you bench you 're on a horizontal plane .
So would it make sense from a balance perspective to train the lats with pulldowns , which are on a vertical plane ?
Nope .
Stick to the barbell row if you want a big bench .
By writing this article I 've realized that there are a few things I need to change about my bench pressing .
I bet you have too .
Correct the problems that might be keeping you from breaking your own personal record .
Remember , the smallest things often bring the biggest results .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - The Afghan government plans to investigate whether the United States used depleted uranium during its invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and if it might be linked to malformed babies born afterwards .
Parts of Afghanistan , particularly the mountainous region of Tora Bora in the east -- the suspected hideout of al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden -- came under heavy U.S. bombing in late 2001 when the Taliban regime was ousted .
Depleted uranium is a heavy metal used in some weapons that can pierce armour .
It has small levels of radioactivity associated with it .
Cases of malformed babies delivered in the heavily bombed Afghan areas have come to light , Faizullah Kakar , Afghan deputy public health minister for technical affairs said on Saturday , citing an unnamed U.S. expert .
Kakar told Reuters the Afghan government planned to investigate the matter .
“ We have decided to do a study to see what is going on .
We will take samples of soil , rocks , water in different areas where the war had taken place in the past and look in the same area to see if there is an excess of malformed babies , ” Kakar said .
“ It ’s then that we can tell you what is going on .
But until then it is still speculation , ” he said .
“ In Afghanistan , we have so many problems with nutritional deficiency , like folic acid .
So it ’s difficult to tell if it ’s due to depleted uranium or due to some nutritional problems or some other genetic issues , ” he said .
Asked if the United States had told Afghanistan if depleted uranium was used during the war , Kakar said : “ They have not told us that they have used it , but my source said it was used . ”
Kakar said he would like to see the study done as soon as possible , but the Afghan government , which largely relies on Western aid and troops , needed to find ways of funding it .

Dairy products do not help people lose weight

A review published in the May 2008 issue of Nutrition Reviews suggests that recent claims that low - fat diary products or calcium can help people lose weight are more of hype than science .
The review by Dr. Amy Joy Lanou at the University of North Carolina in Asheville and Neal D. Barnard associated with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicines in Washington DC found that 41 out of the 49 trials showed no effects of dairy products or calcium on weight .
Among the rest of trials on dairy products versus weight loss , two showed an increase in body weight , one showed a slower rate of weight gain while the other five showed weight loss .
The authors said the association between use of dairy products and weight loss in some " observational " studies may be due well to other factors such as increased exercise , reduced intake of high caloric foods and increased use of dietary fiber , fruit , and vegetables among other things .
" Our findings demonstrate that increasing dairy product intake does not consistently result in weight or fat loss and may actually have the opposite effect , " Lanou and Barnard concluded in their report .
Lanou was cited by Reuter as saying she was not a bit surprised by the findings because milk is intended for growth .
It just does n’t make sense that a food that has lots of calories , fats and protein would help weight loss .

More than half of the scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency who responded to a survey said they have experienced political interference in their work .
The survey results show " an agency under siege from political pressures , " said the Union of Concerned Scientists ' report , which was publicly released Wednesday and sent to EPA administrator Stephen Johnson .
The online questionnaire was sent to 5,419 EPA scientists in summer 2007 ; 1,586 replied , and of those , 889 reported that they had experienced at least one type of interference within the past five years .
Such allegations are not new : During much of the Bush administration , there have been reports of the White House watering down documents regarding climate change , industry language inserted into EPA power - plant regulations , and scientific advisory panels ' conclusions about toxic chemicals going unheeded .
But Francesca Grifo , director of the scientific integrity program for the Washington - based nonprofit group , said the survey documents the widespread nature of the problem at EPA .
" What we 've been up against until now is anecdotal evidence , " Grifo said .
She acknowledged that scientists who are frustrated and upset might have been more likely than those who are satisfied to respond to her organization 's survey , but also said : " Nearly 900 EPA scientists reported political interference in their scientific work .
That 's 900 too many . "
EPA spokesman Jonathan Shradar noted that administrator Johnson was previously a 27 - year career scientist himself .
" We have the best and finest scientific community in the world at EPA , " Shradar said .
" All of the issues we deal with are issues that we all are very passionate about .
It 's important that we let the scientists do the science and allow policymakers to do the policy work . "
The survey respondents were split over the effect of political interference on regulations .
According to the report , 48 percent believed that EPA 's actions are " frequently or always " consistent with scientific findings , while 47 percent believed that agency policy " occasionally , seldom or never " made use of its scientific judgments .
In optional essays , scientists repeatedly singled out the Office of Management and Budget at the White House , accusing officials there of inserting themselves into decision - making at early stages in a way that shaped the outcome of their inquiries .
They also alleged that OMB delayed rules not to its liking .
EPA actions " are held hostage " until changes are made , wrote one scientist from the agency 's Office of Air and Radiation .
Some also accused members of Congress of inappropriate interventions .
All of the respondents remained anonymous .
J. William Hirzy , an EPA senior scientist and union official , said politics trumped science at times during the Clinton administration as well , but " what we 're seeing now is ... the favoring of energy interests , coal - fired power plants .
That 's something different in this administration . "
On Wednesday , Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles , wrote to Johnson to ask him to be prepared to respond to the findings at a hearing in May of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .

China ’s higher education transformation and its global implications
Yao Amber Li , John Whalley , Shunming Zhang , Xiliang Zhao
A central element of China ’s unconventional development strategy has been industrial policies aimed at building domestic capabilities in sophisticated industries , though whether these have succeeded remains controversial .
1
Since 1999 , a similar strategy has been adopted in educational policy , and the emphasis on sophistication has resulted in a major transformation of higher education in China .

This transformation has involved major new resource commitments to tertiary education and significant changes in organisational form , reflecting China ’s commitment to continued high growth through quality upgrading and the production of ideas and intellectual property as set out in both the 10th ( 2001 - 2005 ) and 11th ( 2006 - 2010 ) 5 - year plans .
The number of undergraduate and graduate students in China has been growing at approximately 30 % per year since 1999 , and the number of graduates at all levels of higher education in China has approximately quadrupled in the last six years .
Entering class sizes and total student enrolments have risen even faster , approximately quintupling .
Much of the increased spending is focused on elite universities , and new academic contracts differ sharply from earlier ones , which lacked tenure and often used annual publication quotas .
These changes have already had large impacts on China ’s higher education system and are beginning to be felt by the global educational structure .
Skilled labour supply in China now equals around 40 % of that in all OECD countries , and the growth rate of student numbers is much higher than in the OECD .
In the coming years , these shifts may have major implications for global trade both directly in ideas , and in idea - driven products .
The changes we discuss also reflect a wider strategy of attempting to upgrade the quality and skill content of Chinese production through large increases in higher educational resource inputs and other changes in economic policy in China .
This strategy , adopted by high - level policymakers in China , is seemingly not driven by analysis of the demand side of labour markets .
The sharp increase in the number of individuals with higher educational attainment has created significant short - term problems of absorption and unemployment for such labourers in various areas .
These education policies have also been a factor in China ’s increasing inequality .
China ’s transformative strategy differs from that of most low - wage developing economies , such as India , which focus on primary or secondary rather than tertiary education .
The transformation has potentially major implications for the global educational system , as China ’s changes will have global impacts on relative supplies of skilled labour , academic publications , and trade in ideas and idea - related products .
The strategy may also change our perception of the link between education and growth .
Previous efforts in other countries to use educational transformation as a mechanism to initiate or maintain high growth have generally been regarded as unsuccessful , but those efforts focused on primary and secondary education .
China ’s efforts seem to be motivated by a desire to maintain high growth by using educational transformation as the primary mechanism for skill upgrading and raising total factor productivity .
If it succeeds , other countries may follow , leading to higher education competition .
Dimensions of China ’s higher education transformation
Large increases in the number of students
The number of graduate and undergraduate students in China has approximately quadrupled in the last six years .
Before 1999 , the number of students both graduating and enrolling was stable .
In 1998 , the total number of graduates from tertiary education was 0.8 million ; in 2005 , it was more than 3 million , a nearly threefold increase .
The number of enrolments ( of new and total students ) has risen even faster and approximately quintupled between 1998 and 2005 .
More Ph.D. engineers and scientists in China by 2010 than in the US
It is widely recognized that there will be substantially more Ph.D. engineers and scientists in China in 2010 than in the United States , as China produces three times the number of engineers per year . 3
In 2001 , only 5 % of American 24 year olds with a bachelors degree were engineers , compared to 39 % in China and 19 % or more in South Korea , Taiwan , and Japan .
R.E. Smalley , a Nobel Prize - winning scientist from Rice University , recently concluded that by 2010 90 % of all Ph.D. physical scientists and engineers in the world will be Asians living in Asia . 4
And among Asian Ph.D. engineers and scientists , most will be produced by China .
Markedly improved access to higher education for rural households
China ’s higher education transformation has considerably improved access to higher education for rural households .
As a result , the gap in access between rural and urban areas is gradually diminishing .
In the mid-1990s , conditional upon being in the urban sector ( including counties and town ) , the probability of high school graduates obtaining admission to university was around 0.3 .
That probability in 2005 is almost 0.5.5 Admission rates are higher than these numbers since not all high school graduates register for higher education entrance exams , and entrance exams are organized all over China .
Admission rates for the population in rural areas have risen much faster than admission rates for the urban population .
The promotion of elite universities and consolidation of other universities
Recent Chinese higher education policy promoted so - called “ elite ” universities and consolidated other universities , reducing their numbers .
Elite universities are the top ten universities in China , which receive the largest education funds from central and local governments .
They have priority in selecting students through national entrance exams and have the best faculty and research resources in China .
The policy focus is to elevate a small number of Chinese universities to world - class status while enlarging them .
All universities in China have in recent years been subject to directives from central ministries to substantially increase their undergraduate populations , even if the accompanying significant increases in infrastructure fall behind .
As a result , increases in undergraduates of 30 % per year have been common in many universities .
A shift from quantity to quality
These higher educational changes have been accompanied by a shift in focus from quantity flow in the pre-1999 period to an elevated emphasis on quality post -1999 .
Educational attainment in China is now subject to quantity indicators designed to drive continued improvement of educational quality by participating institutions : funding is no longer simply awarded in response to increasing the numbers of students enrolled .
Chinese higher education institutions are now subject to extraordinary pressures to upgrade themselves in terms of objective rankings .
High priority is placed on international rankings , taken as publications in international journals , citations , and international cooperation .
These measures of attainment are directly linked to institutions ’ funding .
Some of this focus on improved educational attainment in China seems to be spontaneous and accelerated by the policy process that exerts the pressure .
Indicators of educational attainments in terms of international rankings across countries , publications of papers , and citations feed directly into annual performance indicators for Chinese faculty in an ongoing process that goes substantially beyond the tenure - for - life system outside China .
It is not uncommon for an annual target of three international publications to be set for faculty members , and failure means termination of employment .
Concluding remarks
China may thus be the first case of a lower income country using major tertiary ( rather than primary or secondary ) transformation in educational delivery as a development strategy .
This educational transformation started in the late 1990s and may only be in its relatively early stages .
It has the potential to have major impacts on China , the global economy , and for global educational structure .
These reflect the increasing global importance of China ’s educational system and the competitive impacts of educational attainment .
China ’s educational transformation will be a central element of its integration into the international economy , but these implications have been discussed little .
There is , in our view , a need for further research in the area .

Director Sydney Pollack Dies of Cancer at 73 ( Photos )
Tootsie , Out of Africa and The Way We Were are just of few of the unforgettable films that the legendarydirected .
The talented filmmaker passed away on May 26 , at his LA home in Pacific Palisades at age 73 after a courageous 9 month battle with cancer .
" Stars are like thoroughbreds , " Pollack once told The New York Times .
" Yes , it 's a little more dangerous with them .
They are more temperamental .
You have to be careful because you can be thrown .
But when they do what they do best — whatever it is that 's made them a star — it 's really exciting . "
One of Pollack 's last projects was opposite George Clooney in the movie Michael Clayton .
He was producer and actor in the film and left the star with very fond memories :
Sydney made the world a little better , movies a little better and even a dinner a little better .
A tip of the hat to a class act .
He 'll be missed terribly . "
Pollack is survived by his wife , Claire ; two daughters , Rebecca and Rachel ; his brother Bernie ; and six grandchildren .
His son Steven Pollack died in a plane crash in 1993 .

Circles in the Sky
Credit & Copyright : Jean - Marc Lecleire Explanation : Gazing skyward on a sunny day in May , photographer Jean - Marc Lecleire captured this engaging display of ice halos forming complete circles in the sky .
Recorded with a fish - eye lens from a spot near the grand Château de Chambord in France , the picture looks straight up , spanning almost 180 degrees from horizon to horizon .
Surrounding the Sun is a halo formed by sunlight refracting through hexagonal - shaped ice crystals in high , thin clouds .
The halo is circular and exactly 22 degrees in radius , but it looks squashed because of the distortion of the extremely wide - angle lens .
Surrounding the zenith ( the point directly above the observer ) and always at the same altitude as the Sun is a lovely parhelic circle , caused by sunlight reflecting from ice crystals with nearly vertical faces .
On average more common than rainbows , beautiful ice halos can often be seen in planet Earth 's sky by those who know how to look for them .

Fingered by whistleblower ’s Mark Klein and Babak Pasdar for their role in illegally spying on Americans , AT&T and Verizon were awarded a major contract by the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , Washington Technology reports .
According to David Hubler and Alice Lipowicz ,
Verizon Business will perform the lion ’s share of the work on the Homeland Security Department ’s OneNet telecommunications contract with support from AT&T Government Solutions .
The OneNet award , under the General Services Administration ’s Networx Universal contract vehicle , has a maximum value of $ 970 million through March 2017 , DHS spokesman Larry Orluskie said .
( “ Verizon to Lead DHS OneNet Award , ” Washington Technology , May 15 , 2008 )
Carolyn Duffy Marsan avers ,
“ The Department of Homeland Security is looking for a partner to help them build , manage and secure their global network for … 22 agencies , ” says Marlin Forbes , regional vice president for Verizon Business ’ Federal Defense & International Services .
“ There ’s a huge legacy … from what they were doing in the past as separate agencies before they were part of DHS .
We think this deal goes right to Verizon ’s sweet spot . ”
( “ Verizon snares $ 678 million federal network deal , ” IDG News Service , May 15 , 2008 )
“ Sweet spot , ” indeed !
That ’s a lot of boodle however you slice it , for trampling on our civil liberties .
But no matter , since the House seems poised to pass “ compromise ” legislation that would grant “ limited immunity ” ( read , “ get - out - of - jail - free cards ” ) to enterprising telecom giants like AT&T and Verizon .
Under cover of granting the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court the power to determine whether anti-surveillance cases can go forward , the House undoubtedly will join their Senate colleagues in gutting constitutional guarantees not to be spied upon by “ outsourced ” corporate spooks in league with the national security state .
It ’s a “ win-win ” all around –for lobby - ensnared congressional leaders , the Bush administration and scandal - averse telecom executives–given that it ’s right - wing Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts , a Bushist sycophant , who gets to pick who sits on the secret FISA court .
Sounds like another “ slam dunk ” defense of civil liberties by “ opposition ” Democrats .
In March , AT&T won a $ 20 million contract for DHS ’ Customs and Border Protection agency .
Under terms of the 10 - year deal , AT&T “ will be the primary provider of network voice services to Customs and Border Protection ’s 47,000 employees around the country , ” Washington Technology explains .
Meanwhile , under terms of the closed - door deal with Verizon , the dodgy wireless carrier that “ partnered ” with the FBI on its illegal data - sucking “ Quantico circuit , ” Verizon Business will “ help combine the multiple , separate WANs at DHS ’ 22 agencies into one common , secure IP network , ” and “ manage and secure more than 5,000 agency sites worldwide and create a Security Operations Center for DHS , ” Hubler and Lipowicz report .
And considering all the hard work DHS does to “ secure the homeland , ” safeguarding America ’s borders from “ threats ” posed by poverty - stricken migrants escaping one or another “ free trade ” deal struck by the Clinton or Bush administrations , it sounds like money well spent .
Unless that is , you ’re an “ illegal ” immigrant on the receiving end of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) “ professionalism . ”
On Wednesday , The Washington Post reported that the U.S. government “ has injected hundreds of foreigners it has deported with dangerous psychotropic drugs against their will to keep them sedated during the trip back to their home country , according to medical records , internal documents and interviews with people who have been drugged . ”
That ’s right , the state ’s forced use of antipsychotic drugs on defenseless people unable to resist their deportation was repeated some 250 times , explained Post reporters who examined ICE records and court depositions in their excellent , though highly - disturbing report .
According to psychoanalyst Stephen Soldz ,
These drugs , especially Haldol are extremely powerful and are almost never utilized in individuals not diagnosed as actively psychotic .
They can be extremely uncomfortable , especially if first administered in high doses and can disorient an individual for days . …
The use of drugs by ICE is , unfortunately , part of a pattern by the Bush administration of the misuse of the health professions for non-therapeutic purposes .
I and others have written extensively about the role of psychologists in aiding national security interrogations , interrogations that often cross the line into torture . …
It is beginning to look as if there is a pattern of inappropriate use of psychopharmacological agents for overcoming resistances of various types .
( Stephen Soldz , “ Involuntary Drugging of Detainees , ” CounterPunch , May 16 , 2008 )
Needless to say , AT&T and Verizon Business care not a whit for the incalculable harm done in the name of the American people by their DHS “ partners ” ( in crime ) .
These days , corporate America ’s “ little Eichmanns ” may not have many trains to “ run on time , ” but from Guantanamo Bay to an ICE holding cell , and from the NSA ’s “ Terrorist Surveillance Program ” to the FBI ’s “ Quantico circuit ” one can easily discern the same seamless web of corporatist greed and corruption .
After all , $ 970 million buys a great deal of complicity–and silence .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. home foreclosure filings in April edged up from March and were a whopping 65 percent higher than a year earlier , real estate data firm RealtyTrac said on Wednesday .

Home foreclosure filings in April totaled 243,353 , up 4 percent from March , RealtyTrac , an online market of foreclosure properties , said in its U.S. Foreclosure Market Report .
The figure is a total of default notices , auction sale notices and bank repossessions .
“ The total number of U.S. properties with foreclosure activity in April was the highest monthly total we ’ve seen since we began issuing the report in January 2005 , ” James J. Saccacio , chief executive officer of RealtyTrac , said in a statement .
In March , home foreclosure filings had risen 5 percent from February .
The surge in foreclosures indicates an increasing number of homeowners are struggling to make mortgage payments amid the worst U.S. housing market downturn since the Great Depression .
RealtyTrac , based in Irvine , California , said the national foreclosure rate in April was one foreclosure filing for every 519 U.S. households .
“ These properties contribute to already bloated inventories of homes for sale , and put downward pressure on home values , ” Saccacio said , adding that the nationwide foreclosure rate could reach 2 percent by the end of the year .
“ Areas of California , Florida , Nevada and Arizona continue to be particularly hard - hit , ” he said .
Nevada , despite a 5 percent month - over - month decrease in foreclosure activity in April , had the highest foreclosure rate in the country , with one filing for every 146 households , followed by California and Arizona .
All three states had been among the hottest U.S. housing markets during the boom years from 2000 to 2005 .
Default rates and foreclosures have jumped over the past year as the housing market deteriorated .
As interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages reset higher , many homeowners who have been unable to sell their homes or refinance existing home loans amid a drop in home prices have been forced into foreclosure .
Nevada had 7,276 foreclosure filings in April , up 95 percent from April 2007 .
California ’s foreclosure activity was down less than 1 percent from the previous month , but it still ranked second highest in the nation with one filing for every 204 households .
California , the most populous U.S. state , reported 64,683 foreclosure filings , the most of any state and up 112 percent from April 2007 .
Saccacio noted that this also meant an erosion of property tax bases , which was putting municipal budgets in peril .
“ For example , the city council in Vallejo , California - part of a metropolitan area with a foreclosure rate that ranked sixth highest in the nation in April - last week voted to have the city file for bankruptcy , ” he said .
The city council of Vallejo , California voted last week to approve a petition for a bankruptcy filing for their former Navy town , which has seen revenues decline amid the housing slump while its employee costs have ballooned .
The vote positions Vallejo , a town of more than 100,000 residents along a main highway between San Francisco and the state capital of Sacramento , to become the first sizeable city in California to file for bankruptcy .
Arizona ranked third highest in the nation with one foreclosure filing for every 224 households in April , with 11,620 filings , up 26 percent from March and 181 percent higher than a year earlier , Realty Trac said .
Florida ranked fourth highest in the nation with one foreclosure filing for every 242 households in April , with 35,264 filings , up nearly 17 percent from March and 146 percent higher than a year earlier , Realty Trac said .
Some members hope Unasur could become a regional version of the EU
The leaders of 12 South American nations have formed a regional body aimed at boosting economic and political integration in the region .
At a summit in Brazil , they signed a treaty which created the Union of South American Nations ( Unasur ) .
Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said the move showed that South America was becoming a " global player " .
But tensions between several members will make it difficult for the group to achieve its goals , observers say .
Mr Lula said at the summit in Brasilia that the differences between some Unasur governments were a sign of vitality in the region .
" The instability some want to see in our continent is a sign of life , especially political life , " Mr Lula said .
" There 's no democracy without people [ protesting ] in the streets , " he added .
The treaty envisages that Unasur will have a revolving presidency and bi-annual meetings of foreign ministers .
Prior to the Brasilia summit , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez described the " empire " of the United States as Unasur 's " number one enemy " .
Mr Chavez is embroiled in a bitter diplomatic row with his Colombian counterpart Alvaro Uribe - a staunch US ally - over Colombian claims that Venezuela has been helping to finance the activities of the Colombian Farc rebels .
The Unasur members are Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Colombia , Ecuador , Guyana , Paraguay , Peru , Suriname , Uruguay and Venezuela .
BMW is poised to give the go - ahead to a tiny Zero Emissions Vehicle ( ZEV ) that will help to revolutionise city - centre driving .
The rear - engined city car could be called Isetta and will first arrive in American showrooms in 2012 .
The project was created because of new Californian regulations ( soon to be copied by 12 other US states ) which require big car makers to sell between a few hundred and a few thousand ZEVs every year from 2012 .
However , global sales of the new model are also likely , because BMW has decided that the concept will be ideal for sale in cities all around the world .
Indeed , many European cities have already established low - emissions zones .

SAN FRANCISCO  Comcast , the country ’s largest residential Internet provider , said on Thursday that it would take a more equitable approach toward managing the ever - expanding flow of Web traffic on its network .
The cable company , based in Philadelphia , has been under relentless pressure from the Federal Communications Commission and public interest groups after media reports last year that it was blocking some Internet traffic of customers who used online software based on the popular peer - to - peer BitTorrent protocol .
Comcast said it would change its fundamental approach to playing Internet traffic cop .
Instead of interfering with specific online applications , it will manage traffic by slowing the Internet speeds of its most bandwidth - hogging users when traffic is busiest .
“ In the event of congestion , the half percent of people who are overutilizing an excessive amount of capacity will be slowed down subtly until capacity is restored , ” the chief technology officer for Comcast , Tony G. Werner , said .
“ For the other 99.5 percent , their performance will be maintained exactly as they expect it . ”
More Analysis of the Environmental Impact of Walking vs. Driving
Last month I blogged about Chris Goodall ‘s claim that walking could exacerbate global warming more than driving if the person doing the walking gets his or her calories from foods like beef or milk .
A group called the Pacific Institute has done some further analysis of the data .
Their analysis suggests that for most reasonable assumptions about the diet of the walker , driving generates a greater carbon footprint .
I like how the Pacific Institute approached this issue .
They used data and clearly articulated assumptions to better understand these claims .
They put everything out on the internet so that people can check what they have done and challenge it if appropriate .
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. might take a lesson from this .
ITmediaニュースとMouRaバチェラーズニュースの共同企画「おもしろさは誰のものか」、そのバチェラーズサイドとして、今回はガイナックスの版権部門の長である神村靖宏氏にインタビューを行った（前編）。
ガイナックスは 「 優れた才能を持つアマチュアが集まり、プロとして作品をつくり始めた」という伝説を持つ集団（※）。劇場映画「王立宇宙軍・オネアミスの翼」（'87）、OVA
「トップをねらえ！」（'88）、「ふしぎの海のナディア」（'90）、「新世紀エヴァンゲリオン」('95)など、多数の名作を世に送り出してきた映像製作会社である。
（※）ITmedia編注：ガイナックスは、日本SF大会「 DAICON3」（1981年）のオープニングアニメーションに関わった学生らで構成した「ダイコンフィルム」が母体となって設立された。ダイコンフィルムは「DAIKON4」（1983年）で、当時人気の特撮番組をパロディ化した映像作品「愛國戰隊大日本」を発表し、アマチュア作品としては群を抜いた質の高さが話題になった。
同人誌に代表される活発なファン活動が、日本のキャラクター分野の豊かな土壌になっていることを否定する人は、そうは多くないだろう。しかし近年このファン活動も“ IT化” が進み、かつてはコミックマーケットのように限定された展示会で、手渡しで売られていた同人誌が、全国通販なども行われるようになった。
また以前なら ば “ 口コ ミ ” で感想を伝え合ったファンの交流だったが、現在では動画サイトにおもしろいと思った（あるいはその逆の）作品をアップロードするという行為も見られるようになった。
こうした状況について 「こうしたコミュニケーションが作品の人気に火をつけた」あるいは「人気を長期にわたって支えた」という声もある一方で、「DVDなど商品の利益を損なっている」という指摘もある。
企業活動全体が、 “ グローバルスタンダード ” を要求されるようになり、また製作委員会方式をはじめ、多数の企業の出資を受け入れて作品がつくられるようになると、一社の判断で「自分たちはグレーゾーンを容認する」とは打ち出しにくくなってくる。そして作品製作やその公開についても、条件を詳細に契約で定める必要も出てくる。
そこに、同人活動のようなグレーソーンは介在しにくい。だから規制もある程度しかたのないことではないかと思う。だがその一方で、創作という行為は、クリアな契約社会になじまない本能をともなっているようにも感じられるのだ。
そうした事情について、ガイナックス神村氏に取材した。ガイナックスはファン活動を母体にしたという少し変わった背景を持つプロの集団であり、たとえば「エヴァンゲリオン」では、ファンサイトのために簡単な申請を行えば使える画像を準備するなど、独自のスタンスを持つことで知られる会社である。そうした人たちならば、キャラクター分野の「グレーゾーン」について、どのように肌で感じているのだろうか。これがこの章の主題だ。
勢いをそいでしまってはつまらないじゃないですか
「 アニメブームの最初期のころ、『海のトリトン』('72)でファン活動が盛り上がって、それがさらに『宇宙戦艦ヤマト』('74)のときに広がっていった。当時もすでにそうしたファン活動が作品の人気の下支えをしているという認識は、かなりつくり手側にも伝わっていたと思います。
ファン活動って、最初にみんながやるのは啓蒙活動じゃないですか（笑）。こんなおもしろい作品があるんだ、自分はこういう読み解き方をしたとか、そうした情報を交換するのが同人活動だったんですけども、それが80年代に入ると様子が変わってきて、2次創作が主流になってきた。この作品のキャラクターを使って、自分の世界をつくります、というような。
まだ我々は版権元ではありませんでしたが、コミックマーケットの参加者がまだ数千人規模だったころ、当時は版権元側もファン活動について、『よくはわからないけれど、作品を盛り上げてくれているな』というくらいの認識で好意的に見ていた。そのころはまさかコミックマーケットが、あんなウルトラマーケットに育つなんて思っていなかったですからね。だからあまり、権利がどうとかいうことまで、考えてはいなかったんだと思います。
しかしそのマーケットが広がっていく過程で、なん度か制約の枷（かせ）をつくるタイミングはあったのでしょうけど、よくいえば枷をはめないままでうまくいってきた。言葉を変えると制御するタイミングを逸してしまったといえるのかもしれないですけども（笑）」
――やはりどこかでファン活動は制約されるべきだと感じているのでしょうか。
「 いや、僕はそういう風には思わないですね。ファンの勢いをそいでしまってはつまらないじゃないですか。これは、良い悪いという判断ではなくて、それではつまんないでしょうという感覚です。
まあ、やっぱり同人誌の中には、つくり手側にとってカチンとくるような表現だってないわけじゃないですけれども、まあ、それはそれで作品の楽しみ方のひとつではある。作品というものは完成してしまえば、つくり手の手を離れてしまうものですから、そこで起こった観てくれた人の感想やエモーションは、制御のしようがないものですよね。
ファン活動というものは、われわれ全体にとってプラスの効果を生んでいるとは思っていますけど、じゃあそれを定量的に、どれぐらいの額になるんだとか評価するのはもう、難しくてよくわからないです」
双方にとって非常によかった
――ただ同じファン活動でも、アマチュアがフィギュアなどの立体造形物をつくるガレージキットの世界では、イベント当日、会場内でのみ作品の販売が許諾される「一日版権制度」が生み出され、ファン活動でも、きちんと版権処理を行っているケースがあります。ガレージキットの即売会、ワンダーフェスティバルは、こうした制度にもとづいて運営されていますが、同人誌とちがってこちらはなぜ、このように成長したのでしょうか。
「 同人誌はある種放し飼いといいますか、版権元やもともとのライセンシーである出版社などが制御不可能な領域で発展してきた。しかし、同人誌はいわゆる市場商品とは競合しないと思うんですよ。たとえば『エヴァンゲリオン』の同人誌が合計で何万部売れたとしても、基本的には角川書店のコミックスの売り上げがそれで落ちるということはないと思います。
しかしガレージキットのほうは、精度が上がってくると市場商品との競合が発生しうるわけですよ。実際問題として、ガレージキットのせいでプラモデルが売れなくなるということはないとは思うのですが、同じ土俵に上がってしまうのは確かなんですよね。
だからもし、厳しい商品管理を行い、ロイヤリティを支払って商品を販売している世界に対して、アマチュアがつくった、プロに比肩し得る商品が無許諾で売られる世界がそのまま続いていたら、現在ではかなり問題視されていたと思います。
80年代に、小ロット低コストの立体複製技術が生まれて、それを使ったガレージキットメーカーが勃興してきました。ガイナックスの前身であるゼネラルプロダクツや海洋堂が、マニア向け製品の開発・販売をはじめた一方で、アマチュアの方々がポリパテとかプラ板の積層で『ガンダムをつくりました』とか模型誌のコンテストに発表したりしたのはこの時期です。その最初のころはやはり『できるからやっちゃった』みたいな勢いで無版権のファン活動といっしょくたの時期もありましたけど、比較的早い時期に、これをビジネスとしてしっかりやっていきたいという覚悟がガレージキットメーカー側にあったんでしょうね。
あの時期、武田（康廣 現、ガイナックス取締役統括本部長）たちが、版権元から許諾を受けて、個人であってもイベント会場で自分がつくったものを販売できるという仕組みをひねり出しましたが、それがもう20年以上現役のシステムとしてうまく動いていますし、他のイベントでも採用されています。
当日版権のようなシステムが発明されたのは、ガレージキットにとっても幸せだったし、メーカー製の立体商品にとっても、ガレージキットの世界でつちかわれたセンスがものすごくフィードバックされていますから、非常によかったと思います」
確かに。一般的に同人誌発売イベントの会場では、漫画家や担当編集者に、その作品の同人誌が届けられる光景すら見られることがあり、その点では牧歌的であった。一方、ゲーム業界のように漫画、アニメの後を追ってファン活動の対象の分野として勃興してきた分野ではより版権管理が厳しいケースもあると聞くが、それは市場商品との競合の観点から見れば、もっともな話である。PCゲームはむしろ立体造形物に近く、数人のアマチュアが、そうプロとは変わらない作品をつくることが可能ではあるからだ。

Matthew , 26 , looks through the glass at his enclosure at an animal sanctuary in Vienna on May 4 , 2007 .
The chimp probably does not know if he wants to be human or not .
And that could be one of the many differences that separates him from us .
Still , anthropologists admit it 's hard to define what it is to be human .
Matthew , a 26 - year - old chimp , is headed to court in Europe as part of a human effort to classify him as a person .
Beyond the legal challenges , anthropologists say chimpanzees are not humans , though without a clear definition of what it means to be human , backing that claim up is a challenge perhaps fit for some great courtroom drama .
Animal rights activist and teacher Paula Stibbe , along with the Vienna - based Association Against Animal Factories ( AAAF ) , says she wants the chimpanzee , named Matthew Hiasl Pan , declared a person .
That way , Stibbe says she can become the primate 's legal guardian if the bankrupt animal sanctuary where Matthew lives closes .
( Under Austrian law , only humans are entitled to have guardians . )
The appeal has been filed in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg , France .
The case comes after Austria 's Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling in January , which rejected a request to appoint the chimp with a legal guardian .
The rulings did not address whether a chimpanzee could be declared a person .
" His life depends on this decision , " Eberhart Theuer , the animal rights group 's legal advisor , told the Evening Standard , a tabloid newspaper in London .
" This case is about the fundamental question :
Who is the bearer of human rights ?
Who is a person according to the European Human Rights Charter ? "
For some scientists , the question of humanness is a tricky one , as no single characteristic separates humans from every other animal .
And behaviors once thought exclusive to us , such as tool - making , exist in many non-human primates .
Considered our closest living relatives , chimps behave a lot like us and even share about 96 percent of their DNA sequence with humans .
But the bottom line is , chimps are chimps , not humans , say anthropologists .
" Granted , chimpanzees show many similarities with us as humans , " said John Mitani , a primate behavioral ecologist at the University of Michigan , " but they are nonetheless chimpanzees , not humans , and are obviously different as well . "
Chimp characteristics
One anthropologist says the chimp dilemma brings up an animal - rights issue .
" We do n't have a real formal venue for chimpanzees that have outlived their usefulness to whatever humans sort of owned them , " said Jonathan Marks of the University of North Carolina , Charlotte .
" Obviously it 's a situation that needs to be addressed , but it needs to be addressed in the realm of animal welfare .
Confusing humans for chimps never did anybody any good . "
But is Matthew really like you and me ?
" Everybody who knows him personally will see him as a person , " Stibbe told the Evening Standard .
Yet the definition of what it means to be a person , to be human , is a work in progress .
" One of the hard things is there is no single characteristic that has been found that makes humans truly unique , " said Sarah Brosnan of Georgia State University .
Brosnan studies social behavior and cognition in non-human primates .
Making matters worse , chimps show a smorgasbord of behaviors once tagged to humans only , including altruism , tool - use , an ability to learn from their kin and deal - making behaviors .
Looking to genetics for an answer is also thorny .
If you were to line up any string of nucleotides ( structural units ) from a chimp 's DNA with the corresponding human strand , about 96 or 98 out of 100 of the nucleotides would match up .
" Nobody is going to look at a human genome and a chimp genome and mix them up , " Brosnan said .
" But human genomes are different from each other , so it depends on where you draw the line . "
Chimp - human split
About 6 million years ago , chimpanzees and human ancestors diverged .
Chimps went their way , and we began to go ours .
The split led to various differences .
For instance , chimps are covered in hair and we are much less so .
A chimp 's brain is about one - third the size of an average human brain .
And we walk upright on two legs , while chimps typically walk on all fours .
" What seems to have happened initially is that our ancestors began walking most of the time upright on two legs , " Marks said .
Along the way , our ancestors shed their thick coats of body hair , which allowed us to disperse body heat differently from chimps .
Chimpanzees , like most mammals , pant to keep their bodies from heating up .
Humans sweat .
Apparently , Marks said , when our ancestors began speaking , their vocal tracts reorganized and that made it difficult to pant .
Teeth tell a tale , too .
Along our evolutionary trek , human ancestors developed much smaller canine teeth , while chimps still sport the dagger - like teeth .
" Male chimpanzees have canine teeth much larger than female chimpanzees , " Marks told LiveScience .
" That difference does n't exist in humans .
We call our lawyers instead of bearing our canine teeth .
And women can call their lawyers just as readily as men can . "
Animal rights
Even still , activist Stibbe says the legal standing is the only way to ensure the chimp 's survival .
" In his home in the African jungle , he would have been well able to look after himself without a guardian , " Stibbe said .
" But since he was abducted into an alien environment , traumatized and locked up in an enclosure , it did become necessary for me to act on his behalf to secure the donation money for him and to avoid his deportation . "
Marks disputes Stibbe 's statement , saying that in nature chimps do have guardians , or other chimps to watch their backs .
" That 's ridiculous .
Chimpanzees are very social creatures , " Marks said .
" One of the other tragedies of this chimpanzee is it seems to have grown up largely in isolation from other chimpanzees . "
If Matthew the chimp were declared a person , scientists foresee it would open a messy can of worms .
" In general , I do n't think that it 's a good idea to grant chimpanzees legal human rights , " Mitani said .
" Chimpanzees are well - known to kill each other .
What would we do to perpetrators of those ' crimes ? ' "
And what about other animals , like dogs and dolphins : A chimp - is - a - person ruling could trigger similar court cases in support of non-human animals getting human status , said Brosnan and other anthropologists .
( CNN ) -- Six Baha'i leaders in Iran were seized and imprisoned this week , the religious group said .
The act prompted condemnation and concern from the movement and a top American religious freedom panel .
A U.S. panel says attacks on Iran 's Baha 'is have increased since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president .
Iranian intelligence agents searched the homes of the six on Wednesday and then whisked them away , according to the Baha'i's World News Service .
The report said the six are in Evin prison and that the arrests follow the detention in March of another Baha 'i leader .
The Iranian Foreign Ministry could not immediately be reached for comment , and the incident has not been mentioned in Iran 's state - run media .
" Their only crime is their practice of the Baha'i faith , " said Bani Dugal , the principal representative of the Baha 'i international community to the United Nations .
The U.S. State Department issued a statement Friday " strongly " condeming the arrests , which it said were " a clear violation of the Iranian regime 's international commitments and obligations to respect international religious freedom norms .
" We urge the authorities to release all Baha 'is currently in detention and cease their ongoing harassment of the Iranian Baha'i community , " the U.S. statement said .
The group -- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- says the arrests are reminiscent of roundups and killings of Baha 'is that took place in Iran two decades ago .
" Especially disturbing is how this latest sweep recalls the wholesale arrest or abduction of the members of two national Iranian Baha 'i governing councils in the early 1980s -- which led to the disappearance or execution of 17 individuals , " Dugal said .
" The early morning raids on the homes of these prominent Baha 'is were well - coordinated , and it is clear they represent a high - level effort to strike again at the Baha 'is and to intimidate the Iranian Baha 'i community at large , " she added .
The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom -- a government panel that advises the president and Congress -- condemned the Wednesday arrests , as well as another in March .
The commission chairman called the acts the " latest sign of the rapidly deteriorating status of religious freedom and other human rights in Iran . "
The commission said the seven were members of an informal Baha 'i group that tended to the needs of the community after the Iranian government banned all formal Baha'i activity in 1983 .
The commission chairman , Michael Cromartie , echoed the fears that the " development signals a return to the darkest days of repression in Iran in the 1980s when Baha 'is were routinely arrested , imprisoned , and executed . "
The Baha 'is are regarded as " apostates " in Iran and have been persecuted there for years .
" Since 1979 , Iranian authorities have killed more than 200 Baha 'i leaders , thousands have been arrested and imprisoned , and more than 10,000 have been dismissed from government and university jobs , " the commission said .
The commission said that since President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad came to power a few years ago , Baha 'is " have been harassed , physically attacked , arrested , and imprisoned . "
" During the past year , young Baha 'i schoolchildren in primary and secondary schools increasingly have been attacked , vilified , pressured to convert to Islam , and in some cases , expelled on account of their religion . "
The commission said other groups in the predominantly Shiite Muslim country of Iran , such Sufis and Christians , are subject to intimidation and harassment .
Ahmadinejad 's inflammatory statements about Israel have " created a climate of fear " among the country 's Jews .
The Baha 'is say they have 5 million members across the globe , and about 300,000 in Iran .
The Baha 'is say their faith " is the youngest of the world 's independent religions " and that its basic theme is that " humanity is one single race and that the day has come for its unification in one global society . "
They say their founder , Baha'u ' llah ( 1817 - 1892 ) , is regarded by Baha 'is as " the most recent in the line of Messengers of God that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham , Moses , Buddha , Krishna , Zoroaster , Christ and Muhammad . "

Write a thing about the best videogames of all time , the Guardian commands me .
And I obey .
But space is short , so I 've done it in instalments ( part two next week ) .
Bear in mind that these are n't the best videogames of all time , just a personal and possibly perverse selection , listed in order of release , not merit .
Anyway : insert coin .
Hit start button .
Asteroids ( 1979 , Atari )
Of all the early monochrome classics , Asteroids was my favourite , because it 's truly bleak .
Rather than aliens or robots , your enemies are unthinking lumps of rock that are hurtling through space .
Twirling somewhere in the middle of this cluttered void is your tiny , heartbreakingly fragile spaceship , armed only with a feeble electric peashooter .
If Asteroids has a message , it 's this : you are insignificant , the universe does n't care about you , and you are definitely going to die .
Brilliant .
Pac - Man ( 1980 , Namco ) Pac - Man himself may be an ultimately unknowable yellow disc , but his spectral pursuers had proper googly eyes and everything .
And nicknames .
And blood types .
OK , not blood types .
But this was one of the first games with identifiable characters , which goes a long way to explaining its success .
3D Deathchase ( 1983 , Micromega ) A Spectrum game in which all you had to do was avoid trees and shoot fellow motorcyclists .
Simple , speedy pseudo - 3D graphics meant suddenly you were starring in the bike section from Return Of The Jedi .
Yes .
You really bloody were .
Stop The Express ( 1983 , Hudson Soft ) A rare Japanese Spectrum game , this was an insanely breakneck combat / platformer in which you had to scamper along the top of a runaway train , fighting assassins and dodging obstacles .
Best of all , when you beat it , your sole reward was a caption reading " Congraturation !
You sucsess ! "
Elite ( 1984 , Acornsoft )
Most home computer games were simplistic , flick - screen affairs in which you played a fat mayor jumping over a nettle or something like that .
Then Elite came along and took the piss .
A groundbreaking 3D space combat - and - trading simulator that managed to convince me my computer could , when programmed correctly , house an entire alternative universe .
Jet Set Willy ( 1984 , Software Projects )
Back in the day , you needed only a single programmer to create a game - and since said programmers were often geeked - out stoners , said games were often weird .
Jet Set Willy 's blend of flying pigs , in - jokes , Python and Freak Brothers references encapsulates the homebrew quirkiness of the cottage industry software scene of the early 80s .
We shall not see their like again .
The Hitchhiker 's Guide To The Galaxy ( 1984 , Infocom ) Still one of the only games to contain proper , structured jokes , H2G2 was a text adventure co-written by Douglas Adams himself .
It was also the first postmodern game , since it knew it was a game , and also knew you knew , so sometimes it would refer to you as Arthur Dent ( star of the game ) and other times simply as you ( the player controlling him ) - whichever seemed funniest at the time .
The Sentinel ( 1986 , Firebird )
You played a nomadic consciousness that had to absorb parts of the 3D landscape , then transfer itself inside a series of motionless avatars in order to travel - your goal being to ascend the highest peak before the ominous Sentinel stared you to death with his huge , cycloptic eye .
In other words , it makes sense only when you play it .
Kato Chan And Ken Chan ( 1988 , Hudson Soft )
An import - only title for the PC Engine ( a tiny Japanese console ) , Chan And Chan was a below - average platform game - but one that revolved , startlingly , around shitting , farting and pissing .
The point at which I first grasped the illicit joy of off - kilter Japanese imports .
( Also for the PC Engine : Toilet Kids , a shoot - em - up in which you fired turds at flying penises . )
Tetris ( 1989 )
There can't be a human being on Earth who does n't love Tetris .
Perpetual order from perpetual chaos .
The most inherently satisfying video game ever created .

China 's H - 8 stealth bomber may be more advanced than the American B - 2A and capable of delivering a 350 - kiloton nuclear warhead to the continental United States , or it could be a mock - up of the A - 12 " Flying Dorito . "
PLAAF
Those are just two of the rumors accompanying a video trumpeting some recent triumphs of Chinese aviation .
Although it 's " top secret , " Chinese quasi- official Web sites brag that the Xian H - 8 is a stealth carbon fiber , " special nanotechnology " - coated strategic heavy bomber .
What we know for sure is that it has a range of 11,000 kilometers , without refueling , but it could refuel if it wanted to -- possibly .
In any case , it has extralarge fuel tanks .
It has a crew of two and travels at Mach 1.2 , or maybe 1.4 .
It carries an 18 - ton bomb payload and / or 12 new stealth cruise missiles with a range of 3,000 kilometers .
And three nuclear missiles , at least .
A prototype was successfully tested last year ( witnessed by the deputy mayor of Xian ) and will enter mass production and active service in the People 's Liberation Army Air Force by 2010 .
Then again , it 's an enlarged version of the H - 6 with the underwing engines , a project that was canceled in the 1970s .
It has four Ws - 10A engines based on Russian or U.S. technology -- or both -- and was designed by the 603 Institute .
Oh , and it was made possible by stolen American technology .
Even with pilfered stealth technology , though , China will probably not have had " enough time to ( successfully ) fabricate and assemble a working aircraft , " Taiwan 's Ministry of National Defense hopes .
And the " Flying Dorito " ?
The stealth McDonnell Douglas A - 12 carrier - borne attack aircraft was canceled in the 1990s by then -Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney .
Or was it ?
Forgoing sleep is like borrowing from a loan shark .
Sure you get that extra hours right now to cover for your overly - optimistic estimation , but at what price ?
The shark will be back and if you ca n’t pay , he ’ll break your creativity , morale , and good - mannered nature as virtue twigs .
Now we all borrow occasionally and that ’s okay if you fully understand the consequences and do n’t make it a habit .
I did that the other night .
We pushed an update to OpenBar , which had me working until 1:30 AM .
That would n’t have been so bad if it was n’t because I got woken up at 5 AM to help deal with an issue that arose .
But the costs the following day were typical , numerable , and expensive :
Stubbornness :
When I ’m really tired , it always seems easier to plow down whatever bad path I happen to be on instead of reconsidering the route .
The finish line is a constant mirage and I ’ll be walking in the desert for much longer than was ever a good idea .

The finish line is a constant mirage and I ’ll be walking in the desert for much longer than was ever a good idea .
Lack of creativity :
What separates programmers who are 10 x more effective than the norm is not that they write 10 x as many lines of code .
It ’s that they use their creativity to solve the problem with 1/10th of the effort .
The creativity to come up with those 1/10th solutions drops drastically when I ’m tired .

The creativity to come up with those 1/10th solutions drops drastically when I ’m tired .
Diminished morale :
When my brain is n’t firing on all cylinders , it loves to feed on less demanding tasks .
Like reading my RSS feeds for the 5th time today or reading yet another article about stuff that does n’t matter .
My motivation to attack the problems of real importance is not nearly up to par .

Irritability : If you encounter someone who ’s acting like an ass , there ’s a good chance they ’re suffering from sleep deprivation .
Your ability to remain patient and tolerant is severely impacted when you ’re tired .
I know I ’m at my worst when sleep deprived .
These are just some of the costs you incur when not getting enough sleep .
None of them are desirable .
Yet somehow it seems that the tech industry has developed a masochistic sense of honor about sleep deprivation .
At times it sounds like bragging rights .
People trying to top each other .
For what ?
To seem so important , so in need , so desired that humanity requires you to sacrifice ?
Chances are you ’re not that special , not that needed , and the job at hand not that urgent .
Software development is rarely a sprint , it ’s a marathon .
It ’s multiple marathons , actually .
So trying to extract 110 % performance from today when it means having only 70 % performance available tomorrow is a bad deal .
You end up with just 77 % of your available peak .
What a bad trade .
This is why I ’ve always tried to get about 8 1/2 hours of sleep .
That seems to be the best way for me to get access to peak mental performance .
You might well require less ( or more ) , but to think you can do with 6 hours or less is probably an illusion .
Worse , it ’s an illusion you ’ll have a hard time bursting .
Sleep - deprived people often vastly underestimate the impact on their abilities , studies have shown .
So get more sleep .
Stop bragging about how little you got .
Make your peak mental capacity accessible .
Gimme that Old - Time Irreligion
a book review by Norman Levitt
The very first thing I did in drafting this review was to Google Chester Alan Arthur .
I trust my readers will recall the name , if only after a bit of head - scratching , as that of one of the most obscure and unmemorable of American presidents , a run -of - the - mill New York politician who attained to the highest office in the land by virtue of the assassination of his almost equally obscure predecessor , James A. Garfield , who picked the party wheel - horse Arthur as his running mate for reasons now totally forgotten .
What has this to do with John A. Paulos ’s recent book Irreligion ?
It is well known , of course , that some our most eminent presidents — Jefferson , Lincoln , Madison — spurned orthodoxy in religious matters , even to the point of — to use Paulos ’s convenient title — irreligion .
This , of course , is sufficiently embarrassing to our fundamentalist ayatollahs that they have been furiously rewriting history , chiseling away at the facts with all the fury of the restored priests of Amun hacking off Nefertiti ’s heretical nose .
What interested me more , however , was the question of whether disdain for religion was purely the province of politicians who where gifted intellectuals as well , or whether it was at one point so widespread and socially acceptable that even routine mediocrities , hacks , and tub - thumpers could espouse such views without being banished from public life and high office .
So I picked me a president — the most unmemorable I could find ( Millard Fillmore is too memorable for being unmemorable ) — and took a peek at what is known or surmised about his religious convictions .
Chester Alan Arthur fit the bill admirably .
According to The Religious Views of our Presidents , by Franklin Steiner , Arthur finds his place in the list under the heading “ Presidents whose religious views were doubtful . ”
In the 19th century , at least , political viability of an aspiring public figure was not unconditionally dependent on a show of religious enthusiasm .
That is not to say that affected reverence for faith ( as well as open hostility to the “ wrong ” faith ) were absent from the political stump .
Then , as now , candidates and office holders often made a big show of their ostensible piety .
But they did so in a society where it was more or less understood and expected that a broad spectrum of attitudes toward religion , as such , existed , that “ freethinkers ” and “ infidels ” were part of that spectrum , and that the “ village atheist ” was a standard , and even admirable element of the intellectual scene .
The celebrity of such writers as Mark Twain ( a doubter ) and Ambrose Bierce ( an atheist outright ) attests to this .
The phenomenon of the atheist celebrity continued even into the first part of the 20th century , most notably in the person of America ’s great curmudgeon , H.L Mencken .
Somehow that tradition died away by stages in the Cold War era , so much so that by the turn of the new century the Bush administration brought religion back into the White House , and in the run up to the 2008 presidential election , a loony fundamentalist preacher like Mike Huckabee was taken seriously as a presidential candidate , while the others in both parties fell into line , sincerely or otherwise , to demonstrate that their own piety was at least minimally acceptable .
In particular , the presumptive Republican standard bearer John McCain , having indiscreetly uttered some home truths about the religious right in the past , had to crawl and snivel ( flip - flopping extravagantly ) in order to make his peace with that odious crowd before he could seize the party ’s crown .
Paulos ’s Irreligion
Given this religious revival , it is of more than passing interest to note the recrudescence of blatant and aggressive atheism in the past couple of years .
All of a sudden , the lonely or isolated non-believer can find a veritable library of god - debunking literature to sustain him merely by taking a brief on - line tour of Amazon and the like .
Note that this is no longer the cantankerous low - rent pamphleteering of a few lonely cranks or the screeds of minuscule contrarian sects , as might have been the case a decade ago .
Rather , these books come from big - time commercial publishers savvy about the likelihood of finding profit in the denunciation of prophets , and from authors of some prior repute , often with heavy - caliber academic credentials .
Now , mathematician John Alan Paulos , best known as the author of Innumeracy , has joined the lists with his newest book , Irreligion .
Paulos deserves high praise for turning out a book that is brief , forthright , and amiable .
While making the same basic points as , say , Dawkins ’s The God Delusion , it avoids the often choleric tone of that work , keeping a light , conversational tone where Dawkins hurls flaming rhetorical fireballs of denunciation .
This is not meant as a criticism of Dawkins , whose grim disgust with the cruel absurdities of religion echoes what many of us feel in our hearts .
But it does point up the fact that an atheist world - view does not necessarily lead to a foul - tempered misanthropy that is forever giving voice to searing disdain for a species that is so nasty and foolish as to delude itself into religious fervor .
Paulos ’s cheery offhandedness , which never declines into mere diffidence , clearly makes the point that to be an atheist , one does not need to be a professional malcontent .
The book is organized in a way that readers inclined to skepticism but who have never seriously studied the debate over the viability of theism will find convenient and quite useful in their private debates with friends , relatives , and even clergymen of various persuasions .
Paulos lays out , seriatim , most of the classical philosophical arguments for the existence of a deity , and immediately refutes them as they arise .
Thus we find the ontological argument , the argument from First Cause , the argument from design , the argument from the seeming existence of moral universals , and so forth , laid out one by one and just as soon demolished .
It will be noted that these chapters are as brief as they are easygoing .
Some of Paulos ’s critics , noting this brevity , complain that he is too brisk and thoughtless in giving such cavalier treatment to arguments so ancient and weighty , over which so many sages have wracked their brains in ages past .
But this misses Paulos ’s larger and more important point :
The hypothesis that a deity created the universe and somehow still intervenes in it is , on the face of it , an extravagant , inelegant , and superfluous supposition .
It lacks any support from our direct experience of the world , nor even from the subtle and indirect inferences of modern science .
Therefore , in order to make it plausible , let alone convincing , requires arguments that are clear , direct , and compelling .
An enormous burden of proof lies heavy on the proponents of theism ; atheism is really the default position .
Paulos finds that the classical arguments cited are at best verbally dexterous , and that typically , they head into muddy and confusing ground before they get too far .
In large measure , they reduce to arguments from the deployment of pompous but vacuous terminology .
Therefore , there is no reason to take them all that seriously , since they flounder early and often , and are riddled with self - contradiction when picked apart by a relentlessly logical mind .
Some lapses can be found in Paulos ’s exposition .
The newly - fashionable argument from the “ irreducible complexity ” of biological systems is a mainstay of the crypto-creationist Intelligent Design movement , but Paulos ’s treatment of this ploy is , for once , too brief and superficial ; he ought to have included some specific and concrete example of the consistency of standard evolutionary theory with claimed instances of irreducible complexity , rather than simply tossing the idea into the same pot as the argument from design in general .
Likewise , a bit more might have been said about the supposed “ fine tuning ” of physical constants , especially in the light of various new hypotheses concerning the foundations of physics .
Finally , I note that Paulos digresses into the famous question posed by Eugene Wigner :
Why does the vast corpus of mathematical ideas developed without any applications in mind turn out to be so useful in describing what we can discover of physical reality , to the extent that it is virtually impossible to envision a “ physics ” detached from these mathematical formalisms ?
This , it seems to me , is a question that bears very remotely , at most , on the arguments pro and con theism , and the book need n’t have considered it at all .
Nevertheless , I find that Paulos ’s analysis is superficial and a little flaccid , especially in view of the fact that he is a professional mathematician .
Wigner ’s question remains deep and resists an easy answer .
But these minor points do n’t much detract from the overall value of what Paulos has given us .
Irreligion will , I ’m confident , take a distinguished place in what one might call the canonical literature of the New Atheism , and I highly recommend it , especially to bright youngsters who will find its occasional use of mathematical ideas pleasant rather than repellent .
The New Atheism
An important question remains :
Why has atheism and skepticism toward religion suddenly emerged as a question of great current interest , at least among the literate , in the past few years ?
Clearly something has happened to break atheists of their tendency to nurture their disbelief privately and to keep their opinions to themselves .
It seems obvious that politics has a lot to do with this , specifically the cultivation of the religious right as a phalanx of conservative storm troopers who are rewarded by conservative politicians by having their singular dogmas incorporated , as much as possible , into public policy .
The increasing pressure on women ’s reproductive rights , the suppression of stem cell research , and , most egregiously , the fresh intrusion of creationism into public schools are primary instances of this .
Beyond these concrete horrors , there is no escaping the fact that the miasma of compulsory religiosity has thickened and diffused throughout society .
For instance , one notes , rather queasily , the success of the Evangelicals in turning the Air Force Academy into a virtual fundamentalist seminary where cadets from all sorts of backgrounds are relentlessly pressured by officers and upperclassmen into declaring for the Born - Agains .
Atheists , who , despite polls , have never been all that rare , have come to mistrust the notion that they can believe as they will , undisturbed , provided they remain discreet about it .
The mood fostered by the religious right seems to tend toward the inquisitorial .
Scientists , in particular , representing the one vocation in which non-belief is the norm , rather than the outlier , have sensibly concluded that the culture in which they have quietly lived is being attacked at its foundations .
It ’s one thing to send your kids to a public school where “ under god ” is formulaically recited as part of the daily Pledge of Allegiance .
It ’s quite another to have your kid ’s elementary biology class interrupted by harangues against “ Darwinism ” , or to see the Bible , taught as literal truth , surreptitiously introduced into the curriculum .
When matters have come to that pass , scientists , among others , see little point in not fighting back openly .
Thus one now sees a torrent of books , largely by scientists and sympathetic philosophers , striking back , not only at the enemies of stem - cell research and the proponents of Intelligent Design Theory , but at the very roots of the cultural tic that provides these miscreants such fertile ground : supernatural religion predicated upon a supreme being .
Then , too , one must consider the possibility that as the ostensible religious uniformity of the nation begins to dissolve , the sort of person who habitually responds to questionnaires about faith by listing himself as “ unaffiliated , but a believer ” has , at long last become more honest with himself and with the rest of us , frankly acknowledging the deep vein of skepticism underlying his disinclination to become a churchgoer .
I suspect that many of the readers of the New Atheists ’ books fall into this category , and are more willing to let their doubts see the light of day .
The Return of the Suppressed
The new boldness of atheists and nonbelievers is not so much a novel development as an unconscious return to the mindset of an earlier century .
Contrary to the standard myth of progress , America spent many years going backwards in point of publicly - acceptable attitudes toward religion , even as Western Europe eagerly abandoned its historical obedience to Christianity , and turned itself into a society where atheism is pretty much the norm , the persistence of officially - established churches and similar vestigial institutions notwithstanding .
I do n’t expect America to move that far that fast .
Religion still has its claws into too many people and communities ; one doubts that the airwaves will soon be full of clear - channel radio stations proclaiming the indispensability of skepticism and the savage wrongheadedness of biblical literalism .
All the same , our supposedly provincial forebears seem to be on the brink of vindication .
One of these days , we may well see a major election where a candidate need n’t supply the press with a photo - op of him or herself and family dutifully sitting through an acceptable church service .
( Indeed , we may already have witnessed such a miracle in the election of Socialist Bernie Sanders as U.S. Senator from Vermont ! )
In my search for relevant historical minutia , I discovered that even the much - despised Millard Fillmore ought to be regarded as a secularist hero for our time .
It seems that as a New York legislator , Fillmore led the fight to enable citizens unwilling to swear an oath to a Divine Being to give testimony in state courts nonetheless .
Politicians with that kind of principle and that kind of guts are still in short supply , certainly on the right .
But one might hope that the increasing eagerness of atheists like Paulos to go public with their beliefs will have a positive effect on the yet - unfulfilled struggle to have this country and its social institutions truly respect freedom of opinion .
One lawyer for Guantánamo detainees said he replaced his office telephone in Washington because of sounds that convinced him it had been bugged .
Another lawyer who represents detainees said he sometimes had other lawyers call his corporate clients to foil any government eavesdroppers .
In interviews and a court filing Tuesday , lawyers for detainees at Guantánamo said they believed government agents had monitored their conversations .
The assertions are the most specific to date by Guantánamo lawyers that officials may be violating legal principles that have generally kept government agents from eavesdropping on lawyers .
“ I think they are listening to my telephone calls all the time , ” said John A. Chandler , a prominent lawyer in Atlanta and Army veteran who represents six Guantánamo detainees .
Several of the lawyers , including partners at large corporate law firms , said the concerns had changed the way they went about their work apart from Guantánamo cases .
A lawyer in Chicago , H. Candace Gorman , said in an affidavit that she was no longer accepting new clients of any type because she could not assure them of confidentiality .
TIJUANA , Mexico ( Reuters ) - Drug hitmen have killed a popular Mexican singer along with his manager and assistant near the U.S. border , authorities said on Wednesday , the latest murder among musicians who sing “ narcocorrido ” ballads glorifying drug traffickers .
The body of Jesus Rey David Alfaro , known as “ The Little Rooster , ” was one of six that turned up tortured , murdered and pinned with threatening messages for Mexico ’s army last week in the border town of Tijuana near San Diego .
“ We believe Alfaro had links to the Arellano Felix cartel , ” said an official with the Baja California state attorney general ’s office who declined to be named .
The official was referring to Tijuana ’s main drug smuggling cartel , which is fighting a gory turf war with traffickers from Mexico ’s Pacific state of Sinaloa , led by the country ’s most - wanted man , Joaquin “ Shorty ” Guzman .
At least half a dozen Mexican folk singers , who play narcocorridos and upbeat , brassy “ grupera ” music , have been killed since Mexico ’s drug war flared in 2006 .
Alfaro , a regular act at Tijuana ’s biggest bars and music halls , was found covered in a blanket in wasteland on the edge of the city with rope marks around his neck , suggesting he was tortured before he was shot in the head , the attorney general ’s office said .
Drug hitmen pinned a message on his body saying “ You ’ll be next , ” a taunt aimed at the thousands of soldiers sent by President Felipe Calderon to Tijuana to crush the drug gangs and clean up police forces working with the cartels .
Tijuana , long a transit point for narcotics heading to the United States , has seen a spike in murders this past year , with drug gangs even killing children .
More than 2,500 people were killed in drug violence in Mexico last year and at least 320 people have died so far this year .
So this is what party unity sounds like .
Alice Huffman , a member of the Democratic party 's rules and bylaws committee , which met on Saturday to decide the fates of the Florida and Michigan delegations , was explaining herself .
She had just sought to allow all of Florida 's delegates to vote at the Democratic convention in August , despite the disputed scheduling of the state 's presidential primary .
But that motion failed , and she was explaining to her 29 fellow committee members and the rest of us in a Washington hotel ballroom why she was now - in the interest of party unity - going to support a second motion that would seat the delegation at half strength .
A woman in the audience yelled : " You just took away votes ! " Huffman : " We gave you some back , too .
We will leave here more united than we came . "
The room , or that portion of it dedicated to Hillary Clinton 's advancement to the White House , burst into mocking laughter .
She tried to keep talking .
A man yelled : " Lipstick on a pig ! "
Huffman countered : " Please conduct yourselves like proper men and women . "
At a later point , committee member Everett Ward was trying to speak .
A woman in the audience yelled , apropos of what I 'm not sure : " What about Iowa ?
New Hampshire ?
South Carolina ? "
Another woman countered : " Shut up ! "
At the end of the evening , the committee member Don Fowler leaned into his microphone to thank the co-chairs , James Roosevelt Jr and Alexis Herman .
The Clinton supporters in the room , to put it mildly , did not share Fowler 's gratitude and made their disapproval known .
But hey , Florida and Michigan are settled .
The primaries held in defiance of party rules now count , or half - count .
The bottom lines are these .
First : Clinton netted a gain of 24 delegates , 19 out of Florida and five out of Michigan .
She was hoping for more than twice that .
Second : as for the " magic number " - the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination - forget the figure 2,026 , which did not count the two states .
The new magic number is 2,118 ( or , according to some people , 2,117 ) .
Third : Obama picked up 63 delegates in Saturday 's scrum .
He now has 2,053 delegates and is 65 short of sewing up the nomination .
Clinton gained 87 delegates .
She has 1,877 , and is 241 delegates short .
( This is pending the tally from yesterday 's Puerto Rico vote - she was expected to win there and pick up another 10 or 12 . )
And fourth : the number of outstanding delegates is 291 , meaning that Clinton would have to persuade more than 80 % to throw their lot in with her .
The above numbers confirm what we 've known , really , since mid-February .
Barack Obama is going to be the Democratic standard bearer .
Certainly since the Tuesday night he won Wisconsin ( February 19 ) , and arguably since the Tuesday before that , when he rolled up big wins in Maryland and Virginia , it 's been all but inevitable .
So what have we been doing these past three - and - a - half months ?
On the plus side , we 've been watching a very useful and necessary toughening of the nominee .
Everything that 's happened since Wisconsin - the emergence of Jeremiah Wright , the flap over the " bitter " white working class , and so on - has constituted Obama 's trial by fire .
Far better that he had to answer all those questions in March than in October , with millions more voters paying closer attention .
But at the same time , we 've been hostage to the Clintons ' inability to come to grips with the fact that Hillary was going to lose .
Her final descent into rancid demagoguery about Florida and Michigan , comparing them to Zimbabwe and likening the " cause " of seating the states at full strength to the civil rights movement was , for some observers , the last straw .
It was a rules dispute over two states that broke the rules ; no one was jailed or lynched , and if anyone disenfranchised the voters of those two states , it was n't the Democratic party or Obama , it was the political leaders of the states themselves .
We have no idea whether the fuming Clinton partisans at Saturday 's meeting represent thousands or millions .
But however many of them exist , the fact is that Clinton worked them into this lather - Eve Fairbanks of the New Republic filed a stomach - turning report for her magazine 's website on some of the things said about Obama outside the hall - and Clinton is responsible as things move forward for working them out of it .
That means , for starters , ending her quest soon and letting her backers know that she 's not fighting on to the Denver convention .
But an even greater responsibility falls on Obama as the nominee .
Losers have to be gracious , but winners have to be magnanimous .
He has a little trouble with magnanimous .
He also has few women in his campaign 's higher brain trust .
He needs to show that he takes the frustrations of Clinton 's supporters seriously .
And since it seems highly unlikely that he 'll offer her the vice - presidency , he 'll have to find creative and interesting ways to reach out to Clinton voters .
Remember unity , one America , we 're all our brothers ' and sisters ' keepers - the fundamental premise of the Obama campaign to begin with ?
Now would be an excellent time for him to put those principles into action .

India has accused Pakistan of firing across the militarized frontier that divides the disputed region of Kashmir – the first such allegation since the neighbors and rivals signed a cease - fire agreement in 2003 .
Violations across the so - called Line of Control have been rare since that truce was signed as part of peacemaking efforts between the nuclear - armed nations .
The LoC was recognized after a 1971 war and it has since become the de facto border separating India 's part of Kashmir from Pakistan 's part .
But on Sunday , eight people were shot dead when the Indian Army attacked militants they claim were trying to sneak into Kashmir .
And on Tuesday evening , India claimed that the Pakistani Army had fired bullets across the LoC , according to Reuters .
Pakistan had vehemently denied the claims .
The incident took place in the Tangdhar region , about 105 miles north of Srinagar , Indian Kashmir 's main city .
Since 1989 , numerous militant groups have been fighting for Kashmir 's separation from India or its merger with Pakistan .
Both claim all of Kashmir , India 's only Muslim - majority state .
Pakistan regards the demands of the Kashmiri people as legitimate but denies abetting the insurgency .
The two Kashmir border - crossing allegations follow a string of bombings in Jaipur , and some officials said terrorists had hoped to undermine India and Pakistan 's peace process with those bombings , reports The Christian Science Monitor .
On Wednesday , commanders from both armies held a meeting to discuss the alleged violation , reported NDTV , a leading Indian television new channel .
NDTV said India 's prime minister , Manmohan Singh , had described the development as " worrisome . "
Bloomberg reported that the issue of infiltration across the Kashmiri border would feature prominently in talks between India and Pakistan .
India 's foreign minister , Pranab Mukherjee is scheduled to visit Pakistan next week and discuss , on May 21 , the four - year - old peace process .
Though this process has improved relations between the two countries , India and Pakistan have made little progress over Kashmir .
Earlier this month , Pakistan 's prime minister , Yousuf Raza Gilani , said that the only viable settlement of the Kashmir issue was one that addressed the needs and aspirations of the Kashmiri people .
Some Indian newspapers were quick to criticize Pakistan over reports its army had fired over the LoC.
Pakistan , of course , promptly denied it , reported The Times of India .
Calcutta's
The Telegraph reported that up to 80 shots had been fired from a 10,000 - plus foot high post manned by a unit of the Pakistan Army , and sought to explain why this gave cause for concern in India .
There was less coverage of the alleged violation across the LoC in Pakistan 's newspapers .
But Dawn , a leading newspaper , reported that India and Pakistan would have plenty to talk about on May 21 , from the bombs that exploded in the Indian city of Jaipur on Tuesday to Sunday 's " alleged infiltration attempt . "
Writing in an editorial in India 's leading Mint newspaper , diplomatic affairs editor Jyoti Malhotra urged both sides to keep on talking .
While universities do n't tend to shout as loudly about their latest tech innovations as do Google , Cisco and other big vendors , their results are no less impressive in what they could mean for faster , more secure and more useful networking .
Here 's a roundup , in no particular order , of some of the most amazing and colorful projects in the works .

1. Exploiting T-rays
Who needs electricity to run superfast computers when there 's terahertz radiation , or T - rays ?
University of Utah engineers have reached deep into the electromagnetic spectrum to find this new way to build circuits for computers that would run a thousand times faster than today 's gigahertz - speed computers .
The development involves creation of waveguides to send and manipulate T - rays , also known as far - infrared light .
" We have taken a first step to making circuits that can harness or guide terahertz radiation , " says Ajay Nahata , study leader and associate professor of electrical and computer engineering , in a statement .
" Eventually - in a minimum of 10 years - this will allow the development of superfast circuits , computers and communications . "
2. Hybrids : Computers , not cars
A multi-university research team funded by the Department of Defense is working to combine computer memory functions typically performed by magnetic components and computer logic operations typically handled by semiconductor components into a hybrid material .
The benefit would be faster and more compact machines that chow down less power and are less expensive to build .
" In this approach , the coupling between magnetic and non-magnetic components would occur via a magnetic field or flow of electron spin , which is the fundamental property of an electron and is responsible for most magnetic phenomena , " says Giovanni Vignale , a University of Missouri physics professor in the College of Arts and Science , in a statement .
" The hybrid devices that we target would allow seamless integration of memory and logical function , high - speed optical communication and switching , and new sensor capabilities . "
The Department of Defense awarded a $ 6.5 million grant to the University of Iowa for the project .
In addition to the Iowa and Missouri schools , also working on the project are researchers from New York University , University of California at Berkeley and the University of Pittsburgh .
3. Getting to bottom of Web searches
Web search might seem like a complex issue , but it really boils down to three basic kinds of searches : informational , navigational and transactional ( related to buying something ) .
That 's the word from researchers at Penn State University 's College of Information Sciences and Technology and Australia 's Queensland University of Technology who looked at more than 1.5 million queries from hundreds of thousands of search engines users .
The bulk of searches ( 80 % ) proved to be informational , with the other 20 % split between navigational and transactional .
The researchers used an algorithm that they say classified searches with a 74 % accuracy rate .
" Other results have classified comparatively much smaller sets of queries , usually manually , " said Jim Jansen , assistant professor in Penn State 's College of Information Sciences and Technology , in a statement .
" This research aimed to classify queries automatically .
The researchers ' work is outlined in a paper titled " Determining the informational , navigational and transactional intent of Web queries " that will appear in the May issue of Information Processing & Management .
4. Mapping the whole Internet
Israeli researchers have created a topographical map of the Internet by enlisting more than 5,600 volunteers across 97 countries who agreed to download a program that tracks how Internet nodes interact with each other .
The result is " the most complete picture of the Internet available today , " Bar Ilan University researcher Shai Carmi told the MIT Technology Review .
" A better understanding of the Internet 's structure is vital for integration of voice , data and video streams , point - to - point and point - to - many distribution of information , and assembling and searching all of the world 's information , " Carmi and fellow researchers state in a new report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" It may reveal evolutionary processes that control the growth of the Internet . "
Carmi's research uses a program called the DIMES agent , which is downloaded onto volunteers ' computers and performs Internet measurements such as traceroute and ping .
The project 's
Web site promises that , along with providing a " good feeling , " using the DIMES agent will provide maps to users showing how the Internet looks from their homes .
Users of the program chat about their findings at this forum .
Another project that tracks Internet traffic growth is called the Minnesota Internet Traffic Studies ( MINTS ) site .
5 . The Fluid Project
A handful of universities , including the University of Toronto and the University of California , Berkeley , is working to build a software architecture and reusable components that can make Web applications easier to develop and use .
The Fluid Project 's work focuses on user - centered design practices .
Vendors such as Mozilla Foundation , IBM and Sun are also taking part .
The latest news out of the project is that a grant has been awarded to the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre at the University of Toronto from the Mozilla Foundation to promote DHTML accessibility and the adoption of ARIA ( the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative 's Accessible Rich Internet Applications specification ) .
6. Attila : one radio on many wireless networks
Today 's wireless networks are in a rut :
Most radios that form the networks can only work on one frequency band of the spectrum .
If that band is glutted , glitchy or jammed , the radios are useless .
Enter Attila the Radio , invented by two researchers at Stevens Institute of Technology , in Hoboken , N.J .
The concept is simple : Attila parcels out a stream of data packets over any and all available wireless spectrum at the same time .
The packets could stream , for example , over a Wi-Fi mesh , Verizon 's Code Division Multiple Access ( CDMA ) cell network , rival AT&T's Global System for Mobile Communications ( GSM ) airwaves , and over a WiMAX link .
Current prototypes use several radios , one for each of the networks being used , but the goal is a single radio .
The future of Attila the radio lies now with Attila the company , formally known as Atilla Technologies , which was founded in 2005 by two Stevens Institute of Technology researchers .
7. Sniffing out insider threats
Researchers are developing technology they say will use data mining and social networking techniques to spot and stop insider security threats and industrial espionage .
Air Force Institute of Technology researchers have developed software that can spot insider threats using an extended version of automated document indexing known as Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing ( PLSI ) .
This technology can discern employees ' interests from e-mail and create a social network graph showing their various interactions , researchers said .
The technology could help any organization sniff out insider threats by analyzing e-mail activity or find individuals among potentially tens of thousands of employees with latent interests in sensitive topics .
The same technology might also be used to spot individuals who feel alienated within the organization as well as unraveling any worrying changes in their social network interactions .
The researchers explain that individuals who have shown an interest in a sensitive topic but who have never communicated to others within the organization on this subject are often the most likely to be an insider threat .
The software can reveal those people either with a secret interest in that topic or who may feel alienated from the organization and so communicate their interest in it only to those outside the organization , researchers said .
Another important signal of alienation or a potential problem is a shift in the connections between an individual and others within the organization .
If an individual suddenly stops communicating or socializing with others with whom they have previously had frequent contact , then the technology could alert investigators to such changes .
The research team tested their approach on the archived body of messages from the liquidated Enron company e-mail system .
8 . All about Twitter
University of Maryland students have written a paper called " Why We Twitter : Understanding Microblogging Usage and Communities " examining why people Twitter .
Also known as microblogging , Twittering is a new form of communication in which users can describe their current status in short posts distributed by instant messages , mobile phones , e-mail or the Web , " according to the paper 's abstract .
The authors , Akshay Java , Xiaodan Song , Tim Finin and Belle Tseng , say the paper " presents our observations of the microblogging phenomena by studying the topological and geographical properties of Twitter 's social network . "
They concluded that figuring out why individuals microblog is elusive , but that by analyzing an aggregate of data across a community can provide insight into why a group of people microblog .
9 . Spotting phishers
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed an online game designed to teach Internet users about the dangers of phishing .
Featuring a cartoon fish named Phil , the game , called Anti-Phishing Phil , has been tested in CMU 's Privacy and Security Laboratory .
Officials with the lab say users who spent 15 minutes playing the interactive , online game were better able to discern fraudulent Web sites than those who simply read tutorials about the threat .
The game focuses on teaching Internet users how to tell the URL of a fraudulent site from a legitimate one , officials say .
It offers tips such as examining URLs for misspellings of popular sites , dissecting a Web address to understand where it 's pointing to , and using Google to validate a URL against search results .

10 . RFID and the heart
Telemedicine researchers have been awarded a $ 400,000 grant to work on integrating RFID technology with cardiac sensor networks used to monitor patients ' heartbeats .
The Rochester Institute of Technology says its work will make cardiac sensor networks more secure , reducing the chances of identity theft or other abuse .
The work could also make the healthcare process work more efficiently by supporting RFID tags on medicine bottles , the school says .
" Telemedicine technology can greatly increase the quality of medical care while also decreasing healthcare costs , " said Fei Hu , assistant professor of computer engineering at RIT , in a statement .
" Through this project we hope to increase the integration of RFID into existing cardiac sensor networks , ensure the overall security of the system and promote the implementation of the technology in nursing homes and adult care facilities across the country . "
11 . Analyzing the " Dark Web "
Computer scientists at a University of Arizona lab have created a project called Dark Web that is designed to track and analyze the moves of terrorists and extremists using the Internet to spread propaganda , recruit members and plan attacks ( click here to read our feature on cyberwar ) .
The project , which is funded by the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies , is led by Hsinchun Chen at the Artificial Intelligence Lab in Tucson .
Dark
Web 's specialty is tracking massive amounts of information scattered across thousands of Web sites and in e-mail and other online programs .
Spidering , link analysis , multimedia analysis and other techniques are used , according to the NSF .
A method dubbed Writeprint is used to strip away the anonymity of terrorists online by analyzing language , semantic and other features of content and comparing it with other content posted across the Internet .
Authors can be identified and new information published by the authors can be flagged as it is posted and spread .
One recent study by the Dark Web team identified stories and videos used to train terrorists in building improvised explosive devices .
Not that the terrorists are unaware they 're being watched .
" They can put booby - traps in their Web forums , " Chen said in a statement , " and the spider can bring back viruses to our machines . "
12 . Really , really fast wireless
Scientists at the Georgia Electronic Design Center ( GEDC ) at the Georgia Institute of Technology have designed a system that can transfer data at 5 G bps at a range of 5 meters .
Joy Laskar , the GEDC 's director , says many of the products designed for the 60GHz band initially will be marketed to consumers for home use , because businesses are more likely to take wait - and - see attitudes with new technology that has n't yet proved reliable .
Even so , he says he can imagine several business applications for multigigabit networks , especially in the field of large - scale data transfer .
" Imagine that you have a portable device that 's essentially an evolved iPod that has hundreds of gigs of storage , " he says .
" One scenario would be to have several kiosks around an office that could wirelessly send information to your device . "

Update 3 : ReadWriteWeb says Google App Engine Announces New Pricing Plans , APIs , Open Access .
Pricing is specified but I 'm not sure what to make of it yet .
An image manipulation library is added ( thus the need to pay for more CPU :-) and memcached support has been added .
Memcached will help resolve the can't write for every read problem that pops up when keeping counters .
Update 2 : onGWT.com threw a GAE load party and a lot of people came .
The results at Load test : Google App Engine = 1 , Community = 0 . GAE handled a peak of 35 requests / second and a sustained 10 requests / second .
Some think performance was good , others not so good .
My GMT watch broke and I was late to arrive .
Maybe next time .
Also added a few new design rules from the post .
Update : Added a few new rules gleaned from the GAE Meetup : Design By Explicit Cost Model and Puts are Precious .
How do you structure your database using a distributed hash table like BigTable ?
The answer is n't what you might expect .
If you were thinking of translating relational models directly to BigTable then think again .
The best way to implement joins with BigTable is : do n't .
You -- pause for dramatic effect -- duplicate data instead of normalize it .
* shudder *
Flickr anticipated this design in their architecture when they chose to duplicate comments in both the commentor and the commentee user shards rather than create a separate comment relation .
I do n't know how that decision was made , but it must have gone against every fiber in their relational bones ...
But Flickr ’s reasoning was genius .
To scale you need to partition .
User data must spread across the shards .
So where do comments belong in a scalable architecture ?
From one world view comments logically belong to a relation binding comments and users together .
But if your unit of scalability is the user shard there is no separate relation space .
So you go against all your training and decide to duplicate the comments .
Nerd heroism at its best .
Let inductive rules derived from observation guide you rather than deductions from arbitrarily chosen first principles .
Very Enlightenment era thinking .
Voltaire would be proud .
In a relational world duplication is removed in order to prevent update anomalies .
Error prevention is the driving force in relational modeling .
Normalization is a kind of ethical system for data .
What happens , for example , if a comment changes ?
Both copies of the comment must be updated .
That leads to errors because who can remember where all the data is stored ?
A severe ethical violation may happen .
Go directly to relational jail :-)
BigTable data ethics are more Mardi Gras than dinner with the in - laws .
Data just wants to have fun .
BigTable wo n’t stop you from hurting yourself .
And to get the best results you may have to engage in some conventionally risky behaviors .
But if those are the glass bead necklaces you have to give for a peak at scalability , why not take a walk on the wild side ?
For a more modern post- relational discussion of data ethics I ’m using as my primary source a thread of conversations from JA Robson , Ben the Indefatigable , Michael Brunton - Spall , and especially Brett Morgan .
According to our new Voltaire , Locke , Bacon , and Newton , here ’s what it takes to act ethically in a BigTable world :
Do n’t bother with BigTable unless your goal is to create a web site that scales to millions of users .
The techniques for building scalable read - mostly web applications are difficult and require a radical mindset change .
Standard relational techniques work very well until you scale to huge numbers of users .
It is at that point you need to break the rules and do something counter - intuitively different .
More of the same will not work .
If you do n’t plan to get to that point it may not be worth the effort to change .
BigTable is targeted at building web applications ,
It 's nature makes it a poor match for OLAP , data warehousing , data mining , and other applications performing complex data manipulations .
Assume slower random data access rather than fast sequential access .
Every get of an entity could be from a different disk block on a different machine in a cluster .
Calculating , for example , the average over a column in SQL can be efficient because data is stored together on disk .
In BigTable data can be anywhere so iterating over every value in a column is expensive .
Each read is potentially a random block from anywhere which means the average retrieval time can be relatively high .
The implication is to use BigTable you must adopt some unfamiliar and unintuitive strategies in order to deal with such a very different performance profile .
Using relational database we are used to writing applications against fast highly performant databases .
With BigTable you have to become familiar with the rules for developing against a slower but more scalable database .
Neither approach is better for all purposes , but BigTable has the edge for high scalability .
Group data for concurrent reads .
Given the high cost of reading data from BigTable your application will not scale if every page requires a large number of reads .
The solution : denormalize .
Store data in the same entity based on what data needs to be read concurrently .
Relational modeling groups data together based on the “ minimize problems ” rule .
BigTable ’s new rule is “ maximize concurrent reads ” which implies denormalization .
Store entities so they can be read in one access rather than performing a join requiring multiple reads .
Instead of storing attributes in separate entities in order to remove duplication , duplicate the attributes and store them where they need to be used .
Following this rule minimizes the number of reads required to return an entity .
Disk and CPU are cheap so stop worrying about them and scale .
A criticism of denormalization is storing duplicate data wastes disk space .
Google ’s architecture trades disk space for better performance .
Disk is ( relatively ) cheap , so do n’t fight it .
On the CPU front a data center ’s worth of CPU is at your service .
As long as you structure your application in the way GAE forces you to , your application can scale as large as it needs to simply by running on more machines .
All scalability bottlenecks have been removed .
Structure data around how it will be used .
Trade SQL sets for application based entities .
Queries are slow so the closer data is to the format it is to be used the faster pages will render .
It ’s like the database model becomes the model previously used at the caching layer .
Complete entities tend to be cached , not low level detail rows .
That ’s what BigTable models should look like because that ’s how concurrent reads are maximized .
This is n’t the same as an object oriented database because the behavior is provided by applications , behavior is not bound to the entity so multiple applications can read the same entities yet implement very different behaviors .
Compute attributes at write time .
Since looping over large columns of data is inefficient with BigTable the idea is to calculate values at write time instead of read time .
For example , instead of calculating an average by reading an entire column at read time , track the total number and the total value at write time so the average can be calculated with one read on page display .
Programmer effort is made up front at write time to minimize the work needed at read time .
Preventing applications from iterating over huge data is key for making applications scale .
Given the limitations of GAE transactions and quotas , GAE may not be appropriate for business applications that need exact summary statistics .
Warning : if the summary stat is written on every read request then this approach will not scale as writes do n't scale .
Create large entities with optional fields .
Normalization creates lots of small entities .
Instead , create larger entities with optional parts so you can do one read and then determine what ’s present at run time .
This shifts work from the database to the CPU while minimizing the number joins .
Define schemas in models .
Denormalization requires user developed code to properly keep data consistent across multiple entities .
The database wo n’t do it for you anymore .
Schemas are really defined in code because it ’s only code that can track all the relationships and maintain correctness .
All database access must go through the models or otherwise the much feared inconsistency problems will result .
Hide updates using Ajax .
Updates are slow so big bang updates of many entities will appear slow to users .
Instead , use Ajax to update the database in little increments .
As a user enters form data update the database so the update cost is amortized over many calls rather than one big call at the end .
The result is a good user experience and a more scalable app .
Puts are Precious .
Updating entities in large batches , say even 200 at a time , is n't
part of the BigTable model .
Entity attributes are automatically and synchronously indexed on writes .
Indexing is an expensive operation that accumulates a lot of CPU time so the number updates that can be performed in one query is quite limited .
The work around is to perform updates in smaller batches driven by an external CPU .
Even when GAE provides the ability run batches within GAE the programming model for writes needs to be accounted for in a design .
Design By Explicit Cost Model .
If you are going to be charged for an operation GAE wants you to explicitly ask for it .
This is why some automatic navigation between objects is n't provided because that will force an explicit query to be written .
Writing an explicit query is a sort of EULA for being charged .
Click OK in the form of a query and you 've indicated that you are prepared to pay for a database operation .
Place a many - to - many relation in the entity with the fewest number of elements .
One way to create a many - to - many relationship is to have a list property that contains keys to the other related entities .
A Company entity , for example , could contain a list of keys to Contact entities or a Contact entity could contain a list of keys to Company entities .
Since it 's likely a Contact is associated with fewer Companies the list should be contained in the Contact .
The reasoning is maintaining large lists is relatively inefficient so you want to minimize the number of items in a list as much as possible .
Avoid unbounded queries .
Large queries do n't scale .
Consider showing only the most recent 10 or so values from an attribute .
Avoid contention on datastore entities .
If every request to your app reads or writes a particular entity , latency will increase as your traffic goes up because reads and writes on a given entity are sequential .
One example construct you should avoid at all costs is the global counter , i.e. an entity that keeps track of a count and is updated or read on every request .
Avoid large entity groups .
Any two entities that share a common ancestor belong to the same entity group .
All writes to an entity group are sequential , so large entity groups can bog down popular apps quickly if there are a lot of writes to that group .
Instead , use small , localized groups in your design .
1 . In recorded history , bananas date back to around 600 B.C.E. , when they were mentioned in Buddhist texts .
2. Bananas came to the Americas in the 15th century but were n't regularly imported to the United States until later , following their showcase at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition .
3 . On average , American consumers eat 30 pounds of bananas a year .
4. Banana peels have been a staple of slapstick slip - and - fall gags for decades , but in the 1960s , many people tried using them for a different purpose — to get high .
Rumors that smoking dried banana peels caused hallucinogenic effects were likely started in part by singer Country Joe McDonald , who mistakenly attributed an acid trip to a banana - peel joint he 'd tried .
Regardless , the trippy allegations touched off a banana run on fruit stands across the country , until an FDA investigation found no evidence to support the claim .
5 . Several films have used the familiar yellow fruit in their titles , including Herbie Goes Bananas and Banana Joe .
But perhaps the most notable is Bananas , Woody Allen 's 1971 banana republic - themed political satire .
6 . Of course , Allen reportedly only named the movie Bananas because " there are no bananas in it . " 
7 . Whether that 's true or not , it was probably a wiser choice than the movie 's original title , " El Weirdo . " 

8. Fleegle , Bingo , Drooper , and Snorky were the Saturday morning TV quartet collectively known as The Banana Splits .
Their infectiously happy " Tra La La Song "  hit the U.S. singles chart back in 1969 .
9 . Because they 're a major source of potassium , vitamin C , and other nutrients , bananas are believed to aid in the treatment of morning sickness and hangovers .
10 .
Like money , bananas do n't grow on trees .

This is a review of Jamie Galbraith 's The Predator State from a forthcoming edition of the Journal of Economic Issues :
Review of the Predator State : How Conservatives Abandoned the Free Market and Why Liberals Should Too , by James K. Galbraith .
New York , London , Toronto , Sydney : Free Press , 2008 .
( Note : review is based on Advance Uncorrected Proofs . ) :
This is political economy at its best , in the tradition of Veblen ’s Theory of the Leisure Class , or J.K. Galbraith ’s The New Industrial State .
The comparators are chosen carefully , for not only is The Predator State an update , it is equally as deserving of status as a classic .
The issues are carefully examined , the prose is delightful , the arguments appear unassailable , and the choir — including this reviewer and presumably most of the readers of this journal — shouts “ Amen ! ” .
But will the book be read ?
Can any book today capture the attention accorded to Veblen a century ago , or to Galbraith , senior , nearly fifty years ago ?
Still , one must applaud Jamie for trying .
This is an amazing effort ...
The general theses can be simply stated .
First , while conservatives toyed with laissez - faire , they quickly abandoned it in all important areas of policy - making .
For them , it now serves as nothing more than an enabling myth , used to hide the true nature of our world .
Ironically , only the progressive still takes the call for “ market solutions ” seriously , and this is the major barrier to formulating sensible policy .
Second , the “ industrial state ” has been replaced by a predator state , a coalition of relentless opponents of the very idea of a “ public interest ” , whose purpose is to master the state structure in order to empower a high plutocracy with nothing more than vile and rapacious goals .
Finally , the “ corporate republic ” created by the likes of Dick Cheney is highly unstable , a formula for national failure .
Progressives must wrest control from the reactionaries before it is too late for restoration of America as the world ’s financial anchor , technological leader , and promoter of collective security .
Jamie thus resurrects both the extreme pessimism of Veblen ’s notion of predation ( by the conspicuously consuming leisure class in Veblen ’s day , but by the corporate elite and Cheney ’s imperial court today ) as well as his only partially defined but optimistic vision of a world dominated by the engineers .
As Jamie argues , his father admired Veblen but was most influenced by the New Deal , the mobilization during WWII , and the rise of the modern corporation that cooperated with government and labor to create the planned economy of the postwar period .
Hence , Veblen ’s opposition of the business enterprise versus the public interest was replaced by countervailing powers that compromised a largely acceptable truce .
Jamie insists that his father ’s analysis was correct , however , it was already becoming outdated by the early 1970s as the Bretton Woods system fell apart .
The free market reactionaries promised that some combination of monetarism , supply side economics , balanced budgets , and free trade was the solution to America ’s woes .
The mantra “ free markets ” provided an easy antidote to “ planning ” that was said to constrain recovery and growth .
As each conservative policy was tried , however , it resulted in obvious and even spectacular failure .
In truth , all economies are always and everywhere planned — for the simple reason that planning is the use of today ’s resources to meet tomorrow ’s needs , something that all societies must do if they are going to survive — so the only question is who is going to do the planning , and to whom are the benefits going to flow ?
There are still a few true believers ( principled conservatives that Jamie compares to noble savages in the political wilderness ) , but most conservatives realized that there is no conflict between “ big government ” and “ the market ” as they abandoned the myth but usurped the “ free market ” label .
All we are left with is the liberal who embraces the myth out of fear of being exposed as a heretic , a socialist , or a fool .
Thus , the liberal pines to “ make the market work better ” , never challenging the view ( abandoned by all but the most foolish conservatives ) that government is the problem .
Economic freedom is reduced to the freedom to shop , including the freedom to buy elections , and anything that interferes is a threat .
“ Market ” means nothing more than “ nonstate ” , a negation of use of policy in the public interest .
Jamie provides a careful analysis of the frontline battles on many of the most important issues -- Social Security , health care , inequality , immigration , security after 9 - 11 , trade and outsourcing , and global warming — showing how “ market solutions ” are designed to enrich a favored oligarchy through a spoils system administered through the state ’s structure .
The policy “ mistakes ” in Iraq or New Orleans or at Bear - Stearns do not result from incompetence — indeed they only appear to be failures because we apply inappropriate measures of success .
There is no common good , no public purpose , no shareholder ’s interest ; we are the prey and governments as well as corporations are run by and for predators .
The “ failures ” enrich the proper beneficiaries even as they “ prove ” government is no solution .
There is a way out , but it is not easy .
Historically , regulation and standards have required acceptance by progressive business — those firms that recognized they would lose in races to the bottom .
Today , corporate and public policy alike are run by the most reactionary elements , well - paid rogues that suck capacity .
Wherever one finds a sector that still operates reasonably well , one finds remnants of New Deal institutions that support , guarantee , regulate , and leverage private activities , in spheres as diverse as higher education , housing , pensions , healthcare , the military - industrial complex ( and the prison - industrial complex ) .
Naturally , even these sectors are endangered as they represent potential riches ( witness subprimes , a privatization mess that Wall Street would love to repeat with Social Security ) .
Still , Jamie is hopeful .
The ideology of free markets is bankrupt , but the US is not .
The path is clear : re-regulation , planning , standards ( including wage controls ) , and coming to grips with the nation ’s global responsibilities .

Excerpts from the Preface :
Intended Audience :
Python reflects a number of growing trends in software development , putting it at or near the leading edge of good programming languages .
It is a very simple language surrounded by a vast library of add - on modules .
It is an open source project , supported by many individuals .
It is an object - oriented language , binding data and processing into class definitions .
It is a platform - independent , scripted language , with complete access to operating system API 's .
It supports integration of complex solutions from pre-built components .
It is a dynamic language , which avoids many of the complexities and overheads of compiled languages .
This book is a complete presentation of the Python language .
It is oriented toward learning , which involves accumulating many closely intertwined concepts .
In our experience teaching , coaching and doing programming , there is an upper limit on the " clue absorption rate " .
In order to keep within this limit , we 've found that it helps to present a language as ever - expanding layers .
We 'll lead you from a very tiny , easy to understand subset of statements to the entire Python language and all of the built - in data structures .
We 've also found that doing a number of exercises helps internalize each language concept .
Professional programmers who need to learn Python are our primary audience .
We provide specific help for you in a number of ways .
Instructors are a secondary audience .
If you are looking for classroom projects that are engaging , comprehensible , and focus on perfecting language skills , this book can help .
Each chapter in this book contains exercises that help students master the concepts presented in the chapter .
This book assumes a basic level of skill with any of the commonly - available computer systems .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Bush , saying he was unaware of predictions of $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline in the coming months , told reporters Thursday that the best way to help Americans fend off high prices is for Congress to make his first - term tax cuts permanent .
" If you 're out there wondering ... what your life is going to be like , and you 're looking at $ 4 a gallon , that 's uncertain , " Bush responded to a question posed at a White House news conference .
" And when you couple that with the idea that ... taxes may be going up in a couple years , that 's double uncertainty . "
Analysts have said that gasoline could reach $ 4 a gallon by this spring , due to strong demand and a change in formulation , among other reasons .
When taking the question about the $ 4 milestone , Bush told the reporter , " That 's interesting .
I had n't heard that . "
In other areas of energy policy , the president repeated his support for both renewable sources and conservation .
Bush also criticized Congress , which is considering an $ 18 billion tax increase for large oil companies .
" All that 's going to do is make the price even higher , " he said .
" We ought to be encouraging investment in oil and gas close to home if we 're trying to mitigate the problems we face . "
The House of Representatives passed the oil tax bill Wednesday , and Senate Democrats said they would try to push the bill through quickly to avoid a Republican filibuster .
If the bill passes , the White House has threatened to veto .
Bush told reporters that in order for the use of renewable sources of energy - such as corn - and switchgrass - based ethanol - to become widespread , the country needs to increase domestic oil production and build new refineries .
Two things about me : 1 ) I always have my nose buried in my iPhone .
2 ) I always have Google Reader open in my web browser at home .
Putting those two together , you might have thought I was a heavy user of the Google Reader app for the iPhone , but I really was n’t .
I did like it a lot , but only in spurts .
It simply never felt built for power usage .
Today , that changes with a new beta version Google is rolling out .
Quite frankly , I ’m worried about my social life .
This new version , found at http://www.google.com/reader/i/ is simply awesome .
It takes the desktop experience and translates it onto the iPhone ’s screen .
One big problem I had with the app before was that it was entirely too hard to star anything .
As I wrote last November :
I would still like to see a bit more prominent way to star and share stories ( and a way to do so without having to click in to the story – for those of us who star things to read later ) .
That ’s exactly what Google has done .
Now , it ’s a large , very finger - tappable star — and yes , you no longer have to click into a story to star it .
But the best part of the app ?
Its speed .
This thing is smoking fast .
The team that updated the app clearly took cues from the excellent iPhone version of Gmail .
It ’s simple really , just make the iPhone version act like the regular version , but with larger areas to click on .
The “ share ” link still could be a bit bigger , but there is only so much screen real estate to work with .
This version also works with the new “ Notes ” feature of Google Reader .
You wo n’t yet find the new Reader on the iPhone Google Apps toolbar area ( it will still take you to the old version ) , so be sure to use the link above .
Waiting in line will never be the same again .
Here ’s an audio post as I test it out :

Last night , we debuted “ Clerks II ” at the Cannes Film Festival .
WireImage.com ’s pics of the cast / crew arrival at the Palais , as well as pics from pre-and - post show .
With all the vitriol surrounding some of the press screenings of flicks there this year , I was pretty terrified “ Clerks II ” , also , might be greeted by a chorus of French Boos ( and I ai n’t talking about champagne ) .
However , after last night , I say “ VIVA LA FRANCE ! ”
When the flick ended and the credits started rolling , a standing ovation began that lasted a full eight minutes .
It was surreal and wonderful , and it just kept going and going .
I looked to Harvey ( Weinstein , our boss ) , that old Cannes war - horse , to see if the cast and I should start heading out of the theater : as it was two in the morning and the applause was n’t showing any signs of stopping .
But from two aisles back , he responded with a waving “ No ” finger at me , mouthing the words “ Do n’t move . ”
So we all stayed put .
By the time the credits ended , I figured the audience was done applauding as well .
But they were n’t .
They just kept on clapping .
And thankfully , not only did Zack and Joey get the whole thing on tape to prove it all happened ( watch for it in a new “ Train Wreck ” video blog , up this weekend ) , but Roger Friedman over at Fox411 was there was well , documenting what I have to say was one of the twenty most amazing moments of my life .
Read Roger ’s Piece , “ Clerks II Delights Cannes ” , right here .
But be warned : it also contains a very positive review of the flick that gives away some major plot points .
SPOILERS ABOUND !
The applause finally stopped after eight minutes .
Harvey was over the moon about it .
“ In my thirty years of coming here , I ’ve never seen a standing ovation last that long at a midnight show in Cannes , ” he said .
“ Ever . ”
En route to the theater , I prayed that the notoriously fickle Cannes ’ audience would n’t boo the flick .
During the screening , I prayed that the film would keep playing as gang - busters as it had been playing up ’til that point , and that the audience stayed with us , rather than succumb to mid-flick naps .
After the screening , I started praying that I never forget that insanely special moment that I shared with Jeff , Brian , Rosario , Mos and Jen – when time seemed to stand still , and at the world ’s most famous film festival , we all stared wide - eyed ( and wider - smiled ) at a room - full of cats staring back at us ( with equally wide smiles and palms cooked red from non-stop applause ) who really , really “ got ” what we were trying to communicate with “ Clerks II ” .
Life comes down to a few major moments .
Last night was definitely one of them .
“ Clerks II ” – July 21 , in theaters everywhere .
