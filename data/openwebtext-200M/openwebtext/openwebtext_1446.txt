Right wingers are always complaining about how that mean liberal Jon Stewart is always picking on them and their network Fox News , well on Monday night ’s The Daily Show , Stewart unloaded on the gaffe riddled campaign of Democratic Senate candidate Martha Coakley .
Check out the video .
Here is the video :

After talking about her Curt Schilling gaffe , Stewart said , “ Alright , well it ’s not anything a little retail politics ca n’t overcome .
This is Massachusetts baby , get out there due some meetin’ and greetin’ .
How ’s that ?
She said what now ?
Apparently when The Boston Globe asked her if she was being too passive in her campaigning , she replied , ‘ As opposed to standing outside Fenway Park ?
In the cold ?
Shaking hands ? ’
Let me see if I can field this one for you , YES !
What are doing on the campaign trail ?
Hey , what are handing me this baby for ?
A kiss ?
You ’re his mom , you kiss him . ”
Stewart summed up in two minutes the problems of Martha Coakley , and how she and her campaign managed to blow a 30 point lead .
Do I really need to point out that it is n’t a good sign for any candidate if they become the target on Jon Stewart ’s pointed humor on election eve ?
It would be very surprising , and a tribute to the Democratic organization in Massachusetts if they are able to overcome such a terrible candidate .
I think that we can also put all of that right wing nonsense about Jon Stewart ’s liberal media bias to bed now .
Stewart is a comedian and as such , he is willing to skewer anyone who deserves it , be they Democrat or Republican .
At TPM , Justin Elliott has tracked David Schenker , of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , doing some highlevel horsetrading , suggesting on Alhurra , the US - sponsored Arabic station , that Obama has to back down on his fight with Netanyahu because of his need for votes on the health - care bill :
I do n’t really think this will last very long , primarily for political reasons .
President Obama has mid-term elections coming up .
He does n’t want these congressmen to be seen as being allied with an anti-Israel president .
He ’s also asking these congressmen to back a very unpopular health care bill .
This is not a winning political issue right now .
Steve Clemons saw the dual loyalty implications in the threat :
" Any US Congressperson or Senator who actually explicitly withdrew or withheld support for health care reform because of loyalty first to Israel and its needs would invite serious questions about his or her patriotism and oath to the US Constitution and American people . "
Schenker is a former Bush Pentagon aide .
Wonder if he knows something we do n’t ?
With their best chemical antibiotics slowly failing , scientists are increasingly looking to nature for a way to control deadly staph bacteria -- the culprit behind most hospital infections .
Naturally toxic for bacteria , enzymes called lysins have the promising ability to obliterate staph , but the problem is producing large enough quantities of them to study how they work .
Rockefeller University scientists have now overcome this barrier by engineering a lysin that not only kills multidrug - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) in mice , but also works synergistically with traditional antibiotics that have long been shelved due to resistance .
For the past five years , Vincent A. Fischetti , head of the Laboratory of Bacterial Pathogenesis and Immunology , and his colleagues have tried to clone a lysin that specifically targets staph , but they always ran into the same problem .
Although hundreds of thousands of lysins could be expressed in an engineered cell , they all would stick together forming an insoluble clump , rendering them inactive .
" They were useless ; a real thorn in our side , " says Fischetti .
" We 've come across some problems cloning lysins for other bacteria , such as strep , but nothing to this extent . "
Lysins , proteins derived from the viruses that have been infecting bacteria for billions of years , have two basic components .
One acts as a recognition system to identify the specific bacteria species it has evolved to target ; the other works like a molecular power drill that bores holes through the bacterium 's cell wall , killing the organism .
Together , these two components work so quickly and so efficiently that bacteria have no time to develop resistance .
To develop a functional lysin , Fischetti's team , including Anu Daniel and Chad Euler , a former postdoc and a senior graduate fellow in the lab , respectively , took advantage of the modular nature of lysins .
In a series of progressive and logical steps , the team mixed and matched the two segments from 20 to 25 different staph - specific lysins until they created a chimera that , when expressed in sufficient numbers , did n't stick together .
They then tested the chimeric lysin -- named chimeric lysin for staphylococci , or ClyS -- to see if it would behave like one that had evolved in nature .
" It 's as if this chimeric lysin evolved on its own , " says Fischetti .
" It resists neutralization by antibodies that treat it as a foreign invader and it is highly , highly effective . "
By combining nature 's forces with technological power , Fischetti and his team have not only come up with an alternative way to defeat MRSA but have potentially breathed new life into drugs that are no longer effective against the organism .
Used alone , ClyS is able to kill all staph species , including strains of MRSA , in both culture and in mice .
But the researchers also found that when using ClyS together with the antibiotic oxacillin ( an antibiotic to which MRSA is resistant ) , the synergistic effect allowed them to administer both in very low doses , allowing a previously shelved and inexpensive antibiotic to be used again .
" This work came out of sheer persistence and hard , tedious work , " says Fischetti .
" But it also speaks to the power of nature and technology working together to help us win this battle of antibiotic resistance . "
Finally , FINALLY , I ’m able to make a decent colour view of the most interesting area of The Chocolate Hills … !
Please click on the image below to bring up a full size version …
That ’s something , is n’t it ?
All that flaky , crusty material on the top ?
Let ’s take an even closer look at that …
What IS that stuff ?
Well , the common belief is that it is “ fracture fill ” , that ’s material that was deposited inside cracks in the rock at some point – when they were underwater , perhaps , in the deep , distant past of this part of Mars – and were then exposed when the rock cracked open , revealing the layers of different minerals within .
That would back up what we ’re seeing on this image , and other images of these rocks : a layer of bluish - grey material sandwiched between layers of harder , more yellowy rocky material .
Fascinating whatever it is !
A couple more 3D views for you all to ( hopefully ! ) enjoy …

WASHINGTON — President Obama and Representative John A. Boehner , the House Republican leader , share a love of golf .
But the prospect of the two men hitting the links together would seem as likely as , say , the president and Mitch McConnell , the Senate minority leader , exchanging a hearty “ bro hug ” before Thursday ’s meeting on health care .
Beyond all the hand - wringing about hyper - partisanship that accompanies every discussion here these days , a more subtle — and perhaps pertinent — reality hangs over the much - anticipated Blair House confab : Mr. Obama and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill appear to have no personal chemistry whatsoever .
They have spent little time together since Mr. Obama took office .
White House and Congressional aides who have seen them interact describe the encounters as “ strained ” and “ scripted . ”
Mr. Boehner last week accused the president of being a “ finger - wagging ” lecturer , while Mr. Obama has complained to an aide that some House Republican leaders “ smirk ” through their meetings .
If good chemistry is essential to good politics , as Senator Edward M. Kennedy used to say , these guys are in oil and water territory .
“ Relationships matter in politics and you have to work at building them , ” said Senator Bob Corker , Republican of Tennessee , who like many Washington figures these days , invokes with nostalgia the friendship between President Ronald Reagan and the House speaker , Thomas P. O’Neill , bitter public adversaries who nonetheless forged a chummy and productive bond after hours .
A WATER Police officer dived into Port Phillip Bay to save a woman and then promptly arrested her for allegedly stealing a boat from the St Kilda Marina .
The drama began at around 11 am when a fisheries officer saw a boat run aground off Williamstown .
He recognised the vessel as belonging to a fisherman and made contact with the owner .
The boat had allegedly been stolen from the St Kilda Marina on last night .
Water Police called to the scene saw a woman struggling in the water about 500 m from shore , and senior Constable Andrew Folley dived in to save her .
The 27 - year - old Deer Park woman was arrested after it was determined she did not need medical assistance .
Police say another officer boarded the stolen vessel and arrested a man .
The 38 - year - old North Melbourne man and the woman are expected to be remanded in custody to appear in the Melbourne Magistrate 's Court on Monday .
The stolen vessel suffered extensive damage and had to be towed to Williamstown .
In this instructable I will demonstrate how to easily remove a tick from your dog without pulling it out .
The tick will crawl out on it's own and you wo n't have to deal with ' did I get it all out ? '.
This sounds like a magic trick and you might even think it is , I did .
My sister inlaw had been telling me how to do it for quite a while and I just never tried it , because I did n't think it would work .
One day when I was at the vet getting my dogs their yearly shots , my vet found a tick and removed it using this method and I was sold .
I easily remove about 20 ticks a year from my two dogs .
When I used the old way , which was get your tweezers as close to the head of the tick and pull straight out , it would often leave parts of the tick behind .
Ticks seem to like areas near the eyes and ears , which would leave marks and scars that would n't ever go away .
So how do you do it ?
Rub the tick in a circular motion and pretend you 're trying to make the tick dizzy .
I generally stick with one direction , clockwise .
It usually takes less than a minute , so if it 's not working , make sure the body of the tick is moving around .
Remember you can't get dizzy unless you 're actually moving in a circle , quickly .
I doubt the tick actually gets dizzy , but they sure do n't like something about the movement and they crawl out on their own .
This was too difficult to document with photos , so here 's the video .
Rupert Murdoch has called on Gulf states to open up their markets to global competition from companies such as his own News Corporation by cutting regulation and ending censorship .
In a keynote speech expounding the value of media content for its ability to contribute to global economic growth at the inaugural Abu Dhabi Media Summit , Murdoch said light - touch regulation would help the oil - rich Arab city state build an effective creative industry .
" A creative sector flourishes best in societies where governments intervene with a light hand , " he told an audience of 550 delegates at the inaugural summit .
Echoing a theme that is likely to be repeated at other events during the two - day summit , Murdoch promoted the idea of paying for content in a digital age in which much is expected to be free .
" In many parts of the world , we are finding that the best way to finance quality content is by having a balance of advertising and subscription revenue , " he said .
Murdoch , the owner of the Times and the Sun in the UK as well as the Wall Street Journal , New York Post and Fox in the US , also made a call for press freedom in a country criticised by others for its censorship .
" With this increased global attention comes the occasional inconvenient or unwelcome story .
Again , I speak from some personal experience .
Throughout my life , I have endured my share of blistering newspaper attacks … unflattering television coverage … and books that grossly distort my views or my businesses or both .
I have learned that this kind of coverage is a fact of life in a modern media society .
I have learned too that it is the price one pays for success .
" For a nation , the stakes are even higher .
In face of an inconvenient story , it can be tempting to resort to censorship or civil or criminal laws to try to bury it .
This is not only a problem here : in France a criminal defamation law remains in place .
In the long run , this is counterproductive .
Markets that distort their media end up promoting the very panic and distrust that they had hoped to control . "
The conference , with delegates including Maurice Lévy of Publicis , Tim Armstrong of AOL and Eric Schmidt of Google as well as James Murdoch , head of News Corp outside the US , and the Daily Mirror 's editor , Richard Wallace , was opened by Sheikh Mohammed Khalaf al - Mazrouei , the chairman of the government - owned Abu Dhabi Media Company .
The country , which has significant oil resources unlike its indebted neighbour Dubai , is keen to diversify into creative and cultural industries and the event , held at a five - star hotel , is an attempt to create the media equivalent of the Davos economic summit .
Murdoch said that the creative industry would create jobs that were " environmentally friendly , well paying , and contribute to a better quality of life " .
Calling for ad markets to be opened up , he said : " Opaque markets tend to be unfairly dominated by one or two players .
This can be a cosy arrangement for those players .
But a nation pays a very high price for this cosy arrangement – because it takes away the financial engine needed to drive investment in local content . "
Despite achieving much of his early success in the UK , Murdoch credited his adopted homeland for News Corp 's growth .
" We succeeded because the open American economy let us compete on our talents , " he said .
As well as investing in Rotana , the world 's largest producer of Arab music and setting up local production offices in Abu Dhabi , News Corp announced a strategic partnership between Fox International Channels and Abu Dhabi 's twofour 54 yesterday .

SAN JOSE , Calif . --
After experiencing the most unusual rash of injuries in recent memory this season , the Detroit Red Wings soon will be feeling the uncomfortable effects of a salary - cap crunch and roster pinch .
Tomas Holmstrom will return to the lineup Tuesday in San Jose .
No problem fitting him in .
That is why rookie Justin Abdelkader was assigned to Grand Rapids ( AHL ) on Friday .
The first difficult decision comes before
, when the club must trim one player to meet the 23 - man roster limit and shed roughly $ 700,000 to get under the $ 56.8 million cap .
One or more cuts will follow
from a concussion .
He will begin a conditioning stint in Grand Rapids ( AHL ) on Wednesday .
If all goes well for him , he could be activated as early as next week .
With Franzen and Lilja on the active roster , if there are no additional long - term injuries , the Red Wings would need to trim two players and about $ 2 million from their payroll , general manager Ken Holland said .
Here is a look at who is susceptible to being moved and who is safe ( their salary cap hit is in parentheses ) :
Ville Leino ( $ 800,000 )
It is becoming apparent he is on his way out .
He has had ample opportunity to prove he belongs and has not shown enough determination , losing puck battles and doing little offensively ( four goals , three assists in 42 games ) .
Maybe he will be an effective NHL player one day , but the Red Wings ca n’t afford to wait .
It is doubtful they would sacrifice anyone else at the expense of Leino .
In all likelihood , they will try to trade him for a low - round draft pick .
Failing that , he probably will be waived and claimed by another club .
Brad May ( $ 482,000 )
He has filled a valuable role as an enforcer and provides a physical presence in limited ice time .
It ’s nice to be able to insert him into the lineup against opponents that like to play rough .
But he likely will be waived if and when Lilja returns .
May undoubtedly would clear waivers , but it is doubtful he would go to Grand Rapids .
He is 38 and nearing the end of his career and might retire .
Derek Meech ( $ 483,000 )
Holland said it is unlikely he will carry eight defensemen .
That does n’t bode well for Meech if Lilja returns .
The Red Wings opted to keep Meech over Kyle Quincey at the start of last season .
Quincey has blossomed into a steady NHL defenseman .
Meech has lacked consistency , which is n’t easy to develop while being shuffled in and out of the lineup and sitting for long stretches .
If the club ca n’t deal Meech and opts to waive him , he likely would be claimed .
One concern for the Red Wings is losing a defenseman and then having Lilja experience a setback or just not being nearly as effective after missing almost one full year .
But their hands appear to be tied if he is cleared .
Brett Lebda ( $ 650,000 )
He has the edge over Meech , having played regularly on teams that reached the Stanley Cup finals the past two seasons .
Jason Williams ( $ 1.5 million )
Would the Red Wings consider moving this unrestricted free - agent forward now if they do n’t plan on re-signing him after the season ?
Probably not , considering they need offense .
Kirk Maltby ( $ 833,000 )
He likely is safe .
He has been a Red Wing for 14 seasons and though his output has declined and he is n’t as abrasive as he once was , he still is a valued penalty - killer .
Drew Miller ( $ 413,000 )
He is n’t going anywhere .
When the Red Wings plucked him off waivers from Tampa Bay on Nov. 11 , they probably expected to send him down when they got healthy .
Miller nixed that notion by doing a terrific job on the penalty - kill and providing more offense than anyone anticipated ( seven goals , 14 points ) .
He is a restricted free agent who surely will be re-signed in the off - season .
Patrick Eaves ( $ 500,000 )
He , too , is here to stay .
His stock has steadily risen after a slow start .
He is strong on the penalty - kill , willing to block shots , plays with an edge , forechecks hard , has speed and has fit in nicely on a consistent energy line with Darren Helm and Kris Draper .
Like Miller , he is a restricted free agent who figures to be re-signed .

American consumers , who spent a year watching Congress scratch and claw over sweeping health care legislation , can now try to figure out what the overhaul would mean for them .
The uninsured are clearly the biggest beneficiaries of the legislation , which would extend the health care safety net for the lowest - income Americans .
The legislation is meant to provide coverage for as many as 32 million people who have been shut out of the market — whether because insurers deem them too sick or because they cannot afford ever - rising insurance premiums .
For people already covered by a large employer — most Americans , in other words — the effect would not be as significant .
And yet , just about everyone might benefit from tighter insurance regulations .
HONG KONG — China executed more people last year than the rest of the world combined , according to a report published Tuesday by Amnesty International .
Amnesty said there were “ thousands ” of Chinese executions in 2009 — the precise number is considered a state secret — and the rights group called on Beijing to divulge how many it carries out .
The report said that at least 714 people were executed in 17 other countries , led by Iran , Iraq , Saudi Arabia and the United States .
Methods of execution included beheading , stoning , electrocution , hanging , firing squads and lethal injection .
Amnesty said in its report last year that China had executed at least 1,718 people in 2008 , nearly three - fourths of the 2,390 executions worldwide that year .
The Department of Defense has identified 4,364 American service members who have died since the start of the Iraq war and 938 who have died as a part of the Afghan war and related operations .
It confirmed the deaths of the following Americans this week :
Iraq :
JARRETT , Michael R. , 20 , Pfc. , Army ; North Platte , Neb. ; Second Battalion , 159th Aviation Regiment , 12th Combat Aviation Brigade .
Afghanistan :
HICKMAN , Jason O. B. , 35 , Sgt. First Class , Army ; Kingsport , Tenn. ; 25th Infantry Division .
JUAREZ , Mark D. , 23 , Lance Cpl. , Marines ; San Antonio ; Third Marine Division .
MEINERT , Jacob A. , 20 , Lance Cpl. , Marines ; Fort Atkinson , Wis. ; Third Marine Division .
I was reading some LDS blogs earlier this week and happened upon this cryptic post about how “ Someone else shouldnt decide if I can write a book , and which course I should pursue in the process . [… ]
When our founding fathers wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , they gave me that right . ” and “ Every year the government takes a few more choices away from me , and force me down a path that I dont want to go , but I still think this is the best country in the entire world , ” — ending with a stirring rendition of “ God Bless America . ”
Naturally , this left me going “ What on Earth is she talking about … ? ”
And then it hit me : that health care reform bill must have passed !
I ’m sorry I have n’t been following this issue closely .
I hate to take an attitude of “ I live in Europe so I ’ve got mine — good luck to the rest of y’all ” but I have to admit that I ’ve kind of tuned out this whole debate ever since it turned into a total circus .
I commend those of you who ’ve had the perseverance to follow this issue to the end .
Here ’s what the folks of Outer Blogness and beyond are saying about it :
Some feel that in America today there ’s just too much of this representative - government - passing - laws - some - people - don ’t - like , so the forces of “ liberty ” have decided to improve on the democratic process by throwing rocks through people ’s windows and threatening legislators with violence .
Dale is unimpressed by tropes like the “ tearful eulogy for the America We Loved , ” but is outraged by “ the suggestion that this Act confers benefits on people who unlike the speaker have not earned them , ” and Mr. Hackman has some mathematical remarks about the idea that “ the working poor are not to be cut any slack because , even though they are working , they obviously have been making poor choices in life … which is why they are poor . ”
The Urban Koda also does a little math to put health care in perspective .
Anachronologist argues we still have a long way to go and proposes that we put our HCR predictions in a time capsule .
Meanwhile , if ( like me ) you ’re wondering precisely what it was that passed , Djinn points us towards an informative graphic !
( Then points out the bad news … )
And speaking of the end of the world , Andee has questions about a prank to convince Christians they ’ve been “ left behind . ”
On to discussions !
Curmudgeon wants to debate the question “ Are we born with God ? ” — coincidentally the same question Christopher Smith wrote about last week !
You guys should totally get together and discuss this .
Awakening has a theological puzzle about how God ’s physical body affects
His omnipotence .
And Jon has suggested a game of critiquing the worst arguments for atheism .
And “ Sunday in Outer Blogness ” would n’t be complete without stories about Mormonism !
Reina got her “ Dodge Letter ” — and had an unexpected reaction !
Via reddit , another interesting gay Mormon story .
Mason responds to the question “ Did you pray with full intent ? ”
Finally , following up on our discussion of how Mormon females are encouraged ( or not ) to follow their dreams , Jana recounts her path to technology .
And G recounts a short memory that basically nails what it was like …

Mountain View , California ( CNN ) --
Google long has been an advocate of a single Web , one that 's free of government censorship and barriers to information access .
That 's not the reality in today 's world however .
Governments from China to France put various roadblocks in the information superhighway to serve their interests , filter speech or protect copyrights .
And high - speed Internet connections have n't reached all corners of the globe -- not even all parts of the United States .
To learn more about this split between Google 's idea of an all - access Web and the reality today , CNN sat down recently with Derek Slater , one of Google 's policy analysts .
Slater declined to comment on Google 's negotiations with China .
The search engine has threatened to pull out of the country after the Gmail accounts of some human rights activists were hacked .
Since this interview , it has been reported that Google is working with the National Security Agency to prevent similar cyberattacks .
But Slater did offer insights about increasing today 's sluggish Internet speeds and why a unified Web can change peoples ' lives .
The following is an edited transcript :
CNN : What are you expecting from the broadband talks in the United States ?
Slater : Earlier in the year the FCC [ Federal Communications Commission ] started its proceedings to create a national broadband plan , and in our view that 's a great step in the right direction , to make the U.S. once again a leader in broadband .
The Internet was essentially invented here , but over the years we 've fallen further and further behind in speed , deployment , penetration .
And we think it is essential that there be a national goal to have fast , affordable and open access to the Internet .
CNN : What are n't we doing that we should be ?
Slater :
It 's a combination of classical and jazz .
So there are certain things that we need to do in order to bring faster connections to all Americans , to make sure there 's really , truly universal service , and updating the ways in which we do that .
But there 's also a range of experimentation that 's going to have to go into this .
It 's a really difficult challenge to think about how are we going to move not just a step further in terms of the speeds that we 're getting today , but a leap further .
How are we going to get to 100 megabits per second , a gigabit per second , to homes ?
There is no silver bullet there .
Instead , it 's going to take encouraging creative solutions .
Some of them will come from the public sector , that is , some of them will involve municipalities or governments .
Some of them are going to come from the private sector .
And some of them are going to be a mix .
CNN : What are the ideas that Google has submitted to the FCC ?
Slater :
One is that community institutions can serve as hubs to improve adoption within communities .
Schools , libraries , health care facilities can be local and centralized points where people from the community who are n't familiar with Internet access or do n't have access to it can get access , and we can help achieve universal adoption .
...
One other one that we had talked about was encouraging deployment of multiple strands of fiber to peoples ' homes .
That 's because the biggest cost of broadband is digging up the streets , running cables into peoples ' homes and so - on .
CNN : Zooming back a bit , why is broadband [ high - speed Internet ] important for the average person ?
Slater : Broadband is the dial tone of the 21st century .
It is essential for participation in civil society and political processes .
It 's also essential infrastructure when it comes to economic growth and innovation , and job creation .
It 's also to this century what the beginning of national highways and the electricity grid was for the 20th century .
It 's going to be an input into a broad range of economic activities .
So , as we fall behind , that 's also falling behind in our global competitiveness and our global ability to grow our economy and compete as an innovative country .
That 's why this is a national issue , and that 's why broadband is different from average consumer goods .
CNN : Why is an " open Internet " important to the globe , or to developing countries ?
Slater :
At this point the benefits of the open Internet are really indisputable .
We 've seen unprecedented innovation come from that .
Not just companies like Google , but all sorts , both commercial and not .
The net is also essential to free expression and creativity .
It 's democratizing the ability for everyone to speak and create .
It puts a printing press and a megaphone in everyone 's hands .
That can reach billions of people potentially all over the world .
That sort of democratization of creativity , of innovation , of free expression , is essential to us all , essential to our economy and our society .
You can look specifically at the way the Internet today is transforming the way small businesses operate .
Through both Google and other platforms they can advertise their businesses , make people aware of what they 're doing online , which they could n't do through traditional media as easily .
CNN : Are there limits to how much the Internet can improve peoples ' lives ?
Slater : Faster broadband is not a cure - all to everything , but we see every day how it is improving our economy and benefiting our society .
...
I think improving broadband infrastructure can improve peoples ' lives in a number of core areas that are important to our society .
Health care .
Improving medical treatment .
Imagine if someone in rural Montana could do a medical consultation over the Internet with an expert in New York City .
Imagine the same thing if we were talking about a student in Iowa [ who ] could do a distance learning course with somebody miles away , and in that way could improve education .
CNN : In watching the first weeks after the earthquake in Haiti , have you thought of any ways tech infrastructure or the Web might be used to help build that country back up ?
Slater :
That 's a really interesting question , and I do n't have a great answer off the top of my head .
I 've only seen parts of [ the news coverage ] , but it 's been amazing to watch all of the sites that have sprung up to get funding to Haiti . ...
Google set up a site to help drive funding there .
It 's amazing how quickly that stuff can just take root and spread quickly throughout our society .
It reminds me in certain ways of the protests in Iran .
It was so quick and easy for people there to start snapping photos and tweeting .
And that information diffused and spread throughout the world in a very quick way and a way we 've never seen before .
Update : I ’ve added a few more examples of spin and accusations of bias against PSU as well as some good reporting examples that were not posted as of last night .
After the CRU emails were released in November , 2009 , there was widespread accusations of misconduct against most of the scientists mentioned in the emails .
Today , the Penn State University ( PSU ) inquiry committee investigating accusations made against Dr. Michael Mann publicly released its findings .
The committee found that , with respect to the most serious three accusations out of four , “ there exists no credible evidence ” that Mann had committed research misconduct .
The inquiry committee empaneled an investigation committee to look into the last accusation – that Mann had “ seriously deviated from accepted practices within the academic community ” – because they could make a determination about this and because
Only with such a review will the academic community and other interested parties likely feel that Penn State has discharged its responsibility on this matter .
According to the report , neither the inquiry committee nor the University received any formal allegations of research misconduct before or during the inquiry , so the committee generated four allegations after “ [ reducing ] to allegation form the many different accusations that were received from parties outside of the University . ”
The accusations were reduced down to the following four :
Did [ Mann ] engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any actions with the intent to suppress or falsify data ?
Did [ Mann ] engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any actions with the intent to delete , conceal or otherwise destroy emails , information and / or data , related to AR4 , as suggested by Phil Jones ?
Did [ Mann ] engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any misuse of privileged or confidential information available to [ him ] in [ his ] capacity as an academic scholar ?
Did [ Mann ] engage in , or participate in , directly or indirectly , any actions that seriously deviated from accepted practices within the academic community for proposing , conducting , or reporting research or other scholarly activities ?
After reviewing all the CRU emails that Mann sent , received , or even discussed Mann ’s work , and after the inquiry committee researched other relevant information from the National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) , science journal articles , OP - ED columns , and even internet blogs , the committee interviewed Mann .
Several days after that interview , the committee also interviewed Dr. Gerald North , the lead author of the NAS paper that exonerated Mann ’s research and the so - called hockey stick temperature graph in 2006 , as well as the former editor of Mann ’s Science Magazine associated science article .
And the outcome of all the research and interviews was that there was no substance to the first three allegations above .
The inquiry committee specifically pointed out that the “ trick ” email that has drawn a lot of attention used the word “ trick ”
to describe a mathematical insight that solves the problem .
For example , see in a classic text on quantum mechanics by David Parks :
“ The foregoing explanation of the velocity paradox involves no new assumptions ; the basic trick , the representation of a modulated wave as the superposition of two ( or more ) unmodulated ones , has already been used to explain interference phenomena … ”
This is a point that has been made repeatedly ever since the CRU emails were released last November .
The fourth and final allegation will be reviewed by an investigation committee because the inquiry committee wanted a group of professors ( the inquiry committee was composed of administrators ) to determine if Mann ’s private emails cast doubt on his professionalism and because of the risks to PSU ’s public reputation .
In addition , the administrators did n’t feel that they could judge what qualified as “ accepted practice ” for Mann and his field of climatology when accepted practice can vary from one scientific discipline to another .
Overall , however , the PSU inquiry committee found that the three allegations of research misconduct were all without merit and that they were unqualified to determine whether the final allegation had merit or not .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the news of Mann ’s exoneration on three of the four accusations has been met with spin from partisan media , accusations of bias , and even claims of conspiracy .
While there ’s been a number of media sites that spun this story in a fashion that focused exclusively on the investigation while downplaying the fact that the three most serious allegations were all found to be without merit , this Washington Examiner piece went a bit too far with their spin .
They wrote that PSU officials were investigating “ at least one charge of professional misconduct . ”
Given that the inquiry report found exactly one potential problem , the “ at least one ” is unjustified and represents blatant spin .
Update : World Net Daily commits as great a sin of spin as the Washington Examiner does , claiming that “ [ e ] ven colleagues want ‘ warming ’ scientist investigated ” and “ [ a ] panel of fellow faculty members at Penn State University has recommended further investigation …. ”
Make that University administrators , not fellow faculty .
There ’s also no mention of the fact that Mann was exonerated on three of four allegations , an attempt to show that Mann is out of step with mainstream scientists by comparing him to the thoroughly debunked OISM Petition Project , and pointing to the biased and flawed work of Icecap ’s Joe D’Aleo .
Paul Chesser at the American Spectator blog has forgone the spin and flat - out accused the University of bias .
Chesser says that the PSU committee ’s reference to the CRU emails as “ stolen ” casts doubt on the committee ’s objectivity , that the administrators ca n’t be objective given the fact that Mann ’s reputation reflects on theirs , and he accuses PSU of committing a “ whitewash . ”
Tobacco and Big Oil shill Steve Milloy also accused PSU of bias in a press release that accuses the committee of not being thorough and essentially calls them liars with respect to whether or not Mann deleted emails under an FOI request from the UK .
And here ’s another example , from Pajamas Media , where the common “ whitewash ” and “ greywash ” memes of Milloy and American Spectator are again repeated .
Update : More accusations of supposed “ whitewash ” by Green Hell , and Andrew Bolt ( with grand conspiracy claims in the comments ) .
But the posts get really interesting at blogs like Michelle Malkin ’s and Big Government , where the commentators claim outright that this is an example of a leftist / socialist / statist plot , or that PSU is beholden to the money that Mann has brought into the university , or that Mann is guilty of fraud and deserves to be imprisoned .
James Delingpole at the Telegraph is perhaps the most extreme , claiming that “ Michael Mann is as innocent as OJ ” and repeating false claims about Mann ’s work on the pre-industrial temperature record .
And , given the history between Steve McIntyre of Climate Audit and Mann , as well as the climate disruption denial stoked by both McIntyre and Anthony Watts of Wattsupwiththat , it ’s not surprising that both blogs illustrate spin , bias , and paranoid conspiracies .
Thankfully , Mann has his defenders as well , among them Kevin Grandia of DeSmogBlog and the Huffington Post , Pete Altman at the NRDC Switchboard blog , climatologist and science blogger Eli Rabett , and the Union of Concerned Scientists , to name just a few .
And there are a number of other observers of this investigation who view it as a partial exoneration because they take the PSU inquiry committee at their word barring proof of misconduct by the committee itself .
In fact , most of the traditional media falls into this category , such as James Broder of the NYTimes , The Canadian Press , The Seattle Times , even Ars Technica .
Update : Some more examples of good reporting on the PSU finding include The LA Times , the Catallaxy Files blog , and The Great Beyond blog at Nature .
This story is n’t over .
Mann said as much in his statement :
Three of the four allegations have been dismissed completely .
Even though no evidence to substantiate the fourth allegation was found , the University administrators thought it best to convene a separate committee of distinguished scientists to resolve any remaining questions about academic procedures .
This particular chapter in the Climategate saga wo n’t be closed until after the five faculty investigation committee completes their investigation into the last allegation sometime in the next 120 days .
And if the response of the denialosphere to this partial exoneration is any indication , the Mann saga wo n’t be over even then .
What will probably happen with respect to Mann is what has happened repeatedly with respect to climate disruption science over the last decade or more – self - described skeptics and climate disruption deniers will claim that this time it ’s the end of climate disruption .
No , this time .
No , this time ….
Disclosure : I attended PSU for my BSEE back in the 1990s .
Thanks to Kevin Grandia of DeSmogBlog for posting this over at HuffPo , where I initially came across it .
Roggenbier ( literally " Rye Beer " ) is a modern recreation of the traditional German rye beers brewed in the period before the Reinheitsgebot .
Brewed with a combination of barley , wheat , and rye , it is usually a dark , grainy , lightly - hopped beer , and is often served unfiltered , with the yeast poured into the glass ( " mit Hefe " ) in a manner similar to a Hefeweizen .
Weizen ale yeast is often used , resulting in a beer with some of the flavors traditionally associated with a Weizen .
For these reasons , modern Roggenbier is sometimes considered a subcategory of Weizen .
History of Roggenbier
European brewers , including German brewers , brewed beer with rye for centuries , as well as with whatever other grain they could get their hands on .
However , in the medieval period the leaders of some German states decided that rye should be reserved for bread making .
With the extension of the Reinheitsgebot throughout modern Germany , rye brewing declined and , eventually , disappeared .
Five hundred years later , in 1988 , German brewers began recreating these beers .
The modern version is usually similar to a Dunkelweizen , but with about half of the wheat replaced with rye .
It is not clear how similar these beers truly are to the medieval brewing tradition they claim to have revived .

No diacetyl .
History : A specialty beer originally brewed in Regensburg , Bavaria as a more distinctive variant of a dunkelweizen using malted rye instead of malted wheat .
Comments : American - style rye beers , or traditional beer styles with enough rye added to give a noticeable rye character should be entered in the specialty beer category instead .
Rye is a huskless grain and is difficult to mash , often resulting in a gummy mash texture that is prone to sticking .
Rye has been characterized as having the most assertive flavor of all cereal grains .
It is inappropriate to add caraway seeds to a roggenbier ( as some American brewers do ) ; the rye character is traditionally from the rye grain only .
Ingredients : Malted rye typically constitutes 50 % or greater of the grist ( some versions have 60 - 65 % rye ) .
Remainder of grist can include pale malt , Munich malt , wheat malt , crystal malt and / or small amounts of debittered dark malts for color adjustment .
Weizen yeast provides distinctive banana esters and clove phenols .
Light usage of noble hops in bitterness , flavor and aroma .
Lower fermentation temperatures accentuate the clove character by suppressing ester formation .
Decoction mash commonly used ( as with weizenbiers ) .
Commercial Examples : Paulaner Roggen ( formerly Thurn und Taxis , no longer imported into the US ) , Bu̹rgerbräu Wolznacher Roggenbier

On Martin Luther King Jr. Day , Monday , hundreds of people will gather , greet friends , hear inspiring words , walk Spokane streets together and promote racial and community harmony .
It ’s a genuine community event , but some of us experience it more personally because our lives , faith perspectives and worldviews were transformed by the life and death of Dr. King .
Last year seemed particularly significant because of the convergence of MLK Day with the presidential inauguration of Barack Obama , a refreshing bit of history that will be forever linked to some of King ’s contributions to our culture .
Unfortunately , President Obama has cast a cloud over Martin Luther King Jr. Day , regarding the most vital gifts from our 20th - century hero .
Sadly paraphrased : Rosa sat so Martin could walk .
Martin walked so Barack could run .
Barack backpedaled to have his war and a Nobel , too .
In an Oslo auditorium , graced 45 years earlier by Martin Luther King Jr. , President Obama last month trivialized King ’s choice to follow Jesus and Gandhi , suffer instead of inflict suffering , convert instead of crush .
King was presented the Nobel Prize for Peace for steadfastly practicing nonviolence as he led the civil rights movement through violent threats and actual violence against African Americans , liberal activists , his family and his life .
Obama was selected for the same distinction for talking the talk and igniting hope that the U.S. could lead the way to peace and reconciliation .
Obama gave an eloquent speech in Oslo , but he appeased our corporate masters , who crave distant wars , never risking their own lives and fortunes as the poor are routinely sacrificed for power and energy supremacy .
Obama undermined the honor , justifying his own quagmire , the vacuous war in Afghanistan , inherited from President George W. Bush .
Avoiding the truth that we have much to lose and nothing to gain circulating war - weary troops from bleak objective to senseless atrocity , Obama smeared the success of King ’s victory , which proved nonviolent action is the moral , rational and pragmatic answer to oppression and conflict .
Obama dismissed the proposition that war is evil , futile and disastrous , denying that nonviolence , as taught and waged by King and Gandhi , has not failed when relentlessly and patiently practiced .
Saying Hitler could not have been stopped by nonviolent resistance , Obama slighted Norway , whose people did exactly that , sparing their country Nazi domination and the devastation suffered by countries with powerful armies .
Jimmy Carter , a former commander - in - chief , said , when he received the Peace Prize in 2002 , “ War may sometimes be a necessary evil .
But no matter how necessary , it is always an evil , never a good .
We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other ’s children . ”
Of course , Dr. King ’s Nobel lecture is filled with memorable lines .
It ’s incomprehensible to me that Obama could ignore or contradict so many great quotes in his own speech , although we ’re accustomed to lip service to King ’s memory from apologists for war .
A few lines from King ’s 1964 Nobel lecture , almost three years before he powerfully and specifically condemned the Vietnam War :
“ This problem of spiritual and moral lag … expresses itself in three larger problems which grow out of man ’s ethical infantilism .
Each of these problems , while appearing to be separate and isolated , is inextricably bound to the other .
I refer to racial injustice , poverty , and war .
“… ( W ) ar is obsolete .
There may have been a time when war served as a negative good by preventing the spread and growth of an evil force , but the destructive power of modern weapons eliminated even the possibility that war may serve as a negative good .
If we assume that life is worth living and that man has a right to survive , then we must find an alternative to war . ”
It ’s easy to name a piece of street for Dr. King .
It ’s difficult to see his war criticism as anything less than prophetic .
The challenge on MLK Day 2010 is to accept the fact that we have dodged the part of his example intended for us , comfortable Americans who made war and violence our default choices .
To honor Dr. King , we have to change , and we have to take President Obama with us .
Rusty Nelson , who was a U.S. Army lieutenant in South Vietnam when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated , spent 22 years helping staff the Peace and Justice Action League of Spokane .
When it comes to sovereign default risk , it 's all about the percentage of debt held by foreigners .
That 's because when domestic citizens own their government 's debt , it 's just a shell game whereby a portion of private wealth has been gobbled up by the public sphere , but the nation 's public + private net debt balance is zero .
Yet when foreigners hold tons of government debt , then the nation in question is truly ' in debt ' .
That 's why the Japanese government can manage massive amounts of debt , which is mostly owned by Japanese tax payers , while Greece is screwed , as shown by this Deutsche Bank chart below ( Via FTAlphaville ) :
This is why Europe would probably bail out Greece .
Quite a few European banks probably have exposure to Greek debt , which could make for a messy situation Europe would rather avoid .
Some speculate that Germany in particular could become Greece 's savior , their Abu Dhabi if you will .
Times Online : Would Germany do it ?
Yes , almost certainly .
“ In Merkel ’s generation , ” one German fund manager said , “ there is still a sense of responsibility for Europe , and that really drives a lot of her decisions . ”
But not all agree — Wolfgang Schäuble , the Finance Minister , for one , has said that German taxpayers should not have to foot the bill .
In practice , if Germany did , in effect , guarantee Greek debt , the slight widening of German credit spreads would probably not push up the costs of borrowing to a politically painful point .
It would be a tough sell for Merkel at home , but , only a few months after the elections , one she has enough capital to win .
No , we 're not saying we wish the British had won the war or that we wish America had never been born .
We 're just saying that American history glosses over a lot of true dick behavior .
After all , consider that ...
But as it turns out , these latest teabaggers are simply carrying on a longstanding tradition of proud , vaguely patriotic douchebaggery that they learned from the OG's of asshole behavior ; the guys who tossed some tea into a harbor a couple hundred years ago .
It 's easy to say the modern teabaggers are assholes .
The modern teabaggers are assholes .
See ?
We did n't even break a sweat .
5 Great Britain Had No Idea The Colonists Were Unhappy

Benjamin Franklin had been chosen by the Pennsylvania colonial legislature to represent the colonies before the crown .
If the colonies were pissed , or sick of paying unfair taxes ( or as was more often the case , not paying them ) , it was Franklin 's job to let the crown know .
Unfortunately , Ben really loved the crown .
Right before the revolution , he had been trying , unsuccessfully , to convince the king to take back Pennsylvania from the Penn family , and put it under royal control .

When the issue of the Stamp Act first came up , even though the colonists were furious , Ben Franklin was all about it , and he told Great Britain as much .
Hell , he even gave a friend of his the cushy job collecting the new taxes .
But Why ?
Because he was fucking clueless about the people he was representing and spent most of his time in Britain .
When colonists eventually showed up at his house rioting , he must have been just shocked that they were so angry about the Stamp Act .
Or , he would have been shocked , but people were rioting at his house and threatening to hang him , so he kind of had some other stuff to deal with .

When you think about it , Ben Franklin was a terrible choice for Voice of the People .
The dude managed to be a rich , successful , self - made , internationally jet - setting playboy in the 18th goddamn century , for fuck 's sake .
John Q. Public he was not .
Of course he did n't mind the Stamp Act ; if it did n't at all impede his ability to fuck princesses on hot air balloons , ( or whatever the 18th Century analogue to the mile high club was ) , why should he care ?
Franklin's hypothetical balloon - humping to one side , the point is that Great Britain was blissfully unaware on the other side of the ocean while the colonists steamed and let their rage build .

REUTERS / Finbarr O'Reilly
( Reuters ) - A new type of computer virus is known to have breached almost 75,000 computers in 2,500 organizations around the world , including user accounts of popular social network websites , according Internet security firm NetWitness .
The latest virus -- known as “ Kneber botnet ” -- gathers login credentials to online financial systems , social networking sites and email systems from infested computers and reports the information back to hackers , NetWitness said in a statement .
A botnet is an army of infected computers that hackers can control from a central machine . ”
The company said the attack was first discovered in January during a routine deployment of NetWitness software .
Further investigation by the Herndon , Virginia - based software security firm revealed that many commercial and government systems were compromised , including 68,000 corporate login credentials and access to email systems , online banking sites , Yahoo , Hotmail and social networks such as Facebook .
“ Conventional malware protection and signature - based intrusion detection systems are , by definition , inadequate for addressing Kneber or most other advanced threats , ” Chief Executive Amit Yoran said in a statement .

A recent study conducted by Hollins University indicates that 48 % of sodas from soda fountains in the United States are contaminated with coliform bacteria .
The researchers drew the conclusions from a test of 90 beverages from 30 fountains in fast food restaurants .
The bacteria found was a form of fecal contamination , it was discovered , although it was not immediately clear whether it came from the soda fountains themselves , or people with dirty hands .
Other bacteria were also found in the soda samples , including E.coli , present in eleven percent of the tested beverages .
Many of the soda drinks apparently fell below the US Environmental Protection Agency 's minimum standards for drinking water ; regulations state that samples cannot test positive for E.coli bacteria .
In total , 20 % of soda fountains had more than the maximum recommended levels of bacteria .
" The large number of beverages and soda fountain machines containing E. coli is still of considerable concern [...] and suggests that more pathogenic strains of bacteria could persist and thrive in soda fountain machines if introduced , " the authors of the study wrote .
Renee Godard , the study 's lead author , and a professor of biology and environmental studies at Hollins University , commented on the findings .
" Certainly we come in contact with bacteria all the time .
It 's simply that some bacteria may potentially cause some disease or gastrointestinal distress .
One thing we hesitate with is that people get afraid of bacteria .
Many of them are benign or helpful , but certainly , I do n't want E.coli in my beverage , " she said .
Godard and her team took samples of 90 different beverages from three groups - sugar soda , diet soda , water - from 30 fast - food restaurants in Roanoke , Virginia .
" You can get collections of bacteria in the water line and that then runs through the whole machine and gets in to the beverage .
Any time any water or liquid sits somewhere , it 's just a breeding ground for bacteria , " commented Primary Care Physician Alanna Levine .
Experts suggest that plastic nozzles used on soda fountains might be part of the reason why the study found so much bacteria is present ; it takes only a single dirty hand to spread bacteria over a tube , and it could be easily transferred to the rest of the fountain from there .
" It could be from dispensing with a hand that was n't clean or using wet rags to wipe down the machine .
We have n't done the work to really identify those potential sources and how these bacteria get established , " Godard said .
A professor at the University of California Davis , however , said he believed that a single localised study was n't enough to come to a conclusion about soda machines throughout the country .
" How sanitation regulations are promulgated and enforced in a community are different .
Some communities are more on to it than others .
How much of a threat it represents ?
It 's probably limited .
Once again , it 's a matter of what regulations are in place , who pays attention and whether it 's being followed , " he said , as quoted by CNN .
The National Restaurant Association responded to the university 's findings in an e-mail statement .
" While the results of this study are disconcerting , we feel that it is n't representative of our industry and that our guests can safely enjoy beverages from dispensers and single - serve containers alike , " the organisation said .
The American Beverage Association also countered the findings .
" Fountain beverages are safe .
Consumers can rest assured that our industry 's fountain beverages pose no public health risk . [...]
Importantly , our industry meets , and often exceeds , all government health standards in bringing its products to market . "

So , I have a question :
Since when was it any damn news anchor 's business how good of a Catholic their guests are ?
Last night , filling in for Bill O'Reilly on his Fox program , Laura Ingraham invited on Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois to talk about health - care reform and comprehensive immigration reform , Ingraham took a wild tack to go after Gutierrez :
She questioned him on how good of a Catholic he was , because he had announced he was voting in favor of President Obama 's health - care package .
Her reasoning was that the national Catholic Bishops ' conference had announced that anyone voting in favor of the bill would not be a good Catholic .
As Gutierrez tried to politely point out , this really is a church - state separation matter .
Or has Ingraham forgotten the bad old days when it was pro forma for anti-Catholic bigots to accuse Catholic politicians of doing the bidding of the Vatican ?
Maybe Ingraham should ask those nuns who defied the bishops just how good of Catholics they are .
Hold out your wrists , young lady !
SECTION 0 : General Introduction
The previous tutorial examined how " narrow - phase " collision detection works in N ; given two shapes ( a dynamic AABB or circle , and a static tile ) , we learned how to project the dynamic object out of the tile .
This tutorial deals with " broad - phase " collision detection : given a dynamic object in a world full of tiles , how do we know which objects and tiles it should be tested with during the narrow phase ?
The solution used in N was to split the world into a uniform grid of square " cells " ; instead of testing the dynamic object against all the tiles in the world , we only need to test against the tiles contained in the cells which are touching the dynamic object .
The one problem with our approach is that all dynamic objects must be smaller than a grid cell ; while this limitation can be circumvented ( for instance , by representing a single large object as multiple smaller objects ) , in actionscript , it really helps keep things running fast .
Thus , it was a self - imposed design constraint .
Grids tend to work best when all game objects are of roughly the same size and the game world is relatively small ; an NxN grid requires N^2 cells , so for larger worlds the memory requirements might be prohibitive .
More complex structures which are used to partition game worlds , such as quadtrees or multi-resolution grids , save memory and / or make it easier to support objects of vastly different size .
[ back to table of contents ]
SECTION 1 : Basic Tile Grid
The first use of the grid was to store the tilemap data which defines the " solid " parts of the world ; since tile - based games use a grid of tiles , a grid seemed like a good fit ;)
The grid itself is simply a 2D array ; each entry in the array is a cell object .
In N , each cell is occupied by a single tile - shape .
The first thing we'd like to be able to do is to determine , given a position , which cell contains this position .
This is easily done :
grid_column = Math.floor( pos.x / cell_width ) ;
grid_row = Math.floor ( pos.y / cell_height ) ;
Now we can easily determine which cell contains our dynamic object 's center ; we call this cell the current cell of the object .
Since we 've restricted the object 's size to less than the size of a cell , we know that the object can only overlap at most 4 cells .
instructions :
drag the blue box to move it within its current cell .
comments :
the grid cells touched by the box are highlighted in red .
note that if the object overlaps the current cell 's right neighbor ,
it can't possibly overlap the left neighbor ; likewise for the up / down neighbors .
Figure 0 . The Cells Touched by an Object
We can safely assume that the object will , at most , be overlapping the current cell , a horizontal neighbor of the current cell , a vertical neighbor of the current cell , and a diagonal neighbor of the current cell ; the diagonal neighbor is also a neighbor of the horiz / vert.
neighbors .
Determining which cells an object overlaps can be done is various ways :
. you can simply use 4 position - lookups ( one for each of the object 's corners )
. you can use one position lookup ( with the object 's center ) to determine the current cell 's index in the 2D grid , and then use offsets from this index based on the object 's position relative to the current cell 's position ( i.e. if the object 's center is left and below the current cell 's center , and the current cell 's index is [ i ] [ j ] , we know we have to look at the left , down , and left - down neighbors , or [ i - 1 ] [j ] , [ i ] [ j+1 ] , [ i - 1 ] [ j+1 ] .
We can run into problems if part of the object is outside of the boundary of the grid ; this results in the above methods generating cell indices which do n't exist .
This can be avoided by using min/max to keep the indices within the limits of the grid , or by using modulo to " wrap " the indices to the other side of the grid .
A much simpler solution is to pad the outside edges of the grid with " border " cells , which can't be occupied by an object ; this prevents objects from leaving the boundary of the grid .
--= collision vs. a tilemap using the grid =--
Now that we know the 4 cells touched by our dynamic object , we need to collide the object against the tiles contained in those cells .
The actual collision process is described in the first tutorial .
Each cell in the grid stores tile information describing the tile contained in that cell .
this includes a flag indicating the shape of the tile , as well as any tile - specific properties needed by the collision routines ( i.e. x - width , center position , surface normal ) .
To implement this , you can define a set of tile objects ; each tile is responsible for generating collision results between itself and a dynamic object :
tile.Collide_Circle(myCircle )
Or , you can use a simpler c- like approach where both the tile and the object are simply containers of data , and collision functions are stored in a 2D hash - list of collision functions ; the shape - flags of the objects being collided are used as hash keys to select the appropriate function :
Collide[tile.shape][myObj.shape ]( tile , myObj )
[ back to table of contents ]
SECTION 2 : Advanced Tile Grid
--= grid improvements =--
Now that we have a simple grid in place for use with object - vs. - tilemap collision , there are certain things we could do to make it more efficient .
The first thing is to store , in each cell , direct references to that cell 's 4 neighbors .
This way , once we 've determined an object 's current cell , we can access the neighboring cells using a single property lookup ; this results in a smaller number of calculations when accessing neighboring cells but causes each cell to occupy more memory .
Since the cost of calculating cell indices is likely to be negligible in many programming environments , this trade - off might not always be worthwhile .
In N we implemented these neighbor " pointers " separately :
cell .nR //right , left , up , down neighbors
cell.nL
cell.nU
cell.nD
--= edge info =--
One major enhancement we made to our grid is to store information , not only about each cell , but about each of the cell 's 4 edges .
This idea was borrowed from an article in Game Programming Gems 3 [ Forsyth ] which mentioned that the game X - Com used a similar structure .
The edge data we stored was very minimal ; a single flag which indicates the state of the edge :
. empty : neither of the cells which share this edge contains a solid tile shape
. solid : each tile shape has at least one edge which matches a grid edge perfectly ; these edges were labeled solid .
. interesting : edges which were adjacent to a cell containing a solid tile shape , but which did n't match the shape perfectly were labeled " interesting " , indicating that we needed to perform further collision tests .
For instance , the two edges on the outside of a triangle 's hypotenuse are " interesting " .
Once each tile has been assigned a set of edge states , we then need to compare the edge states of neighboring tiles ; any edge at which both tiles have solid edge states should be considered empty , as such a configuration only exists below the surface of the world .
Such a change will have no impact on the correctness of the collision results , since objects should only collide with the world 's surface .
Figure 1 . The 9 Tile Shapes Used in N , and their Corresponding Edge States
Solid edges are highlighted in red and interesting edges in grey .
Having this edge info let us skip a lot of tile - specific collision routines ; if an object overlaps a solid edge ( which is very common in tile - based games ) , we simply project it out of that edge instead of having to resort to a more complex object - vs . - tile collision test .
Since the only edges which were labeled " solid " are those which perfectly match the shape of a tile , the result is the same as if we had used an object - vs . - tile test , but it 's much simpler to compute .
The only time we have to resort to tile - specific collision routines is when an object touches an " interesting " edge .
This edge information can be considered a coarse approximation of the surface of the world described by the tilemap ; this is sometimes useful since a normal tilemap does n't contain any explicit surface information , and knowing the surface of the world is often useful -- for instance to allow enemies to move along the world 's surface .
Figure 2 . An Example Tile Map Containing Chunks of Contiguous Tiles and their Edge States
Solid edges are highlighted in red and interesting edges in grey .
Note that the non-empty edges form a perimeter around each chunk which approximates the chunk 's surface .
Having this extra edge info for each cell may or may not be useful in your game .
In N , doors were easily implemented as objects which changed the value of a cell 's edge states .
This was a pleasant side - effect of using edges .
Additionally , the enemy AI uses edge states for pathfinding ; this lets enemies respond to doors , and follow the ( approximate ) surface of the world .
Our ray - queries were also sped up by using this edge info .
Unfortunately , the state of each edge is determined by the state of the two cells adjacent to it ; the logic we implemented to correctly setup the edges was complex and quite prone to bugs , since we had to consider each possible combination of cell states .
A simpler method to setup / define edge states probably exists ; please let us know if you come up with anything .
[ back to table of contents ]
SECTION 3 : Object Grid
The grid structure described above can also double as a spatial database used to manage dynamic objects .
Just as each cell contains information about the tile located in that cell , it can also contain information about each dynamic object currently located in the cell .
Each cell contains a list of dynamic objects ; as an object moves through the grid , we insert / remove it from each cell 's list as appropriate .
There are two approaches that can be taken when using a grid with dynamic objects :
" normal " grid : each object is associated with all of the cells it touches .
In our case , this would be from 1 to 4 cells .
Every time the object moves , it 's removed from the cells which it used to touch , and inserted into the cells which it now touches .
When we collide an object , we only need to test it against the contents of any cell it touches .
. pros : each object needs to look in at most 4 cells to find other objects it might collide with
. cons : each object needs to be inserted / removed from up to 4 cells every time it moves ; also , additional logic needs to be added to the collision code to deal with a case where , for instance , two objects touch the same two cells .
Since we only want to test that pair of objects once , we'd have to add a " tested " flag or similar code to deal with this .
" loose " grid : each object is placed in a single cell : that which contains its centre .
When an object moves , it 's removed from that ( single ) cell and inserted into the cell which contains its new position .
When testing for collision , we have to check not only the current cell , but the 8 cells neighboring the current cell .
The idea of a " loose " grid can be a bit confusing until it clicks , at which point everything will make perfect sense .
You can find more details here : [ Ulrich ]
. pros : each object needs to be inserted / removed from only 1 cell when it moves .
. cons : each object always needs to look in 9 cells to find other objects it might collide with
We chose to use a loose grid in N because it simplified handling moving objects ; however , most of the ideas mentioned in this tutorial apply to any kind of grid .
Each cell in our grid stores a double - linked - list of references to objects ; the objects in a cell 's list are those whose centers are contained in the cell .
( If you 're not familiar with linked - lists , googling " linked list " is probably a good way to learn about them . )
In our implementation , each cell has :
. next // the head of the linked list
. prev // always equal to null since . next is the first list entry
and each object has :
. cell //reference to the cell in which it 's contained
. prev //reference to the object before this object in . cell 's linked list
. next //reference to the object after this object in . cell 's linked list
Whenever an object moves , its position in the grid is updated and changes to the linked lists are made as appropriate .
--= more details =--
There are two ways to approach broad - phase collision .
One is to let each object query the world to find other objects it might be colliding with .
Another is for a manager to find all possible collisions , and notify the objects involved .
In N , we used the first method because it allowed a very simple design : only the ninja queries for collision , and the other objects are notified if the ninja 's query results in a collision event .
While this is good from the point of view of execution speed , it also limits possible designs .
For instance , enemies can't react to each other ( as in Super Mario Bros. , where goombas which walk into each other change direction ) .
So , each frame the ninja tests its current cell and the 8 neighboring cells for objects ; it tests for collision against any objects found .
A more general , elegant system , which is useful in simulation - type environments where all objects must collide with each other , is to iterate over all moving objects , and test them against :
. any objects after them in the current cell 's list
. any objects in the lists of 4 cells which neighbor the current cell .
You can use any contiguous set of 4 cells , for instance , [ right , right - down , down , left - down ] , [ up , up - left , left , left - down ] , etc .
It might seem like this technique will miss some collisions , but if you work it out on paper you 'll see that every possible collision between objects is found .
This lets us reduce the number of per-object cell - list tests to 5 ( from 9 ) , without resorting to flags or any other awkward solution .
Collision detection in any game is very specific to the game 's design ; usually you can achieve significant increases in efficiency by simply choosing good rules for your game world .
For instance , in a game such as Soldat where there are many moving objects , most of which are bullets , a very good idea is to decide that bullets should not collide against other bullets .
This means that bullets do n't have to be moved in the grid every time they change positions -- instead of being in the grid , they simply read from the grid to determine which objects they might collide with .
This saves the cost of numerous linked - list insertion / removals ; the tradeoff is that you can't stop your opponent 's bullets with your own .

SECTION 4 : Raycasting
Aside from projection / collision queries , games often also need other types of queries ; objects can invoke these queries when they need to know something about the world .
A good example of such a query is a raycast ; a ray is simply a line with only one endpoint .
Rays can be used to determine if two objects can " see " each other , or can model a fast - moving projectile -- for instance , in Quake , many weapons ( such as the railgun ) are modeled as rays .
We might want to know the first thing that the ray intersects ( by first we mean the intersection point closest to the ray 's origin ) ; or , given two points we might want to know if the line which connects those two points intersects anything .
In N , we use raycasts to determine AI visibility , as well as for some of the weapons .
Colliding the ray against the world requires the two ( hopefully now familiar ) steps :
. broad phase : determine which things ( tiles and objects ) the ray might collide with
. narrow phase : test the ray against each thing to determine collision information , such as the point of intersection
--= broad phase =--
In our grid - based system , the broad phase amounts to determining which cells the ray touches ; anything not contained in this set of cells can't possibly touch the ray .
( NOTE : since we use a loose grid for our objects , this is n't strictly true ; see below for more details )
A naive approach to determining which cells the ray touches might be to calculate the AABB containing the ray , and consider all cells touching this AABB as touching the ray .
While this works well for short rays , or rays which are almost vertical or horizontal , it requires testing up to n^2 cells , which will get very slow very fast .
A better solution would be to determine EXACTLY which cells the ray touches ; a great ( and quite simple ) algorithm to do this is described in [ Amanatides ] and [ Bikker ] ; basically , it lets us step along the ray , visiting each cell the ray touches in the order it is touched by the ray .
For N , we simply implemented this algorithm ; at each cell we test the ray against the cell contents , using our narrow - phase routines .
--= narrow phase : vs. tiles =--
Not only does the above ray - traversal algorithm tell us which cells the ray touches , it also allows us to efficiently calculate the points at which the ray enters and exists each cell -- i.e. the points at which the ray crosses the edges of the grid .
This is very useful because , since our grid stores edge info , we can stop as soon as the ray crosses over a solid edge -- we know that this is an intersection without having to perform any special ray - vs. - tile intersection test .
If the ray crosses an interesting edge , we need to test the ray against the cell 's tile shape using a tile shape - specific test .
Most of the tests we used were implemented as ray - vs. - line or ray - vs. - line - segment tests , based on the following sources : Geometry Algorithms and [ O' Rourke ] .
For the circular shapes , we adapted a swept - circle test [ Gomez ] .
--= narrow phase : vs. objects =--
One major problem with using a loose grid is that objects which are n't contained in the cells touched by a ray might still touch the ray .
Figure 4 . The Cells Touched by a Ray
Note that even though an object is n't contained in a cell touched by the ray , it may still intersect the ray .
In N , this was a problem we could ignore -- since the ninja was the only object which rays needed to be tested against , we simply performed a ray - vs. - tiles test to find the point at which the ray hits the tiles , and then we performed a ray - vs. - circle test against the ninja to see if the ray hit the ninja before hitting the tiles .
If intersecting rays with dynamic objects is an important feature of your game , you might be better off using a regular / non-loose grid , which does n't suffer from this problem .

SECTION 5 : Conclusion / Source Code
As we mentioned before , the one main limitation of our grid - based approach is that all objects must fit inside a grid cell ( i.e. can be no larger than a grid cell ) .
This is n't really a limitation imposed by the use of a grid ; it 's a self - imposed limitation designed to increase the simplicity and speed of this approach .
To use a grid - based approach with any size of object , all that 's necessary is to be able to ( hopefully quickly ) determine which cell (s ) an object touches , so that it can be inserted / deleted from those cells ' linked lists .
With objects smaller than a cell , this is very fast ; as the size of an object grows , the number of cells it touches increases , and the cost of the linkws - list insertions and deletions will become prohibitive .
The best grid resolution to use is game - specific .
Another thing to note is that you do n't need to have a tile - based world to use a grid ; using the previous tutorial 's collision routines and a grid - based system , you could develop an engine which supports a world composed of arbitrarily placed and sized shapes ; this way your world would n't have to be constrained to tile - sized blocks .
All you need to be able to do is , given a shape , determine all of the tiles it overlaps .
If you insert each static object into the grid this way , you can then use the grid as you would with tiles -- to find all the static objects to test a dynamic object against .
Anyway , hopefully you 've learnt that a simple grid can often be an effective data structure to use as a spatial database in your game , and also how to go about using it .

The newest game in designer Sid Meier 's illustrious Civilization franchise will be begin beta testing with Facebook users this June , according to Variety .
The Facebook platform game — called Civilization Network — was announced a few months ago , and both gamers and the press noted that Civilization and Facebook seem like an excellent match .
It 's easy to picture the addictive - but - relaxing , turn - based gameplay of Civilization IV or Civilization Revolution adapted to the same platform that plays host to FarmVille — and we all know how huge that game is .
Unfortunately , some fans of the series had gotten the impression from the original announcement that the game would be coming sooner .
Not so .
Meier said he'd be looking for beta testers " soon " and that the " full game will be available next year . "
Game publisher Take Two Interactive did n't say whether or not the beta will be open to everyone .
If you want to know more about the game , you 're pretty much out of luck ; not much has been announced yet .
You can become a fan on Facebook to receive future updates , though .
For now , here 's what Meier said about it .
" You can coordinate your strategy to win great battles , share your technology to jump ahead of your rivals , lobby your family and friends to form your own government and win vital elections , manage and grow your cities to maximize production and happiness , spy on your enemies , and work with your friends to create the great Wonders of the World .
The game will offer everything you enjoy in Civ in a fully persistent environment – you can play as much as you like , whenever you like , and it ’ll be free to play . "
DEUTSCHLAND . ( hpd ) Ein aktiver Säkularer ging vor einigen Jahren aus beruflichen und persönlichen Gründen nach Asien .
Aus der Entfernung hat er auf Deutschland im Jahr 2009 geschaut und ist mehr als verwundert , was hier an der Tagesordnung ist .
Einige ausgewählte Beispiele belegen es .
Ein Jahresrückblick von Matthias Krause
Wer 2007 noch geglaubt hatte , Richard Dawkins und Christopher Hitchens hätten mit ihren Buchtiteln „ Der Gotteswahn “ und „ Der Herr ist kein Hirte .
Wie Religion die Welt vergiftet “ übertrieben , musste sich dieses Jahr eines Besseren belehren lassen .
Als wollten sie Dawkins und Hitchens bestätigen , haben einige kirchliche Würdenträger und einige christliche Politiker die absurdesten Unwahrheiten behauptet und damit weiterhin das gesellschaftliche Klima zu Lasten von Nichtchristen und Atheisten vergiftet .
Was ist „ Wahn “ ?
Zum Begriff : Das deutsche Wiktionary definiert „ Wahn “ als „ [ 1 ] allgemein : falsche Vorstellung , [ 2 ]
Psychiatrie : ein Wahn ist eine falsche Interpretation der Realität , diese ist unkorrigierbar , der Betroffene hält an seinem Wahn fest “ .
Auch Richard Dawkins bezieht sich auf eine derartige Definition , nämlich eine „ dauerhafte falsche Vorstellung , die trotz starker entgegengesetzter Belege aufrechterhalten wird “ .
[ Der Gotteswahn ( Taschenbuch ) , S. 17-18 ]
Schulgebet
Im Januar wurde auf Betreiben einer Elterninitiative bekannt , dass das zuständige Schulamt in einer Gemeinschafts - Grundschule in Korschenbroich - Pesch ( NRW ) das Beten folgender vier Zeilen außerhalb des Religionsunterrichts untersagt hatte , nachdem sich die Eltern eines Kindes dagegen gewandt hatten : „ Von guten Mächten wunderbar geborgen , / erwarten wir getrost , was kommen mag .
/ Gott ist bei uns am Abend und am Morgen , / und ganz gewiss an jedem neuen Tag . “
Dietrich Bonhoeffer hat diese Zeilen in Gestapohaft geschrieben , bevor er wenige Monate später im KZ Flossenbürg von den Nationalsozialisten hingerichtet wurde .
( Damit erfüllt das Beten dieser Zeilen an sich schon das Wahnkriterium , denn wer angesichts dieser Umstände behauptet , Bonhoeffer sei „ von guten Mächten wunderbar geborgen “ gewesen , der führt entweder den Begriff „ gut “ oder den Begriff „ mächtig “ ad absurdum – oder beides .
Der
Text kann daher als Beispiel für eine nicht korrigierbare , falsche Vorstellung gelten . )
Jedenfalls folgte das Schulamt der Rechtsprechung des Bundesverfassungsgerichts , dass ein Schulgebet außerhalb des Religionsunterrichts nur dann zulässig ist , wenn sich Schüler dem in zumutbarer Weise entziehen können – dies sah das Schulamt bei einer so kleinen Grundschule als nicht möglich an .
Es sollte eigentlich jedem einleuchten , dass das Aufsagen der genannten Zeilen für Nichtgläubige unzumutbar ist .
Dennoch bildete sich eine Elterninitiative , die die Entscheidung des Schulamtes nunmehr als ein „ Verbot von Dietrich Bonhoeffer “ bezeichnete und die Angelegenheit an die Öffentlichkeit brachte .
Auch der CDU - Landtagsabgeordnete Lutz Lienenkämper – immerhin Jurist !
– hielt die getroffene Entscheidung für „ politisch “ falsch und schrieb an NRW - Schulministerin Barbara Sommer : „ Die Eltern verstehen zu Recht nicht , wie gerade dieser Bezug aus einem Gedicht von Dietrich Bonhoeffer von der staatlichen Schulaufsichtsbehörde so grundlegend missverstanden werden kann , dass darin ein konfessionelles Schulgebet gesehen wird , welches – wenn überhaupt – in den Religionsunterricht gehöre .
Diese Interpretation verrät ein nicht hinzunehmendes Fehlverständnis . “
Ministerin Sommer – offenbar besser mit der Rechtslage vertraut als Rechtsanwalt Lienenkämper – fand zwar auch , es sei „ nicht hinzunehmen , dass den restlichen Schülern des Klassenverbandes ein kurzes freiwilliges gemeinsames Gebet vorenthalten wird , wenn diese ein solches Gebet wollen “ , erklärte aber auch : “ Natürlich darf kein Kind gegen seinen Willen oder dem seiner Eltern zum Schulgebet gezwungen werden .
In solchen Fällen hat die Schule dafür Sorge zu tragen , dass dieser Schüler dem Gebet in zumutbarer Weise ausweichen kann . “
Man werde die Schule „ beraten und Wege aufzeigen , wie auch zukünftig ein Schulgebet gesprochen werden kann , dem der Schüler , dessen Eltern eine Teilnahme ihres Kindes ablehnen , ausweichen kann “ .
Diese Lösung sollte dann so aussehen : Ein Kind , das nicht mitbeten wolle , könne sich ja in der Zeit mit anderen Dingen beschäftigen .
Die betroffene Mutter – eine Atheistin , die aus Sachsen nach Nordrhein - Westfalen gezogen war : „ Das bedeutet , dass meine Tochter jeden Tag von Neuem aus der Klassengemeinschaft ausgegrenzt wird “ .
Deswegen schickt sie ihr Kind jetzt auf eine andere Schule .
Schulministerin Sommer erklärte indessen : „ Ich freue mich sehr darüber , dass es uns gelungen ist , eine Klärung herbeizuführen “ .
Schließlich sei die Ehrfurcht vor Gott „ eines der wichtigsten Erziehungsziele des Schulgesetzes und der Landesverfassung “ .
Mixas Osterpredigt
„ Eine Gesellschaft ohne Gott “ ist demgegenüber „ die Hölle auf Erden “ – jedenfalls nach Ansicht von Bischof Mixa aus Augsburg , der auch katholischer Militärbischof ist .
Um diese Behauptung zu untermauern , verwies Mixa in seiner Osterpredigt auf das „ gottlose Regime des Nationalsozialismus “ .
Allerdings lassen sich die Nazis , die mit der Inschrift „ Gott mit uns “ auf dem Koppelschloss in den Krieg zogen – Atheisten waren sowohl in der SS als auch in der NSDAP unerwünscht – unmöglich als „ gottlos “ bezeichnen .
Die NSDAP vertrat gemäß ihrem Parteiprogramm ein „ positives Christentum “ .
Die „ Gottlosen “ – das waren im Nationalsozialismus die Bolschewisten – die auch von der Kanzel aus bekämpft wurden .
Immerhin : Im Dezember von Schülern auf seine obige Behauptung angesprochen , unterschied Mixa zwischen einem „ humanen Atheismus “ und einem „ brutalen Atheismus “ .
Möglicherweise dämmert ihm , dass seine Behauptung nicht haltbar ist .
Vielleicht merkt er aber auch , dass jedes Mal , wenn er ( oder sein Kollege Meisner , s.u. ) die Nazis als „ gottlos “ bezeichnet , er damit Organisationen wie dem IBKA oder der Giordano - Bruno - Stiftung einen Anlass liefert , auf die wahren Verhältnisse hinzuweisen .

The beardier parts of the web - o - sphere have been abuzz about HTML5 , the next version of the language that powers our internet .
Will it revolutionize web apps ?
Will it kill Flash video ?
Will it fix our gimpy iPads ?
Yes ... and no .

The tech press has transformed HTML5 from a quiet inevitability to an unlikely savior :
When YouTube and Vimeo started testing it , it 's was invoked as a Flash - killer , and the emancipator of web video .
When Google used it to design a new Google Voice web app , among others , it was framed as the murderer the of the OS - specific application .
When the iPad was announced with no Flash support , HTML5 was immediately pegged as a salve , not to mention a way to get around the " closed system " of Apple 's App Store .

It does n't take much imagination to draw these stories into an appealing narrative about how the app-less , plugin - free , totally web - based future is just a browser update away .
The thinking goes , somewhere in this impenetrable 125,000 - word published standard , you 'll find the answer to the internet 's every ailment : its clunky , proprietary plugins , its stunted web apps , its fundamental shortcomings as a platform for rich media .
At the heart of each of these theories lies a grain of truth , but none of them are totally — or even mostly — true .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Here 's what 's really going on .
HTML 5 is already working its way into the underpinnings of web apps you use every day , making them faster and more stable than those relying on Java or other plugins .
They 're more like real apps .
It 's helping us inch closer to the dream of having real applications available at all times , on any platform .
HTML is also setting forth a vision of media — specifically video — that does n't rely on crashy , resource - intensive proprietary plugins .
Look in your plugins folder , you will probably see four video plugins at a minimum .
HTML is a standard with an optimistic view of the future :
You launch your browser , and whatever site you visit , whatever media you choose to play , your browser just magically supports it , without the frustration , confusion and added instability of a plug-in .
Advertisement
But at heart HTML is just a framework , a glimpse , and an ideal :
Its real effect on the internet continues to be defined by the companies and web developers who choose to adopt its many pieces — and it is further shaped by those who do n't .
The Basics
Before we get into what HTML5 means , we have to talk about what it is , and to talk about what it is , we need to talk about what it 's built upon .
Advertisement
Hypertext markup language , or HTML , is the language underneath every web page you 've ever been to .
The language , along with its various complementary technologies ( see : CSS , Javascript ) , has become immensely complex over the years , but the concept is simple .
HTML is what turns this :
< u ><em >< strong >< a href = " http://gizmodo.com "
>
Hello!</a></strong></em></u>
Into this :
It 's basically a set of instructions that a website hands to a browser , which the browser then reads and converts into a formatted page , full of text , images , links and whatever else .
Advertisement
Here , try this : Right - click anywhere on this webpage , and click " View Page Source , " or " View Source , " or something to that effect .
Your eyes will be assaulted with a wall of inscrutable text .
You 'll see evidence of syntax , but your brain wo n't be able to parse it .
Your eyes will glaze over , and you will close the window .
This , my friends , is HTML .
But you probably already knew that , because it 's 2010 , basic web languages are basically in our drinking water .
So what 's this " 5 " business ?
Advertisement
Somewhere in the central command center basement of the internet , there 's a group of guys who maintain the standard , or the rules , of HTML .
In the case of HTML5 , the buck stops with the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group ( WHATWG ) , and to a lesser extent , the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) .
It is through these independent standards organizations that new features are codified and presented to the public , and later — in theory — supported by various browsers , no matter what company is behind them .
In the early nineties , the W3C and a few influential torchbearers would collect various new web features thought up by different browser makers , publishing these standards with the hope that we did n't end up with different internets for different browsers .
By the mid to late nineties , the standards had grown in both size and stature , then serving as the de facto guide for browser makers and developers alike .
( If this sounds a bit rosy , the reality was far grimmer — just ask any seasoned web developer about Internet Explorer , version 6 or earlier . )
Advertisement
Despite an occasionally rocky road , HTML standards went beyond being just a record of changes in web technology ; eventually they became the blueprint to push them forward .
Still , standards are guides , not laws , and no browser maker has to adopt each and every revision .
The last major revision of the HTML standard , version 4.01 , was published in 1999 .
HTML5 has n't yet been formally codified , but it was born in 2004 and has been undergoing steady work and maintenance since .
In the '90s , HTML discussion centered around topics like font coloration , or tables , or buttons , or something more esoteric .
Today , a new HTML version means deep - down support for the modern web , namely web apps and video .

The New Features
The HTML5 spec is more than just new tags and tools , but for users and developers , they 're what matter most .
Specifically , I 'm talking about APIs , or application programming interfaces .
It 's because of these APIs ( usually manifested as tags like < VIDEO > or < IMG > ) that we 'll soon be treated to a richer internet .
And it 's because of these APIs that when work on HTML5 started , it was called " Web Applications 1.0 . "
Today , if you pick apart HTML5 , these are the biggest pieces :
• Video .
If you watch video on the internet , you 're watching it through a plugin — a piece of software that works within your browser , but which is n't technically a part of it .
A decade ago , this plugin may have been clunky RealPlayer software , semi-reliable Windows Media Player controls , or a QuickTime plugin that you were better off skipping altogether .
Today , it 's probably Flash or Microsoft Silverlight , or a newer , subtler Quicktime or Windows Media plugin .
Whether you 're playing a YouTube movie embedded on a web page , or just viewing a .mov file as you download it , your browser has to use the plugin .
Advertisement
HTML5 includes support for a simple tag that lets developers embed video in a page just like they 'd embed a JPEG or other image , with a pointer to a file on a server .
Packed along with the ability to read that video tag are a few rendering engines , which would decode the video without any kind of plugin .
Embedding a video with HTML5 is as easy as embedding an image , provided the video codec is compatible with the browser 's rendering engine .
In terms of code , it can be as simple as this :
< video src=" video.mp4 " width = " 320 " height =
" 240 " ></ video >
Boom .
Video .
Here 's what some of the current rudimentary players look like :
- SublimeVideo ( Safari 4 , Chrome )
- YouTube ( Safari 4 , Chrome )
- Vimeo ( Safari 4 , Chrome )
- DailyMotion ( Firefox , Safari 4 , Chrome , Opera )
Advertisement
In theory , eliminating the video plugins means no extra CPU overhead , fewer crashes , and wider compatibility — if HTML 5 video was standard now , we would n't be stuck waiting for Adobe to port their plugin to our mobile phones , and Mac users would n't bring their systems to a crawl every time they tried to watch a YouTube video in HD .
As a general rule , playing a video file through an extra plugin like Flash is going to be slower , buggier , and more resource - intensive than playing it through a browser 's native decoder .
That 's why people are excited about HTML5 video .
• Offline storage : Remember Google Gears ?
It was a set of plugins for various browsers that let web apps , like Gmail or Zoho Writer ( an online text editor ) , store content locally on your computer , so they could behave more like native apps .
Gmail , for example , could then work without an internet connection .
It would n't retrieve your new emails while offline , obviously , but it'd at least have a working interface and a database of your old emails , just like Outlook or Mail.app would .
Well , Google abandoned Gears , because HTML5 basically supports the same thing , again , without a plugin .

- Here 's a basic demo ( Firefox 3.6 , Safari 4 , Chrome , Opera )
- And a more complex one , including lots of other tricks ( Firefox 3.6 , Safari 4 , Chrome , Opera )
- Or , try Gmail on your iPhone or Android phone
• Drag -and - Drop Elements , and Document Editing .
You know how you can drag and drop emails in Gmail ?
And how you type into text boxes , to post or send everything from Tweets to emails to forums posts ?
As it stands , these systems are built on a delicate , complicated stack of ad - hoc code tricks , which have worked fine up until now , but which could stand to be simplified .
Even if you 're not a developer , just know that this , in theory , translates to increased stability .
And that 's exactly what HTML5 proposes : Super - simple implementations of editable documents boxes , drag - and - drop page elements , and drawing surfaces .

Here 's how that works .
( Firefox 3.6 , Chrome , Safari 4 , Opera , iPhone )

There 's a clear trend here .
HTML5 is about video , and it's about far more stable yet complex web apps .
These are the sources of excitement right now , but they 're also the sources of confusion .
Hopes and Dreams
On the desktop , the transition to HTML5 will be largely seamless , though you 'll notice an uptick in the quality , speed and richness of some apps you use all the time — think webmail , document editors , and text entry applications for starters .
On mobile , the results will definitely be more pronounced .
Remember Google 's new Voice web app for the iPhone and Pre ?
Take away the browser controls , and it 's almost indistinguishable from a native app .
Advertisement
Advertisement
The hope — and it 's a realistic one — is that certain categories of web apps will supplant native apps .
The advantages are obvious :
If your document editor is online , it 'll work consistently whether you 're on an iPad or a Windows desktop ; if your email client is a website , your messages are always available , and your read / unread status is always in sync .
Web apps like Google Documents will get faster , more consistent , and more universally compatible .
Still , you 're not going to see Photoshop or Final Cut in your browser window anytime soon .
If this dream sounds familiar , it 's because it 's very old , and already realized in many ways : Ancient services like Hotmail mark its genesis , and the app-less Chrome OS is its eventual , if limited , endpoint .
Advertisement
The second dream , and the one you 've probably been hearing the most about lately , is that HTML5 video could kill Flash .
As in , render Adobe 's plugin , which most internet - connect computers already have installed , completely obsolete , simultaneously making Apple 's iPad and other mobile devices more capable of getting at all the media the web has to offer .
Vimeo , DailyMotion and YouTube ( YouTube ! ) have all recently launched pilot programs for HTML5 video technology .
On the surface this is very exciting .
Their players are basic , but they work , and there are some rather spectacular demos of more advanced HTML5 video players doing the rounds right now .
The latest builds of the WebKit rendering engine , which comprises the guts of both Mac OS and iPhone / iPad ( mobile ) Safari , Google 's Chrome OS , the Pre 's browser and the Android browser , among others , support full - screen HTML5 video .
The iPad notoriously wo n't ship with Flash , but Apple 's desktop ( Mac OS ) Safari is one of the first browsers to fully support the HTML5 video discussed here , the natively rendered video used by YouTube and Vimeo in their tests .
So the stars are aligning for an HTML5 video takeover , right ?
No , they 're really not .

Managing Expectations
As I mentioned , the WHATWG and W3C can publish as many standards as they want , but in order for any to actually matter , browsers have to support them — and by browsers , I mean all major browsers , from nimble , rapidly - developed apps like Opera and Chrome to Internet Explorer , which , by the way , is still globally the most popular dashboard to the internet .
Take the < VIDEO > tag as an example : Safari and Chrome do support it , both the HTML code and the native rendering of a couple of associated video formats .
Firefox supports the tag , but does n't support decoding of the key video format currently used by YouTube and Vimeo .
Internet Explorer does n't support it at all without a plugin , and is n't the whole point of HTML5 to get rid of plugins ?
Advertisement
Just as different browsers update their rendering engines at different speeds , users of browsers update their software even less predictably , and some do n't update at all .
Despite Microsoft 's aggressive IE8 evangelism , IE6 was only just bumped from being the Number One browser in the world .
It was released in 2001 , when HTML 4 was just learning to walk and HTML5 was but a glint in the W3 C 's eye .
IE6 will never work with HTML5 video .
But it plays video just fine with Flash .
Advertisement
Even on the cutting edge , there are serious roadblocks to widespread adoption of HTML5 video , the most dangerous being video codecs .
Because HTML5 supports video embedding natively , browsers will have to be able to decode embedded video files in lieu of the plugin that use to do it for them .
The current working HTML5 standard does n't explicitly define a video format to be used with the tag — and as luck would have it , there are now two formats vying for the job .
Advertisement
• Ogg Theora is a free codec standard — free as in open source — which most browsers that support HTML5 video support right now .
It 's an attractive option on paper , because browser companies do n't have to pay any licensing fees to include the ability to decode it in their software .
The trouble is , it 's notoriously inefficient , and , perhaps because of this , it 's not too popular .
Google 's standards guru Chris DiBona infamously said :
If [ YouTube ] were to switch to Theora and maintain even a semblance of the current quality , it would take up most available bandwidth across the internet .
Advertisement
True or not , as a codec standard Ogg Theora is n't gonna cut it , even though from a business point of view , it 's ideal .
• h.264 video suffers from pretty much the opposite situation .
Based on a codec standard that 's natively supported in many mobile phones , it 's what Vimeo and YouTube are running in their respective experiments .
These video sites ' already store their mobile - quality libraries in h.264 — what do you think streams to your iPhone YouTube app , since Flash is n't supported ?
So enabling h.264 streaming is as simple as developing a player interface , which takes no time and even less resources .
It 's also efficient — that 's why it 's popular in the first place .
One problem though :
It 's proprietary .
Advertisement
Yes , if you want to build a browser that plays back h.264 - based video with HTML5 , you need to be prepared to pay millions of dollars to the companies that own the format 's patents .
Beyond the basic cost issue , some deem it risky to put the internet 's entire video ecosystem into the hands of some obscure rightsholders , whose whims could change down the road .
( Who , exactly ?
These guys ! )
Google and Apple have so far been okay with the royalties , but Mozilla , creator of Firefox , is taking a more conservative longview .
As Mozilla 's Chris Blizzard insists , there 's a precedent for these worries :
Because it 's still early in H.264's lifespan it 's extremely advantageous to lightly enforce the patents in the patent pool .
MP3 and GIF both prove that if you allow liberal licensing early in a technology 's lifespan , network effects create much more value down the road when you can change licenses to capture value created by delivering images and data in those formats .
Basically wait for everyone to start using it and then make everyone pay down the road .

So , while h.264 is a shoo - in for the job , it would probably be unbelievably perilous to sign it up .
If this seems like a lot to digest , do n't worry !
Despite the thousands of urgent words spilled on this subject , it does n't really matter .
Flash is here for a while , because nobody can get their act together .

First let 's talk about DRM , a sore subject , but something you can't not talk about .
Flash video supports it .
HTML5 video does n't , as it stands .
Could you imagine a Hulu on which every video is a right - click away from saving to your computer ?
A Netflix where you keep what you stream ?
I mean , sure , you can imagine this , but there 's not enough Tums in Los Angeles for Hollywood execs to stomach that discussion .
No DRM , no movies or TV shows .
Simple as that .
And if the fight over a basic HTML5 video standard is fraught , just imagine how tough it'd be to get Mozilla , Apple , Google , Opera and Microsoft to agree on DRM .
Meanwhile , the test runs show , in reality , how little weight is being thrown behind HTML5 video at the moment .
This is how YouTube describes their HTML5 initiative , which caused such a fuss last week :
In the last year our community has made it clear that they want YouTube to do more with HTML5 .
To meet this demand we recently rolled out HTML5 support in TestTube , a destination on YouTube where we routinely experiment with different products .
Some of the products in TestTube are successful and rolled out to the wider community .
Others , however do n't make it beyond TestTube .
We 're still in the early stages , but our hope is to continue this active and ongoing discussion around emerging Web standards .

Can you feel the enthusiasm ?
YouTube 's HTML5 test is just that , a test .
There 's no convincing evidence of idealistic shift in the works .
YouTube 's future hinges on the ability to integrate ads into their videos , to sell access to DRM'd content , and to reach the largest audience possible .
Until HTML5 video can pull this off , Google and YouTube are going to keep on doing what they 've been doing — using Flash .
Lastly , Adobe has interests in this discussion too , and is working frantically to push Flash to virtually all mobile smartphone platforms that do n't already have it .
Meanwhile HTML video tag support on smartphones is barely the discussion phases — it 's plagued with as many problems , if not more , than desktop HTML 5 video .

narrative .
What about the spec 's glaring lack of ability to replace Flash 's other , non-video functions ?
Sure , increasing browser support for scaled vector graphics and HTML5's Canvas tag go a short way to creating vivid , visual web applications without plugins , as does the wide array of Javascript tools already available to web developers .
Why You Should Care About HTML5

But what about games ?
And more importantly for developers who like paychecks , what about animated , interactive ads ( some which are overlaid on the aforementioned YouTube videos ) ?
The internet 's not going to give up on those anytime soon , and the non-Flash web technologies we have now are n't going to cut it for years .

What 's Really Going to Happen to Your Internet
As I said way back at the beginning , part of the job of an HTML spec is to codify what 's already being done by developers and browser makers .
As such , there 's a very good chance that HTML5 is partially supported by your desktop browser .
If you have a smartphone with a WebKit - based browser , you already use web apps that leverage the technology .
This will simply become more common , in a mundane , linear way : Google , Apple , WebKit , Mozilla , Opera , and yes , even Microsoft will continue to include new features in their software , and developers will begin to leverage it as soon as they can .
Web apps will get smarter , faster and more powerful , even if you do n't really notice it .
You 'll worry less about having a constant internet connection , and you 'll probably install few native applications on your phone or laptop .

For the foreseeable future , video on the internet is going to remain almost exactly as - is .
If anything , Flash will become more entrenched in the short term , as the YouTubes and Hulus of the world expand their catalogs with more DRM'd content , and continue building their desktop content platforms around the plugin .
As for mobile devices like the iPhone and iPad , for whom Flash seems eternally out of reach , video delivery will move increasingly toward apps , which content companies can tightly control , and not toward HTML5 video , which — all other problems aside — they really can't .
HTML5 has a place in online video , and I expect companies to continue testing it , playing with it , and expanding their uses for it .
I expect browsers to continue increasing support for it — hey , maybe even mobile Safari ! — but do n't stake your hopes , or a specific gadget purchase , on its immediate promise .
An internet where native web languages have killed all plugins , including Flash , is just too far away to talk about coherently .

HTML5 is infiltrating the web , not tearing it down and building it back up .
Like the standard itself , the HTML5 web will evolve slowly , with web technologies gradually supplanting tools you use now .
You 'll notice it , but you 'll have to watch closely .

After Chuck hits an all - time ratings low , daylight savings has started hurting television behemoths like American Idol ...
So why is Human Target apparently immune , and what can other shows learn from it ?
Advertisement
The Hollywood Reporter 's Live Feed blog noted Human Target 's strong performance , pointing out that the show even managed to win its time slot , unusually .
So what makes Target so unusual ?
Firstly , it stood out in its timeslot in terms of genre ( It was up against two comedies and NBC 's medical drama Trauma ) , but so did the less successful Chuck ; what it offered that Chuck did n't , though , was a done - in - one storyline complete in one hour ( Admittedly , one that had continuity call - outs to earlier episodes , but nothing a new viewer would find problematic ) .
With that idea having kept NBC's Law & Order and CBS ' CSI franchises not only alive , but surprisingly strong in the ratings , for years , is Human Target a pointer towards a post - Lost direction for genre television that 'll be more successful for networks ?

Call it in the air ( 4 historically significant decisions made by the flip of a coin )
The coin toss .
It ’s a 50/50 chance .
Heads or tails .
They just did it in the Super Bowl to see who receives the opening kickoff .
They then spent more time explaining which side was heads and which side was tails than they did flipping the coin .
It seems to me it would have been much less complicated if they had just used a quarter .
Anyhow , the legal tender of any country can be doubly used as a decision maker for the more important parts of your life .
Which movie to see ?
Flip a coin .
Beef or chicken ?
Flip a coin .
Budweiser or Bass Ale ?
Forget the coin , Budweiser is awful .
Scary Latin hitman trying to decide whether or not to kill somebody ?
You know the drill .
Recently , Private Practice star Kate Walsh and her ex-husband tossed a coin to see who got to pick first when it came to dividing up their assets .
Who needs lawyers ?
Big decisions have come down to heads or tails several times in the past .
Many of the results changed a little bit of history .
Here are the more notable occasions .
The day the music died
In February 1959 , there was a major concert tour consisting of Richie Valens , Buddy Holly , and J.P. Richardson , also known as “ The Big Bopper ” .
They were preparing to travel to the next site after they finished a show at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake , Iowa .
( I do n’t know why it was called the Surf Ballroom .
There are n’t too many good sets rolling up on the beaches of Iowa .
But I digress … )
Buddy Holly had chartered a plane out of Fargo , North Dakota to fly his band out after one of the buses broke down .
Richardson managed to get on the plane after pleading with Buddy Holly ’s guitarist ( Waylon Jennings ) for his seat .
Holly ’s other band member flipped a coin with Richie Valens to see who got the other seat .
Valens won .
The plane , taking off in a blinding snowstorm , crashed into a cornfield instantly killing Holly , Richardson , Valens , and the 21 - year - old pilot .
It became known as the day the music died .
Green living or green beer ?
In the Pacific northwest , there was a lot of land to decide what to do with .
Francis Pettygrove and Asa Lovejoy shared the deed on a 640 acre parcel that they foresaw as being a great place where people would want to live .
The only thing they disagreed on was the name .
Lovejoy wanted to name the plot after his hometown of Boston , Massachusetts , while Pettygrove was insistent on naming it after his roots in Portland , Maine .
After much discussion , they flipped a coin for it .
Pettygrove won the toss and now we have Portland , Oregon .
It makes me wonder how different it would be if it were named Boston instead .
Maybe there would be less facial hair , microbreweries , and flannel and instead annoying accents , baked beans , and people saying that something is “ wicked awesome ” .
3rd is the new 1st
This one also involves Portland .
Before the NBA draft lottery system , the first pick in the draft was decided by a coin flip .
My beloved Lakers drafted Magic Johnson after a coin flip , so it can certainly end good .
Not in this case .
The Houston Rockets won the flip and claimed the # 1 pick in the 1984 draft .
That ’s not what makes this interesting , though .
Houston picked Hakeem Olajuwon first overall .
Portland , in all their glory , picked Sam Bowie second .
Who ’s Sam Bowie , you ask ?
Well , it does n’t matter , because that ’s still not what makes this interesting .
You see , Chicago had the third pick .
Since Olajuwon and Bowie were already taken , the Bulls had to go to the bottom of the barrel and picked a guard out of North Carolina named Michael Jordan .
Yeah , but who does everybody remember ?
In 1903 , a couple brothers took a contraption to Kitty Hawk , North Carolina .
The brothers , Orville and Wilbur Wright , planned to take to the skies in their newly built “ airplane ” .
Since it only held one person , the brothers flipped a coin to see who would be the first person in history to make a powered flight .
Wilbur got that distinction … sort of .
Wilbur won the toss and went to the air in the Wright Flyer .
He stalled after takeoff and was only in the air for about three seconds .
To add insult to injury , he also damaged to plane when he crashed .
The next day , Orville made his attempt , flying 120 feet in 12 seconds .
His flight is generally considered the first successful powered flight .
Sorry Wilbur .
So remember , the next time you ca n’t decide between Mac n’ Cheese and Top Ramen , flip for it .
There have been several much more important decisions made that way .

About 550 light - years from Earth , a star like our Sun is writhing in its death throes .
Chi Cygni has swollen in size to become a red giant star so large that it would swallow every planet out to Mars in our solar system .
Moreover , it has begun to pulse dramatically in and out , beating like a giant heart .
New close - up photos of the surface of this distant star show its throbbing motions in unprecedented detail .
" This work opens a window onto the fate of our Sun five billion years from now , when it will near the end of its life , " said lead author Sylvestre Lacour of the Observatoire de Paris .
As a sunlike star ages , it begins to run out of hydrogen fuel at its core .
Like a car running out of gas , its " engine " begins to splutter .
On Chi Cygni , we see those splutterings as a brightening and dimming , caused by the star 's contraction and expansion .
Stars at this life stage are known as Mira variables after the first such example , Mira " the Wonderful , " discovered by David Fabricius in 1596 .
As it pulses , the star is puffing off its outer layers , which in a few hundred thousand years will create a beautifully gleaming planetary nebula .
Chi Cygni pulses once every 408 days .
At its smallest diameter of 300 million miles , it becomes mottled with brilliant spots as massive plumes of hot plasma roil its surface .
( Those spots are like the granules on our Sun 's surface , but much larger . )
As it expands , Chi Cygni cools and dims , growing to a diameter of 480 million miles -- large enough to engulf and cook our solar system 's asteroid belt .
For the first time , astronomers have photographed these dramatic changes in detail .
They reported their work in the December 10 issue of The Astrophysical Journal .
" We have essentially created an animation of a pulsating star using real images , " stated Lacour .
" Our observations show that the pulsation is not only radial , but comes with inhomogeneities , like the giant hotspot that appeared at minimum radius . "
Imaging variable stars is extremely difficult , for two main reasons .
The first reason is that such stars hide within a compact and dense shell of dust and molecules .
To study the stellar surface within the shell , astronomers observe the stars at a specific wavelength of infrared light .
Infrared allows astronomers to see through the shell of molecules and dust , like X - rays enable physicians to see bones within the human body .
The second reason is that these stars are very far away , and thus appear very small .
Even though they are huge compared to the Sun , the distance makes them appear no larger than a small house on the moon as seen from Earth .
Traditional telescopes lack the proper resolution .
Consequently , the team turned to a technique called interferometry , which involves combining the light coming from several telescopes to yield resolution equivalent to a telescope as large as the distance between them .
They used the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory 's Infrared Optical Telescope Array , or IOTA , which was located at Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins , Arizona .
" IOTA offered unique capabilities , " said co-author Marc Lacasse of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ( CfA ) .
" It allowed us to see details in the images which are about 15 times smaller than can be resolved in images from the Hubble Space Telescope . "
The team also acknowledged the usefulness of the many observations contributed annually by amateur astronomers worldwide , which were provided by the American Association of Variable Star Observers ( AAVSO ) .
In the forthcoming decade , the prospect of ultra-sharp imaging enabled by interferometry excites astronomers .
Objects that , until now , appeared point - like are progressively revealing their true nature .
Stellar surfaces , black hole accretion disks , and planet forming regions surrounding newborn stars all used to be understood primarily through models .
Interferometry promises to reveal their true identities and , with them , some surprises .
has Golden Geometry of the Golden Mean .
PBS NOVA has an Online Exploration of the Giza Pyramids and Sphinx with commentary by Mark Lehner and Zahi Hawass , who advocate an age of about 4,600 years for the Giza pyramids .
Mark Lehner says " ... we know ... the date of the pyramids ... mostly by context .
The pyramids are surrounded by cemeteries of other tombs .
... we find organic materials ... that can be radiocarbon dated ...
But primarily we date the pyramids by their position in the development of Egyptian architecture and material culture over the broad sweep of 3,000 years . ... "
I agree with the dates of the materials found in the area of the Giza pyramids , but I do NOT agree that those materials , tombs , etc. , are the materials , tombs , etc. , of the builders of the Giza Pyramids and Sphinx .
In my opinion , the builders were either the Ice Age Civilization of 36,525 to 11,600 years ago , or , at the latest , a part of a global Early Human Civilization that broke up about 6,000 years ago , and that the Giza Sphinx and Pyramids were already built about 5,100 years ago when Menes reunited Lower Egypt , including Giza , with Southern Upper Egypt .
What does it look like ?
The largest of the Giza pyramids is usually called the Great Pyramid .
I prefer to call it the Great Golden Pyramid , because its geometry
is that of the Golden Mean .
The Golden Mean Ratio is given by PHI = ( 1 + sqrt( 5 ) ) /2 = 1.618 ... .
The Great Golden Pyramid has height sqrt( PHI ) = 1.272 ...
and base 1+1 = 2 .
Each triangular face intersects the ground at an angle
of arcsin( sqrt ( PHI ) / PHI ) , a little less than 52 degrees .
Since 4 / sqrt( PHI ) = PI , approximately , so that the circumference
of a circle whose radius is the height of the pyramid is
2 x PI x radius = 2 x PI x sqrt( PHI ) =
= 2 x ( 4/sqrt( PHI ) ) x sqrt( PHI ) = 2 x 4 = 8 ,
and since the perimeter of the base of the pyramid is
2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 ,
the Great Golden Pyramid approximately squares the circle .
Exterior measurements of the Great Golden Pyramid are
now very uncertain , because the casing of limestone blocks
has been removed over the years .
Some smaller blocks are in European museums ,
but most of them are in Cairo ,
where they are now part of dams , bridges ,
and mosques ( such as the Sultan Hasan Mosque ) .
Each side of the base of the Great Golden Pyramid
is about 440 Royal Cubits ,
so that each semibase is 220 RC ,
the total perimeter of its base is about 8 x 220 = 1760 RC .
Units of measurement often used for the Great Golden Pyramid include the Primitive Inch ( PI = 2.54268 cm ) and the Royal Cubit ( RC = 20.6066 PI , or 52.396 cm ) .
Its height would be about 280 RC if
it had a capstone shaped like a Golden pyramid .
Therefore , the ratio of perimeter to height
would be approximately 2 PI : 1760/280 = 6.28 ... .
SteveR pointed out that an earlier version of this page had an error in which I wrote PI instead of 2 PI , a mental mistake that I probably made by thinking of PI as fundamental and neglecting the 2 , and failing to proof - read carefully .
Perhaps I should think of 2 PI as more fundamental than PI , as advocated by Bob Palais in his Mathematical Intelligencer ( 2001 , v. 23 , no.
3 , pp. 7 - 8 ) article PI Is Wrong !.
Each face is an isosceles triangle of height PHI times the semibase .
Such an isosceles triangle has central angle
2 arccos( PHI / sqrt( 1+PHI^2 ) ) = 63.43 ... degrees .
If three such triangles are used to make
a pyramid ( instead of the four at Giza ) ,
and if they are mirrors to make a mirrorhouse ,
the result is an icosahedral kaleidoscope .
In describing the Great Golden Pyramid ,
I do not try to be exact about lengths , angles ,
and such , but only approximate .
One reason for
discussing it approximately is that the pyramid
itself has been disturbed ,
perhaps by earthquakes over the last few thousand years ,
or
perhaps by explosions inside the pyrmid ,
as suggested by Chris Dunn because the
disturbance seems to be to internal structure of the pyramid
rather than to the base of pyramid .
Internal explosions were used by Vyse during
his explorations in the 1800s .
This gif image amplifies the magnitude of the disturbance
by a factor of 10 to show it more clearly .
Another reason is that my astronomical software
does not go back in time to 9000 BC , so I have
just estimated with a paper precession chart ,
a 6 - inch star globe , and protractor , ruler , and compass ,
to see roughly what is where .
Still another reason for using rough estimates is
my general attitude that you can get a better
overall view of something by initially making
rough overall estimates than by trying to
achieve a lot of precision at first .
Rough first approximations can often show
you what is important and what is not ,
and then later you can refine the important things .
The Great Golden Pyramid contains two interior chambers
and a number of interior shafts .
The interior shafts
all generally lie in a north - south vertical plane
section of the pyramid , displaced a little east of
the center of the pyramid :
It ( like many other Egyptian pyramids ) has chambers underneath ,
but the Great Golden Pyramid has far more elaborate interior chambers
than any other Egyptian pyramid .
The higher interior chamber , usually called the King 's chamber ,
is called here the Upper Chamber .
The lower interior chamber , usually called the Queen 's chamber ,
is called here the Mid Chamber .
The Entrance shaft starts at an entrance on the north face ,
a little above ground level ,
and descends at an angle of about 26 degrees .
Since the latitude of Giza is about 30 degrees North ,
if you go into the entrance shaft and look back ,
you will see a part of the sky centered about 4 degrees
from the North pole in the sky .
If you could see through the ground and the Earth as
you looked forward going down the Entrance shaft ,
you would see an area near the South pole in the sky .
The Entrance shaft continues down to the conventional
chamber under ( not inside ) the pyramid .
However , part way there an Ascending shaft branches off ,
and goes up to the two interior chambers .
That shaft goes up at a slope of about 26 degrees .
If you could see through the pyramid to the sky in its direction ,
you would see ( at a certain time of day ) the Belt of Orion .
At another time of day , you would see the Southern Cross .
The height of the entire pyramid
( not including the capstone , which is and has been missing )
is 203 courses , or layers , of varying thicknesses ,
totalling about 264.5 RC .
If a capstone went to the theoretical apex of the pyramid ,
the total height would be about 282 RC , or ,
roughly rounding , 280 RC .
At a little bit above the 25th course ,
the Ascending shaft branches into 3 passages :
the Well Passage , descending vertically ;
the horizontal branch to the Mid Chamber ;
and the continuation into the Grand Gallery .
The Well Passage is a vertical descending branch ,
leading through an irregular shaft down
to the chambers underneath the pyramid .
The horizontal branch leads to the Mid Chamber ,
which is located on the East - West plane of the pyramid
just East of the North - South plane .
The Mid Chamber is made of limestone ,
10 RC in the East - West direction ,
11 RC in the North - South direction ,
and the height of the North and South side walls
is ( 20 / sqrt ( 5 ) ) RC = about 8.94 RC .
The height of the top of the gable roof is about 11.8 RC .
A 5 - step corbeled Niche , from 1 RC to 2 RC deep ,
from 1 RC to 3 RC wide , and ( 20/ sqrt ( 5 ) ) RC = about 8.94 RC high ,
has been carved in the East wall .
The top of the side walls is 50 RC above the base of the pyramid .
A crust of salt is on the walls of the Mid Chamber .
Two small shafts , with cross section
about 8 x 8 PI = 0.388 x 0.388 RC = 20.3 x 20.3 cm ,
which is about the size of a waveguide set at the frequency of " ... 21 - centimeter Radiation ... " radio emission " from hydrogen when the electron flips its spin ... a critical technique for " seeing " the interstellar medium which is dominated by hydrogen ... " ,
go North and South from the Mid Chamber
at an angle of about 39 degrees .
Their openings were sealed until about 1872 .
The top of the openings are about 3.3 RC from the floor ,
the same level as the top of the bottom section of the Niche
and the roof of the entrance into the Mid Chamber .
The Southern shaft has been explored by a robot used
by Rudolf Gantenbrink of Munich .
He has found it to be
blocked by a stone door with handles .
An new exploration was then undertaken to
see what is behind the stone door .
In 2002 Zahi Hawass and his team used a new robot to
drill through the door
and look behind it with a small camera
to find yet another door .
Since the 39 degree angles of the Mid Chamber shafts
are nearly the right - angle - complements of the 52 degree
angles of the faces of the pyramids with the ground ,
the Mid Chamber shafts symbolically place the Mid Chamber
at the apex of an inverted intersecting and interpenetrating
Great Golden Pyramid .
In this way , the Mid Chamber ( which is smaller than a
capstone that would complete the geometry of the pyramid )
might be regarded as being the interior chamber of a " virtual " capstone ,
and the Niche might be a " door " to a " virtual gallery shaft "
leading to the " outside " of the " virtual " capstone .
Returning to the Ascending shaft , and continuing ascent ,
you enter the Grand Gallery , an upward extension continuing
to ascend at the 26 degree slope toward the Antechamber
preceding the Upper Chamber .
The Grand Gallery has 7 - step corbeled side walls ,
2 RC wide at the top and 4 RC wide at the floor .
The floor has a central groove 2 RC wide ,
flanked by 1 RC floor - ramps on each side .
The Grand Gallery is about 18 RC high vertically ,
or about 16 RC high perpendicular to its floor .
It is about ( 200 / sqrt ( 5 ) ) = about 89 RC long .
There are 55 ramp - holes on the sides of the floor - ramps .
Some parts of the Grand Gallery walls contain salt deposits ,
but not as much as in the Mid Chamber .
At about the level of the 50th course of the pyramid ,
the Grand Gallery reaches the level of the Upper Chamber
and leads through a low passage way about 2 RC x 2 RC x 2.5 RC
to the Antechamber of the Upper Chamber .
The Antechamber is about 5 RC long , 2 RC wide and
a little over 5 RC high .
Its side walls have 4 pairs of vertical grooves ,
each about 4 RC high .
3 go all the way to the floor .
The first pair of grooves stop 2 RC above the floor ,
and contain a two - section granite leaf about 2 RC high ,
each section being about 1 RC high .
You could slide the top section of the granite leaf
up and out of the first pair of grooves ,
then move it over and drop it into
one of the other 3 pairs of grooves .
You could then do the same thing with the bottom section .
In this way ,
you could make a 2 RC high wall in any one
of the other 3 pairs of grooves ,
or you could make two 1 RC high walls in any two of them .
Such a 2 RC high wall in the last pair of grooves
would block the entrance to the Upper Chamber ,
which is through a low passage way about 2 RC x 2 RC x 5 RC .
Other such configurations would not block the entrance ,
but you could use them to act as " dams " to contain
water or other liquids in the Upper Chamber
and the Antechamber .
The Upper Chamber itself is made of granite ,
about 10 RC wide ( North - South ) ,
about 20 RC long ( East - West ) ,
and about 5 x sqrt(5 ) RC = about 11.18 RC high .
The diagonal of each North - South wall is about 15 RC .
The diagonal of the whole chamber is about 25 RC .
The ratio of the North - South wall diagonal
to the East - West length to the whole chamber diagonal
is about 15:20:25 = 3:4:5 .
A granite coffer is inside .
It is about 2 RC high , about 1.9 RC wide , and about 4.36 RC long .
It is too wide to be taken in or out through the Entrance shaft .
In Primitive Inches , its dimensions are about :
exterior height - 41.213 interior depth - 34.2
exterior width - 38.698 interior width - 26.7
exterior length - 89.806 interior length - 77.8
The dimensions of the coffer make it possible that the Ark of the Covenant could fit inside it , including carrying poles , since according to Exodus ( chapter 37 ) the Ark is ( in terms of conventional cubits that are roughly 18 conventional incles ) 2 cubits ( 36 conventional inches ) long , 1.5 cubits ( 27 conventional inches ) wide , and 1.5 cubits ( 27 conventional inches ) high .
The two Cherubim on top of the Ark would have about 34.2 - 27 = 7.2 conventional inches to fit inside the coffer .
Two small shafts , with cross section
about 8 x 8 PI = 0.388 x 0.388 RC = 20.3 x 20.3 cm ,
which is about the size of a waveguide set at the frequency of " ... 21 - centimeter Radiation ... " radio emission " from hydrogen when the electron flips its spin ... a critical technique for " seeing " the interstellar medium which is dominated by hydrogen ... " ,
go North and South from the Upper Chamber .
The top of the Northern shaft is about 2 RC above the floor .
The shaft goes up at an angle of about 32 degrees to exit
the pyramid at the 101st course .
If you looked out the Northern shaft ,
you would see the area of the North polar sky .
If you went outside the pyramid and looked down the shaft ,
and could see through the pyramid and the Earth ,
you would see the area of the South polar sky .
The top of the Southern shaft is also about 2 RC above the floor .
The shaft goes up at an angle of about 45 degrees to exit
the pyramid at the 102nd course .
If you went outside the pyramid and looked down the shaft ,
and could see through the pyramid and the Earth ,

There is also an Entrance Void above the Entrance Shaft .
According to http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature24647 ( 2017 )
" ... The Great Pyramid ... was built on the Giza Plateau ( Egypt ) ...
Despite being one of the oldest and largest monuments on Earth ,
there is no consensus about how it was built ... we imaged
the pyramid using muons , which are by - products of cosmic rays that
are only partially absorbed by stone ...
The resulting cosmic-ray
muon radiography allows us to visualize the known and potentially
unknown voids in the pyramid in a non-invasive way .
Here we report
the discovery of a large void ( with a cross section similar to the
Grand Gallery and a length of 30 m minimum ) above the Grand Gallery ,
which constitutes the first major inner structure found
in the Great Pyramid since the 19th century ...
This void , named
ScanPyramids Big Void , was first observed with nuclear emulsion
films ... installed in the Queen ’s chamber ( Nagoya University ) ,
then confirmed with scintillator hodoscopes ... set up in the same
chamber ( KEK ) and re-confirmed with gas detectors ... outside of the
pyramid ( CEA ) .
This large void has therefore been detected with a
high confidence by three different muon detection technologies and
three independent analyses ... " .
The Grand Gallery and Upper Chamber represent the 4 - Real - dimensional Physical World Minkowski Spacetime
of Schwinger Sources and Human Tubulin / Microtubules .
It is the RP1 x S3 Shilov Boundary Lie Sphere
of
the Lie Ball Complex Domain Type IV ( 4 ) ( p=2 ) in which Planck Scale Cl ( 16 )
Cells mirror the information
content of the Human - scale Microtubule / Tubulin Quantum Consciousness structures .
The 4 Ceiling Chamber spaces ( 1 - 4 ) represent the 4 Complex Imaginary Dimensions of the Lie Ball Complex Domain .
Therefore , the Builders of the Great Pyramid represented the Real Shilov Boundary Physical world
by the Grand Gallery and Upper Chamber that are easily accessible by Humans with Microtubule Quantum Consciousness
and
they represented the Imaginary Complex World of Cl ( 16 ) Spacetime Cells mirroring the Human Microtubule World
as Ceiling Chamber spaces and the Great Void that are more accessible to Souls of the Spirit World than to Physical Humans .

The white - power movement is recruiting , hating , praying , bonding and rallying .
But mostly it 's hiding .
American Swastika ( Rowman & Littlefield , $ 35 ) takes readers into the " free spaces " of the white - power movement , where members emerge to speak their minds without fear of retribution .
Researched and written by Pete Simi and Robert Futrell , who met at UNLV , where Futrell is a professor and Simi was a graduate student , the book takes us into the homes of white - power believers , to their rallies , concerts and to children 's birthday parties with swastika - shaped cakes .
Simi , an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at University of Nebraska , Omaha , was given special access to the groups .
He and Futrell , associate professor of sociology at UNLV , talk with the Las Vegas Weekly about the experience , what they learned and why we should care .
Why do this book ?
Futrell :
There 's really very little systematic study on these groups , their culture , where they 're located and what they do .
There is often an assumption that the white - power movement had died .
This book shows they exist and continue to grow — just under the radar .
Were you hassled for taking this on ?
Simi :
There is a tendency for people to associate you with what you study , not just on an intellectual level but a personal level as well , especially when you 're getting up close and personal with people and spending a lot of time with them .
We 've experienced this at conferences .
People are n't quite comfortable with what we 're doing .
The assumption is that you must be on some level sympathetic .
Futrell : Most social - movement studies look at left - leaning movements .
The question is , do our concepts and theories about social movements apply if we 're only studying mainly one genre of movement type ?
When a group is organized around a culture of violence you can be assured that some people will act on that violence .
One of our criticisms is from people wanting to know how significant this really is .
Well , another Oklahoma City bombing seems pretty significant .
We know now that Timothy McVeigh was tightly wrapped in a set of white - power movement networks .
Some of these people are stockpiling weapons .
I think we want more information rather than less .
Are they all about hate ?
Simi :
One response is , " We 've largely been misunderstood as a hate movement , but we 're all about love .
We exist to love other members of our race .
We 're really not promoting violence at all .
We 're simply promoting an affirmation of our own people . "
Another response is acknowledging that the movement is about violence , " because violence is absolutely necessary ; given the conditions that we face today , we need to engage in violence . "
Futrell :
Their community is wrapped in violent and paranoid ideology , but they do make emotional connections that go beyond hate for others , such as love and connection and solidarity within the groups .
Any mental - health issues ?
Simi :
The movement as a whole is not uniformly pathological , but there is definitely a mental - health factor with certain individuals — from chronic depression to antisocial personality , whether it was prior to getting involved , or onset after getting involved .
The movement 's ideas are very radical and emotion - laden .
The mind - set takes a toll on people .
You see a lot of pent - up anger .
A lot of things come into play — substance abuse , heavy drinking , the extreme nature of the ideas and the anger that goes with believing your race is on the verge of extinction .
Who are they ?
Simi :
A common stereotype is that the poorly educated and lower socioeconomic status folks are the ones attracted to these groups .
We find that people across the socioeconomic spectrum get involved in this .
This tells us the recruitment potential these groups have is far wider than what we might initially expect .
It also helps us question some assumptions of who is more likely to get involved in these groups .
Also , people do n't realize where these groups are situated .
They 're distributed widely across the country , and yet people tend to think of two places in particular , the Deep South and the Pacific Northwest .
You also have places like Southern California , which is really a hot spot for these groups .
Futrell : Part of the stereotype is that these are mainly belligerent , in - your - face , easily identifiable people .
In many cases they are not .
That 's a strategic effort on their part .
Part of their strategy is to get good jobs , get an education , infiltrate institutions and create the revolution from within .
Does hiding mean they feel powerless ?
Futrell :
They actually feel a sense that they are empowered because they 're hiding .
Some argue that they are growing the movement under the radar or even just sustaining it .
They feel a sense of power in doing this .
How big is the movement in Las Vegas ?
Simi :
There has been an ebb and flow in the area .
For a while , the National Alliance , prior to their organization fragmenting , had seen some growth in Las Vegas , and was making inroads in terms of recruiting .
They also had that billboard in regard to immigration , which listed their website at the bottom of the billboard .
Futrell :
That website was cast as an anti-immigration website , but two or three layers in , you were on the National Alliance website .
Around the same time , during a holiday break , I was up here working and there were National Alliance stickers on several of the buildings at UNLV .
Simi :
The other thing Las Vegas has had in terms of neo -Nazi and white supremacist presence tends to involve the methamphetamine trade .
John " Polar Bear " Butler , who was convicted of the murder of two anti-racist skinheads , was involved in a network of neo -Nazis who were heavily involved in methamphetamine trade and other criminal activity .
Pete , why did these groups agree to meet with you ?
I portrayed myself as potentially sympathetic .
I specifically mentioned that I was interested in how the media demonizes that group .
How long and often were you with them ?
Simi : I started fieldwork in 1997 .
My last major period of fieldwork was in summer of 2004 , when I lived with a family for five weeks .
There were also much more infrequent visits where I 'd go to stay with people for two to three days .
Did anything surprise you ?
Simi :
The relationships I found myself building with people whose beliefs and practices are , in many ways , antithetical to my own .
You spend time with these folks and you inevitably build friendships — friendship with quotes around it .
That was hard to reconcile and figure out .
Why white supremacy ?
Simi : I 'd been interested in issues of racism since I was a child .
I grew up with an African - American father figure / older brother and saw how my white friends would say things about black people , and I 'd try to figure out how people come to those beliefs and why some people associate anger and hate and antagonism toward people who are different from them .
Futrell :
My social - movement research had mainly been in the realm of science and technology controversies , but this was some data that I thought was fascinating and unique .
Also , my family was from Louisiana and Texas .
I 'm from Kentucky .
I saw some of this racism straight on , and it always sort of confused me why color made a difference .
Much like your four - year - old nephew , RNA can only read three - letter combinations .
Called codons , these three DNA - base - pair groups form the phrases that RNA translates into the 21 amino acids that underlie all life .
But now , University of Cambridge researcher Jason Chin has engineered more literate RNA , capable of reading codons composed of four base pairs .
This expands the possible number of codons from 64 to 320 , and opens the door for a whole new line of artificial amino acids .
Jacob Zuma .
By Patrick Bond
February 16 , 2010 -- Recall that South Africa 's President Jacob Zuma came to power last year as a result , mainly , of trade union and South African Communist Party mobilisations in 2006 - 08 , culminating in the rude but welcome dismissal of president Thabo Mbeki .
And now , because he is unable to galvanise momentum for any sort of political project aside from survival [ following another round of scandals surrounding his private life and dubious attitude towards women ] , Zuma appears to be drifting rightwards , towards the Afican National Congress ' solid financial - support base of white capital and aspiring black entrepreneurs .
On February 11 , the 20th anniversary of Nelson Mandela 's release from prison , was the day that Zuma was meant to fight back , by delivering a stunning State of the Nation speech in front of Mandela and the nation .
Instead , he and his speechwriters pleased no one .
Zuma displayed " no appreciation of the full extent of the massive crisis of unemployment , poverty and inequality " , as the leaders of his main ANC 's alliance partner , the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) , bitterly complained .
Statistics justifying this charge were revealed three weeks ago by middle - of - the - road economists at the University of Cape Town ( UCT ) .
" Income inequality increased between 1993 and 2008 " , reported Murray Leibbrandt , Ingrid Woolard , Arden Finn and Jonathan Argent .
" Poverty in urban areas has increased . "
South Africa 's Gini coefficient inequality measure raced ahead of Brazil 's to become the world 's leader among major countries : from 0.66 in 1993 to 0.70 in 2008 .
The income of the average black ( African ) person actually fell as a percentage of the average white 's from 1995 ( 13.5 % ) to 2008 ( 13.0 % ) .
How could a democratic government adopt socioeconomic policies that amplified apartheid race - class inequality ?
Mandela , Mbeki , long - serving finance minister ( now planning minister ) Trevor Manuel , former trade minister Alec Erwin , and former central bank governor Tito Mboweni -- and Zuma too -- all deserve credit for a feat not even the most extreme pessimist could have predicted when the ANC was unbanned exactly two decades ago .
According to the UCT researchers , the inequality problem is " due both to rising unemployment and rising earnings inequality " -- in turn partly due to labour broking , i.e. , the outsourcing of formerly secure employment at much lower wages with no benefits .
There are 500,000 outsourced workers in South Africa , according to industry sources , though the finance ministry confessed during parliamentary questions last October that its economists do n't really have a clue : " To conduct such a study would require detailed data on the number of workers involved with temporary employment services or labour broking , the wages of these workers and some estimate for the number of workers who would lose their jobs if labour broking were to be banned . "
Leaders of a decent society would immediately find out the answers , then ban labour brokers , and at the same time increase state - subsidised employment creation , especially for badly needed green jobs such as construction of solar hot - water heaters and community facilities , and environmental maintenance .
But as the inequality data show , South Africa is just not that kind of place ; it 's a society in which the ruling party 's crony capitalists ally with those who grew wealthy during racial apartheid , and then together promote class - apartheid policies and practices to accumulate yet more wealth .
University of KwaZulu - Natal microcosm
In our own microcosm at the University of KwaZulu - Natal ( UKZN ) here in Durban , the implications of this system are evident thanks to vivid lessons our administrators learned when the great teacher of poverty , Mamphela Ramphele , experimented on UCT 's workforce a decade ago .
Ramphele was Steve Biko 's partner , a revolutionary and community health worker during the 1970s , and a researcher of Western Cape social degradation in her 1980s anthropology doctoral thesis , and co-chair of the Carnegie Inquiry into poverty .
A committed scholar - activist , she had to retool for a new , rather more lucrative stage of her career a decade ago : World Bank managing director .
To create poverty on the prolific scale required at the World Bank , Ramphele got good training as UCT 's president ( vice - chancellor ) , from 1996 - 2000 .
According to her deputy , Wieland Gevers , Ramphele 's arrival marked " a turning point in UCT 's history " , as the university 's " focus underwent a fundamental shift " .
Ramphele " served on the boards of several premier corporations .
She came to UCT strongly convinced that its administration was archaic and not sufficiently informed by modern corporate practice .
A whirlwind hit UCT . "
The ill wind blew away the rights of already low - paid workers .
Explained an approving Gevers , " In corporate fashion , and with support of UCT 's Council , Mamphela outsourced many functions that were not core business . "
By March 2000 , the Labour Court ruled that UCT could retrench hundreds of non-academic staff , " a process which has already left many families homeless and fighting for survival " , according to journalist Beauregard Tromp .
As at UKZN , labour broking wrecked the lives of UCT workers doing cleaning , gardening , maintenance and messenger services .
Ramphele called this " pruning the tree of dead wood and inappropriately placed branches to make way for new shoots " .
Dead wood ?
Leonard Malukazi of the National Education , Health and Allied Workers Union observed that Ramphele fired low - income workers who served for more than 30 years : " There were people who were about to retire in a year 's time .
Even then they did n't give a second thought to who they retrenched . "
It was a brutal shock , says Malukazi .
" The majority of university workers have been working to pay a housing bond [ mortgage ] and with these retrenchments it basically means that you have entire families out on the streets without the benefits of health care or housing allowances . "
As Ramphele 's salary soared at the World Bank , UCT workers suffered dramatic income cuts ( to an average of US $ 160 per month ) and lost their annual bonus , free medical insurance , housing subsidy and all other benefits .
UCT academics Jonathan Grossman and Vicki Scholtz noted how " Ramphele spoke of the " painful decision " and assured the UCT community that the workers would be employed , retrained and / or able to start their own businesses .
As with so many painful decisions , the pain was all imposed on the victims of the decision by those taking it . "
But the UCT workers resisted and after continuing their court battles , the university -- under new management -- was soon compelled to pay out nearly a million dollars worth of damages .
Then workers brought their pay up to $ 400 / month through organising and strikes .
The same process has begun at UKZN because of extremely low wages -- cleaners take home just $ 120 / month , security guards $ 240 -- and exploitative working conditions , including the mass firing of 80 vulnerable cleaning workers last month .
Trevor Ngwane of the Centre for Civil Society works closely with worker - leader Zama Hlatshwayo ; even these very talented radicals persistently reach deadlock with university human - resources bureaucrats .
It 's a dangerous game , for anger at labour brokers ramped up tragic violence during the 2006 national security guards ' strike , in which 70 scab workers were killed .
" The security industry paid pitiful wages and must take responsibility for what happened , " conceded Ramphele , in her 2009 book Laying Ghosts to Rest .
" The right to work for a decent reward was violated by its exploitative practices . "
She uses a chapter of that book to justify her UCT management practices , but somehow forgets to mention the outsourcing of low - paid workers .
The " talk - left , walk - right " legacy , so typical of nationalist , post - apartheid managerialism , continues to bedevil our universities ; UKZN 's mission statement also sounds progressive .
What can change the power balance ?
Zuma is apparently not to be trusted , for as COSATU observed on February 13 , his speech contained " nothing on the creation of decent work , the spread of casualisation of labour and the scourge of labour broking , and nothing to explain how he intends to implement the 2009 manifesto commitment to ' avoid exploitation of workers and ensure decent work ' . "
What Zuma did do , however , was threaten more police brutality against the victims of his macroeconomic policies , such as was witnessed in the most militant peripheral town ( Balfour ) last week when police hunted down and tortured community activists .
South Africa 's per capita social protest rate continues to lead the world , and scenes of road blockades , burning tyres and repression reminiscent of the film District 9 , may prove yet more embarrassing to the South African ruling class when 3 billion viewers tune into the soccer World Cup starting on June 11 .
Zuma also promised electicity utility Eskom 's partial privatisation , notwithstanding South Africa 's universally miserable experience with the likes of phone company Telkom 's Texan - Malaysian rip - off landline phone partners , the disastrous Suez municipal water takeover in Johannesburg , the crash of a South African Airlines - Swiss Air deal , machinations by the US energy firm AES , toll roads and many others .
Privatisation will , COSATU replied , " ultimately wreck a crucial public national service and we shall continue to campaign vigorously to prevent the sell - off of a vital public asset " '
Many others agree .
On February 16 , South Durban community organisers and Climate Justice Now !- KZN activists protested at Eskom 's Durban headquarters against massive electricity price increases ( likely to be approved by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa ) , vast greenhouse gas emissions from proposed coal - fired power plants and the threatened $ 3.75 billion World Bank loan .
The unity of consumers , communities , environmentalists and workers -- both formally employed and outsourced -- might prevail .
An international coalition is forming to deny Eskom access to the World Bank , and if that fails , to deny the World Bank access to the $ 250 billion in capital it will be asking for at its Spring 2010 meetings in Washington just 10 weeks from now .
A decade ago , Trevor Ngwane and the late Dennis Brutus were instrumental in launching the World Bank Bonds Boycott , which followed the South African divestment movement of the 1970s - '80s by lobbying institutional investors to avoid profits and interest from apartheid -- or in this case , global apartheid .
In this and similar struggles now intensifying here , we riff - raff are up against formidable opponents from Pretoria to Washington , including world - class experts well practiced in the art of generating poverty and inequality .
Calls for solidarity against all these class - apartheid manifestations will soon ring out .

Is your agent really working for the enemy ?
A user ’s guide to home economics ( and how to beat the expert industry ) .
By Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner
Can You Crack the Code ?
Listed below are 10 terms commonly used in real estate ads .
Five have a strong positive correlation to the ultimate sales price and five have a strong negative correlation .
Which are which ?
See Answers on the following page .
• fantastic
• granite
• spacious
• state - of - the - art
• !
• Corian
• charming
• maple
• great neighborhood
• gourmet
It ’s one of the biggest bets you can place on another person :
You hire a real estate agent to sell your home .
She sizes up its charms , snaps some pictures , sets the price , writes a seductive ad , shows the house aggressively , negotiates the offers , and sees the deal through to the end .
Sure , it ’s a lot of work , but she ’s getting a nice cut .
On the sale of a $ 300,000 house , you ’ll typically pay a 6 percent agent fee of $ 18,000 .
That ’s a lot of money .
But you tell yourself that you never could have sold the house for $ 300,000 on your own .
The agent knew how to – what ’s that phrase she used ?
– “ maximize the house ’s value . ”
She got you top dollar , right ?
http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.05/realestate_pr.html
A real estate agent is every bit the expert .
She is better informed than you about your home ’s worth , the state of the housing market , even the buyer ’s frame of mind .
You depend on her for this information .
As the world has grown more specialized , countless such experts have made themselves similarly indispensable .
Doctors , lawyers , contractors , auto mechanics :
They all enjoy informational advantage .
And they use that advantage to help you .
Right ?
Information can be a beacon , or information can be a cudgel ; it depends on who wields it and how .
In any transaction , it ’s common for one party to have better information than the other .
In the parlance of economists , this is information asymmetry .
There ’s value in asymmetry ; it ’s the reason why someone , such as a consumer , will pay someone else , an expert , for his knowledge .
Of course , sometimes an expert might manipulate his advantage for his own benefit .
If your doctor suggests that you have an angioplasty – even though current research suggests that angioplasty often does little to prevent heart attacks – your first thought wo n’t likely be that the doctor is using his informational advantage to make a few thousand dollars for himself or his buddy .
But as David Hillis , an interventional cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas , explained to The New York Times , a doctor may have the same economic incentives as a car salesman or a funeral director or a mutual fund manager : “ If you ’re an invasive cardiologist and Joe Smith , the local internist , is sending you patients , and if you tell them they do n’t need the procedure , pretty soon Joe Smith does n’t send patients anymore . ”
Or consider these findings of a 1996 medical study : Obstetricians in areas with declining birthrates are much more likely to perform cesarean section deliveries than obstetricians in growing areas – suggesting that when business is tough , doctors may try to ring up more expensive procedures .
The Internet , of course , is all about smoothing over these asymmetries ; in one industry after another , from life insurance to used cars , the Web has eliminated the expert ’s upper hand by giving once - exclusive information to the online masses .
But some industries have been slow to change – real estate among them .
The best way to observe information asymmetry at work is to measure how an expert treats you versus how he performs the same service for himself .
Real estate provides the perfect opportunity , since housing sales are a matter of public record , and real estate agents often do sell their own homes .
Recent data covering the sale of nearly 100,000 houses in suburban Chicago show that more than 3,000 of those houses were owned by agents .
Before plunging into the data , a question :
What is the agent ’s incentive when selling her own home ?
Simple : to make the best deal possible .
Presumably , this is also her incentive when selling your home ; after all , her commission is based on the sale price .
And so your incentive and the agent ’s incentive would seem to be nicely aligned .
But commissions are n’t as simple as they seem .
First of all , a 6 percent commission is typically split between the seller ’s agent and the buyer ’s .
Each agent then kicks back half of her take to her agency .
Which means that only 1.5 percent of the purchase price goes directly into your agent ’s pocket .
So on the sale of your $ 300,000 house , her personal take of the $ 18,000 commission is $ 4,500 .
Still not bad , you say .
But what if the house was worth more than $ 300,000 ?
What if , with a little more effort and patience , she could have sold it for $ 310,000 ?
After the commission , that puts an additional $ 9,400 in your pocket .
Yet the agent ’s additional share – her personal 1.5 percent – is a mere $ 150 .
So maybe your incentives are n’t aligned after all .
Is the agent willing to put out all that extra time and energy for just $ 150 ?
There ’s one way to find out : measure the difference between the sales data for houses that belong to real estate agents themselves and the houses they sold on behalf of clients .
Using the information from those 100,000 Chicago homes , and controlling for any number of variables – location , age and quality of the house , aesthetics , and so on – it turns out an agent keeps her own home on the market an average of 10 days longer and sells it for an extra 3 - plus percent , or $ 10,000 on a $ 300,000 house .
When she sells her own house , an agent holds out for the best offer ; when she sells yours , she pushes you to take the first decent offer that comes along .
Like a stockbroker churning commissions , she wants to make deals and make them fast .
Why not ?
Her share of a better offer – $ 150 – is too puny an incentive to encourage her to do otherwise .
So her job is to convince you that a $ 300,000 offer is in fact very good , even generous , and one that only a fool would refuse .
This can be tricky .
The agent does n’t want to come right out and call you a fool .
So she merely implies it – perhaps by telling you about the bigger , nicer , newer house down the block that has sat unsold for six months .
This is the agent ’s main weapon : the conversion of information into fear .
Consider this true story , related by John Donohue , a law professor who in 2001 was teaching at Stanford University : “ I was just about to buy a house on the Stanford campus , and the seller ’s agent kept telling me what a good deal I was getting because the market was about to zoom .
As soon as I signed the purchase contract , he asked me if I would need an agent to sell my previous Stanford house .
I told him that I would probably try to sell without an agent , and he replied , ‘ John , that might work under normal conditions , but with the market tanking now , you really need the help of a broker . ' ”

In five minutes , a zooming market tanked .
Such are the marvels that can be conjured by an agent in search of the next deal .
So a big part of a real estate agent ’s job is to persuade the homeowner to sell for less than he would like while at the same time letting potential buyers know that a house can be bought for less than its listing price .
To be sure , there are more subtle means of conveying this information than blatantly telling the buyer to bid low .
The Chicago study also reveals how agents exert influence through the listings they write .
A phrase like “ well maintained , ” for instance , is full of meaning to an agent – the house is old but not quite falling down .
A savvy buyer will know this ( or find out once he sees the place ) , but to the retiree who is selling the house , “ well maintained ” might sound like a compliment , which is just what the agent intends .
An analysis of the language used in real estate ads shows that certain words are powerfully correlated with the final sale price of a house .
This does n’t necessarily mean that labeling a house “ well maintained ” causes it to sell for less than an equivalent house .
It does , however , indicate that when an agent labels a house “ well maintained , ” she is subtly encouraging a buyer to bid low .
So consider the terms in the box on the previous page : A “ fantastic ” house is surely fantastic enough to warrant a high price , right ?
What about a “ charming ” and “ spacious ” home in a “ great neighborhood ! ” ?
No , no , no , no , and no .
In fact , the terms that correlate with a higher sales price are physical descriptions of the home itself : granite , Corian , and maple .
As information goes , such terms are specific and straightforward – and therefore pretty useful .
If you like granite , you might like the house ; but even if you do n’t , “ granite ” certainly does n’t connote a fixer - upper .
Nor does “ gourmet ” or “ state - of - the - art , ” both of which seem to tell a buyer that a house is , on some level , fantastic .
“ Fantastic , ” meanwhile , is a dangerously ambiguous adjective , as is “ charming . ”
These words , it turns out , are real estate agent code for a house that does n’t have many specific attributes worth describing .
“ Spacious ” homes , meanwhile , are often decrepit or impractical .
“ Great neighborhood ” signals to a buyer that , well , this house is n’t very nice but others nearby may be .
And an exclamation point in a real estate ad is bad news for sure , a bid to paper over real shortcomings with false enthusiasm .
If you study an ad for a real estate agent ’s own home , meanwhile , you see that she emphasizes descriptive terms ( especially “ new , ” “ granite , ” “ maple , ” and “ move- in condition ” ) and avoids empty adjectives ( including “ wonderful , ” “ immaculate , ” and the telltale “ ! ” ) .
She patiently waits for the best buyer to come along .
She might tell this buyer about a house nearby that just sold for $ 25,000 above the asking price , or another house that is the subject of a bidding war .
She is careful to exercise every advantage of the information asymmetry she enjoys .
But even the agent ’s advantage has been eroded by the Internet .
After all , anyone can now get online and gather information about sales trends and housing inventory and mortgage - rate tremors .
And recent sales data is starting to show the results .
Agents still get a higher price for their own homes than for comparable homes owned by their clients – but since the proliferation of real estate Web sites , the gap between the two prices has shrunk by a third .
The information has been set loose .

Peter :
You say that like I 'm supposed to be jealous .
This is my gift to the world .
A way of fully indulging in the joys of the cupcake without any of the drawbacks .
A way that balances every bite with frosting , cake , and the joy of knowing you have truly proven yourself to be an enlightened and practical individual .
I know what you ’re thinking , there must be some drawbacks !
Here are some common questions about THE CUPCAKE SANDWICH :
Wo n’t the frosting get everywhere ?
While some frosting does leak out the sides at times , this is a perfect opportunity to have a bit of frosting by itself without having to have globs of it all at once .
Do n’t consider this a drawback , but an opportunity .
How is this any shorter than it was before ?
Wo n’t getting it in your mouth still be a problem ?
And your math sucks , cupcakes are not 2 x the height of my mouth .
First of all , you are probably the same detractors that found flaws in the Full Gadget Ratio .
Nertz to you .
Second , no this will not be a problem .
The cakey bottom , once placed on top , creates a “ safe zone ” for your hands with which you can compress the size of the cupcake at will , without getting your hands covered in frosting .
As for the height of the cupcake vs mouth , it may not be perfect but sometimes the best things in life are n’t .
How have I never thought of this before ?
This is why I ’m an internet humorist and you ’re a reader .
We all have our roles to play .

First American CoreLogic , a real estate research company , recently released data on negative equity mortgages for the third quarter of 2009 .
The situation is stark .
Nearly one in four U.S. mortgages ( 23 % ) is currently underwater , with the borrower owing more than the property is currently worth .
According to First American , when mortgages " near " negative equity are tallied , the total number of mortgages near or currently underwater is around 14 million - " nearly 28 percent of all residential properties with a mortgage nationwide . "
Being underwater does not necessarily mean that a borrower is at risk of default .
Although foreclosures and payment delinquencies are currently at record levels nationwide in the wake of the popped real estate bubble , most borrowers facing negative equity continue to make their mortgage payments .
While being underwater " is the best predictor for loan defaults , " according to Sam Khater , economist with First American , " if you have your job and do n’t encounter economic shock , you ’ll most likely keep paying on your home . "
But should you keep paying if you 're underwater ?
Brent White , an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Arizona has examined the situation , and argues in a recent discussion paper that homeowners " should be walking away in droves . "
According to White , millions of homeowners " could save hundreds of thousands of dollars by strategically defaulting on their mortgages . "
Such a strategic move comes with consequences for the borrower - most notably a negative impact on one 's credit score .
This has a quantifiable cost , but White states that " a few years of poor credit should n’t cost more than few thousand dollars , " and notes that individuals can rebuild their credit rating over time , and can " plan in advance for a few years of limited credit . "
Such costs are , argues White , " minimal compared to the financial benefit of strategic default . "
White makes use of the hypothetical example of a California couple purchasing an average priced ( $ 585,000 ) , averaged sized home in 2006 to demonstrate the case for default :
" Though they still owe about $ 560,000 on their home , it is now only worth $ 187,000 .
A similar house around the corner from Sam and Chris recently listed for $ 179,000 , which , with a modest 5 % down , would translate to a total monthly payment of less than $ 1200 per month – as compared to the $ 4300 that they currently pay .
They could rent a similar house in the neighborhood for about $ 1000 .
Assuming they intend to stay in their home ten years , Sam and Chris would save approximately $ 340,000 by walking away , including a monthly savings of at least $ 1700 on rent verses mortgage payments ...
If they stay in their home on the other hand , it will take Sam and Chris over 60 years just to recover their equity "
White argues that in such cases , borrowers are better off taking a short - term hit to their credit , and strategically defaulting to escape a long - term , crushing financial burden .
By staying in the home , borrowers are taking money that could otherwise be saved for retirement or used for other purposes , and throwing it away to service a liability that is unlikely to show positive equity in their lifetime .
Such advice seems most likely to appeal to those upside - down in particularly hard - hit areas of the country , including California , Florida , Nevada and Arizona .
However , as noted , most homeowners are sticking it out , and continuing to pay their mortgages .
According to White , many who might otherwise make such a decision avoid doing so due to " fear , shame , and guilt , " sentiments which are " actively cultivated " by the government and financial industry to keep homeowners from walking away .
It remains to be seen if underwater borrowers will overcome fear of the consequences and take White 's advice to strategically default .
Mortgage lenders most likely hope that his ideas remain firmly in the minority - as one mortgage executive stated in comments reacting to White 's report , the argument for strategic default is " incredibly irresponsible and misinformed , " and , if widely embraced , has the potential to " ' tear apart the very basis ' upon which mortgage lending rests " .
Losing otherwise performing mortgages to strategic default , whatever the economic sense for borrowers , could be yet another blow to an already reeling industry .

Andy Ritger , NVIDIA manager responsible for the Linux graphics cards , as announced on the X.org mailing list that the graphics chip company will no longer develop the open source 2D video drivers for its chips .
He recommends using the VESA X driver instead .
Ritger reports that NVIDIA will continue to support the xf86 - video - nv driver for existing GPUs and " within reason " on existing and future X server versions .
However , the company will no longer support the driver for future GPUs as of Fermi .
NVIDIA will also exclude Displayport in the driver .
The reason the chipmaker gives is that the capabilities of the NV driver are lagging behind X Window System development .
According to Ritger , " NVIDIA developed and maintained the xf86 - video - nv X driver primarily as a very minimal driver that works ' well enough ' to give
users accelerated X rendering from the time they install their Linux distribution until the time they install the [ proprietary ] NVIDIA driver . "
" X rendering " in this sense means the X Rendering Extension upon which today 's X Window Systems rely heavily .
The NV driver " does not offer much beyond what is provided by the stock VESA X driver . "
For added value , says Ritger on the xorg - announce mailing list , the NV driver would need a lot of work , which would divert essential NVIDIA resources away from developing their proprietary graphics driver .
He advises Linux users to use the VESA X driver until they can get the proprietary NVIDIA Linux driver .
Ritger feels that concentrating on the NVIDIA driver development would be in Linux users ' best interest so that NVIDIA graphics functionality is optimized under Linux .
Canonical 's Ubuntu project has already taken the NV driver rejection in stride by replacing the driver with the Nouveau driver in Ubuntu 10.04 .
Other distros are also likely to seek other standard drivers for NVIDIA graphics .
A common effort to establish a common driver can only help the free software community .
DUBLIN , Ireland ― Pope Benedict XVI ’s response to the clerical child abuse scandal in Ireland has been widely criticized as flawed for placing much of the blame for the abuse and cover-ups on secularism rather than church structures .
In a pastoral letter to Irish Catholics , read out to the faithful at masses on Sunday , the 82 - year - old pope apologized to victims , saying “ You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry . ”
He noted that in recent decades the Catholic Church in Ireland had to confront “ new and serious challenges to the faith arising from the rapid transformation and secularisation of Irish society . ”
It was in this overall context “ that we must try to understand the disturbing problem of child sexual abuse , which has contributed in no small measure to the weakening of faith and the loss of respect for the church and her teachings . ”
Following the statement , the Irish branch of the mainstream Catholic organization Voice of the Faithful criticized the pope ’s failure to acknowledge that it was secular agencies such as the media , the police , the civil courts and the state that uncovered a problem kept hidden by the church ’s own systems of governance .
And in an editorial Monday , The Irish Times argued that those in charge of the Irish church during the worst periods of abuse and cover - up were scarcely the liberals criticized regularly by the Pope : “ His secularization of the Church — meaning the introduction of social legislation such as contraception , separation and divorce for women — comes from an old - fashioned , authoritarian , misogynistic church concerned above all with its reputation . ”
In his letter , the pope announced a Vatican investigation of some dioceses and church institutions in Ireland , and advised clerics to “ submit yourselves to the demands of justice . ”
It did not comment on calls for the resignation of the leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland , Cardinal Sean Brady , who is under pressure to step down because of his handling of abuse claims by two young people against notorious serial abuser Father Brendan Smyth .
As a priest , Brady swore them to secrecy and passed their complaints to his bishop rather than the police , and Smyth continued to rape children for more than a decade .
Four Irish bishops have offered their resignations following revelations of cover -up in the recent Murphy report on the Dublin archdiocese but three have not been accepted by the Vatican .
The extent of skepticism in Ireland about the papal message was evident at a conference of Ireland ’s main opposition party Fine Gael in Killarney at the weekend .
There the traditionally conservative delegates gave a standing ovation to abuse survivor Andrew Madden when he called on the pope and Brady to resign .
Madden said the pastoral letter failed to accept the cover - up of clerical abuse in Ireland and the part the Irish bishops and the Vatican played in it .
Voice of the Faithful , founded in Boston following revelations of Cardinal Bernard Law 's negligence , agreed there was no recognition “ that the concentration of powers exercised by bishops led to a conflict of responsibilities , to a culture of secrecy and in too many cases to an unjust and intimidatory response to victims which compounded their sufferings . ”
The pope said he felt shame and remorse for what the victims had endured and found it understandable that those abused in residential institutions found it hard to be reconciled with the church .
He acknowledged grave errors of leadership by Catholic authorities in Ireland and the sometimes grievous failure “ to apply the long - established norms of canon law to the crime of child abuse . ”
The Catholic archbishop of Dublin , Diarmuid Martin , indicated that the state ’s inquiry into clerical child sex abuse in Ireland should be extended .
“ Without accountability for the past there will no healing and no trust for the future , ” said Martin , who has been at the fore in exposing the scandal of abuse in Ireland .
He told the congregation at the Pro Cathedral in Dublin city center that the church “ tragically failed many of its children : it failed through abuse , it failed through not preventing abuse , it failed through covering up abuse . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Fed up with the tough job market , some young American Jews are choosing to wait out the recession in Israel , where the government heavily subsidizes their stay while they intern , learn Hebrew or volunteer .

According to Masa , a group that organizes programs to Israel and is partially funded by the Israeli government , participation is up 50 percent since the fall of 2008 .
Today , Masa has more than 1,500 Americans working in Israel .
Masa ’s Aaron Goldberg said interest has been rising since the financial crisis , which gave them the idea for their “ Israel : A Better Stimulus Plan ” marketing campaign .
“ Before the economic crisis , there was n’t that impetus to look beyond the traditional career path , ” said Goldberg , Masa ’s director of recruitment .
“ Now there are less jobs and less internships , so this becomes a great way to add something to your portfolio . ”
Jews are not the only ones seeking their fortune overseas .
According to the Institute for International Education , the number of American students interning overseas has doubled since 2000 to more than 13,000 in 2008 .
“ In tougher times , people are taking a look at how they can develop themselves further , ” said Paul Lakind , president of The Global Intern , a company in Randolph , New Jersey that arranges internships in Israel , as well as England , China and Italy .
Since its founding , Israel has sought to attract Jewish youth to ensure its survival as a Jewish state .
But the recession has proven a good marketing tool .
Rachel Wolfson , 22 , graduated last May with a degree in government and English but the Dallas resident could only find work selling shoes .
To save money , Wolfson moved back in with her parents , but quickly grew frustrated .
“ I feel like an undergraduate degree does n’t mean as much as it used to , ” she said .
“ And with the economy the way it is , I just decided to leave America . ”
Through Masa , Wolfson will intern for the political party New Movement - Meretz .
The internship is unpaid , but Wolfson hopes the experience will improve her resume .
Her internship costs about $ 9,000 , including air fare , room and board for five months .
Masa gives her a $ 3,000 grant and suggested she have $ 300 - $ 500 a month for personal expenses .
ISRAEL SPARED WORST OF ECONOMIC WOES
Unemployment is up in Israel , but the country was spared the economic beating America and many other rich countries took .
High - tech and biotech , Israel ’s top industries , are booming and many global firms now have a presence there , driving demand for college - educated English speakers .
Although Masa ’s programs mostly focus on helping Jews get reacquainted with Israel , other programs are open to non-Jews , especially those between 20 - 30 years of age .
Most programs are short - term , meant to immerse young adults in a foreign culture while boosting their professional skills .
But some participants have decided to stay on after their internships ended , after receiving job offers .
Elliot Lazarus , a 30 - year - old architect from Long Island will soon be relocating to Jerusalem with his wife and 5 - year - old son , after spending last fall interning at two Jerusalem architectural firms .
When he was initially laid off in December 2008 , Lazarus was in despair .
But with time , he came to think of his job loss as a new beginning .
“ Most people ca n’t just walk away from a six figure salary , ” he said .
“ I had to be shaken out of my comfort zone . ”
Unlike most participants , Lazarus is an orthodox Jews who long had a desire to live in Israel .
But he says it took the economic crisis to push him over the edge .
On his blog “ Recessioning in Jerusalem ” ( recessioninginjerusalem.blogspot.com ) , he ruminates about his decision and more everyday pursuits , like haggling over the price of a haircut or jogging through the Old City at dusk .
For some , the appeal of Israel is religious .
For others it ’s practical : life is cheaper there .
But overwhelmingly , participants say they are surprised by Israel ’s work culture , which encourages flexibility and a better life - work balance .
“ It was never a problem to ask my boss if I could come in late or leave early , ” recalls 27 - year - old Rachael Freedman who interned at a Tel Aviv architecture firm after losing her job in 2008 .
“ It ’s definitely more relaxed . ”
Since returning , Freedman has been hired back by her old firm , but Israel also left an indelible mark on her .
“ I think about it every day , ” said Freedman , who considers herself a secular Jew .
“ I wake up thinking of Israel , at work I think about it , and hope to be there in the nearer future .
There is just something about it that feels like home . ”
Dudes , thanks for you suggestions of things to do in Glasgow !
I am slowly working my way through them .
I 've started to put some photos up on the flickr , you can look at them if you like hills or museums or train stations ( as I do ) .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Shares of Medicaid insurers , hospital companies and even drugmakers rose on Monday as many investors concluded that passage of landmark U.S. healthcare legislation will add millions of new paying patients .
The S&P Health Care Sector index .
GSPA was up nearly 1 percent on Monday , outpacing the broader market , after the U.S. House of Representatives gave final approval to a sweeping overhaul late on Sunday night .
Shares of hospital companies such as Community Health Systems CYH.N and health insurers such as Amerigroup AGP.N that focus on Medicaid plans for the poor led the increases .
Analysts expect those companies to benefit as the reform package extends coverage to 32 million Americans .
Robert Schaeffer , portfolio manager with Becker Capital Management , noted that health insurance companies had been on the rise prior to Sunday ’s reform bill vote , foreshadowing a positive take by investors .
“ It ’s obviously been perceived by the market , which is more often right than economists and politicians , but I think the changes have basically been perceived as generally positive , ” Schaeffer said .
“ The last few weeks we ’ve noted for example that the HMOs -- the Wellpoints and Aetnas of the world -- have been doing quite well , ” Schaeffer said .
“ I think that ’s probably an anticipation that , while there are some negatives , there ’s still a universe of 33 or 34 million people that at some point of time are going to go under some form of insurance platform . ”
The overhaul will expand the Medicaid government health plan for the poor and bar insurance practices such as refusing to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions .

Shares of health insurers -- the prime political target of reformers during the lengthy debate -- built on a rally from the end of last week .
Investors were heartened that the uncertainty was cleared from the market and that sector companies avoided a worst - case scenario , such as the creation of a government - run competitor .
The Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index .HMO initially rose 1.9 percent but gave back some of those gains and was up 0.7 percent in late morning trading .
Large insurers WellPoint Inc WLP.N and UnitedHealth GroupUNH.N shed early gains , with United Health down nearly 2 percent at midday .
Medicaid - focused insurers such as Amerigroup and Molina Healthcare MOH.N climbed sharply , as the companies stand to benefit from an expansion of the program .
Molina shares were up 5 percent .
The cost of protecting U.S. health insurers ’ debt with credit default swaps rose .
Five - year credit default swaps on Aetna Inc AET.N rose to 110.5 basis points from 97.5 basis points at Friday 's close , while Cigna Corp 's CI.N credit default swaps rose to 120 basis points from 110 basis points on Friday , according to data from CMA DataVision .
Shares of hospital companies Community Health Systems and Tenet Healthcare THC.N rose 4 percent and 7.7 percent , respectively .
The overhaul has been seen as helping hospital companies by adding more insured customers , thereby decreasing the numbers of patients who used services without being able to pay for them .
The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index .DRG was up nearly 1 percent , with Pfizer Inc PFE.N and Merck MRK.N each rising almost 2 percent each .
Drug companies face new fees , but wider insurance coverage could help offset the costs by delivering new customers willing to fill costly prescriptions .
Similarly , the NYSE Arca Biotech Index .
BTK was up 1 percent .
“ We continue to believe money will rotate back into healthcare stocks now that the uncertainty of ‘ reform ’ is lifted , ” Citigroup analyst Charles Boorady said in a research note .
The S&P Health Care Equipment Sub -Industry index .
GSPMED of medical device companies rose 1.6 percent .
Such companies , including Medtronic MDT.N and Boston Scientific BSX.N face an industry tax , but it was cut in half to $ 20 billion and will not start until 2013 .
HUNTSVILLE , AL --
A biology professor is in custody in connection with three fatal shootings on the University of Alabama in Huntsville campus Friday afternoon , according to a UAH official .
Dr. Amy Bishop , a Harvard - University trained neuroscientist , was taken into custody , and her husband has been detained .
They have not been charged with a crime .
Police said they have a suspect in custody but have not named the person .
According to police , three people were killed and three were wounded when the shooter opened fire during a biology faculty meeting on the third floor of the Shelby Center for Science and Technology .
The three injured people are being treated at Huntsville Hospital .
In June 2006 , The Times published a story involving Bishop , biology professor and her husband , Jim Anderson , chief science officer of Cherokee Labsystems in Huntsville .
Bishop is quoted in the story as co-inventor of " InQ , " a new cell growth incubator which promised to cut the costs , size and maintenance involved in the mechanics of cell generation .
From the story : InQ co-inventor Amy Bishop credits the coming together of a group of people with certain skills and crossover knowledge in a series of highly fortunate events fueled by Huntsville 's evolving entrepreneurial spirit .
" It 's great to actually see it hit the market , and the sooner the better , " Bishop said .
" My colleagues think it will change the face of tissue culture .
It will allow us , as researchers , to not live in the lab and control our tissue culture conditions , including the sensitive cultures including those like adult stem cells .
" The conditions to differentiate those have to be exact , and the incubator will help that . "
Tired of applying 1920s science to the rapidly advancing work of biotechnology , Bishop approached her husband ... about inventing a portable cell incubator .
Together , she and Anderson designed a sealed , self - contained cell incubation system that is mobile and eliminates many of the problems with cultivating tissues in the fragile environment of the petri dish .
It also has its own on - board computer that maintains and regulates the incubator , allowing tighter control of the cell environment .

Last week , game developer Tommy Refenes publicly called Apple 's app store " awful " and " horrible . "
This week , Apple yanked his game from their store .

There are a couple of reasons that may have compelled Apple to remove Zits & Giggles , a pimple - popping game for the iPhone and iPod Touch , from the App store :
Possibility 1 : Its co-creator did spend five minutes at last week 's Game Developers Conference " Indie Gamemakers Rant " to declare that he " absolutely fucking hate [ s ] the iPhone app store . "
He likened the iPhone gaming market to that served by the low - quality Tiger handheld gaming systems of the 80s and 90s , handheld devices that played crude Mega Man and Street Fighter games .
Advertisement
Possibility 2 : Zits & Giggles ' creators also kept raising the price of their game — as an experiment — up to $ 400 as of last week .
But Apple has n't offered Refenes any clues , leaving him only with theories .
" They gave me no explanation at all as to why they took it down , " the developer told Kotaku after trying to get an explanation from Apple all week .
" I 'm guessing they are mad that I said their store sucks and the iPhone is a Tiger handheld and they took it down . "

Apple has not responded to Kotaku 's request for comment

Zits & Giggles was launched in March 2009 .
Zits & Giggles is a simple pimple - popping game .
It was co-developed by handful of game makers , including Refenes and Adam Atomic , the developer of the hit iPhone game Canabalt .
The group made the game as a lark , a sentiment that was clear from the summary of the game that used to appear on the App store :
Will you continue to embrace good taste and sensibility , or will you have the courage and the fortitude to go above and beyond your duties as a patriotic citizen ?
This cultural milestone is not only the FIRST * but the MOST ADVANCED dermatological simulator ever released on the iPhone and iPod Touch .

Few people perusing the App store had any interest in Zits & Giggles in March of 2009 .
According to Refenes , sales were negligible .
In his rant last week , Refenes explained that , about five months ago , he raised the price to $ 15 .
It was an experiment .
On the day he raised the price , three people bought the game .
He said he raised the price to $ 50 , and four more people bought it .
Refenes was inspired and convinced that people who buy games from the App store are n't good at sniffing out good games .
He would keep raising the price to see how many more people would buy the game .
Fourteen people bought the game at $ 299 in February , he said .

On Monday , March 15 , the day Zits & Giggles was removed from the App store , someone bought the game for $ 400 , he told Kotaku .
Advertisement
One day after the removal , Refenes received an e-mail from an Apple official .
The note , subject - lined " Your App Store submission Zits & Giggles , " began with " We have been trying to reach you " along with a phone number to call but did not refer to the game 's removal .
After receiving the e-mail , Refenes figured out that his game had been pulled .
He 's been trying to get Apple to talk to him , by phone or e-mail , ever since .
Refenes , who is also part of the development team for the anticipated PC , Xbox 360 and Wii downloadable game Super Meat Boy , told Kotaku that he does not believe his game broke any App store rules .

Kotaku has sought clarification from Apple about whether the pricing experiment , which would have cost consumers far more money than Zits & Giggles is worth , violates any App store pricing rules .
In 2008 , Apple removed an app called I Am Rich that charged people $ 1000 for essentially nothing .
At the Game Developers Conference , Refenes called the App store to the " Tiger handheld game of this generation , " a platform on which big brands are sold but where game quality is not the consumers ' priority .
The pricing experiment had confirmed this , he told his fellow game creators : " My conclusion to all of this is that the people you 're selling games to on the App store , they 're not necessarily gamers .
There are some games that sell very well on the App store , but for the most part , when you have stuff like Street Fighter and Assassin 's Creed , the are a way to sell a brand , just like the Tiger handhelds were . "
It is easy to believe that Refenes ' March 10 , 2010 rant , delivered a year after the game was launched and several months after the price started to climb , was the impetus for the removal of Zits & Giggles from the App store .
But whether Apple made its move on March 15 due to discovering the app via the rant or to punish a trash - talking developer will remain a mystery until Apple speaks up .
A new report from Harvard University says that contrary to what the CRTC states , Canada has some of the slowest and most expensive internet access in the developed world .
" Our company - level pricing study for the highest - speed offers in the countries we observe here locates all of the Canadian companies but one in the cluster with the slowest speeds and highest prices , " said the report from the university 's Berkman Center for Internet & Society .
" Canada continues to see itself as a high performer in broadband , as it was early in the decade , but current benchmarks suggest that this is no longer a realistic picture of its comparative performance on several relevant measures . "
A report from the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission last year found that Canada was a broadband leader among G7 nations .
But the Harvard report graded broadband internet access in terms of household and population penetration , speed and price across the 30 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development .
Canada ranked 19th over all , ahead of countries such as Australia and Ireland but behind the United States and leaders Sweden , Denmark and Japan .
Canada placed in the middle of the pack in terms of speeds offered but fared poorly in pricing , ranking 18th out of 30 for current - generation internet and 18th out of 19 for next - generation speeds , which are 35 megabits or faster .
The showing is a slight improvement from a similar report issued by the Berkman Center in October that found Canada ranked 22nd overall .
The updated report , released last week , took into account recent , faster offerings from Canadian internet providers such as Rogers and Videotron .
The costs at which these services are offered —
Shaw sells 100 - megabit speeds for around $ 160 a month , for example — are still considerably higher than in the rest of the world , the report said .
As in its report last year , the Berkman Center found that regulatory hesitation and an over - reliance on competition between telephone and cable companies are the causes of Canada 's poor performance .
While the CRTC did institute open - access rules that require network owners to share their expensive and hard - to - replicate infrastructure with smaller competitors , it has only done so half - heartedly , the report said .
The CRTC has allowed network owners to charge the highest competitor access rates in the OECD , and it has repeatedly said that such access will eventually be curtailed , both of which have dissuaded new entrants from investing in the market , the report said .
" The Canadian experience suggest that reliance purely on competition between strong cable incumbents and strong telephony incumbents may be insufficient to sustain high penetration or achieve high capacity and low competitive prices in the long term , " the report said .
An editorial in the Globe and Mail on Monday said the federal government needs to take immediate action to stop Canada 's sliding position in broadband .
Affordable , higher - speed internet access is necessary for Canadians to remain competitive with the rest of the world , the newspaper said .
" If we do not act with haste , the innovations that could employ our future work force could well pass us by . "
A spokesperson for the CRTC declined to comment .
Telecommunications industry executives condemned the study and the newspaper 's editorial .
Michael Hennessy , head of regulatory affairs at Telus , on his Twitter page said the editorial was " BS " that was based on " flawed OECD data . "
The country 's biggest internet providers last year sponsored a study that found Canada was a world leader in many broadband measures .
The government has thus far agreed with the internet providers .
In December , the cabinet overturned a CRTC decision that would have given competitor companies access to super - fast next - generation broadband infrastructure .
Since then , a number of network owners have announced faster offerings .
Shaw said last week it will begin testing one - gigabit connections — which are about 100 times faster than what some Canadians currently have access to — in April .
The company did not say what it plans to charge customers for such services .
The Berkman Center report was funded by the Ford and MacArthur charitable foundations in the United States .
The report was commissioned by the Federal Communications Commission , the U.S. equivalent of the CRTC , to help the regulator form its recommendations for a national broadband plan , which it will soon forward to Congress .
FCC head Julius Genachowski recently proposed the " 100 Squared " initiative , which would see 100 million homes connected with 100 - megabit connections by 2020 .
Under the plan the government could become involved in building broadband infrastructure .
It 's been three weeks since Google announced that a sophisticated and coordinated hack attack dubbed Operation Aurora recently targeted it and numerous other U.S. companies .
Until now we 've only known that the attackers got in through a vulnerability in Internet Explorer and that they obtained intellectual property and access to the Gmail accounts of two human rights activists whose work revolves around China .
We also know a few details about how the hackers siphoned the stolen data , which went to IP addresses in Taiwan .
About 34 mostly undisclosed companies were breached .
Now a leading computer forensic firm is providing the closest look so far at the nature of the attacks , and attackers , that struck Google and others .
The report never mentions Google by name , or any other companies , but focuses on information gathered from hundreds of forensic investigations the firm has conducted that are identical to what we know about the Google hack .
What the information indicates is that the attack that hit Google is identical to publicly undisclosed attacks that have quietly plagued thousands of other U.S. companies and government agencies since 2002 and are rapidly growing .
They represent a sea change from the kinds of attacks that have commonly hit networks and made headlines .
" The scope of this is much larger than anybody has every conveyed , " says Kevin Mandia , CEO and president of Virginia - based computer security and forensic firm Mandiant .
" There [ are ] not 50 companies compromised .
There are thousands of companies compromised .
Actively , right now . "
Mandiant released the report last week at a closed - door cybercrime conference , sponsored by the U.S. Defense Department , in an effort to make companies aware of the threat .
The firm has been investigating the Google breach and many of the most high - profile breaches of the last few years , such as those that occurred at credit and debit card processors Heartland Payment Systems and RBS Worldpay .
Unlike those latter attacks , however , the breed of attacks that struck Google and others is markedly different .
Advanced Persistent Threats — — — — — —— ——
Called Advanced Persistent Threats ( APT ) , the attacks are distinctive in the kinds of data the attackers target , and they are rarely detected by antivirus and intrusion programs .
What 's more , the intrusions grab a foothold into a company ’s network , sometimes for years , even after a company has discovered them and taken corrective measures .
" APT is a very unique threat out of the Asia Pacific that . . . looks different and is much more widespread than the criminal compromises , " Mandia says in a recent phone interview .
The Heartland and RBS attackers , and other criminal hackers of their ilk , tend to use SQL injections attacks to breach front - end servers .
The APT attackers , however , employ undetectable zero - day exploits and social engineering techniques against company employees to breach networks .
The non-APT hackers target only financial data or sensitive customer data for identity theft , while the APT attackers never target such data .
Instead , their focus is espionage .
They attempt to take every Microsoft Word , PowerPoint and Adobe PDF document from every machine they compromise , as well as all e-mail , says Mandia .
The non-APT hackers also employ smash - and - grab guerrilla tactics and are fairly easy to kick off a network once a company discovers them , Mandia says .
After they grab what they want , they have little interest in hanging around .
APT attackers , however , aim to establish a long - term occupying force inside a company ’s perimeter .
Last year , for example , an unidentified defense contractor discovered 100 compromised systems on its network , and found that the intruders had been inside since at least 2007 .
APT attackers also appear to be well - funded and well - organized .
In some cases , Mandiant has found multiple groups inside a network , each pursuing their own data in a seemingly uncoordinated fashion .
No one is immune to APT attackers , who have struck defense contractors and government agencies as well as private companies and law firms .
A recent story revealed that three U.S. oil companies were hacked in what appears to be an APT attack .
The attacks have been little - known outside government and computer security circles until now because companies have been loath to admit they 've been breached – Google is the exception – or share details of how they were hacked .
Many entities do n't discover a breach until someone from law enforcement tells them .
By then , it 's too late .
" By the time the government is telling you , you 've already lost the stuff you did n't want to lose usually , " Mandia says , noting that it 's generally not possible to ascertain everything that an attacker took .
One series of attacks last year involved a spear - phishing campaign that targeted an unnamed , high - ranking counterterrorism official , and two entities described as coordinators of local , state and federal intelligence .
From Mandiant 's description , it appears these refer to a local fusion center and a federal counterterrorism center .
The report does n’t indicate how successful the attacks were other than to say the intruders stole e-mail and information that helped them map networks and locate valuable data .
Mandiant 's agreements with clients prevent it from disclosing the names of its forensic customers .
One mark of APT attacks is that they have especially hit companies with dealings in China , including more than 50 law firms .
" If you 're a law firm and you 're doing business in places like China , it 's so probable you 're compromised and it's very probable there 's not much you can do about it , " Mandia says .
In 2008 , Mandiant investigated a breach at a law firm that was representing a client in a lawsuit related to China .
The attackers were in the firm 's network for a year before the firm learned from law enforcement that it been hacked .
By then , the intruders harvested thousands of e-mails and attachments from mail servers .
They also had access to every other server , desktop workstation and laptop on the firm 's network .
In another case , a Fortune 500 manufacturer was in discussions to acquire a Chinese corporation when it was notified by law enforcement agents that it had been hacked .
The attackers sent targeted spear - phishing e-mails to four key U.S. executives involved in the acquisition discussions that appeared to come from a colleague .
When the executives clicked on a URL in the e-mail , malware loaded to their machines .
Within a short time , the attackers had administrative rights on the majority of the company 's computers .
They were able to read e-mail containing critical information about the company 's negotiating strategy – days before the negotiations took place .
After discovering the breach , the company abandoned its plan to acquire the Chinese firm .
The vast majority of the activity the Mandiant firm has witnessed has been linked to China , according to its report .
" All we 're saying is that the majority of the data that gets exfiltrated ultimately finds its way to IP addresses in China , and that 's pretty much all anybody knows , " Mandia says .
Attack Techniques — — — ——
–
While APT attacks are sophisticated , they use simple techniques to gain initial entry and , once inside , adhere to a pattern .
For starters , the attackers conduct reconnaissance to identify workers to target in spear - phishing attacks – such as key executives , researchers and administrative assistants who have access to sensitive information – and then send malicious e-mails or instant messages that appear to come from a trusted colleague or friend .
The e-mails have an attachment or link to a ZIP file containing zero - day malware that exploits Microsoft Office or Adobe Reader vulnerabilities .
Google employees received an e-mail with malware that exploited a vulnerability in Internet Explorer 6 that Microsoft had not yet publicly disclosed .
Once the attackers have a foothold on one system , they focus on obtaining elevated access privileges to burrow further into the network .
They do this by grabbing employee password hashes from network domain controllers – and either brute - force decrypt them or use a pass - the - hash tool that tricks the system into giving them access with the encrypted hash .
At this point , they move laterally through the network , compromising systems as they go and using other exploits to attack additional vulnerabilities .
The systems being compromised are Windows systems .
Stolen e-mail messages and documents are collected and stored on a staging server inside the company 's network before being encrypted with custom algorithms and compressed into an .rar file .
The files are then siphoned out in small random bursts generally via normal protocols with spoofed headers to disguise the activity .
In the case of the Google hack , the attackers used an SSL port but a custom protocol .
Some of the more sophisticated malware the attackers use is packed , using customized packers , to make it harder for investigators to reverse engineer and determine what it 's doing .
Attackers also use self - destructing malware that erases itself if it fails to reach its destination .
The attacks go undetected because most victims only monitor data coming into networks , not inside a network or going out of it .
Spear - phishing attacks and zero - day exploits often circumvent protections against data coming in , and data being siphoned out is generally disguised to resemble legitimate traffic .
APT attackers have used sniffers to grab headers from a company 's authenticated proxy communications to dynamically create their own credentials to mimic the communication .
They 've also spoofed Yahoo and AOL SSL certificates and hijacked a victim 's chat program to conduct communication between malware and command servers .
Two other methods they use to disguise their activity are process injections and so - called stub malware .
In a process injection , they introduce malicious code into a trusted process already running on a system to conceal malicious activity .
Stub malware is code with only minimal functionality – to keep its footprint small .
The attackers then remotely add new capabilities to it , which run in the network 's virtual memory .
" [ They would simply code new executable segments that could be uploaded and executed via the stub 's process in memory , without requiring a disk - write to succeed , " the report notes .
" It was difficult to detect these additional capabilities unless memory was analyzed at the same time the new capability was uploaded and executed . "
Remediation — ——
–
Many entities that are compromised by APT remain so even after they 've instituted measures to rid themselves of the intruders , Mandia says .
If they do manage to eradicate the intruders , the most they can hope for is a three - to six - month respite before the attackers return .
The worst thing a company can do , when it discovers a breach , is to shut down an infected system or remove it from the internet before understanding the extent of the breach .
Otherwise , the attackers just switch tactics and focus on other parts of the network .
" If you do a remediation effort that fails , the sophistication of the next wave you deal with is higher , " Mandia says .
Mandiant has seen malware and backdoors that were programmed to lay dormant for months – more than a year in one case – before awakening and sending a beacon to an external command center signaling that it was alive – long after the company thought it had eradicated the intruders .
Last December , Mandia was about to eradicate malware from one network when it suddenly stopped beaconing to its command center .
Symantec , the maker of the antivirus program on the network , had updated its virus definitions and the security software was now detecting and stopping the malware .
Ordinarily this would be good news .
But in an APT attack , this just means the attackers will install new malware that the antivirus program wo n't detect .
And it generally does n't take days to do this .
" New stuff was peppered on the network in under three hours , " Mandia says .

The reasoning can be extended to cover the financial sector as a whole .

That value can then be leveraged yet further for it to raise debt against its share price and so on .

Shame on him , and shame on the spineless Democrats who let this mean old snake go home to take a nap and then rolled over for his blackmail , adjourning for the weekend and letting desperate families hang :
Retiring Sen. Jim Bunning ( R - Ky . ) late Thursday launched a one - man crusade to block an extension of unemployment and COBRA insurance benefits , vowing to allow the benefit programs to expire Sunday unless Democrats agreed to pay for them with unused stimulus funds .
Bunning ’s quixotic pursuit of deficit offsets at the potential expense of payments to unemployed or uninsured citizens enraged Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) and other Democrats , who vowed to keep the chamber in session until Bunning relents or collapses .
Yes , last night the brain - addled Bunning complained about missing a college basketball game , and responded " Tough sh*t " when Sen.
Jeff Merkley begged him to drop his opposition .
A senior Democratic leadership aide said Durbin would ask for unanimous consent to pass the extensions without Bunning ’s payment scheme every half hour for the foreseeable future .
“ We ’re going to keep doing it until we break him , ” the aide said .

Octuplets mother Nadya Suleman , with 14 young mouths to feed and a mortgage to pay off , accepted an offer to use her lawn to promote responsible pet ownership in exchange for cash and food , her lawyer said .
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) sent Suleman 's lawyer an offer to pay for placement of a sign in the yard of her La Habra , California , home .
The sign would read : " Do n't let your dog or cat become an ' Octomom . '
Always spay or neuter . "
The ad features a litter of kittens nursing with their mother .
The offer is intended to call attention to the dog and cat overpopulation crisis , PETA spokesman Amanda Schinke said .
" Every year , 6 to 8 million animals enter animal shelters , and roughly half of them are euthanized because of a lack of good homes , " she said .

Advertisement World number one Roger Federer has pulled out of the Dubai Championships because of a lung infection .
The Swiss , a four - time winner in Dubai , is expected to be out of action for a further two weeks .
Federer was due to make his first appearance since winning the Australian Open last month , but he will now return to action at Indian Wells in March .
British number one Andy Murray and world number two Novak Djokovic are among those competing in Dubai .
" I can't play , it 's too risky , " said Federer .
" It 's a lung infection .
It 's the first time I 've had it .
The breathing was difficult .
I 'm still very tired and a bit slow with everything .
606 : DEBATE
I find this pretty sad , I was looking forward to seeing him back in action and this tournament is one of his favourites
roamed " Indian Wells , I hope to be back .
Right now , there 's no guarantee .
I will do tests and see what the doctors say . "
Federer 's withdrawal leaves Murray as the highest - ranked player in the top half of the draw , and the Scot will open his campaign against Russian qualifier Igor Kunitsyn .
Murray has been off the circuit for almost a month after reaching the Australian Open final in January , recuperating after his defeat by Federer .
" I do n't want to be going over to Indian Wells , Miami with niggles , " said Murray .
" By the end of that month you 're undoubtedly going to be hurting so you do n't want to go into the tournaments already sore .
" So I need to make sure that I take enough time after , like in Australia .
I need to make sure that I 'm fresh .
My back was sore , my knee was hurting , my hip .
After Australia you need to make sure that you got those things right .
" A lot of it is through tiredness , but the sport is such a physical one .
Your body takes such a pounding and over the course of the two weeks you 're hitting , playing , doing interviews as well .
I 'm not complaining about it , but it does take away some energy .
" You need to make sure you get away from it and just refresh our mind and come back feeling right for all the tournaments , " added the 22 - year - old Scot .
" That 's the difference , the change that I 've made in my mentality over the last six months or so .
I want to go into all of the slams feeling right , because last year that was n't the case .
And I do n't want that to happen again . "
Croatia 's Marin Cilic is a potential semi-final opponent for Murray in what would be a repeat of their Australian Open encounter at the same stage , which the Briton won in straight sets .
The first round gets under way on Monday , with Murray against Kunitsyn the late match after defending champion Djokovic takes on Guillermo Garcia - Lopez at 1500 GMT .

Do n't drop the soap ( opera ) : Far - right 's faux DADT dramas come up all wet
by Jeremy Hooper
This from the American Family Association :
Gays showering with straights ?
Absolutely .
If President Obama , congressional Democrats , and homosexual activists get their wish , your son or daughter may be forced to share military showers and barracks with active and open homosexuals who may very well view them with sexual interest .
Talk about creating a hostile work environment for people who practice normative sexuality !
Obama 's new military : Gays showering with straights [ AFA ]
( H/t : Tuesdays Blog )
Okay , so first and most obviously : Gross .
The AFA 's remarkable disdain for all things LGBT is nothing short of nauseating .
Just yuck in every way .
But here 's the thing :
Would n't this fear actually be a reason why they 'd want openly gay soldiers ?
I mean , LGB soldiers are already allowed to serve now , they just have to do it in silence .
So in the current showers , those uneased by the possibility that a gay might peep their weenie have only their speculation to tell them who they should and should not avoid .
With openly gay soldiers , they 'd fully know !
The gay soldier could go about the usual bath time business of , you know , cleaning his or herself , and those with unfounded fears could spend all their time hiding their junk .
The transparency would benefit both the soldiers who no longer have to hide , as well as the soldiers who are convinced that gay men and women want to shtup anything of the same gender that comes within his or her immediate radius .
Win / win , really .
And of course unwanted sexual advancement , be it of the homo or hetero variety , is a completely separate matter , which is already grounds for punishment , and which will obviously remain so in a DADT - less world .
So the " fear " is literally all in the AFA 's mind .
That mind was made up the first second the words " gays " and " equality " entered into the same sentence !
Your thoughts
They 're worried about gays when this :
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/17/military-rape-reports-ris_n_176106.html is still happening at an alarming rate .
They need to get their shit straight .
Posted by : Melissa Anne Baluka | Feb 9 , 2010 2:08:17 PM
GAYS ARE ALREADY IN THE MILITARY !!!
THEY ARE ALREADY SHOWERING WITH OTHER DUDES AND OTHER WOMEN !!
Somehow , everyone has survived without being forcibly RAPED by someone of the same sex .
LIFE GOES ON .
People are getting SHOT AT and dying and this is what they are worried about ... showers .... seriously ...
Seriously , AFA and it's band of idiot followers must have the best looking sons and daughters ever - because you 'd SWEAR just because someone is gay , they ATTACK everything with a penis ( if gay ) or a vagina ( if female ) .
Apparently , gays have no standards or you know , limits .
Can someone explain to me how this ridiculous fear was overcome in countries like Canada and the UK ?
Or are people just normal and shower without problems ?
So stupid that this is a concern .
Posted by : Stef | Feb 9 , 2010 2:33:53 PM
Every day gays shower with straights throughout the world at public gyms , schools , and swimming pools .
Its never been a problem there , why should it be a problem in the military ?
Posted by : Priya Lynn | Feb 9 , 2010 2:52:33 PM
My question :
Who are all these gays joining the armed forces so that they can peep water - logged genitalia ?
Would n't a health club be easier / safer ?
Posted by : G - A - Y | Feb 9 , 2010 2:54:11 PM
The religious do n't have to make sense , they do n't have to tell the truth , they do n't even need to have any grasp on what " normative sexuality " is .
They just have to strike a chord that sounds the homo - phobic / sadistic - rage with the ignorant and small minded who love - to - hate and / or hate - what - they - fear .
Posted by : Dick Mills | Feb 9 , 2010 4:08:43 PM
" Can someone explain to me how this ridiculous fear was overcome in countries like Canada and the UK ? "
Well you see all those other countries that let gays serve without any trouble whatsoever are different .
The bigots will never actually explain the difference beyond " They are n't America . " but they 'll constantly insist they 're totally 100 % different and cannot be compared in any way .

AFA 's argument would make a lot more sense if we called for seperate straight / gay showers throughout all of society .
After all , it worked out * great * the last time a water - dispensing plumbing fixture was segregated for one group vs. another .
Posted by : DN | Feb 9 , 2010 4:57:12 PM
Can anyone else see how easy it would be to change the " gays " and " straights " terms in that article / letter to " whites " and " blacks " ?
I fail to see how this is different ( except for the obviousness of the latter over the former , I suppose , in terms of knowing you 're showering with them ) .
* facepalm *
Posted by : Aya | Feb 9 , 2010 5:35:20 PM
I guess British , Australian , Israeli , heck even Canadian straight men just do n't wuss out like American straight men do .
I guess " Army strong " only goes so far .
Well , at least in the twisted minds of AFA .

Today I showered with other men at the gym .
And , this was my school , not some gay gym in West Hollywood !
Some of them were quite hot .
Yet , somehow , I managed to keep my little gay hands off of them !
Posted by : Bearchewtoy75 | Feb 9 , 2010 6:47:15 PM
@ penguinsaur - Heard someone on the radio the other day say the reason it worked in those other countries was that they did not have as good a military as we have .
So being not hung up on guys in showers makes for a bad military .
Interesting logic
Posted by : Bob Miller | Feb 9 , 2010 10:24:06 PM
So , AFA is busy arousing itself and its constituencies with thoughts of homo voodoo sex magically activated by the sight of damp naked penises in Armed Forces showers .
Can we please remember that this sort of fetishism is so mind numbingly reductive .
Quite aside from the consideration that many other usually clothed body parts are available for momentary consideration in gang shower situations , there is so much else to see and enjoy even in fully clothed situations - eyes , smiles , skin , strength , graceful motion , the hair on the back of some hands , and all the wonderful suggestions that well fitted clothes can make when properly draped over variously healthy bodies .
Of course , if one is busy goosing one 's fear rush over all this stuff , engaging in behavior appropriate to the situations one finds oneself in can be difficult .
That is primarily the responsibility of the rushing party .
It is surely appropriate for the military 's training process to include lessons on appropriate behavior in these situations , the niceties of consent , a review of the mechanics of safer sex , and how to report actual violations ( instead of taking the situation into one 's own hands ) .
It is not that long ago that the training films covered how to behave in formal dining situations .
All of this goes pretty exactly to the underlying concern that the AFA has :
It will seriously reduce their constituency and their cash flow .
Posted by : Jonathan Justice | Feb 9 , 2010 11:06:53 PM
I was under the impression people took showers to clean themeselves .
I was also under the impression that , in the military , you do n't LINGER in the shower because other people are waiting to use it .
It 's insulting enough that these people believe ALL LGBT folk lack the same professionalism as heterosexuals .
But , here 's the real kicker : if your son or daughter signs up for the armed forces , there 's always a very good chance he or she will be shipped of to a country where they could be shot at .
Yet we 're not supposed to worry about that ?
" Oh , I 'm not worried about my son getting his head blown off .
I just do n't want someone staring at his ass for 30 seconds ! "

The AFA is run by a bunch of old , white men whose religious views obscure reality from them .
These people live in some other world than the rest of us and they cannot get used to the idea that ALL OF US have Constitutional rights , not just white religious old men .

We were tracking closely the story of the Russian power plant exploded and then was examined by experts , and tried to be repaired .
Then some estimates appeared that it may take up to ten years to get it back in full scale , and some doubted if it was worth at all .
And while these talks are going on , here is how it looks now after major frosts going on this winter it looks really interesting , like some kind of movie sets for you name it movie .
AVQ&A Welcome back to AVQ&A , where we throw out a question for discussion among the staff and readers .
Consider this a prompt to compare notes on your interface with pop culture , to reveal your embarrassing tastes and experiences .
Prev Next View All
What are your pop-culture rules ?
That is , the up - front guidelines that will prevent you from seeing / reading / listening to something , or that will guarantee that you ’ll see / read / listen to it even if reviews or word of mouth or past experience with the creators have been negative ?

Tasha Robinson
A little explanation on this one :
It comes out of a conversation from a party I attended a few weeks ago , where a friend of mine said she had a new rule regarding movies .
If someone “ comedically ” falls down in the trailer , she will not under any circumstances go see that movie .
It turned out that everyone else there had similar rules :
One friend will not see a film if “ Walking On Sunshine ” or “ I Feel Good ” are used in the trailer .
Other people said they would no longer see anything directed by Michael Bay , or anything featuring Woody Allen .
Other people revealed positive guidelines :
One said that as a rule , she never misses a period piece or costume drama .
Another will see anything with Adam Sandler in it .
Personally — like just about everyone on staff here — I do n’t always get to pick what I ’m going to go see or read or listen to .
Somebody has to bite the bullet and go see Tooth Fairy so the rest of our writers and readers do n’t have to .
But with that caveat , just going on personal preference …
I do n’t have a whole lot of hard - and - fast rules , but one is the “ fat - comedy rule . ”
If the trailer features someone in a fat suit , or someone playing the “ fatty fall down , make funny ” role , I ’m not interested .
( I ’ve still never seen a Chris Farley movie . )
On the positive side , if it features superheroes , I ’m generally there .
Someday someone ’s going to make a comedy about a fat , clumsy , unkempt superhero , and I ’m going to be mildly torn , but I ’m betting rule # 1 beats out rule # 2 .
Let ’s hope I never find out for sure .

Any artists that refer to their own work as “ dark ” immediately go bye - bye in my book .
Give me a break .
That ’s for everyone else to decide , not the creator .
It ’s a large part of my nearly lifelong aversion to Trent Reznor in all forms .
Then I saw him at the ’09 Sasquatch !
Festival and had my lights blown out .
( Still do n’t regret avoiding his albums , though . )
And — something my roommate and I agree on — animal reaction shots are also verboten .
Also , for most of the past decade , I have , on general principle , refused to listen to almost every new band with an animal in its name .
If you ’re a Wolf This or a That Bear or somehow otherwise belong in a menagerie , I steer clear .
Maybe it ’s because I have never liked Animal Collective , barring the one that samples the Grateful Dead , and tracks that have been remixed by Dam - Funk and Pantha Du Prince .
Maybe it ’s because so much of the bleh indie I ’ve encountered has doubled as a trip to the zoo ( or the Natural History Museum ) .
Either way , I prefer the company of humans .

I have a lot of pop-culture guidelines — do n’t expect much out of a remake of something less than 10 years old ; do n’t hang on past the second sequel ; do n’t trust anything that is specifically marketed to “ guys ” , and so on — but they ’ve all coughed up an exception or two , which means I ca n’t really call them rules .
And , in fact , I tend to bristle at anything that does resemble such a rule , simply because whenever one is invoked , my mind almost immediately starts seeking an exception .
So the only thing I could really cite here , and this is more a commentary on my own sense of intellectual inferiority than the quality of the work , is stick to your grade level .
Although there have been exceptions here as well — I ’ve not encountered many movies , TV shows , or books aimed primarily at children that are worth my time , but there have been enough that I ca n’t call it an ironclad rule — even when I enjoy it , I feel like I ’ve been demoted .
Sure , I may have lost my sense of childlike wonder , but since that often translates to “ childlike ability to be amazed and astounded by things that are really stupid , ” I ’m not that sorry to see it go .

My wife lives by something she calls simply “ The Robin Williams Rule , ” inspired by a traumatic period in which she was compelled to watch Patch Adams twice in as many weeks .
In short , if Robin Williams is in it , she ’s not watching it .
I ’ve argued that means she ’s missed out on some pretty terrific movies , like The World According To Garp , The Fisher King , and to a lesser extent , Insomnia , World ’s Greatest Dad and others .
Then I look back at the movies she ’s dodged thanks to this simple rule , and I ca n’t argue with it too vehemently .
Me ?
I live by no rules , baby .
I try to leave myself open to surprises .

I pretty much wo n’t see horror movies just because I ’m a pussy .
I ’d much rather hear about what goes on in them ( I spent a nice afternoon recently Googling Human Centipede ) , so I can satisfy my curiosity without having the mental images seared into my brain for nightmare fodder .

Otherwise , I proposed a list for the Inventory book titled something like “ Least Essential Jessicas . ”
Basically , I have a theory that the most superfluous people in Hollywood tend to be named Jessica or Jennifer — people who maybe can do an okay job in a film , but really are n’t so great that the role could n’t be filled by anyone else .
Of course , these women also tend to be featured most frequently on magazine covers , so due to the promise of so - so acting and general oversaturation factor , odds are if your movie stars someone with the last name Alba , Garner , Simpson , Biel , Aniston , Lopez , or Love Hewitt , odds are I wo n't be seeing it .
Genevieve Koski
I ’m with you on horror movies , Claire .
It takes a LOT of convincing to get me to see a horror movie , and anyone who does get me to sit down for one does so with the understanding that I will spend most of the movie whimpering and hiding my face under my shirt .
But it is n’t necessarily the gore or the disturbing images that bother me — it ’s being startled .
If I know a movie ’s going to deploy tactics like sudden loud noises and mirror scares — which pretty much all modern horror films do — I officially have zero interest .

Another rule I ’ve just recently instated for myself — and this took some soul - searching — I ’m done with modern war movies .
I realized this after watching The Hurt Locker , which I recognized as an accomplished , potentially captivating film that I felt absolutely no connection to whatsoever .
For some reason , the setting and imagery of modern warfare leave me absolutely cold , and prevent me from engaging with a movie the way I like to .
( You can extrapolate any bleeding - heart peacenik tendencies you wish from this , but if there is an ethical basis to these feelings , it ’s subconscious . )
I felt similarly about Jarhead and Generation Kill , which I never managed to like as much as I wanted to .
There ’s a little more wiggle room when it comes to historical war films and hypothetical future wars — I love a good space battle — but I still tread carefully .
On the opposite end of the spectrum :
If a movie / television show includes an uplifting dance or musical sequence , no matter how cheesy — actually , the cheesier the better — I ’m there .
What can I say , deep down , I ’m a big ol ’ cornball .

I have a similar rule to Keith ’s wife ’s , though mine is for model - turned - actress Milla Jovovich .
If she ’s starring in a movie , there ’s a 99 percent chance it ’s terrible .
( She inspired an idea I had for a companion piece to a list from our Inventory book , “ Do n’t Just Say Urkel : 25 sure signs that a sitcom is terrible . ” )
It ’s one of my longest running pop-culture guidelines , as I conceived it in 1997 after wasting a buck and two hours of my life seeing The Fifth Element in a dollar theater .
As a rule , it ’s easy to follow , as Jovovich has pretty much never been in a movie I wanted to see anyway .
“ But Kyle , ” you say , “ you ’re a huge fan of Dazed And Confused ! ” Jovovich had , what , three lines in that whole movie ?
Does n’t count .
Her entire role came down to looking pretty and acting high .
( Mission accomplished ! )
When she steps beyond that and attempts to carry a movie ?
Yikes .
Sam Adams
You say Milla Jovovich , I say Sam Rockwell .
( Also A Perfect Getaway , which kicks some serious ass . )
Nothing against the guy ’s talent , mind you , just his taste , which tends towards the insufferably quirk - ridden and the stylistically inert .
After suffering through Choke , Snow Angels , Joshua , and The Hitchhiker ’s Guide To The Galaxy , to name just a few on an ignominious list that goes back to the odious Box Of Moonlight , I decided a couple of Sundances past to cross every movie with the faintest hint of Rockwell off my schedule .
A few days later , I started hearing the buzz about Moon , and immediately wondered if my crackpot system had failed me .
But sure enough , when I finally got the chance to see the film , it left me colder than the void of space .
No system is perfect , especially one that might cause you to miss The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford , or even my beloved Charlie ’s Angels .
So perhaps it ’s less an arbitrary pop-culture rule than an arbitrary pop-culture guideline .

I have not , and will not , ever buy a book with an Oprah ’s Book Club seal .
And I ca n’t say there ’s any rock - solid logic behind this quirk .
I do n’t mind Oprah per se , and I am appreciative she wields her scepter in an effort to encourage people to read .
I think it has something to do with how I view her flock ( probably unfairly ) , but I imagine all of them as dead - eyed adherents refusing to seek out anything on their own .
And that bugs me .
I have actually read books featured in The Big O ’s coffee klatch :
As I Lay Dying is in my all - time top five , I loved The Corrections , and Gabriel García Márquez has written some pretty decent stuff .
But when I see that stamp of authenticity , it ’s like a force field that wo n’t allow me to even touch a book it shills for .
Not coincidentally , this issue has led to some stupid time - wasting on my part — in particular , the day I spent hours traveling Madison from stem to stern looking for an unsullied copy of The Road .
Jason Heller
I know this is rapidly becoming a moot point , seeing as how — according to all those technophiles that infest the Internet — print media is going the way of the wax cylinder .
( Speaking of which :
You should totally check out my wax - cylinder collection sometime .
You have n’t heard Zeppelin IV in its true glory until you ’ve cranked it on carnauba . )
But no matter how often I pick them up and stroke them lovingly in the hidden corners of my local bookstore , I just cannot bring myself to purchase new hardcover books .
Partly it ’s the price — $ 25 for a freakin’ book ?
You ’d think trees are scarce or something !— but I also ca n’t stand the fact that a ) dust jackets , as lovely as they can be , always slip off in my hands and get ripped way too easily , and b ) hardcovers are needlessly heavy and portability - challenged , especially if I ’m already hauling a laptop around in my bag .
But that preference for paperbacks means I ’m way behind on a shitload of recent books I ’m absolutely dying to read , including China Miéville ’s The City And The City and Paolo Bacigalupi ’s hotly tipped debut , The Windup Girl , simply because I do n’t like the heft , epidermis , or price tag of hardcovers .
Luckily , some publishers — including Orbit , one of my favorite purveyors of fantasy and science fiction — likes to release books directly to trade paperback , my format of choice .
Of course , according to the Boing Boing set , we ’ll soon be reading novels exclusively via intravenous injection , so what the fuck does it even matter ?

My one - line bio in our book , Inventory : 16 Films Featuring Manic Pixie Dream Girls , 10 Great Songs Nearly Ruined By Saxophone , And 100 More Obsessively Specific Pop -Culture Lists ( still available for purchase !
makes a great gift ! ) , covered my semi-arbitrary pop-culture rule , but I ’ll restate .
I have a serious aversion to movies about dancing and movies about terminal illness .
The former stems mostly , I think , from being bored by formula .
Every movie about dancing ( not all movies featuring dancing , but those specifically about it ) features a big dance number at the end , which is supposed to inspire me , even though I generally have no idea why this particular dance is better than any other .
( It should be noted that I enjoyed the movie Honey , but only because it ’s so genuinely terrible and unintentionally hilarious . )
With regards to movies about terminal illness , they ’re usually treacly and emotionally dishonest , do n’t you find ?
Magnolia , which I love , offers something of an exception , but the terminal - illness bit is just part of a larger whole .
On the positive side of arbitrariness , I will see pretty much any big - budget science - fiction movie , regardless of how crappy it looks .

I do n’t have semi-arbitrary pop-culture rules so much as I have preferences .
I feel like an arts writer should be open to everything , but given my druthers , I would rather not see a costume drama , especially about a real - life monarch or an uplifting film about mental illness or an independent film with a protagonist who aspires to be a writer .
That , to me , represents the epitome of lazy writing .
That ’s taking the whole “ write what you know ” thing a little too far .
Other films I tend to avoid : dramedies in which white people bond by dancing to Motown songs , G- rated family comedies starring Martin Lawrence , torture porn , or anything involving rape .

If an actor / actress in a new TV show or movie is in some other show that I love , then there ’s no chance I will not check it out .
That ’s how I wound up watching a handful of episodes of that terrible A&E show The Cleaner a few years ago : Boomer from Battlestar Galactica was in it .
And X - Men Origins : Wolverine ?
Thank goodness for Tim Riggins from Friday Night Lights .
I also saw every episode of Sit Down , Shut Up , no matter how bad it got , because I was pining so hard for the return of Arrested Development , and the majority of its cast voiced the roles .
God forbid anyone from The Wire ever does a terrible horror movie about a fetus .
( Oh wait , The Unborn : Seen ! )
As for what I wo n’t see , I tend to disregard anything with a trailer that utilizes the record - scratching sound , like “ Oh no he di - n’t ! ”
It ’s just such a device at this point , it ’s going to soil my experience of the movie .
I also hate when trailers / posters tell me absolutely nothing about the movie .
What was Extraordinary Measures about , other than Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford walking down hallways and possibly writing things on chalkboards ?
It ’s just marketing , but sometimes that ’s all films are , and if they ca n’t do that well , I ’m not gonna take part .

I was n’t going to participate in this one , because I literally could n’t think of anything : I ’m too forgiving and too willing to watch everything at least once .
But I realized when reading this news item ( about Fox aiming to get Steven Spielberg on board for a TV series about a family that time travels to the prehistoric ) that I will see or read literally anything featuring dinosaurs .
The Jurassic Park trilogy ?
Own all three .
Fragment , that weird book that came out last year about a secluded island where evolution had continued separate from our track for 500 million years ?
Read it and mostly enjoyed it , in spite of the intense shame I felt while reading it .
And I ’ve seen so many crazy stop- motion things purporting to show cavemen fighting dinosaurs that I ’m sure I ’ve forgotten most of them .
It probably stems back to being a 4 - year - old and thinking dinosaurs were the coolest thing ever ( and having a friend who ’s gone on to be a highly respected paleontologist ) , but something about giant reptiles just works for me .
This and my love for time - travel stories , of course , blended into me seeing the absolutely awful A Sound Of Thunder , so this does n’t always work out , but for the most part , if it ’s got dinosaurs , I ’m there .
( CNN ) -- Sgt. Doraliza Velez - Collazo used to sleep with the lights on , haunted by nightmares since suffering a traumatic brain injury in Iraq .
Severe depression kept her inside her small rented room in Southern California most days .
But just before the holidays , a 10 - pound ball of fur came into her life and quickly began to turn it around .
Lupita , a 3 - year - old Chihuahua that had been abandoned at a Los Angeles County shelter , was placed with Velez - Collazo with the help of Pets for Vets , a nonprofit organization .
" I used to not get out of the house at all , " said Velez - Collazo , 37 , whose 12 years as an Army combat battlefield nurse included deployments to Iraq and Kuwait .
" Now I have to take her out .
I get out of bed and put on some clothes . "
That motivation to participate in normal daily activities is the goal of Pets for Vets , founded in 2008 by 27 - year - old animal trainer Clarissa Black .
The Los Angeles - based program matches homeless pets that may otherwise be euthanized with veterans suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder , traumatic brain injury and other ailments from their time in a war zone .
" A lot of times , these veterans who are coming home feel abandoned , and they have a difficult time adjusting to civilian life , " Black said .
" A lot of them tell me that they would just like someone to say thank you .
Pets for Vets is that way to say thank you .
Both [ the veteran and the pet ] have been through traumatic events , and together they can help each other heal . "
Dave Sharpe , 31 , a former senior airman in the U.S. Air Force , heads a similar program in the Washington , D.C. , area .
Sharpe , who suffers from PTSD , started Pets2 Vets after he experienced the healing benefits of his own dog , Cheyenne .
Shortly after he got Cheyenne as a puppy , she witnessed one of his violent outbursts that began after he returned from missions in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan during Operation Enduring Freedom .
" Out of the corner of my eye ... I just saw this pit bull puppy wagging her tail and looking at me like , ' Dad , what are you doing ? ' " Sharpe recalled .
" I picked her up and took her to my bed , and I just told her everything that I went through , and she just sat there licking the tears off my face , and she did n't say a word .
" Right there , I immediately felt at peace with myself , " Sharpe said .
A 2004 Pentagon study found that one in six veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from PTSD , depression or anxiety .
A 2008 study by RAND Corp . put the number at nearly 20 percent , or one in five returning war veterans .
Research has shown that companion animals -- dogs in particular -- help lower blood pressure and heart rates in their owners , according to CNN 's mental health expert Dr. Charles Raison , an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University .
" [ Dogs ] actually have a stress - busting effect , " Raison said , adding there is evidence that dogs are useful for many types of people , including senior citizens , mental health patients and prison inmates .
That bond began more than 10,000 years ago , Raison said , calling dogs the first domesticated animal -- even before cows .
" Because of that , there 's a great deal of warmth and connection between dogs and humans , " he said .
The Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Long Beach , California , recognizes that connection and has referred some of its patients to Pets for Vets .
" If you look at health care , what we tend to do here is being exclusive to fixing a body , " said Richard Beam , public affairs officer for VA Long Beach .
" But we do n't necessarily consider what it is that makes a person whole .
By making them whole , we 're not only healing them physically , but we 're also looking for what makes them thrive for life , what makes them want to be engaged in part of society . "
Beam says that in many cases , the answer to that question is pets .
" We 've seen phenomenal changes in patients even with just 15 minutes with a dog , " he said .
Black made her first pet-vet match in June and has since made seven other successful placements -- all dogs so far , though she 's searching for a cat and a snake for two Pets for Vets hopefuls .
Sharpe 's program has brought about the adoptions of seven dogs since it began bringing veterans to local shelters and rescue groups in July .
Both groups are helping a wide range of veterans , from those who served in Vietnam and the Bosnia conflict to 1991 's Desert Storm and the recent war on terror .
What makes Black 's program unique is her hands - on approach .
Interested veterans interview with Black to determine what kind of pet would fit their needs and lifestyles .
Once she finds a pet that matches that description , she brings it to her home , where she trains it in basic obedience and socializes it with other animals .
Black also helps dogs get used to the presence of wheelchairs or crutches and teaches them to safely hop into laps .
And for vets with brain injuries or PTSD , dogs are taught to recognize the triggers of side effects or panic attacks so they can snuggle or nudge the person during those episodes .
" We find that this kind of training helps ensure that the pet and vet are lifelong companions , " Black said .
" It 's less stress , and it relieves the burden and sets both the dog and vet up for success . "
Once the pet is ready , Pets for Vets provides all of the necessary equipment for the new owner -- leashes , collars , food and water bowls , dog crates and so on .
Sharpe 's Pets2 Vets offers a similar service .
The goal , Black and Sharpe say , is to provide a permanent home and a second chance for four - legged friends and veterans alike .
" I really do believe that companion animals are the life - saving therapy many veterans need , " Black said .
Black , who is hoping to expand Pets for Vets beyond the Los Angeles area , says she sees immediate results from the program .
" [ The veterans ] visibly relax and appear less anxious , " she said of those first meetings between pet and veteran
Sharpe agrees , saying veterans who come into a local shelter for the first time are closed off from those around them , but quickly open up in the presence of a dog .
The results are even more noticeable once the pairs have spent some significant time together at home , Black says .
" [ The veterans ] are happier and more comfortable in their day - to - day lives , " she said .
" They do n't mention as many readjustment annoyances or concerns [ and ] are able to focus on the care and joy of their dogs rather than on the negative things in their lives . "
A month after Lupita came into Velez - Collazo 's life , she 's starting to turn her lights off at night .
" I kind of hold on to her little paw , listening to her breathing , and she looks at me , licking my hand , like , ' You 're going to be OK , Mom . ' "

Remember the 100 hours of combat that made up the first Gulf War , the mere weeks it took for Kabul to fall in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan , or the " shock and awe " wave of air attacks that led off the 2003 invasion of Iraq , followed by the 20 - day blitzkrieg - like campaign that left American troops occupying Baghdad ?
Those were the days when , as retired lieutenant colonel and TomDispatch regular William Astore reminds us , the civilians in the Bush Pentagon thought they were the masters of lightning war .
Now , skip almost seven years , and in Afghanistan the U.S. military has just launched the largest campaign since the invasion of 2001 .
Fifteen thousand U.S. , British , and Afghan troops have been dispatched to take Marja , a single , modest - sized , Taliban - controlled city of 80,000 in one of more than 700 districts in Afghanistan , many under some degree of Taliban control or influence .
How the time frame for success has changed .
As the Americans went in , Marine Commander Brigadier General Larry Nicholson was already warning that it might take up to 30 days , longer than it took to capture Baghdad , just to clear Marja of hidden explosives and , despite overwhelming power arrayed against perhaps a few hundred Taliban guerrillas , the fighting in the town has gone on relatively steadily for days .
What , in 1991 , 2001 , and 2003 was the swift claim of total victory is now a long - haul campaign , according to American military sources , to blunt Taliban success ( or , as Secretary of Defense Robert Gates put it , to " degrade the capability of the Taliban " ) and so , evidently , bring the enemy in a chastened state to the negotiating table before an American drawdown begins .
As for timelines , U.S. officials now talk about the combat portion of the Marja campaign being but the beginning of a full - scale , militarized version of nation - building on a local level .
Think of it as city - or district - building , and the process includes ( we ’re told by the U.S. war commander with some pride ) the unpacking of an imported " government in a box " — the governing and security forces of Hamid Karzai ’s central government — and the launching of a well - funded , local reconstruction program to win " hearts and minds . "
As a result , the test of success is now considered to be months down the line , and that ’s if the Marja campaign does n’t turn out to be a classic counterinsurgency quagmire .
The story of how Pentagon strategists and the U.S. military went from being the masters of war to a force of would - be long - haul city - builders in the backlands of Afghanistan is a strange one indeed , made stranger yet by the bizarre detour they took through modern German military lore .

American Blitzkrieg
Loving the German War Machine to Death
By William J. Astore
" Why do people have a fixation with the German military when they have n’t won a war since 1871 ? " — Tom Clancy
I ’ve always been interested in the German military , especially the Wehrmacht of World War II .
As a young boy , I recall building many models , not just German Panther and Tiger tanks , but famous Luftwaffe planes as well .
True , I built American tanks and planes , Shermans and Thunderbolts and Mustangs , but the German models always seemed " cooler , " a little more exotic , a little more predatory .
And the German military , to my adolescent imagination , seemed admirably tough and aggressive : hard - fighting , thoroughly professional , hanging on against long odds , especially against the same hordes of " godless communists " that I knew we Americans were then facing down in the Cold War .
Later , of course , a little knowledge about the nightmare of Nazism and the Holocaust went a long way toward destroying my admiration for the Wehrmacht , but — to be completely honest — a residue of grudging respect still survives : I no longer have my models , but I still have many of the Ballantine illustrated war books I bought as a young boy for a buck or two , and which often celebrated the achievements of the German military , with titles like Panzer Division , or Afrika Korps , or even Waffen SS .
As the Bible says , we are meant to put aside childish things as we grow to adulthood , and an uninformed fascination with the militaria and regalia of the Third Reich was certainly one of these .
But when I entered Air Force ROTC in 1981 , and later on active duty in 1985 , I was surprised , even pleased , to discover that so many members of the U.S. military shared my interest in the German military .
To cite just one example , as a cadet at Field Training in 1983 ( and later at Squadron Officer School in 1992 ) , I participated in what was known as " Project X . "
As cadets , we came to know of it in whispers : " Tomorrow we ’re doing ‘ Project X ’ : It ’s really tough … "
A problem - solving leadership exercise , Project X consisted of several scenarios and associated tasks .
Working in small groups , you were expected to solve these while working against the clock .
What made the project exciting and more than busy - work , like the endless marching or shining of shoes or waxing of floors , was that it was based on German methods of developing and instilling small - unit leadership , teamwork , and adaptability .
If it worked for the Germans , the " finest soldiers in the world " during World War II , it was good enough for us , or so most of us concluded ( including me ) .
Project X was just one rather routine manifestation of the American military ’s fascination with German methods and the German military mystique .
As I began teaching military history to cadets at the Air Force Academy in 1990 , I quickly became familiar with a flourishing " Cult of Clausewitz . "
So ubiquitous was Carl von Clausewitz and his book On War that it seemed as if we Americans had never produced our own military theorists .
I grew familiar with the way Auftragstaktik ( the idea of maximizing flexibility and initiative at the lowest tactical levels ) was regularly extolled .
So prevalent did Clausewitz and Auftragstaktikbecome that , in the 1980s and 1990s , American military thinking seemed reducible to the idea that " war is a continuation of politics " and a belief that victory went to the side that empowered its " strategic corporals . "
War as a Creative Act
The American military ’s fascination with German military methods and modes of thinking raises many questions .
In retrospect , what disturbs me most is that the military swallowed the Clausewitzian / German notion of war as a dialectical or creative art , one in which well - trained and highly - motivated leaders can impose their will on events .
In this notional construct , war became not destructive , but constructive .
It became not the last resort of kings , but the preferred recourse of " creative " warlords who demonstrated their mastery of it by cultivating such qualities as flexibility , adaptability , and quickness .
One aimed to get inside the enemy ’s " decision cycle , " the so - called OODA loop — the Air Force ’s version of Auftragstaktik — while at the same time cultivating a " warrior ethos " within a tight - knit professional army that was to stand above , and also separate from , ordinary citizens .
This idolization of the German military was a telling manifestation of a growing militarism within an American society which remained remarkably oblivious to the slow strangulation of its citizen - soldier ideal .
At the same time , the American military began to glorify a new generation of warrior - leaders by a selective reading of its past .
Old " Blood and Guts " himself , the warrior - leader George S. Patton — the commander as artist - creator - genius — was celebrated ; Omar N. Bradley — the bespectacled GI general and reluctant soldier - citizen — was neglected .
Not coincidentally , a new vision of the battlefield emerged in which the U.S. military aimed , without the slightest sense of irony , for " total situational awareness " and " full spectrum dominance , " goals that , if attained , promised commanders the almost god - like ability to master the " storm of steel , " to calm the waves , to command the air .
In the process , any sense of war as thoroughly unpredictable and enormously wasteful was lost .
In this infatuation with German military prowess , which the political scientist John Mearsheimer memorably described as " Wehrmacht penis envy , " we celebrated our ability to Blitzkrieg our enemies — which promised rapid , decisive victories that would be largely bloodless ( at least for us ) .
In 1991 , a decisively quick victory in the Desert Storm campaign of the first Gulf War was the proof , or so it seemed then , that a successful " revolution in military affairs , " or RMA in military parlance , was underway .
Forgotten , however , was this : the German Blitzkrieg of World War II ended with Germany ’s " third empire " thoroughly thrashed by opponents who continued to fight even when the odds seemed longest .
What a remarkable , not to say bizarre , turnabout !
The army and country the U.S. had soundly beaten in two world wars ( with a lot of help from allies , including , of course , those godless communists of the Soviet Union in the second one ) had become a beacon for the U.S. military after Vietnam .
To use a sports analogy , it was as if a Major League Baseball franchise , in seeking to win the World Series , decided to model itself not on the New York Yankees but rather on the Chicago Cubs .
The New Masters of Blitzkrieg
Busts of Clausewitz reside in places of honor today at both the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks , Pennsylvania , and the National War College in Washington , D.C. Clausewitz was a complex writer , and his vision of war was both dense and rich , defying easy simplification .
But that has n’t stopped the U.S. military from simplifying him .
Ask the average officer about Clausewitz , and he ’ll mention " war as the continuation of politics " and maybe something about " the fog and friction of war " — and that ’s about it .
What ’s really meant by this rendition of Clausewitz for Dummies is that , though warfare may seem extreme , it ’s really a perfectly sensible form of violent political discourse between nation - states .
Such an officer may grudgingly admit that , thanks to fog and friction , " no plan survives contact with the enemy . "
What he ’s secretly thinking , however , is that it wo n’t matter at all , not given the U.S. military ’s " mastery " of Auftragstaktik , achieved in part through next - generation weaponry that provides both " total situational awareness " and a decisive , war - winning edge .
No wonder that George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , and Donald Rumsfeld were so eager to go to war in Iraq in 2003 .
They saw themselves as the new masters of Blitzkrieg , the new warlords ( or " Vulcans " to use a term popular back then ) , the inheritors of the best methods of German military efficiency .
This belief , this faith , in German - style total victory through relentless military proficiency is best captured in Max Boot ’s gushing tribute to the U.S. military , published soon after Bush ’s self - congratulatory and self - adulatory " Mission Accomplished " speech in May 2003 .
For Boot , America ’s victory in Iraq had to " rank as one of the signal achievements in military history . "
In his words :
" Previously , the gold standard of operational excellence had been the German blitzkrieg through the Low Countries and France in 1940 .
The Germans managed to conquer France , the Netherlands , and Belgium in just 44 days , at a cost of ‘ only ’ 27,000 dead soldiers .
The United States and Britain took just 26 days to conquer Iraq ( a country 80 percent of the size of France ) , at a cost of 161 dead , making fabled generals such as Erwin Rommel and Heinz Guderian seem positively incompetent by comparison . "
How likely is it that future military historians will celebrate General Tommy Franks and elevate him above the " incompetent " Rommel and Guderian ?
Such praise , even then , was more than fatuous .
It was absurd .
Throughout our history , many Americans , especially frontline combat veterans , have known the hell of real war .
It ’s one big reason why , historically speaking , we ’ve traditionally been reluctant to keep a large standing military .
But the Cold War , containment , and our own fetishizing of the German Wehrmacht changed everything .
We began to see war not as a human - made disaster but as a creative science and art .
We began to seek " force multipliers " and total victory achieved through an almost Prussian mania for military excellence .
Reeling from a seemingly inexplicable and unimaginable defeat in Vietnam , the officer corps used Clausewitz to crawl out of its collective fog .
By reading him selectively and reaffirming our own faith in military professionalism and precision weaponry , we tricked ourselves into believing that we had attained mastery over warfare .
We believed we had tamed the dogs of war ; we believed we had conquered Bellona , that we could make the goddess of war do our bidding .
We forgot that Clausewitz compared war not only to politics but to a game of cards .
Call it the ultimate high - stakes poker match .
Even the player with the best cards , the highest stack of chips , does n’t always win .
Guile and endurance matter .
So too does nerve , even luck .
And having a home - table advantage does n’t hurt either .
None of that seemed to matter to a U.S. military that aped the German military , while over - hyping its abilities and successes .
The result ?
A so - called " new American way of war " that was simply a desiccated version of the old German one , which had produced nothing but catastrophic defeat for Germany in both 1918 and 1945 — and disaster for Europe as well .
Just Ask the Germans
Precisely because that disaster did not befall us , precisely because we emerged triumphant from two world wars , we became both too enamored with the decisiveness of war , and too dismissive of our own unique strength .
For our strength was not military élan or cutting - edge weaponry or tactical finesse ( these were German " strengths " ) , but rather the dedication , the generosity , even the occasional ineptitude , of our citizen - soldiers .
Their spirit was unbreakable precisely because they — a truly democratic citizen army — were dedicated to defeating a repellently evil empire that reveled fanatically in its own combat vigor .
Looking back on my youthful infatuation with the German Wehrmacht , I recognize a boy ’s misguided enthusiasm for military hardness and toughness .
I recognize as well the seductiveness of reducing the chaos of war to " shock and awe " Blitzkrieg and warrior empowerment .
What amazes me , however , is how this astonishingly selective and adolescent view of war — with its fetish for lightning results , achieved by elevating and empowering a new generation of warlords , warriors , and advanced weaponry — came to dominate mainstream American military thinking after the frustrations of Vietnam .
Unlike a devastated and demoralized Germany after its defeats , we decided not to devalue war as an instrument of policy after our defeat , but rather to embrace it .
Clasping Clausewitz to our collective breasts , we marched forward seeking new decisive victories .
Yet , like our role models the Germans of World War II , we found victory to be both elusive and illusive .
So , I have a message for my younger self : put aside those menacing models of German tanks and planes .
Forget those glowing accounts of Rommel and his Afrika Korps .
Dismiss Blitzkrieg from your childish mind .
There is no lightning war , America .
There never was .
And if you wo n’t take my word for it , just ask the Germans .

" Only in Washington , " said Rep. Mike Pence , " can you spend a trillion dollars and say you ’re gonna save the taxpayers ' money . ”
And only in Washington can such willful obtuseness be considered a professional attribute .
You can believe that the savings in the Democratic plan will work as CBO thinks they will work , or you can disagree with that .
But let 's not pretend there 's something complicated about the theory of spending money and saving money at the same time .
Let 's say I own a graphics design firm .
But all our computers are very old .
A lot of time is wasted waiting for Adobe Photoshop to load and compute .
So I decide to upgrade all of the computers .
Costs a lot of money .
But since my designers can now do more projects in a day , my firm is actually making more money .
So yes , I can spend money and increase my bottom line at the same time .
Investing in order to secure efficiencies is not a new concept .
The health - care example is a bit more complicated because the thing we are spending money on ( coverage ) is not the thing that 's saving us money .
But it 's not that much more complicated .
Let 's say I want to hire new people at my graphics design firm .
But first I need to make room in the budget .
So I move our offices to a cheaper area of town , I stop providing free lunch for the staff , I raise prices slightly and I implement a variety of painful managerial changes that substantially streamline our operations .
This not only pays for the new hires , but saves money above and beyond that .
No one would argue that these hypotheticals are impossible .
Or , if they did , they would be out of touch with basic economic concepts to a truly unseemly degree .
But that 's what Pence is implying above .
Presumably , he 's just misleading his audience because it 's easier to play to ignorance than to explain his actual critique of the bill .
But that 's not a good thing either .

LXer Feature : 24 - Mar -2010
Whether you want to run the newest and safest version of Firefox or you want to test a new Alpha , it might happen the package manager of your Linux distribution does n't include the version you want .
In this article we 'll look at ways to install the newest version beyond the package manager , and even better : Running multiple Firefox versions on the same system - even at the same time !
Firefox 3.6.2
March 23rd , the German government project Bürger - CERT warned against using Firefox versions before 3.6.2 .
Though I was not sure if this vulnerability also applies to Linux versions of Firefox , I decided to update as quickly as possible .
For Windows users , it 's easy : Firefox tells them there 's a new version , Mozilla did the Quality & Assurance testing of the new version , so they can click on ' Update available ' and they 're up to date and less prone to exploits .
For Linux users however things are not so easy .
They have to rely on their distribution for the Q&A , and they will have to wait for the package maintainers to include the newest version of the browser .
I use Gentoo , and there 's no company behind it .
Though it has a pretty big community , it is not nearly as big as the Debian community .
As a result of this Gentoo is n't normally the first distribution to ship the newest versions of software .
As a result , 3.6.2 was not yet available for Gentoo , though it was recommended by Mozilla .
If you want to install the newest pre-compiled version anyway there are roughly speaking three manners to do it :
The good , the bad and the ugly ..
Let 's start with ' the good ' way .
That 's waiting for the newest version to appear in your software repository .
If not , your distribution will have guidelines how to ask for it .
For Gentoo , this means filing a bug report and kindly asking if someone can make a ' recipe ' ( in Gentoo terms : ebuild ) for the newest package .
For other distributions , this means someone will have to compile and ' package ' the result and submit it .
However , Gentoo package maintainers are volunteers who have a life beyond Gentoo , and one thing they do n't like is being bugged about a new version several times every three seconds after a new minor version is out .
Normally , the package maintainers will know a new version is out before most users do anyway .
So let 's progress to the bad way :
About the same as the Windows way , but worse .
Mozilla provides pre-built binaries on their website .
Someone might download these , unzip and run them .
Probably , you 're probably going to be OK if you do this .
However , this means ' bypassing ' your package manager and this may lead to unexpected results :
Dependencies might not be met , or the binary Mozilla provided may not be aware of quirks specific to the distribution you 're using .
Also , un-installing might be a problem .
Therefore I decided to use the ugly way :
That 's providing your own recipe or package .
In Gentoo chances are big this is really easy , probably much easier than for any other distro as I will show .
What you 're basically doing is , take an ' old ' recipe and just change version numbers in the file name .
That 's all it takes to make a new ebuild !
After that Gentoo's package manager ' portage ' is ready to install it .
Of course there 's no guarantee this will work , and you 're on your own for supporting this dirty hack .
Nonetheless , it worked flawlessly in this case .
Here 's how you do it : # cd /usr / portage/www-client/firefox-bin
This is where the recipes for ' pre - compiled Firefox ' live .
Note the recipes of ' compile it yourself '
Firefox are in www - client / mozilla - firefox .
For the following steps , be sure you 're root , or use sudo for the following steps .
Now copy : # cp firefox - bin-3.6-r1.ebuild firefox - bin-3.6.2.ebuild
Note for future reference : firefox - bin- 3.6- r1.ebuild is the existing recipe , and 3.6.2 the one that did n't exist yet .
When ' ebuilding ' portage , it will look at the file name to decide which version number it should download .
However it also does file fingerprint checking : it checks the files to download against given hashes .
But it does n't know about the 3.6.2 files yet so it does n't have the right fingerprints .
The following is at your own risk , as you 're going to create your own fingerprints and _you_ are the one going to say the downloaded files are trustworthy : #ebuild firefox - bin - 3.6.2 digest
This will download all files , assume whatever is downloaded is the right thing and add fingerprints to the fingerprint - file , the one called ' Manifest ' .
Now we 're ready to install !
As time of this writing , the existing 3.6 - r1 is still not deemed stable .
That 's to say , the package maintainers are not sure if it 's stable yet .
This is comparable to the ' testing ' branche other distributions use , and in Gentoo it 's called ' keyworded ' .
By default , portage does n't install ' keyworded ' packages , so we have to inform portage it 's ok .
One way to do this is : # echo =www-client/firefox-bin-3.6 * ~x86 >>
/etc/portage/package.keywords
Now you can proceed with # emerge - p firefox - bin as usual , and if it suggests to install 3.6.2 as we wanted , you 're ready to go and remove the ' - p ' ( pretend ) and portage will install 3.6.2 .
When done , be sure to run Firefox - bin and not just ' firefox ' , as ' firefox ' will refer to the ' compile yourself ' www - client / mozilla - firefox and both can be installed at the same time using different versions on Gentoo .
Firefox 3.7-alpha4
Then , we proceed with Firefox 3.7 - alpha4 .
Please do n't run this version before you have read the following paragraph about " Multiple versions " !
Otherwise you might screw your existing Firefox profile , so you 're warned !
It 's a good idea to back up your ~/.mozilla directory before proceeding .
I proceed using the ' bad ' way .
Installing this one is pretty easy : Download your zipped archive from Mozilla .
I chose firefox - 3.7a4pre.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2 .
Move it to some dir where it can't cause harm , in my case it 's ~/sys. unzip it : tar - xvjf firefox - 3.7a4pre.en-US.linux-i686.tar.bz2
You can delete the archive file if you want , and rename the resulting directory to Firefox - 3.7 if you like claritiy .
Then , you can simply cd to Firefox - 3.7 , and there 's your binary !
Please note , it 's probably not in your $ PATH ( it should n't be ! ) , the directories where your system looks if you want to start some command .
So , to run this version , you have to manually cd to the directory where you unzipped 3.7 and manually run ./ firefox .
Note this ' tree ' is n't " installed " on your system - which makes this solution only ' halve bad ' - it can be considered a portable version of Firefox .
That 's why it 's easy to remove .
Say I wanted to remove this Firefox 3.7 , all I would have to do is : rm - rf ~/sys / firefox - 3.7
Now , let 's run our new version , but not before we give it its own profile !
Multiple versions Now , besides 3.6.2 installed in the first paragraph , we 're going to run 3.7 a4 , the newest alpha at times of this writing .
To do this , we need multiple profiles to make sure a 3.6 profile wo n't crash 3.7 and the other way around .
Also , as 3.7 is considered ' Alpha ' it should n't touch our ' production ' profile for 3.6 .
Here 's how to proceed :
In a console , run ( as your normal user ) : $ firefox - bin - Profile Manager
Now a window will open listing your available profiles .
In my case the default profile is named " 71vcz8af.default " .
I rename that one to " 3.6 " .
Then I say : Create profile , and a wizard will make a new profile for me .
You can give your new profile a name , in my case I call the new one : " 3.7 " .
However , I do n't want it to be populated by FF 3.6 , so instead of " Start Firefox " I choose " Exit " .
We now have our profiles in place , and it's time to consider the - no - remote option .
When you or some other application ( many do ! ) run ' firefox URL ' from the command line , firefox would normally look to see if there 's already an open window of Firefox .
But we do n't want 3.6 and 3.7a to interact , so whenever we start one of the two , we run ' firefox - bin - no - remote ' .
If you start Firefox with this option , it will start a new instance of Firefox instead of adding a tab to the current open Firefox window .
Now , we have to make sure 3.6 starts with the old profile .
I use WindowMaker as my desktop environment , so I map my Firefox shortcut key / start menu entry to " /usr/bin/firefox - bin - P 3.6 - no- remote ' .
The /usr / bin part is the part which makes sure my ' global ' system Firefox is started ( the one that 's installed ) , and the " - P 3.6 " part is the part which makes sure the 3.6 profile is used .
Now if I simultaneously wanted to run 3.7 , here 's how to do it : $ cd ~/sys/firefox - 3.7
$ ./ firefox -P 3.7 - no-remote
Here the ./ part is what makes sure I 'm running the executable in this directory , and not from $ PATH , which would normally default to /usr / bin / firefox - and that might be another version .
The " - P 3.7 " part , as you might have guessed , makes sure it 's run with the new 3.7 profile .
Enabling WebGL
One of the new cool things about 3.7 is that it supports a mapping of JavaScript to OpenGL , called WebGL .
In other words it enables websites to use hardware 3D acceleration .
To enable this , go to about : config in your Firefox 3.7 alpha .
Type ' webgl ' in the filter bar , and set ' webgl.enabled_for_all_sites " to true .
To be secure , you might set dom.ipc.plugins.enabled to false .
Now you can fully enjoy the WebGL demos on the web using hardware acceleration .
For example , how about this shiny teapot you can rotate with the mouse ( leftclick / drag ) ?
If you hold Ctrl and use the mouse wheel , you can even zoom !
Installing Flash 10.1 beta
One of the big annoyances I have with Firefox is that it always becomes unstable and hangs after watching a few Youtube vids .
This also goes for Opera .
This is caused by the shitty Flash plugin provided by Adobe , most Linux users will probably have 10.0.45 .
However , Adobe bettered its life with 10.1 beta it seems , but it 's not in most software repositories as far as I can tell .
Therefore we 're going to use the ' ugly ' method again to install this one .
It 's rather easy :
In the url - bar of Firefox I type ' flash beta linux ' and I hit enter .
In the green square on the right , I choose : Get the Flash Player 10.1 pre-release .
In the next screen , I click " Download plug - in for Linux ( TAR.GZ ) .
I unzip it and move ' libflashplayer.so ' to ~/. firefox / plugins , and I 'm done !
To be sure , I uninstalled www - plugin / adobe - flash from my system .
Restart Firefox , 3.6 or 3.7 does n't matter , go to about : plugins , and with a bit of luck it will tell you it 's running Shockwave Flash 10.1d 51 ( or higher ! ) .
What I noted using this ' pre - release ' is that , even though it 's not that well tested yet , it 's not as cripple as 10.0.45 and I can watch multiple Youtube vids consecutively without Firefox hanging .
JaegerMonkey
As a last part of my journey into ' bleeding edge ' Firefox I wanted to install the ' highly experimental ' JaegerMonkey ( JM ) javascript ( js ) engine , slated to replace SpiderMonkey in the near future .
The story is a bit complex , so here 's my short version of it : Firefox comes with a js interpreter called SpiderMonkey - which is slow , and a highly optimizing engine called ' TraceMonkey ' which is ' super awesome fast ' .
However , when something cannot be optimized by ' tracing ' by TraceMonkey , Firefox falls back to interpreting using SpiderMonkey , and that 's why javascript in Firefox is pretty slow sometimes .
The people behind JM hope to solve this by means of ' replacing ' the SpiderMonkey interpreter by using Apple Webkits ' Nitro ' JIT ( Just In Time compiler ) instead of interpreting .
So , when it makes sense , be ' super awesome fast ' by means of tracing , and if not , fall back to ' still really fast ' using Nitro .
Building JM is not that hard , you have to do a ' clone ' using the Mercurial source control management tool ( one Gig of downloading in my case ) , then you have to configure with " - enable - methodjit ' and than you have a command line javascript interpreter called ' js ' .
However , I did n't understand this command line interpreter was all that is supported at this moment , even though the JM wiki clearly states so : " Currently we only support shell builds " .
I had to ask on IRC and some kind soul explained to me integrating JM in FF was n't supported yet , and it might be a good idea if the JM wiki stated it was ' absolutely , absolutely , absolutely not intended for end users , only for developers discussing the direction of the project ' .
I agree , but nonetheless it 's interesting .
For what it 's worth : I downloaded Google 's V8 benchmark suite ( easy to ' wget ' ) and ran version 5 of it using the JM command line interpreter .
With the -m switch , it uses the new method - jit , and without the switch it does n't .
With the switch and the JIT enabled , I reached a 38 % higher score than without it , but I 'm not really sure of this results given I 'm not a developer and it was the first time I ever compiled a js- engine and ran benchmarks using the command line version of said js - engine .
But anyway , if you 're an end user and you 're not sure of what you 're doing and you 're using something aimed at developers only , chances are you finally reached the bleeding edge !
Conclusion
So what did we learn ?
Windows users are lucky , being served with well tested upgrades which are easy to install .
Linux users are lucky having multiple ways to install new versions .
It 's pretty easy installing and using some new Alpha version of Firefox in Linux .
Installing and running multiple versions of Firefox on Linux is not that hard , as long as you know what you 're doing and keep them apart .
WebGL is really cool , and it will change the cloud :
It 's theoretically possible CAD and games will be web - based running on fat power hungry x86 servers and available from power efficient ARM - netbooks and smart phones acting as clients , where rendering is done with hardware acceleration of the ARM portable devices !
Flash 10.1 beta is much better than the old cruft Adobe supplied when it comes to using your browser as a Youtube - player , but OGG video ( OGV ) is still even better of course .
People in #developers of irc.mozilla.org are friendly to lost end - users trying to achieve something that 's impossible even when the Wiki clearly says so .
And JaegerMonkey will bring faster javascript to Firefox .
Finally let 's end with a screenshot showing my result :
The information bloggers choose to put out there often has a huge impact on how they ’re perceived and what others online think about them .
And what many bloggers do n’t realize is that information they put on their blogs can have a direct legal impact .
Even if what you ’re posting to your blog is n’t breaking any laws , it may be considered unethical by others , which can often be just as damaging .
Here ’s a guide to free speech and freedom of information specifically for bloggers .
Legal issues , ethical issues , and other things to consider are all covered .
If you have additional input or advice , or disagree with anything here , please speak up in the comments .
Permanent Records
Do you remember the stories about a “ permanent record ” that were told to frighten children into behaving appropriately throughout school ?
The concept was popularized on television and in movies , with kids constantly being threatened that a particular action was going to be placed on their “ permanent record ” .
The theory was that this record would follow you through school and then eventually into the workforce , and that negative things it contained could effect your entire life .
In reality ( in most countries , at least ) , there ’s no such thing as a “ permanent record ” , at least not in the sense that it was portrayed .
But with the Internet , there is a permanent record .
Records are kept of virtually everything you do online , often automatically as part of backups and caches , though sometimes it might also be done manually if something particularly funny or embarrassing or incriminating is done .
This permanent record can come back to haunt you in the future , depending on what it contains , and can really interfere with your ability to get a job , get into a good college , or run for political office .
The thing to remember , is that once you put something out there online , it ’s out there forever .
You wo n’t get a do - over if it ’s something you ’re no longer proud of .
While for the average person this is unlikely to ever cause any substantial problems , if you ’re a businessperson or future politician , it can be very damaging .
Consider your aspirations and future ambitions and act accordingly now .
Do n’t put things online that you think you might regret later .
Chances are , you probably will regret them at some point .
Libel and Slander
Libel is when you write something untrue and potentially harmful about someone .
Slander is when you say something untrue and potentially harmful about someone .
Laws vary from country to country on how slander and libel ( collectively called “ defamation ” ) is handled .
In some countries ( such as the U.S. ) , defamation is a civil matter and is dealt with only if the victim sues the defamer .
In most other countries ( including Canada , the UK , Australia , Russia , and China ) though , there are criminal laws against defamation , at least in certain circumstances .
For the most part , if something you ’ve said or written is true , and you can prove that it ’s true , you ’ll be protected from libel or slander suits .
That does n’t mean that you still wo n’t have to defend against them , which can be expensive .
You can still run into issues if the information you ’ve disclosed is n’t of public interest .
If the information you ’ve disclosed publically is considered private information and not of public note , then you can be sued under invasion of privacy laws in some cases .
Privacy
Privacy laws are another thing that vary widely from country to country .
As a general rule , though , unless something is of public importance , if it ’s not something someone would likely want shared , do n’t share it .
Now , “ public importance ” is one of those things that ’s open to a lot of interpretation .
Obviously , if you ’re exposing information about a public figure , then there ’s a good chance a lot more falls into the “ public importance ” category .
If it ’s someone who is n’t a public figure , then there are fewer areas that would be important to the general public , and therefore fewer things you can expose without having serious worries about being sued or violating any laws .
A good rule of thumb is that if you would n’t want someone to expose a particular fact about you , do n’t expose it about them without a very good reason for doing so .
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property generally includes copyrights , patents , and trademarks .
In the United States and many other countries , as soon as a work ( whether written , audio , or another format covered by the law ) is created , it is protected by copyright law .
No registration is required to be protected , though registration does add an extra layer of protection ( mainly a specific date when it can be proven that a work existed ) .
Trademarks and patents , however , do have to go through a registration and approval process in order to be protected .
As a blogger or online content creator , you need to respect the intellectual property rights of others .
This is usually relatively easy to do .
Here are some things to keep in mind when using the work of others within your own blog :
Do n’t quote more than a few sentences of someone else ’s content .
Properly cite any content you include and link to the original source .
It ’s also polite to link to the place where you found content , if it ’s not the original source .
Do n’t use images in your blog posts unless they ’re licensed for use ( through Creative Commons or otherwise ) or you have permission .
When you use images , make sure you link back to the source and properly credit the creator .
When doing roundups or posts that are showcasing artists ’ work , it ’s generally not necessary to ask permission to post small versions of their work with proper credit and links , though you should be prepared to take down the post or the part of the post that features them if they object .
If you use a trademarked name in your posts , you may want to include a note about who the trademark belongs to and / or link back to the company ’s website .
If you do n’t , you might even get a letter from the trademark owner requesting that you do so .
An interesting side - note about trademarks : trademarks are always adjectives .
Using a trademark as a verb or even as a noun is technically a violation of trademark law , at least in the United States .
In other words , if you say you “ Googled ” something or you “ Photoshopped ” something , that ’s a trademark violation .
The trademarks there are technically the Google search engine , and Adobe Photoshop software .
The problem that companies run into is that if they do n’t protect their trademarks from use like this , the trademark can become “ genericized ” and they can lose their trademark rights to it , meaning anyone could then use the name .
Censorship
When we think of Internet censorship , many people generally think of Iran or China and their massive censorship efforts .
But what most people do n’t realize is that a majority of countries worldwide actually employ some form of Internet censorship or surveillance .
Blue countries have no censorship , yellow countries have some , red countries are under surveillance , and black countries are heavily censored .
Among the countries that employ at least some censorship is the United States , the United Kingdom , Bahrain , Yemen , Australia , Syria , Germany , Denmark , Canada , and Brazil .
These censorship laws are varied , with some specifically set up to protect minors from content that would be illegal for them to see elsewhere , while others aim to block citizens from seeing anything that ’s considered offensive , immoral , or dangerous by their government .
Many people will agree that some censorship laws are necessary .
Laws that protect minors ( from things like obscene or pornographic content ) , for example , are often met with popular support in many countries .
Sometimes these laws only extend to public schools or other government - run institutions , rather than for the populace at large .
Other censorship laws , though , especially those that hinder with freedom of speech , are often met with public disapproval and can cause a country to be ostracized by others in the world community ( as is the case with China and Iran ) .
Censorship plays an important role in what you say online in two separate ways .
First , if you live in a country with censorship laws , educate yourself on what those laws permit and do not permit .
Then decide if you can abide by those rules or not .
If not , and you ’re willing to break your country ’s laws , there are often workarounds possible , such as hosting your site outside of your home country or having someone else register your domain and host your site elsewhere .
But realize that you may face legal repercussions by doing this , some of which can be very severe .
The other important role censorship plays in online content is if you ’re trying to reach people within a particular country .
If your blog ’s content is of particular interest to those in , say , China , then you ’ll need to make sure your blog does n’t say anything that violates China ’s censorship policies .
Web Host Rules
Above we talked about government censorship .
But there ’s another type of censorship that takes place regularly , as well .
It ’s censorship by your web host or ISP .
Hosting companies sometimes have strict rules about what they ’ll allow to be hosted on their servers and what they wo n’t .
The usual targets of these rules are pornography , obscene content , or content that could potentially be used for illegal acts ( such as excerpts from books like the Anarchist ’s Cookbook ) .
For the most part , these ISP and web host rules are n’t something you can fight against .
In most of the world , web hosts are private businesses , and have the right to run their businesses in whatever manner they deem appropriate .
If they do n’t want to host a particular type of site , that ’s their prerogative .
The best advice I can offer in those situations is to find a web host that has no problem hosting the type of material you want to publish .
Censoring Your Own Blog
There ’s also the question of whether you should censor your own blog .
When visitors leave comments on your posts , you may decide you want to censor them or not post them at all .
This is particularly applicable if the comment is offensive or inflammatory , or if it adds nothing to the conversation .
If you do decide to censor comments on your blog , it ’s generally a good idea to post a public comment moderation policy somewhere .
This should outline what types of comments will be excluded from publication ( whether this is simply limited to posts that are offensive or extends to those that add nothing to the conversation ) .
A public comment policy lends credibility and can lead to improved quality in the comments you do receive .
Just realize that some feel that moderating comments in this manner is a hindrance to freedom of speech and may react unfavorably .
You may also censor what you write , in terms of the posts you publish .
When you decide not to write about a specific topic due to potential negative reactions and repurcussions , that ’s self - censorship .
Most bloggers self - censor to some extent on a regular basis .
Personal vs. Business Blogging
When considering what information to post on your blog , it ’s important to consider whether you ’re blogging for personal or business purposes .
What one might consider perfectly appropriate on an informal , personal blog could be offensive or unprofessional if you ’re blogging for your business .
This is one of those situations where it ’s important to figure out the repercussions of everything you post online .
If your blog is for your company or for your profession , then you need to consider very carefuly what you post .
And not just from a legal standpoint .
You need to consider that everything you say is going to reflect on you as a professional .
On a personal blog , people generally expect you to be more informal , more casual , and less professional .
But remember that anything you post online may be seen by potential clients or employers in the future .
Just because it ’s a personal site does n’t mean it wo n’t be used against you professionally .
Legal vs. Ethical Issues
When considering what to publish on your blog or elsewhere online , it ’s a good idea to consider ethical issues as well as legal issues .
There are some things you may debate posting that , while not illegal , may have ethical implications .
These include things like off - the - record information shared in confidence or maliciously - obtained information .
While these things may not be specifically illegal , they would definitely be of questionable ethical standards .
One of the main reasons to consider ethical implications is your reputation .
If your readers perceive you as unethical , they may also perceive you as untrustworthy and unreliable .
Unethical decisions may also result in problems with others in your industry or niche .
They may blacklist your content or your blog entirely , which can really hurt your traffic numbers , especially in niches where blogs tend to quote each other a lot and send traffic back and forth .
When it comes to online content creation , your reputation is often the only thing that matters .
And often people are n’t given a second chance if they make a blunder .
It ’s important to consider what the content you ’re publishing says about you , and that the message it ’s putting out is the one you want .
Conclusion
For the most part , free speech seems to be the rule rather than the exception in the blogosphere .
Despite censoring , both by bloggers themselves , governments , and ISPs , most blogs are relatively open when it comes to the information they disseminate .
This results in a blogosphere that has a diverse array of opinions and voices .
Just remember that everything you put out there becomes a part of the permanent cultural record .
What you say today could come back to haunt you ( or help you ) five , ten , or even twenty years in the future .
Be sure that the message you ’re putting out there now will be a message you ’ll be still okay with then .

All browser makers should take a page from Google 's Chrome and isolate untrusted data from the rest of the operating system , a noted security researcher said today .
Dino Dai Zovi , a security researcher and co-author of The Mac Hacker 's Handbook , believes that the future of security relies on " sandboxing , " the practice of separating application processes from other applications , the operating system and user data .
In a Wednesday entry on Kaspersky Labs ' ThreatPost blog , Dai Zovi described sandboxing , as well as the lesser security technique of " privilege reduction , " as " [ moving ] the bull ( untrusted data ) from the china shop ( your data ) to the outside where it belongs ( a sandbox ) . "
The idea behind sandboxing is to make it harder for attackers to get their malicious software onto machines .
Even if an attacker was able to exploit a browser vulnerability and execute malware , he would still have to exploit another vulnerability in the sandbox technology to break into the operating system and , thus , get to the user 's data .
" Sandboxing raises the bar significantly enough that attackers will have to turn to other [ types of attacks ] , like rogue anti-virus software , " Dai Zovi said today in a telephone interview .
The pervasiveness of Web - based attacks calls for browser sandboxing , Dai Zovi argued .
" It 's crucially important because , in my opinion , the browser will become the OS , " he said .
" Google is the first to realize that the browser is the operating system , and Chrome is a huge leap forward with its ground - up rewrite . "
Chrome has included sandboxing since its September 2008 debut .
And while Dai Zovi considers it easily the leader in security because of that , other browser have , or will , make their own stabs at reducing users ' risks .
For example , Microsoft 's Internet Explorer 7 ( IE7 ) and IE8 on Vista and Windows 7 include a feature dubbed " Protected Mode , " which reduces the privileges of the application so that it 's difficult for attackers to write , alter or destroy data on the machine , or to install malware .
But it 's not a true sandbox as far as Dai Zovi is concerned .
Currently , Mozilla 's Firefox , Apple 's Safari and Opera Software 's Opera lack any sandboxing or privilege reduction features .
" Apple , for example , has implemented some sandboxing in Snow Leopard , but [ although ] security researchers were hoping to see some of that technology used in Safari , that has n't happened , " Dai Zovi said .
Mozilla is working on Chrome - like sandboxing for Firefox -- the project 's dubbed " Electrolysis " -- but the feature probably wo n't make it into the browser until Firefox 4.0 , which is now slated to ship in late 2010 or early 2011 .
Dai Zovi sees browser sandboxing as an answer to the flood of exploits that have overwhelmed users in the past year .
" This is n't perfect , but it 's the direction we should be heading in , " he said .
" The idea of fixing every vulnerability is clearly not working .
We can't always win the race to patch . "
But sandboxing , or at the least , reducing the browser 's ability to affect the rest of the OS , may be the way to block most attacks .
" It adds more defense - in - depth and impedes attackers , " Dai Zovi said .

The market crushed shares of Palm on Thursday after it admitted that sales of its anticipated new phones were missing expectations , quelling hopes the company could regain ground in the competitive mobile market .
The mobile maker warned that revenue for the quarter ending February would be between $ 300 million to $ 320 million , well below average Wall Street estimates of $ 410 million .
By close , shares dropped nearly 20 percent , or $ 1.56 to $ 6.53 , gaining only half a percentage point after hours .
The company explained that revenue for the quarter and the full year are coming in much lower due to slower - than - expected consumer adoption of the company 's products .
Some industry watchers expected a slow down in sales given a general slow down in mobile handsets sales , but the size of the slowdown caught many by surprise .
Long - term macro projections also are n't in the company 's favor .
With the US market being Palm 's best opportunity for more levered growth , we are more concerned with the future growth opportunity , said Maynard Um of UBS .
Gartner researchers projected that the company 's smartphones will have only 1.4 percent of the smartphone market in 2012
The company -- with is ailing Palm Pilot OS -- had lost significant momentum in the past , but it rebounded on the strength of its
Pre platform .
While the firm was able to generate plenty of buzz , it was n't able to execute effectively , according to Gartner analyst Van Baker .
First they announced so far in advance of actually shipping the product that they diluted the positive buss that they created at the Consumer Electronics Show in January of 2009 , Baker writes in an official Gartner weblog .
Launching with Sprint was also a mistake , Baker explains , as they are network in decline .
Palm has tried to address this with the Verizon launch but Palm may have waited too long to do this .
Wall Street is skeptical as to whether the company can rebound from its mired attempt to jump back into the market .
Demand is slow for its new phones , and the expected boon from Verizon and Sprint have n't been materializing .
No matter how good the product , we believe that penetrating the channel will continue to be difficult for Palm and will only get tougher as more competitive touc handsets come to market through the year , J.P Morgan analyst Rod Hall told clients .
Palm is also operating in a highly competitive environment , against giants like Apple and Nokia that have much larger brand - recognition and marketing budgets .
Palm may not be able to quickly bounce bank , Hall concluded .
Either I had a really short attention span as a kid and never made it past the first verse of a song ( which is entirely possible ) , or there are some obscure lyrics to the songs we all know and love .
Here are a few of them .
1. I 'm a Little Teapot .
" I'm a clever teapot ,
Yes it 's true
Here let me show you
What I can do
I can change my handle
And my spout
Just tip me over and pour me out ! "
2. Do Your Ears Hang Low ?
I 'm impressed that a children 's song contains the word " semaphore . " 
Do your ears hang high ?
Do they reach up to the sky ?
Do they droop when they are wet ?
Do they stiffen when they 're dry ?
Can you semaphore your neighbour with a minimum of labour ?
Do your ears hang high ?
3. My Bonnie Lies
Over the Ocean involves terrifying nightmares :
Last night as I lay on my pillow
Last night as I lay on my bed
Last night as I lay on my pillow
I dreamed that my Bonnie was dead
4. Oh My Darling Clementine .
I did n't know anything beyond the " Oh my darling "  chorus , but there 's a whole little tale that goes along with the tragic Clementine .
It goes like this ( I 'm leaving out the chorus , though ) :
In a cavern , in a canyon ,
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner forty niner ,
And his daughter Clementine
Light she was and like a fairy ,
And her shoes were number nine ,
Wearing boxes , without topses ,
Sandals were for Clementine .
Drove she ducklings to the water
Ev 'ry morning just at nine ,
Hit her foot against a splinter ,
Fell into the foaming brine .
Ruby lips above the water ,
Blowing bubbles , soft and fine ,
But , alas , I was no swimmer ,
So I lost my Clementine .
How I missed her !
How I missed her ,
How I missed my Clementine ,
But I kissed her little sister ,
I forgot my Clementine .
5. Alouette .
This one is n't a lost verse " “ it 's more that I had no idea what I was really singing about all of those years : bird dismemberment .
Alouette , gentille Alouette
( Skylark , nice skylark )
Alouette , je te plumerai
( Skylark , I shall pluck you )
Je te plumerai la tÃªte
( I shall pluck your head )
( Je te plumerai la tÃªte )
( I shall pluck your head )
Et la tÃªte
( And your head )
( Et la tÃªte )
( And your head )
The next verses include telling the captive bird that after his head , his beak , neck , back , wings , feet and tail will follow .
Yikes !
6. Bingo .
The earliest recorded version from 1888 adds two verses after the one that spells out the famous farmer 's dog 's name .
They went like this :
Thys Franklyn , syrs , he brewed goode ayle ,
And he called it Rare good Styngo !
S , T , Y , N , G , O !
He call'd it Rare goode Styngo !
Nowe is notte thys a prettie song ?
I thinke it is , bye Jyngo ,
J wythe a Y—N , G , O —
I sweare yt is , bye Jyngo !
7. Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star .
When the blazing sun is gone ,
When he nothing shines upon ,
Then you show your little light ,
Twinkle , twinkle , all the night .
Then the traveller in the dark ,
Thanks you for your tiny spark ,
He could not see which way to go ,
If you did not twinkle so .
In the dark blue sky you keep ,
And often through my curtains peep ,
For you never shut your eye ,
Till the sun is in the sky .
As your bright and tiny spark ,
Lights the traveller in the dark , —
Though I know not what you are ,
Twinkle , twinkle , little star .
8. Baa Baa Black Sheep .
If you feel the need to deplete the rest of the barnyard denizens of their precious goods after you 've taken the sheep 's wool , you certainly can :
" Cluck , cluck , red hen , have you any eggs ?
Yes sir , yes sir , as many as your legs .
One for your breakfast and one for your lunch ;
Come back tomorrow and I 'll have another bunch .
Moo , moo brown cow , have you milk for me ?
Yes sir , yes sir , as tasty as can be .
Churn it into butter , make it into cheese ,
Freeze it into ice cream or drink it if you please .
Buzz , buzz busy bee , is your honey sweet ?
Yes sir , yes sir , sweet enough to eat .
Honey on your muffin , honey on your cake ,
Honey by the spoonful , as much as I can make . "
9. A Tisket , A Tasket .
You probably know about the green and yellow basket , and you might remember that the person singing the song dropped it .
After that , the sordid tale goes like this :
I dropped it , I dropped it
Yes ,
On the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And put it in her pocket
She was truckin ' on down the avenue ,
Without a single thing to do
She was peck - peck - peckin all around
When she spied it on the ground
She took it she took it
my little yellow basket
And if she does n't bring it back
I think that I shall die ( Was it brown ? ) no , no , no , no ,
( Was it red ? ) no , no , no , no ,
( Was it blue ? ) no , no , no , no ,
Just a little yellow basket
10 . London Bridge is Falling Down .
This song goes on forever .
Tired parents might be glad their kids only know the first verse .
If you 're a glutton for punishment , though , here 's the rest :
Build it up with wood and clay ,
Wood and clay , wood and clay ,
Build it up with wood and clay ,
My fair lady .
Wood and clay will wash away ,
Wash away , wash away ,
Wood and clay will wash away ,
My fair lady .
Then you " build it up with bricks and mortar "  and sing that verse .
But " bricks and mortar will not stay , will not stay , will not stay . " 
This is followed by " build it up with iron and steel , "  but " iron and steel will bend and bow . " 
So then we get extravagant and decide to " build it up with silver and gold , "  and , obviously , " silver and gold will be stolen away . " 
There are no other materials available , apparently , so we 're going to stick with the precious metals and " set a man to watch all night , watch all night , watch all night . " 
The question then is , " Suppose the man should fall asleep , fall asleep , fall asleep ? "  and the answer is , " Give him a pipe to smoke all night , smoke all night , smoke all night . " 
So there you have the solution to every crumbling bridge in the world : build it with silver and gold , pay a guy to watch it and let him smoke so he stays awake for his shift .
Sound good ?
So tell me : how many of you know the extended versions of these songs , and how many of you are just as surprised as I was ?
Origins of the PCs
Warforged
Warforged are living machines , built for the purpose of waging war .
Introduced in the Eberron campaign setting , warforged introduce a unique type of character to play : a construct given intelligence and free will .
Although warforged are generally restricted to Eberron , they could be introduced into any high - magic setting as a people who were once , or perhaps still are a servitor race .
Warforged Strengths
High Constitution
Built - in armor is the default for the race
Less vulnerable to sneak attacks and critical hits
Access to a natural attack
Immunity to several effects ( poison , sleep , paralysis , disease , nausea , fatigue , exhaustion , sickened and energy drain )
Is effectively immortal unless destroyed
Can heal damage with the Craft skill
Warforged Weaknesses
Low Wisdom
Low Charisma
Generally has an arcane spell failure chance
Vulnerable to many more spells than humanoids ( spells that affect constructs as well as several that affect metal , stone and wood )
Does not naturally heal damage over time
Spells from the healing subschool are only half as effective on warforged
Playing a Warforged
Warforged characters are mechanical , mostly .
Their default body armor is effectively the equivalent of leather armor with the light fortification special quality .
The lower mental faculties of the warforged means that they are much better suited to a physical role , although they can easily excel as spellcasters with some well chosen feats .
Because of a high Constitution , a warforged character is going to be tough .
They 'll have a higher Fortitude saving throw and more hit points .
The added immunities to several effects also make them tougher to put down .
Unfortunately , they require specialized healing , such as through a Craft check or a repair spell to bring their hit points back up .
This can put a strain on a party 's cleric , who finds it much harder to heal one companion than the rest .
A lower Wisdom score means that a warforged character will be more vulnerable to effects that require them to make a Will saving throw .
That coupled with a vulnerability to several more spells than normal humanoids means that they will have to be extra careful around spellcasters , especially druids and artificers .
Warforged are extremely effective when disarmed compared to other races .
Their built - in armor and natural attack means that they can continue to be effective in battle , even without a weapon .
A damaged warforged can become inert until healed , perhaps through a contingency spell , and flank a group of enemies who thought him to be no longer a threat .
Class Suggestions
Warforged often do well in classes that allow them to work physically : both fighter and barbarian are easy class choices for the average character .
Both excel in what the warforged is designed to do : bust heads .
Both can take feats to improve their body armor without fear of penalizing other abilities , and the natural immunity to several effects that could easily debilitate a fighter , such as paralysis , makes them tougher than their fellows .
One particularly excellent choice for a warforged character is artificer .
Not only does it allow them to enhance their own forms permanently through magic item creation , they can also use their infusions to power themselves , as all that construct - based infusions will work on warforged too .
Races of Eberron introduced warforged artificer substitution levels that allow the character to better infuse their own bodies .
Paladin seems an unlikely choice for a warforged character , with it 's reliance on two ability scores that they do poorly with , but a set of substitution levels in Races of Eberron allow a warforged paladin to heal damage , smite constructs and become more resilient to magical attacks .
Also of interest is the duskblade ( Player 's Handbook II ) , which allows the warforged to take a heavier composite body and still cast arcane spells without failure .
Despite their appearance , warforged can be sneaky if required , and they make good monks , lurks ( Complete Psionics ) , soulknives ( Expanded Psionics Handbook ) , rogues or scouts ( Complete Adventurer ) .
The added benefit of such a character is that if they are trying to disarm a trap and fail , they may be more resistant to it than a flesh - and - blood rogue , especially if poison or debilitating spell effects are involved .
Incarnum - using classes ( Magic of Incarnum ) are excellent choices for warforged characters .
Constitution , which a warforged would have in spades , helps determine the power of a character 's soulmelds .
Either the incarnate , soulborn or totemist is a good choice .
Since wizards use Intelligence to cast magic , you might think they would be a good choice for a warforged character , and you 'd be right .
With some feat selection , or by sucking up the arcane spell failure rate , you could make a very durable arcane caster .
Warmage makes an even more durable choice by allowing the warforged character to wear their composite armor ( or upgrading to a mithral body or similar ) without spell failure , but they are generally limited to evocation and conjuration spells .
If you 're looking to make a divine spellcaster , the archivist ( Heroes of Horror ) makes an excellent choice , since it 's just about the only one that is n't restricted to using Wisdom or Charisma for its spellcasting .
As an added effect , the character could learn any divine spell , making it as versatile as needed .
If you 're looking for a psionic character , you could consider the psion .
A warforged character could take the adamantine body feat and become extremely resistant to damage , while still being able to lash out at others with the power of its mind , or take the psiforged body feat and focus mainly on their psionic powers .
Another interesting choice for a warforged spellcaster is the druid .
While it might not seem like the best choice , the character would retain its natural immunities and resistances while wild shaped , and feats like ironwood body ( Races of Eberron ) would allow the character to better pursue this unusual path .
Feat Suggestions
Warforged characters have a host of feats available to them , many of which can be extremely beneficial , depending on the class the character takes .
Warforged spellcasters , like bards , warmages , or duskblades may see use in taking Battlecaster ( Complete Arcane ) to allow them to use their magic effectively with heavier body armor .
Foremost in a warforged character 's mind should be the warforged feats : an entire section of feats available only to them .
Warforged feats allow characters to alter their bodies in radical new ways , from bulking up their armor , to allowing their natural weapons to bypass damage reduction .
Here is a complete list :
Feat Source Book Page Adamantine Body Eberron CS

Of these feats , 5 of them : Adamantine Body , Ironwood Body , Mithral Body , Psiforged Body and Unarmored Body may only be taken at 1st level .
The feat represents the alteration of the warforged character 's body to make it different than the norm .
Adamantine Body - Adamantine is the strongest body armor a warforged character can wear , and provides protection equivalent to full plate armor along with a healthy dose of damage reduction .
It 's an excellent choice for a character that will be wading into battle , because less damage means less time you 'll have to spend repairing yourself and the less you 'll have to bother the team 's artificer to cast a repair spell on you .
Ironwood Body -
While not as powerful as mithral , ironwood body allows a character to improve their protection and gain some minor damage reduction .
The ones who benefit the most from this feat are druids , as it is one of the few body types that allow that class to cast spells while wearing it .
Mithral Body - Mithral improves the warforged character 's armor class , while not hampering them too much with problems heavier armors provide .
Swashbucklers and rangers can get the most out of this kind of body armor , as they still allow the character to do minor acrobatics ( at a small penalty of course ) .
Mithral is considered light , so spellcasters who are restricted to light armor , like warmages , can also benefit greatly from this choice .
Psiforged Body -
If you want to be a psionicist , or have access to psionic feats , this is the body - type for you .
Beyond providing 1 power point , it also allows the warforged to use his body as a cognizance crystal , making it of far more use to a psion than a soulknife .
Unarmored Body - Sometimes no armor is the best armor .
This feat removes the body armor ( and light fortification ability ) from a warforged character .
The upside ?
Now your warforged wizard can cast spells without bothering with an arcane spell failure , and you 're free to wear whatever robes or armor you desire .
If you 're playing in a Monte Haul style adventure , consider this feat .
If great armor is lying just down the hall , you can always wear it , instead of being stuck with what you started with .
Also of interest is a pair of racial feats : Brute Fighting and Stable Footing which both appear in Races of Eberron .
Both feats can provide your character with some great options beyond the range of other races .
Prestige Class Suggestions
Warforged characters do n't have a lot of prestige class options available to only them , and most of their prestige classes should be chosen to suit their class and feat selection .
There are a few options that warforged should be aware of .
Landforged Walker ( Secrets of Xen'drik ) -
This is one of the best choices for a warforged druid or ranger , especially if they have the ironwood body feat .
The added protection and spellcasting abilities of the class make it a must have for nature - loving characters .
Reforged ( Races of Eberron ) - Reforged is an interesting choice for a warforged character who wants to embrace his living aspect .
By forsaking the machine parts of the character 's body , a reforged loses many of the downsides about being a warforged character , such as the inability to naturally heal .
If you 're trying for an absolute transformation , load your character up on warforged feats while in the class , you 'll lose them , but get an equal number of bonus feats when you complete the class .
Spellcarved Soldier ( Races of Eberron ) -
While it does n't provide the character with any spellcasting abilities , the spellcarved soldier prestige class does require that the character have some magic of their own .
Artificers and armored spellcasters , like warmages , bards or duskblades do best in this class .
While they do n't learn any new spells , they do learn a number of interesting ways to exploit them , as well as some added protection and the ability to utilize more magic items .
Warforged Juggernaut ( Eberron CS ) -
The warforged juggernaut is the logical opposite of the reforged : a character that embraces their construct - side .
These characters do best in the midst of battle , preferably against enemies that squish and splatter satisfyingly against their many weapons .
The bloodspike charger feat ( Player 's Handbook II ) is an excellent choice for a warforged juggernaut character who relies on a spiked shield and their slam attack .
Warforged and Magic
Because of their unique connection to magic , warforged characters can be affected by spells in many different ways than ordinary humanoids .
Specifically , there are a number of spells designed with the warforged in mind .
Consider these spells when working with , or against warforged characters :
Spell Tree Source Book Construct Essence Races of Eberron Humanoid Essence Races of Eberron Natural Weapon Augmentation Races of Eberron Repair Damage Eberron CS
Other Warforged Options
Finally , there are some other features that a warforged character can take advantage of .
Worshippers of the Lord of Blades can invoke 4 rituals ( there 's a feat that provides an added ability as well ) named the Blade Communions .
If you 're looking to make a spry warforged character , maybe one that is better suited for shadows than outright action ; consider making a warforged scout ( Monster Manual III ) .
While they are n't nearly as durable as ordinary warforged characters , the Dexterity boost the scouts receive and their small stature make them into excellent rogues .
Warforged characters should also be well acquainted with magic items that only they can use : components and docents .
Components are magical items that can be attached right into the body of the warforged character .
Such items can replace body parts at times , but are undeniably useful .
Docents are intelligent magical items that take the amulet slot on a warforged , providing them with special abilities and companionship as well as some minor translation abilities .

An audit by the Social Security Security Administration 's Office of the Inspector General urges passage of legislation that would bar states from giving prisoners jobs where they have access to citizens ' private information .

Instances of data theft and data breaches : Privacy Rights Clearinghouse
Social Security Administration : Audit conducted by the Office of the Inspector General WASHINGTON  Prisons in eight states let convicts work in jobs that give them access to Social Security numbers and other personal information for the public , despite years of warnings that the practice should end , a federal audit finds .
Most of the prisoners hold jobs processing public records for federal , state and local governments , according to the audit released this month by the Social Security Administration 's Office of Inspector General .
The work often involves entering and processing data on documents such as student transcripts , tax files , and health care and labor claims forms .
" Although we recognize there may be benefits in allowing prisoners to work while incarcerated , we question whether prisoners have a need to know other individuals ' Social Security numbers , " the audit says .
" Allowing prisoners access to Social Security numbers increases the risk that individuals may improperly obtain and misuse ( the data ) . "
The audit notes that the Social Security Administration has no power to force states to halt the practice and urges passage of legislation pending in Congress that would bar states from giving prisoners jobs where they have access to private citizens ' personal information .
States where prisoners hold such jobs : Alabama , Arkansas , Kansas , Nebraska , Oklahoma , South Dakota , Tennessee and West Virginia .
In Kansas , where five prisons allow inmates to hold jobs processing data with personal identifying information , a prisoner was found last year to have stolen names , birth dates , and Social Security numbers while in a job making digital images of public records , the audit says .
The data was found in a routine search of inmates when their shift is over .
" We 're extremely sensitive to the potential for any kind of access to personal identifying information and have policies ... to limit an inmate 's ability to write down any of this information , " says Bill Miskell , spokesman for the Kansas Department of Corrections .
Those policies , such as inmate searches , have revealed " isolated " cases of inmates trying to steal data , he says , but " we 're not aware of any compromise that has resulted in an inmate being able to utilize personal information for illegal purposes . "
A previous audit by the inspector general in 2006 found that 13 states allowed prisoners to work in jobs where they had access to Social Security numbers and other personal data .
Since then , the new audit says , five of those states have barred the practice .
Shortly after that audit , for example , officials at a Connecticut prison determined through a data security review that an inmate in a records processing job had taken a file containing people 's personal information .
The file was found in her cell , according to the inspector general 's account of the December 2006 incident , and the state subsequently barred inmates from such jobs .
The Social Security Administration will push for legislation to bar prison systems from letting inmates work in jobs where they can access Social Security numbers , the agency says in a written statement .
Officials also will consider making direct appeals to states that still allow the practice and asking them to stop .
" It is essential that we rein in the widespread use and display of these numbers and keep them out of the hands of criminals and organized crime groups that now sell stolen Social Security numbers as a source of income , " Sen .
Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , sponsor of a bill that would prohibit prisoners from handling Social Security data , said in a statement .
" Social Security numbers are among Americans ' most valuable but vulnerable assets . "

U.S. Troops Land in Haiti , Start Peaceful Restoration
With gunships flying overhead , thousands of U.S. troops landed unopposed in Haiti and occupied the capital Monday , launching a peaceful but risk - laden operation to stabilize the country and replace its military rulers with exiled president Jean - Bertrand Aristide .
The first U.S. troops hit the ground at the Mais Gate International Airport under a hot tropical sun at 9:30 a.m. without incident , met by the Haitian army 's deputy commander , Brig .
Gen. Jean - Claude Duperval .
While helicopters ferried troops into the city for most of the day without a shot being fired , Haitians quietly ventured out onto hilltops or the streets , standing in clusters to watch the action .
The U.S. intervention , led by Lt. Gen. Henry H. Shelton , was on its first day a far cry from the violent assault many here had feared and that the Clinton administration had threatened for weeks .
Instead , Shelton vowed to work closely with the Haitian military - whose assumption of dictatorial power three years ago made the operation necessary - and in particular with its commander , Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras .
Cedras , Brig .
Gen. Philippe Biamby and Lt. Col. Michel Francois , who agreed to relinquish power by Oct. 15 in a deal negotiated by former President Jimmy Carter , did not make an appearance Monday and have not spoken publicly since the agreement was struck Sunday night .
The 11th - hour deal was viewed in Washington as either a brilliant gambit that avoided unnecessary bloodshed or a naive pact with untrustworthy thugs .
Aristide was publicly silent on the agreement while Republicans questioned the idea of a U.S. " occupation " of Haiti .
They highlighted the danger of becoming involved in a Somalia - like quagmire .
Soon after the first troops from the army 's 10th Mountain Division landed in helicopters from the USS Eisenhower , Shelton drove to the headquarters of the Haitian military to meet Cedras and Biamby .
Shelton strongly indicated that , pending their resignations , the Haitian commanders would be partners with U.S. forces in maintaining order .
He told reporters after his first meeting that Cedras was " very cooperative , " adding that U.S. troops were " very warmly received " by the Haitian military as well as the Haitian people .
" We discussed methods and techniques we could use to lower the risk " to American soldiers of violent confrontations with Haitian troops or their armed , paramilitary supporters known here as attaches , Shelton said .
He said the U.S. and Haitian military staffs would work together to ensure order .
Shelton expressed concern over the risk to U.S. troops from Haiti 's civil conflict .
Peacekeeping is " not a primary goal " for U.S. troops , he said .
He indicated that insofar as possible , American soldiers would be kept out of the conflict between backers of the Haitian army and those of Aristide .
He said it was uncertain whether Americans would be sent to the slum districts of Port - au - Prince where that conflict is most violent .
" We hope to allow them ( the Haitians ) to handle ... with their own forces " any domestic conflict , Shelton said .
He said he would " wait for guidance " from Washington on whether to try disarming the paramilitary forces blamed for the killings and atrocities here that were cited by President Clinton Thursday night as one of the reasons he decided to act against the ruling military triumvirate .
Pentagon officials in Washington said there will not be an attempt to comprehensively disarm the Haiti populace .
If weapons are used in an incident , they will be confiscated , one senior official said , " but we 're not going into slums to look for shotguns . "
The administration has devised a weapons buy - back program , but it will be implemented " over time " and is not an immediate priority of the U.S. force , the official said .
The same goes for the complicated task of weeding out the 4,000 most undesirable members of Haiti 's military , as agreed in discussions between the administration and Aristide .
" We 're not going to do it today .
We 're not going to do it tomorrow , " the official said .
" But what we 're trying to do is create the conditions to allow that process to take place . "
The danger of U.S. troops getting sucked into Haiti 's conflict seemed illustrated this evening at the main port , where several thousand Haitians jammed Harry Truman Boulevard to watch U.S. troops secure the area and unload ships carrying tons of equipment .
Small groups of young men among a crowd of hundreds at the port gate , described as supporters of Aristide , taunted and stoned Haitian police deployed at the gate , according to witnesses .
Haitians said such boldness would have been dangerous and unthinkable before today and that the presence of U.S. troops and news cameras had encouraged them .
There were to be about 3,000 troops in Port - au - Prince by the end of the day and the balance of the 15,000 troops on the ground by the end of the week to take part in Operation Uphold Democracy , a senior official said at the Pentagon .
" I am very happy , the Americans are going to bring democracy , " said 24 - year - old Malherb Terency , a resident of the Cite Soleil slum , as he watched the U.S. troop movements from under the bill of his Brooklyn Dodgers cap .
" I am for Aristide 150 percent , and I want to get a job . "
While there was not wild rejoicing at the arrival of the U.S. troops , most people seemed to think it was inevitable after all the talk of an invasion , and most supported it .
Several people said there were no public manifestations of support because of fear that the military or its civilian backers would still seek reprisals .
A California appeals court ruled this week that threatening posts made by readers of a website are not protected free speech , allowing a case charging the posters with hate crimes and defamation to proceed .
The case raises fundamental questions about cyberbullying and the line between online speech and hate crimes .
In her dissenting opinion , Judge Frances Rothschild said the appellate court ruling " alters the legal landscape to the severe detriment of First Amendment rights . "
The case involves a teen identified as " D.C. " in court documents , who launched a website in 2005 when he was 15 to promote his pursuit of an acting and singing career .
According to court documents , the student has recorded an album and played a leading role ( . pdf ) in an unnamed feature film , using the pseudonym " Danny Alexander . "
Fellow students at his private high school , Harvard - Westlake School in Los Angeles , posted derogatory comments on his site , mocking his perceived sexual orientation and making hostile statements that threatened him with bodily harm , such as " Faggot , I 'm going to kill you , " and " I want to rip out your fucking heart and feed it to you . "
The site was taken down , and the boy 's father contacted school authorities and the local police , who advised the family to withdraw their son from the school until an investigation could be conducted .
The family did so and , after the investigation dragged on for a while , moved to Northern California .
The police ultimately determined that the postings did not meet the criteria for criminal prosecution and were protected speech .
The father then sued six students and their parents accusing them of hate crimes , defamation – for falsely calling his son a homosexual – and intentional infliction of emotional distress .
The school 's board of directors and three employees were also sued .
One of the defendant students and his parents filed a motion to strike under the state 's anti-slapp law , saying the posts were jocular in nature , intended as a joke and that the statement the student posted was protected speech .
The student had written , among other things , " I 've wanted to kill you .
If I ever see you I 'm ... going to pound your head in with an ice pick . "
A judge rejected the motion in 2008 .
That 's when the case went to the appellate court , which upheld the lower court 's decision , saying in part that the case did n't fall under the anti-slapp - suit law and that the defendants " did not demonstrate that the posted message is free speech . "
Judges Robert Mallano and Jeffrey Johnson , writing for the majority , said the messages revealed a harmful intent and were not protected speech .
The student - defendant stated in court documents that he was directed to the " Danny Alexander " site by another student and was " offended and put off by its ' I am better than you ' attitude and its blatant bragging and self promotion . "
" I had spent time in the past studying Buddhism , " the defendant stated , " and in light of the Buddhist tradition of quiet understatement , the website 's distinctively narcissistic tone was disturbing . "
So he posted a message threatening to kill " Danny Alexander " with an ice pick .
The defendant says he was inspired by the derogatory comments of other posters and wanted to " one - up " them .
" I was in a playful mood and decided to add my own message to the internet graffiti contest that was apparently going on , " he said .
" My message is fanciful , hyperbolic , jocular and taunting and was motivated by [ the plaintiff 's ] pompous , self aggrandizing , and narcissistic website – not his sexual orientation . "
The student says he later sent a letter of apology to the plaintiff and his family regretting his " infantile , immature " conduct .
His father also grounded him and canceled his internet account .
In their ruling , the majority judges write that the message the student posted to the site was " unequivocal " and " a serious expression of intent to inflict bodily harm . "
" That these words produce grotesque and exaggerated images does not lessen the gravity of the threat , " they write .
" The threat in this case was not merely a few words shouted during a brawl ; it was a series of grammatically correct sentences composed at a computer keyboard over a period of at least several minutes . "
An attorney for the defendants said he would appeal the decision to the state 's supreme court .

The United States economy grew at its fastest pace in more than six years at the end of 2009 , even as businesses resisted hiring and continued to do more with less .
The broadest measure of economic activity , gross domestic product , expanded at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter , after a 2.2 percent increase the previous quarter .
“ It was an excellent report , but it ’s not clear how sustainable this pace of growth is , ” said John Ryding , chief economist of RDQ Economics .
The growth rate was the fastest since the third quarter of 2003 , when the economy grew at a rate of 6.9 percent .
But even 2009 ’s fourth - quarter surge was not enough to overcome a terrible start to the year .
The economy finished 2009 with its biggest contraction since 1946 , when the country was still cooling off from World War II .

James W. Douglass Best Price : $ 3.21 Buy New $ 2.26 ( as of 03:25 EST - Details )
My most recent article for OpEdNews , " Into a Thousand Pieces , " has drawn an unbelievable , positive response from the readership , for which I am extremely grateful .
It is encouraging to know that almost forty - seven years after the last true President of the United States was murdered in Dallas , with the three unconstitutional branches of our government in firm control of our nation , that there are still other people who mourn him and desire some form of justice for him .
And for ourselves as well .
A summation of the article is this : the set - up and cover up of John F. Kennedy ’s assassination precludes any theory that does not include the National Security State apparatus ’ involvement .
Folks , this includes any theory where Lee Harvey Oswald is the lone gunman .
No , I have not lost my mind , or even misplaced it .
What are the three occurrences that made JFK ’s murder in Dallas possible ?
Re-routing the parade route to go down Elm Street .
Ordering the 112th Military Intelligence Group to " stand down , " rather than do its job : which was to make certain that windows in buildings were sealed shut and roofs were clear of possible snipers .
Removing the two Secret Service Agents from their position on the rear bumper of the Presidential limousine ( much to their surprise and consternation ) at the last minute , where they might interfere with the aim of a sniper behind the President , or jump forward after the first shot , and protect the President and First Lady from any remaining shots by shielding JFK and Jackie with their own bodies .
Either way , President John F. Kennedy probably leaves Dallas alive .
A film of the Secret Service Agents being ordered off the Presidential limousine ’s back bumper , and the agent ’s reaction can be seen at the following site .
People will argue that this is all merely a coincidence , but I agree with Robert A. Heinlein ’s general assessment regarding coincidence which states that , " Coincidence is a question begging term . "
In other words , people say something is a coincidence when they are unwilling to investigate the circumstances of an incident with the due diligence it deserves : either because they are lazy , fearful or because it does not fit their preconceived notion of what has occurred .
Even if Lee Harvey Oswald was the " lone gunman , " which I personally doubt , he was not the lone person involved in the conspiracy to kill JFK .
On the Trail of the JF ...
Russell , Dick Best Price : $ 3.16 Buy New $ 34.95 ( as of 04:50 EST - Details )
First of all , Oswald has the stink of CIA / ONI ( Office of Naval Intelligence ) all over him , from the time he was a kid in New Orleans .
Second , his " defection " to the Soviet Union has the ham - handed paw prints of the CIA all over it , especially in his return to the United States , and the lack of prosecution when he did return .
Legacy of Secrecy : The ... Hartmann , Thom Best Price : $ 1.98 Buy New $ 2.99 ( as of 03:45 EST - Details )
Third , his actions after his return to the United States , look mostly like a CIA operative who failed in his mission , and is trying to make himself useful to his government by trying to infiltrate pro-Communist pro-Soviet , or pro-Cuban , organizations in the United States  such as the Fair Play for Cuba Committee  as a CIA / FBI informant .
I believe Oswald being set up as a " patsy " for JFK ’s murder as his final " reward " for the abject failure of his mission as a " sleeper agent " to the Soviet Union .
He was in the position to take the blame for the crime whether he actually shot the President or not .
He simply had to die before any " outsider , " such as defense counsel , had a chance to speak to him , which certainly would have occurred on Monday morning .
This leads us to poor Jack Ruby .
Jack Ruby is possibly the largest single enigma in the assassination of President Kennedy .
A Jewish gangster from Chicago , Jack Rubinstein , aka Jack Ruby , operated at organized crime ’s periphery in Dallas during the 1950 ’s and early 60’s .
He claimed to have run numbers for Al Capone when he was a boy .
Ruby initially claimed that he shot Oswald so Jackie Kennedy would not have to return to Dallas for a trial .
This claim is , on the face of it , so preposterous that it lacks any credibility .
He later told Chief Justice Earl Warren in an interview , that the only way that he could tell the Warren Commission the truth about President Kennedy ’s murder was if the Commission took him to Washington to testify , and placing him first in protective custody .
This would seem to automatically disqualify his initially stated reason for shooting Oswald , because if Ruby could only tell the truth to the Warren Commission in Washington , D.C. , under protective custody , by logical extension anything he said to authorities in Dallas most likely would be a lie .

I have often wondered what it was that Jack Ruby did to get himself exiled from Chicago to what was then considered the " cow town " of Dallas ?
I also wonder what the Mob had on Jack Ruby that allowed them to force Jack Ruby to take out Oswald in such a public manner , with no opportunity to escape ?
The " rush to judgment " naming Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone gunman , without any real investigation by the Dallas Police , the FBI , the Secret Service , or the Warren Commission into the possibility of a conspiracy involving any one of a myriad of possible suspects both inside and outside of the American Military - Industrial Complex , was one of the greatest disservices ever performed by law enforcement in this country .
I would call it a lynch mob mentality , but in this case , the mob was being led by law enforcement and the judiciary , while those who stood the most to gain from JFK ’s death , cheered from the sidelines .
We have discussed the pre-assassination set - up ; now let us consider the post - assassination cover up .
Crossfire : The Plot Th ... Marrs , Jim Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 39.88 ( as of 11:40 EST - Details )
First , is the simple fact that the provenance and chain of custody of much of the evidence presented to the Warren Commission is , at best , questionable .
Missing x-rays , photos , and other evidence  including JFK ’s brain , or what ’s left of it , sealed in formalin  are nearly as important as the crime scene ( the Presidential limousine ) , which was being scrubbed down by the Secret Service at the hospital .
Then there are the mysterious figures at Bethesda instructing the pathologists conducting JFK ’s autopsy what to do and what not to do during the autopsy .
Finally , there is the mysterious and sudden appearance of a nearly pristine bullet , Commission Exhibit 399 ( CE 399 ) , whose striations matched those of Oswald ’s rifle , on one of the stretchers in Parkland ’s ER that afternoon .
Besides its questionable provenance , CE 399 has a number of problems .
First is the small ( less than two - and - a - half grains ) amount of mass that was lost from this bullet that supposedly had gone through two men , including several large bones .
Second , it appears that the amount of metal left behind by CE 399 as it traversed the two men ’s bodies probably exceeds the total mass lost by the bullet .
The two largest fragments left in Governor Connally ’s right wrist  and these are not the only fragments that were left  are , according to the Warren Commission , 2×3 mm and 1×2 mm .
With a very conservative estimate of 0.1 mm thickness for each fragment , and a specific gravity of approximately 10.25 g/ cc for the lead alloy of the bullet , you get 0.082g or 82 mg for the weight of those two fragments alone , or 1.27 grains of lead alloy in gun speak .
This is conservatively of the mass missing from CE 399 , and the actual average thickness of those two fragments is more likely to be 0.2 or 0.3 mm , doubling or tripling the mass of the two fragments .
There are also a number of smaller fragments in Connally ’s wrist , chest , and leg according to his x-rays .
I think a proper inventory of the lead fragments in John Connally ’s body would show he had a far greater mass of bullet fragments in his body than the mass of the lead missing from CE 399 .

Post subject : New sub - pixel hinting ( ClearType - like ) patch in cairo
Yesterday I added x11 - libs / cairo -1.8.8-r1 to the tree with a new patch that is applied when the lcdfilter USE flag is on .
This patch is taken from Ubuntu and what it does is enable ClearType - like sub - pixel font hinting in cairo ( and therefore in applications which use cairo , e.g. firefox ) .
This was reported in
This new flag overrides the cleartype USE flag that cairo has had for a while .
Now lcdfilter takes precedence over cleartype , so if you have both enabled the lcdfilter patch will be applied .
The patch causes cairo to respect fontconfig preferences , so now you can configure the sub - pixel hinting based on font , size , weight , etc. and there are 4 filters available : lcddefault , lcdlight , lcdlegacy and lcdnone .
Refer to fontconfig documentation for more information ( man fonts - conf ) .
Please test and provide feedback , I 'd like to hear what you think of it in comparison to the cleartype USE flag , and also in general .
So if you 're running ~arch just sync and then run Hi all , Yesterday I added x11 - libs / cairo - 1.8.8 - r1 to the tree with a new patch that is applied when theUSE flag is on .

Where in fonts .
conf do I put lcddefault , etc. ?
Does that replace rgba for sub - pixel hinting , or does it get its own XML node ?

For example , you can put this snippet in your ~/.fonts.conf :
Code : < match target = " font " >
< edit mode = " assign " name =" lcdfilter " >
< const>lcddefault</const >
</edit >
</ match >
( replace lcddefault with your preference ) .
It does n't replace rgba - that preferences simply controls the sub - pixel geometry ( e.g. rgb or bgr etc. ) , and that depends on your monitor .

Yes , I did n't want to include that patch since upstream has n't even commented on it and other distributions do n't apply it .
I do n't want to make the tree a testing ground .
I 'm willing to apply patches but only to a certain degree , and this patch is too adventurous in my taste .

I 've been mostly following ( gentoo ) bugs and not the forums , perhaps I should have checked them as well .
Anyway , I have no problem with criticism ( on the contrary , I welcome it ) as long as it's constructive and respectful , but comments like " who cares about fixing bugs anyway ? " are neither .
The lcd_filter . patch is useful regardless of the respect - fontconfig .
patch and so I applied it .
Of course it could be more useful to apply both , but there 's a cost to everything and I would n't want to diverge from upstream too much , as I 've explained .
The patch is behind a USE flag , so if you do n't like it just disable it .

Well well ...
I have not been able to find anything in the changelog .
Could someone tell where about we are to date on this issue ?
At least as far as gentoo 's cairo - 1.8.10 is concerned ?
And what about any progression of upstream 's position regarding the patent threat .

For the second consecutive day , Senate Republicans angry over the health care legislation blocked Senate committees from meeting on Wednesday , including an Armed Services Committee session that top officers stationed in Hawaii and Korea had traveled to Washington to attend .
Showing their pique over the Senate ’s plunging ahead with an expedited process to consider changes in the newly enacted health care law , Senate Republicans refused to allow panels to meet after 2 p.m .
Under Senate rules , the afternoon schedule requires agreement from all senators , which is typically given pro forma .
But with Republicans annoyed at being steamrolled by the reconciliation process , that approval was not granted , much to the unhappiness of Democrats who contended that Republicans were inconveniencing a lot of people in their temper tantrum .
“ We have three commanders testifying this afternoon , ” Senator Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said .
“ They ’ve been scheduled for a long time .
They have come a long , long distance . ”
Mr. Levin noted that Senator John McCain of Arizona , the senior Republican on the committee , favored letting the hearing proceed .
And Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina , the Republican on the floor as Mr. Levin made his request , said he would personally have no objection since he was on the committee himself .
But , Mr. Burr said : “ There is objection on our side of the aisle .
Therefore I would have to object . ”
Multiple hearings have been canceled the last two days as Republicans use one of the tools available to them to harass Democrats over the health bill .
That has led to administration witnesses and others being sent back to their offices to await the rescheduling of the session – probably after things settle down a bit .
“ I do n’t get it , ” Senator Claire McCaskill , Democrat of Missouri , said in frustration over the cancellation of a hearing to look into problems with contracts for training of police recruits in Afghanistan .
Over the years , both sides have blocked afternoon committee sessions to show their displeasure with one development or another .
President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s party took a severe drubbing from French voters Sunday in nationwide regional elections that were his last big national test before he seeks re-election in 2012 .
As polling stations closed , initial estimates gave Socialist - led opposition electoral alliances some 54 percent of the vote , Sarkozy ’s right - wing UMP 36 percent and the far - right National Front just under nine percent .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It was obviously for us , a real defeat , ” said lawmaker Jean - Francois Cope , head of the UMP group in the French parliament .
If confirmed , the estimates — based on samples of cast ballots by polling agencies — leave Sarkozy ’s supporters in control of only one of France ’s 22 mainland regions , their right - wing stronghold of Alsace .
Meanwhile the left , dominated by Martine Aubry ’s Socialist Party , kept its hold on the mainland , French Guyana and the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe .
The tight race in Corsica was too close to call .
The UMP ’s sole consolation was taking the Indian Ocean island of Reunion in the vote , which was to elect the regional councils that are in charge of transport , education and cultural policy .
ADVERTISEMENT
Turnout was low , although around four percent higher than in last week ’s first round .
Polling agencies TNS - Sofres and OpinionWay separately predicted that the second round abstention rate would be 49 percent .
Last week ’s first - round vote saw the French leader ’s right - wing supporters win their lowest share of the vote in more than three decades .
The party ’s final score improved , but it remained way behind the opposition .
Sarkozy , whose UMP party still has a comfortable majority in the national parliament , has insisted that the regional poll is not a verdict on central government , but he is expected to order a reshuffle in the next few days .
ADVERTISEMENT
The result was another blow to a president whose personal approval ratings are at an all - time low and will likely increase pressure within his own party for a change of direction .
One report , in the pro-government daily Le Figaro , suggested Prime Minister Francois Fillon would offer his government ’s resignation on Monday but that Sarkozy would ask him to form a new , slightly modified cabinet .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Whatever happens , there wo n’t be a big shake up .
It will be a modest , technical reshuffle , because some adjustments are worth doing , ” Sarkozy ’s chief adviser Claude Gueant told the Catholic newspaper La Croix .
But he added : “ There could be some political content amid the ‘ technical ’ . ”
The new ministerial line - up may offer clues as to whether Sarkozy plans to slow down or alter his reform programme .
He has spoken of a possible “ pause ” once he raises the retirement age and reforms some state sector pensions .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Many of the political strategies of the coming years will be based on this , the last election ” before Sarkozy seeks re-election in the presidential vote in 2012 , said Pascal Perrineau of the elite Sciences - Po school in Paris .
“ He has to reconnect with a part of the popular vote that supported him in 2007 .
He has to send them signals on unemployment and on the cost of living for the working class , ” Perrineau told AFP before the vote .
Meanwhile , the Socialists are expected to try to try use the vote as a springboard to reunited their divided party in time to mount a credible challenge to Sarkozy ’s re-election hopes in 2012 .
In March 14 ’s first round , Sarkozy ’s party trailed the Socialists with 26.3 to 29.5 percent of the national vote .
ADVERTISEMENT
The left - leaning greens of Europe Ecologie scored 12.5 percent and then struck regional electoral pacts with the Socialists for the second round , boosting their joint score well ahead of that of the mainstream right .
Meanwhile , the far - right National Front , led by Jean - Marie Le Pen , did well enough to stay in the race in 12 mainland regions , meaning that much of its 11 percent of the vote remained outside Sarkozy ’s reach .
Neuroscientist Amy Bishop — now under investigation for her 1986 shooting of her brother as well as the murder of three of her colleagues — shows that women can be killers .
Why is everyone so surprised ?
Advertisement
As more of Bishop 's history comes to light — prosecutors have ordered an inquest into her brother 's supposedly accidental death now that evidence suggests Bishop may have been inspired by a newspaper article to murder him — her crimes have ignited a firestorm of philosophizing .
Gina Kolata writes for the Times that Bishop " has become bigger than life , a symbol for those who think that genius is close to madness , or that women cannot get ahead in science , or that tenure systems in universities are brutalizing - or even that progress against fatal diseases is so important that someone like Dr. Bishop should be set free to pursue cures . "
Sam Tanenhaus , also in the Times , argues that her crimes reveal a " gap " in art , a failure to recognize that women 's " evolved status " has given them more freedom to kill .
And Slate 's Emily Bazelon " speculated that Bishop could represent an extreme ( and violent and awful ) manifestation of some women 's frustration with unequal treatment in the workplace .
Not to excuse her behavior , but as one lens through which to view it . "
After news of Bishop 's previous violence came out , she reconsidered , but the question remains , does Bishop 's crime require a " lens " at all ?
Advertisement
Tanenhaus writes that many artistic representations of violent women have been " exculpatory parables of empowerment , anchored in feminist ideology . "
This " made sense " when " the underworld of domestic abuse and sexual violence was coming freshly to light " ( apparently no one knew about domestic violence before Thelma & Louise ) , but things are different now :
The uncomfortable fact is that for all her singularity , Dr. Bishop also provides an index to the evolved status of women in 21st - century America .
The number of female neurobiologists may still be small , but girls often outdo boys in the classroom , including in the sciences .
( Mattel recently announced a new addition , Computer Engineer Barbie , to its line of popular dolls . )
A Harvard Ph.D. remains a rare credential for women ( as well as for men ) , but women now make up the majority of undergraduates at many prestigious colleges .
And the tenure struggle said to have lighted Dr. Bishop 's short fuse reflects the anxieties of many other women who now outnumber men in the work force and have become , in thousands of cases , their family 's principal or only breadwinner .

Echidne of the Snakes wrote that Tanenhaus 's piece was " all about female empowerment turning women into mass murderers .
Just like men ! " — and indeed , Tanenhaus claims that the art that best tells stories like Bishop 's is that in which " the hypothetical notion of empowerment gives way to the exercise of literal power . "
Because of advances in education ( and Barbies ) , Tanenhaus says , women now have more of this " literal power " than ever , and some will use it to kill .
He 's right in one respect — art that depicts women solely as victims of violence , or occasionally as avengers , fails to represent the aggressive impulses of someone like Bishop .
But art 's job is not to represent every possible situation , and narratives of female victimhood are often a response to the cultural and political hegemony of men .
Women have made real strides towards equality ( though the " mancession " may not be one of them ) , but this hegemony still exists , and to say that we need a whole new art - scape now that women are equal in life and crime is a pretty serious overstatement .
Upon learning of Bishop 's history , and of the fact that her failure to get tenure seems to have been a response to the poor quality of her work rather than an instance of discrimination , Bazelon wrote , " she 's not a good example of a woman frustrated by unequal treatment gone wild .
She went wild for different , deeply embedded reasons , it seems clear . "
We do n't really know yet what made Bishop " go wild " — but her crime shows neither that women have achieved total equality nor that our inequality is going to make us all into psychopaths ( as Bazelon also notes , " You can be an extreme awful example of an emotion a lot of other people share , and that does n't make the emotion or the other people awful or potentially violent " ) .
Advertisement
Rather , what Bishop 's story teaches is something that should surprise no one : women can be murderers , and not just in retaliation against abuse or in post - partum psychosis or in any of the other specifically female situations Tanenahus details .
The idea that violence and war are exclusively male , and a female - dominated society would be all sweetness and light , not only misunderstands human nature but muddles the case for female equality .
Women do n't deserve equal rights because we 're morally better than men .
We deserve them because we are human beings — human beings who , unfortunately , sometimes commit unspeakable crimes .
I do n't like the implication that fiction writers must also be sociologists , but in this case two authors Tanenhaus interviews seem to understand the situation far better than he does .
Joyce Carol Oates says , in an analysis of Bishop that Bazelon also praises , " she is a sociopath and has been enabled through her life by individuals around her who shielded her from punishment . "
Patricia Cornwell 's take is even simpler .
Tanenhaus gives her the last word , and I will as well : " People kill because they can .
Women can be just as violent as men . "

CAMPAIGNING FOR STATE -OWNED BANKS
While bank bailouts fatten Wall Street , states continue to battle the credit crisis .
In the search for innovative solutions , some political candidates are proposing that states generate their own credit by setting up their own banks .
State budgets for 2010 face the largest shortfalls on record , totaling $ 194 billion or 28 percent of state budgets ; and 2011 is expected to be worse .
Unemployment has already officially hit 10 percent , and many economists expect it to rise higher .
Continued high unemployment will keep state income tax receipts at low levels and increase demand for Medicaid and other essential services states provide .
The existing alternatives are spending cuts or tax increases , but both will just serve to make the downturn deeper .
When states cut spending , they lay off employees , cancel contracts with vendors , eliminate or lower payments to businesses and nonprofit organizations that provide direct services , and cut benefit payments to individuals .
The result is a reduction in overall demand .
Tax increases also remove demand , by reducing the amount of money people have to spend .
Amanda Paulson , writing in The Christian Science Monitor , quotes Arturo P�rez , fiscal analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures , which released its survey of state budget situations in December :
� Unless you �re North Dakota , you �re probably a state that has had some degree of difficulty or crisis involving finances .
It �s the worst situation states have faced in decades , perhaps going as far back as the Great Depression in some states . �
� Unless you �re North Dakota� � a state with a sizeable budget surplus , and the only state that is adding jobs when other states are losing them .
A poll reported on February 13 ranked that weather - challenged state first in the country for citizen satisfaction with their standard of living .
North Dakota�s affluence has been attributed to oil , but other states with oil are in deep financial trouble .
The big drop in oil and natural gas prices propelled Oklahoma into a budget gap that is 18.5 % of its general - fund budget .
California is also resource - rich , with a $ 2 trillion economy ; yet it has a worse credit rating than Greece .
So what is so special about North Dakota ?
The answer seems to be that it is the only state in the union that owns its own bank .
It doesn�t have to rely on a recalcitrant Wall Street for credit .
It makes its own .
Candidates Across the Political Spectrum Pick Up on the Public Bank Model
In the quest to find ways to divorce the well - being of their states from the financial sector , a growing number of candidates are picking up on the public bank alternative .
Florida , Illinois , Oregon , Massachusetts , Idaho and California all have candidates whose platforms contain this proposed solution to the credit crisis .
A publicly - owned bank has also been proposed on the federal level .
Nationalizing the Federal Reserve ( which is not actually federal but is owned by a consortium of private banks ) was advocated by 2008 Presidential candidates Dennis Kucinich , a Democrat , and Cynthia McKinney , the Green Party candidate .
In 2009 , Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz said the government would have been better off funding a federally - owned bank than doling out trillions of dollars to private investment banks and CEOs who speculated their way into bankruptcy .
Speaking at the New York Society for Ethical Culture on March 6 , 2009 , he said :
� If we had used the $ 700 billion to create a new financial institution , allowed it to lever 10 to 1 , which is very modest compared to the 30 to 1 that we were doing , 10 to 1 would have generated $ 7 trillion of new lending capacity , far in excess of what our country needs .
So the issue here is not about lending .
It �s really about saving the bankers .
And what we confused was saving the banks versus saving the bankers and their shareholders . �
But nationalizing the Federal Reserve faces powerful opponents in Congress .
Meanwhile , on the state level the public bank concept is gaining ground , attracting proponents across the political spectrum , including Democrats , Republicans and Greens .
The issue transcends party lines .
In North Dakota , a Republican state , the state - owned bank was inaugurated by a political party appropriately called the � Non- Partisan League . �
Oregon : The Bankers� Bank Model
In Oregon , Bill Bradbury has included a state bank platform in his bid for governor .
Bradbury , a Democrat , was formerly secretary of state and has been endorsed by former Vice President Al Gore .
His website declares :
� It is time to put Oregonians back to work .
It is also time to declare economic sovereignty from the multi-national banks that in large part are responsible for much of our current economic crisis .
We can achieve these two goals by creating our own bank . �
The Oregonian , Oregon�s largest newspaper , reported that Bradbury plans to deposit tax revenues in the public - interest bank , keeping Oregon�s money in Oregon .
The bank would then lend the money to get the economy going again , targeting small and medium - sized businesses .
Interest would be poured back into the state through more loans to start - up businesses , agriculture , and other key sectors .
Currently , Oregon deposits hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues into large out - of - state banks , siphoning the money off from productive in - state uses .
Many of these banks are the very banks needing federal bailouts to keep from failing in 2008 , after years of handing out risky mortgage loans .
These banks have now grown tight - fisted with Main Street borrowers , making Bradbury�s plan to get money flowing again especially appealing to Oregonian voters .
Bradbury uses the Bank of North Dakota ( BND ) as his model .
Like the BND , the Bank of Oregon would return a dividend to the state based on its earnings , while creating jobs and stimulating the economy through lending .
The state bank would not replace private banking institutions but would partner with them , particularly with community banks , providing them with new customers and helping them provide new services .
To assure the state bank�s independence from existing financial powers , Bradbury proposes that a board of directors appointed by Oregon�s Senate should govern the bank , while taking advice from an advisory committee of experts .
Idaho : Keeping State Assets in the State
In Idaho , James Stivers , a Republican candidate for the State Senate , has also proposed a state bank to fill state coffers and protect the local economy .
In the first indication of a political shift among grassroots Republicans , Stivers swept a closed - ballot preference poll at the GOP District 2 Central Committee meeting in Coeur d�Alene on February 13 , winning the non-binding poll 10 - 0 .
Stivers declares :
� An important part of sovereignty is the monetary authority .
Currently , banks are allowed to multiply many times over the tax receipts deposited in their institutions .
This special privilege is partly responsible for the �sucking sound � in our local economies , as regional banks send their assets to central banks that are playing the derivatives markets of the world .
� A state bank would restore this privilege to the people in a public trust and would give us the opportunity to back our deposits with the wealth from our public lands . �
Stivers sees the bank as a way to facilitate small business startups , end the ability of private banks to cream profits from the public treasury , protect key budget items , and stave off excessive influence from the federal government .
He suggests the novel approach of expanding the role of Idaho�s Bond Bank authority into a full - fledged state bank .
The current banking system , he says , causes inflation , one of the �greatest detriments to a living wage� :
� Inflation is caused by the secret tax of the banking industry in which lenders use the multiplier effect to the benefit of their cronies .
This secret tax takes the form of a decline in the value of the dollar and results in higher prices .
Wages never keep up with this process because its very purpose is to extract wealth from the wage earner to support the privileged classes who curry the favor of lenders .
A state bank would restore this privilege to the people in a public trust and would give us the opportunity to back our deposits with the wealth from our public lands . �
Illinois : Using a State - owned Bank to Fund Infrastructure
In Illinois , Green Party gubernatorial candidate Rich Whitney has other ideas for a state - owned bank .
Illinois is listed by the Pew Center for the States as one of nine states confronting historic budget problems .
In a recent response to the governor�s State of the State Address , Whitney said :
� I am the only candidate in this race who proposes to fund public improvements , and promote economic health , without any further tax increases , through the establishment of a state bank , a progressive idea that North Dakota adopted years ago , and that has helped keep that state debt - free even in these troubled economic times .
Instead of going into more and more debt , to further enrich private banks , we should be using our tax revenue to further invest in our own State and its people , for the enrichment of our own economy . �
The bank would use tax revenues and pension contributions as the financial base to expand credit where it is most needed .
Illinois� bank would borrow from the Federal Reserve at the same 1 percent rate as commercial banks .
Once the budget was balanced , Whitney�s top priorities would be to use the new money to modernize energy infrastructure and promote solar and wind power .
To achieve this , property owners of land where wind and solar generators could be located would be lent money through the state bank at a minimal 1 percent interest rate .
To secure repayment , Whitney would require utilities to buy power from the solar and wind - based producers at a premium rate .
One option would then be to require part of this premium to be paid to the state bank until the loan is returned .
This arrangement , says Whitney , would create a win-win situation :
� The bank is paid back .
The homeowner , farmer or business investing in solar or wind generation realizes immediate savings on energy costs and in many cases will go from being a net consumer to a net producer of energy .
Their greater income will further stimulate the economy .
The utilities will have to pay the cost of the premium rate but in the long run will realize the benefits of having a greater , stable , more diversified and decentralized energy grid , ultimately cheaper in the face of rising fossil fuel prices .
As economies of scale are realized in wind and solar power generation , the costs will fall , as will the necessary premium rate .
And we all benefit from the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions . �
Florida : The Commercial Bank Model
Economist and author Farid Khavari , a Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida , proposes a state - owned bank that would lend directly to borrowers .
The Bank of North Dakota usually uses a �lead lender � such as a bank , savings and loan company , or credit union rather than doing commercial lending directly .
Dr. Khavari maintains that the Bank of the State of Florida could be launched at no cost to taxpayers by using the state�s assets as the reserves for making loans , employing the same fractional reserve lending rules used by private banks today .
In this way , he says , the bank could drive an �economic miracle� in Florida , instigating massive job creation , cutting costs in half or more , providing low interest financing to homeowners and businesses , and improving teacher salaries and care for veterans and the elderly , while at the same reducing taxes .
He explains :
� The economy is collapsing due to lack of demand .
The economy needs money , but the banks are cutting credit , and then sucking all the cash out of the economy by raising interest rates to make sure no one has any cash left at the end of the month .
The cost of interest is built into the cost of everything .
People already work ten years of their lives just to pay interest in one form or another .
The Bank of the State of Florida will end that for Floridians .
And this model will work for every state .
. . .
� We can pay 6 % interest on savings .
Using the same fractional reserve rules as all banks , we can create $ 900 of new money through loans for every $ 100 in deposits .
We can loan that $ 900 in the form of 2 % fixed rate 15 - year mortgages , for example , and the state can earn $ 12 every year for every $ 100 in deposits .
That means Floridians can save tens of billions of dollars per year while the state earns billions making it possible for them .
� State and local government budgets will balance without higher taxes when the BSF cuts interest costs .
6 % BSF credit cards will save people billions per month , money that stays in Florida instead of going to the big banks �and the state will make huge profits on that , too .
Saving billions in interest costs will create millions of jobs without subsidies just by keeping those billions circulating in Florida .
Eventually the state will earn enough to reduce and eliminate state and local taxes while every Floridian has economic security in a recession - proof Florida .��
The Federal Reserve states on its website that the banking system as a whole leverages $ 100 in deposits into $ 900 in loans , but whether a single bank can do it alone has been challenged .
Critics say that while banks do create money as loans , they have to replace the deposits when the checks leave the bank in order for the checks to clear .
How this all works is a bit complicated and will be the subject of another article , but suffice it to say here in response that if a bank does not have the deposits to cover its outgoing checks , it borrows from the interbank lending market at very low rates , or issues commercial paper or CDs ; and the state bank could do the same thing .
It would not be fighting with the other banks for old deposits .
Loans create new deposits , which can be borrowed back from the pool of �excess deposits � thereby created .
Ninety - seven percent of the money supply has been created by commercial banks by turning loans into deposits , but that credit machine has frozen up .
A state bank could get it flowing again .
California : Catching the Wave
California leads the nation in the sheer size of its budget gap .
It too now has a gubernatorial candidate proposing to alleviate the state�s credit woes with a state - owned bank .
Running on the Green Party ticket , Laura Wells is a former financial analyst who received 420,000 votes in her 2002 bid for State Controller , more than any other Green Party candidate has earned in a partisan statewide race .
According to her website :
� Rather than drowning in debt and begging Wall Street for loans , California can institute a State Bank that invests in California 's infrastructure , and future generations . �
She stated in a comment , � A state bank for California is part of my platform as a candidate for the Green Party nomination for Governor .
I ran for State Controller to � Follow the Money . �
Now , we need to Fix the Money .
A state bank would keep California 's wealth in the state .
Rather than invest in Wall Street ( we 've hit the wall on that one ) we can invest in our infrastructure and our future generations . �
Legislative Proposals
It is not just political hopefuls who are exploring the public bank option .
Therese Murray currently presides over the Massachusetts State Senate .
She has introduced legislation that would study the formation of a state - owned bank with the principal aim of boosting job creation in the state .
Massachusetts now faces a 9.4 percent unemployment rate .
� It wouldn�t be in competition with our small community banks , � she says .
� We�ve got to free up some credit , and mortgage companies and banks have got to do a better job of allowing people to redo their mortgages . �
In Virginia , Congressman Bob Marshall , a Republican , introduced a bill in January to study whether to establish a bank that was owned , run , and controlled by the state .
However , the plan was tabled in committee .
On February 16 , the front page of the Huffington Post featured an article on the Bank of North Dakota and the precedent it sets for financially - strapped states .
Besides political candidates promoting this option , it noted that a Washington State legislator and a Vermont House committee were exploring it .
North Dakota hit the Wall Street wall in 1919 , when the Bank of North Dakota was established by the state legislature specifically to free farmers and small businessmen from the clutches of out - of - state bankers .
For over 90 years , it has demonstrated the success of the public banking model .
Other credit - choked states are finally taking notice and devising their own variations on the theme .

The physiological theory that underpins all endurance training and coaching for the last 100 years has just been disproved .
As recently as 2008 , scientific research papers were citing the theory that endurance performance is limited by the capacity of the skeletal muscles , heart and lungs and that exhaustion occurs when the active muscles are unable to produce the force or power required by prolonged exercise .
Dr Sam Marcora , an exercise physiologist at Bangor University , has now disproved this for the first time and proposed an alternative - that it is your perception of effort that limits your endurance performance , not the actual capability of your muscles .
He showed that the muscles were still able to achieve the power output required by endurance exercise even when the point of perceived exhaustion had been reached .
This will inevitably lead to new training and coaching techniques , based on this new understanding of the role of perceived effort in endurance performance .
What Marcora has found is that athletes give up endurance exercise , feeling that they are exhausted , before reaching their absolute physiological limit .
In fact , immediately after exhaustion , the leg muscles are capable of producing three times the power output required by high - intensity cycling exercise .
Like other bodily sensations , perception of effort is a powerful feeling that is there for a reason .
The perception that we have reached exhaustion prevents us from injuring ourselves by exercising too much .
Marcora uses the analogy of pain - if you twist your ankle you might still be able to undertake the mechanics of walking , but the pain prevents you - and so prevents you from causing further injury - so it is with perceived exhaustion , he argues .
The question for sports scientists , coaches and athletes has to be how far can athletes go beyond that perceived exhaustion to improve performance still further ?
" We are already developing and testing new training techniques based on the neurobiology of perceived effort that will help endurance athletes improve their performance , " says Marcora .
The original theory led to the development of countless training developments , such as heart rate monitors , eating carbohydrates to replenish glycogen in the tired muscles and even blood doping , so that the haemoglobin carries more oxygen to the active muscles .
" These techniques have been proved to be effective - and are still effective , " says Sam Marcora , " but we now have a new theoretical model of endurance performance and this in turn will lead to further techniques and coaching strategies to help endurance athletes to improve their performance .

The limit to exercise tolerance in humans : mind over muscle ?

Almost every sector of American society greeted yesterday ’s signing of a historic health care law as a major step toward guaranteeing affordable health insurance for all .
Labor unions , health care professionals , small business owners , retirees , students , and ordinary people from throughout the country applauded President Obama and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi for having the tenacity to push through what ’s being called the most sweeping health care legislation since the establishment of Medicare in the 1960s .
We join with those who hail this legislation both as a measure that will save lives now and begin curbing the insurance industry , and as a giant first step to further reforms that will provide quality , affordable health care for every person in the United States .
Beyond that , its passage is a major defeat for the far right – the Republican Party , sections of Corporate America , and their fascist - like tea party shock troops .
The enactment of this bill is an enormous victory for the broad progressive movement in our country .
It will give energy and enthusiasm to that movement as it mobilizes and builds for the struggles ahead to advance a pro-worker , pro-people agenda .
The far right has been left glaringly isolated but perhaps even more dangerously aggressive .
These racist hate - mongers fought viciously to block the bill on behalf of the nation ’s insurance companies and now say they will continue their dirty campaign by trying to repeal it .
But it ’s clear that an energized people ’s movement will not let that happen .
Even organizations and individuals critical of the bill ( because of restrictions on women ’s reproductive rights , or its exclusion of undocumented immigrants , or because it does n’t go far enough ) have acknowledged its importance and far - reaching implications .
The great majority of health care reform advocates , including those who call for a single - payer system , see the legislation as opening up space to further the struggle for Medicare for all .
Many note the bill provides a number of immediate benefits .
AFL - CIO President Richard Trumka called the bill ’s passage a “ momentous step toward comprehensive coverage ” and vowed that labor will continue to advocate for health care that works for working families .
The new law reestablishes the role of government in providing a “ safety net ” to support ordinary folks against the most outrageous excesses of our health care system .
As President Obama put it , “ It enshrines the idea that everybody should have universal health care . ”
The fight is n’t over .
The corporate - backed far right will continue to use racism , lies and anti-government conspiracy theories to try to scare and confuse people .
We got some ugly glimpses of this just as Congress was on the eve of passing the health care bill .
Tea party protesters in Ohio yelled at and abused a man with Parkinson ’s disease because he was courageous enough to show his support for health care reform .
In Washington , others yelled racist and homophobic epithets at members of Congress .
Some call it the tea- partiers ’ Bull Connor moment .
Connor was the racist , pro-segregation “ public safety ” commissioner in Birmingham , Ala. , who used dogs and fire hoses against African American children standing up against Jim Crow in the 1960s .
Just as the American people rejected the Bull Connor segregationists after seeing the fire - hosing of children in Birmingham , the American people will reject the vicious racism and hate - filled attacks of today ’s Bull Connors .
After almost a year of lobbying , demonstrations , petitions , rallies , health care story collections , town hall meetings , this is a moment to savor a hard - fought victory .
And it ’s a moment to celebrate the persistence and tenacity of the people ’s movement for progressive change – a good thing since there are many more battles ahead .

Rubens Barrichello has warned Nico Rosberg that he may need to ' get out ' of Mercedes GP if he wants to achieve his full potential in Formula 1 , now that Michael Schumacher is his team - mate .
Barrichello has mixed emotions about his lengthy spell alongside Schumacher at Ferrari - especially as he had to play a number two role for most of his time there .
When asked if he had any advice for Schumacher 's new team - mate Rosberg , Barrichello 's cheeky response was : " Yeah .
Get out of there !
That is the only thing I can tell him .
He needs to drive fast and do n't crash : Ross will always tell you that before the race . "
Although Barrichello admits his comment is slightly extreme , he does think that the speed that Schumacher showed on his return to F1 action at Valencia should serve as a warning to Rosberg .
" He [ Nico ] is a great talent and I wish him all the best , and maybe tomorrow you will see the newspapers saying , ' Rubens tells Nico to get out of there ' , but I am not being bad about it , " he said .
" Knowing what I know , and seeing how fast Michael went today , it is going to be a tough job .
I wish him all the best because I think he is a talented boy who can be world champion .
If he has the chances of being world champion in the same team as Michael , then he can be world champion anywhere .
Let 's put it this way . "
Despite his comments about racing alongside Schumacher in the same team , Barrichello has welcomed the return of veterans like the seven - time champion and Pedro de la Rosa to F1 this year .
" It is good to see them back , " he said .
" I think after last year , when I drove a competitive car and almost won the championship , it honestly gives some of the people from the paddock a different sensation .
" Because five years ago it was all about Kimi Raikkonen and new drivers - F1 wanting new drivers all the time .
With [ Robert ] Kubica it was all the same .
Now with the lack of testing , no testing , it makes the older drivers attractive . "
Lentini was born in 1889 in Rosolini in the province of Sirocusa , Sicily as one of twelve children .
Technically , he was one of 12 and a half children .
His twin brother , who consisted of a leg and a set of genitals , was born attached to Francesco ’s spine .
While he was billed as ‘ The Man With Three Legs ’ , Lentini actually had four feet as a small malformed secondary foot protruded from his third leg .
Thus in total he had three legs , four feet , sixteen toes and two sets of functioning male genitals .
Furthermore , to complicate his life further , all of Francesco ’s legs were of different lengths .
As a child , Lentini hated his extra limbs and appendages .
Doctors determined that because of their proximity to his spine , removal could have resulted in paralysis .
Lentini was raised by his aunt after his parents refused to acknowledge him and she , meaning well , enrolled the young Lentini into a home for disabled children .
While there he saw children far worse off than he .
He saw children who could not walk at all and he gained a new appreciation for life .
Lentini not only learned to walk , he also ran , jumped rope , rode a bicycle and even ice skate .
His time at the home for disabled children was an experience he quoted for many years as his major motivation .
In 1898 , at the age of eight , Lentini arrived in America and became an instant sensation .
He charmed crowds with his keen wit and sense of humor .
He wowed audiences with his unusual agility as well .
He had amazing control over his extra appendage .
During performances , Lentini was well known for kicking a soccer ball about with the strange limb .
As he grew older , Lentini ’s performances focused on his charming character .
He would conduct interviews while propped up on his extra limb , using it as a stool .
He fielded questions ranging from his innocent hobbies to the particulars of his sex life .
He was also often asked about his shoes .
People wondered if it was difficult to buy shoes in a set of three .
Showing his mental sharpness , he always revealed that he bought two pairs and gave the extra one to a one - legged friend .
His charm did not go unnoticed and a young lady named Theresa Murray soon took a liking to Lentini .
The pair soon wed and together they had four healthy children .
Lentini continued touring until he died at the age of seventy - eight in 1966 .
His career spanned over forty years and he worked with every major circus and sideshow including Barnum & Bailey and Coney Island .
Lentini was so respected among his peers that he was often simply called ‘ The King ’ .
Deep in the president 's budget released Monday — in Table S - 8 on page 161 — appear a set of proposals headed " Reform U.S. International Tax System . "
If these proposals are enacted , U.S. - based multinational firms will face $ 122.2 billion in tax increases over the next decade .
This is a natural follow - up to President Obama 's sweeping plan announced last May entitled " Leveling the Playing Field : Curbing Tax Havens and Removing Tax Incentives for Shifting Jobs Overseas . "
The fundamental assumption behind these ...
On the projector , he placed a picture of the hand of a gibbon , another human cousin .
“ There ’s the opposable thumb , ” he said , wiggling his own .
“ But theirs is a longer hand because they live in trees , and their arms are very long . ”
Mr. Campbell bent over , walking on the outer part of his foot .
He had intended to mimic how arms became shorter and legs became longer .
He planned to tell the class how our upright gait , built on a body plan inherited from tree - dwelling primates , made us prone to lower back pain .
And how , over the last two million years , our jaws have grown shorter , which is why wisdom teeth so often need to be removed .
But too many hands had gone up .
He answered as fast as he could , his pulse quickening as it had rarely done since his days on his high school debate team .
“ If that really happened , ” Allie wanted to know , “ would n’t you still see things evolving ? ”
“ We do , ” he said .
“ But this is happening over millions of years .
With humans , if I ’m lucky I might see four generations in my lifetime . ”
Caitlin Johnson , 15 , was next .
“ If we had to have evolved from something , ” she wanted to know , “ then whatever we evolved from , where did IT evolve from ? ”
“ It came from earlier primates , ” Mr. Campbell replied .
“ And where did those come from ? ”
“ You can trace mammals back 250 million years , ” he said .
The first ones , he reminded them , were small , mouselike creatures that lived in the shadow of dinosaurs .
Other students were jumping in .
“ Even if we did split off from chimps , ” someone asked , “ how come they stayed the same but we changed ? ”
Hidden From History will be on view in the Louisiana Division / City Archives , third floor , Main Library , 219 Loyola Avenue , from October 7 , 2008 .
The online version will remain available here indefinitely .
The exhibit was curated by Emily Epstein Landau and funded in part by the Sexuality Research Fellowship Program ( 1999 ) , a program of the Social Science Research Council , with funding from the Ford Foundation .
Dr. Landau received her doctorate from Yale University in 2005 .
Her dissertation , " Spectacular Wickedness " : New Orleans , Prostitution , and the Politics of Sex , 1897 - 1917 , is a history of Storyville , the famous red - light district .
She will be teaching New Orleans history this Spring , as a visiting lecturer at the University of Maryland , College Park .
She lives in Washington , DC .
The exhibit was mounted by staff members of the Louisiana Division / City Archives .
The online version was designed by Irene Wainwright .

This exhibit focuses on people who worked and lived in New Orleans beyond the view of tourists and business interests , who eked out an existence on the margins of respectability , who struggled to survive in the urban jungle .
The last third of the nineteenth century brought momentous changes to American culture and society .
The population nearly doubled , and for the first time America became more urban than rural .
The growing cities were emblems of American progress and technological ascendancy , but they also generated fear .
Indeed , the turn - of - the - century city harbored fear , creating a focal point for myriad anxieties afflicting late - nineteenth - century Americans .
Cities , with their anonymity , their lack of community , their immigrants , their poor , their unmoored , their dark and dirty corners , threatened to dismantle the moral order even as they promised to advance prosperity and progress .
New Orleans is one of the country ’s oldest cities .
Indeed , New Orleans was a city before it was American !
In the 1890s , hoping to attract tourists and capital to the ailing city , business leaders drew on the city ’s long history to boost New Orleans as the city of “ Old Romance and New Opportunity . ”
Celebrated for its cosmopolitan diversity , its international exoticism , and its metropolitan sophistication ; yet infamous , too , for moral lassitude , prostitution , and political corruption , New Orleans has always embodied the contrasts and contradictions of urban life .
Known as “ the city that care forgot , ” imagined ( and promoted ) as a seductress on the banks of the Mississippi , New Orleans has long been associated with a lack of consequences , a care - free kind of freedom .
But for people who lived and worked in New Orleans , people who served the pleasure economy , people who toiled for the sugar , rice , tobacco , and other export markets , and for people who were unable to work at all , the city was not so indulgent , not so forgiving .
This exhibit illustrates through photographs and documents the interface between authority and poor people in turn - of - the - century New Orleans .
Some of the city 's poor turned to petty crime or prostitution , while others got by selling cakes and sandwiches in their neighborhoods .
Some struggled desperately with alcoholism and paranoid delusions .
Others went insane on account of extreme worry or family troubles .
One man was committed to the insane asylum for mania caused by love — or at least that is what the ledger book records .
The stories presented here , though fragmented and incomplete , highlight the struggles of people on the margins of society and belie the image of New Orleans as a city of care - free good times .
The people grouped here may have had nothing in common except that their lives intersected with the municipality at least once .
This exhibit brings them together in part to show how the city classified them .
The documents and photographs here are therefore not representative of those New Orleanians who lived their lives quietly and within the law ; they are necessarily skewed toward those who erred or strayed , who got caught or got in trouble , or , conversely , those who actively sought assistance from the city .
New Orleans did not have much to offer the truly needy in the last years of the nineteenth century or the first years of the twentieth .
Maintaining order was , however , paramount , and for this purpose the city had several choices ; among them were the city jail , the Charity Hospital , the insane asylum , the poor house , and sometimes even exile .
The city ’s various institutions produced records , and so , this exhibit also showcases the collections at the New Orleans Public Library .
In the City Archives of the Louisiana Division , one may find traces of people who did not leave their own written accounts or legacies , but who touched the system at some point in their lives and so had their names recorded .
Some even had their pictures taken .
This exhibit offers a glimpse into the lives of some of those anonymous urban dwellers , those unknown New Orleanians .

One of the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's founding principles was Mitch Kapor 's aphorism , " Architecture is politics . "
The design of systems determines the kinds of politics that can take place in them , and designing a system is itself a political act .
As part of EFF 's ongoing 20th anniversary celebrations , it held a panel called " Architecture is policy " at Carnegie - Mellon , featuring Ed Felten , Dave Farber , Lorrie Cranor , John Buckman , and Cindy Cohn — all heavy hitters in their own right , and dynamite together .
This is one of the more thoughtful and thought - provoking hours you could spend today .

Oops .
Republican John Shadegg appeared on MSNBC just after Dennis Kucinich made his statement saying that he was going to vote for the health care bill .
While arguing against the mandate to buy insurance Shadegg let 's one slip and basically made the argument for having single payer health insurance .
As The Hill noted , he quickly switched gears .
Shadegg ( R ) : ' I would support single payer ' over individual mandate :
Shadegg blasted the for - profit health insurance industry during an appearance on MSNBC today , finally declaring , " I would support single payer . "
He quickly clarified his comment , saying he would simply like to see health insurance companies have more competition .
" I would support forcing American healthcare companies to compete right , " he said " Now they have a monopoly . "
That 's similar to the argument Democrats have made for the public option , and in a statement to The Hill , Shadegg 's office said a public option would be better than requiring individuals to buy insurance from the for - profit sector .
Read on ...
David Shuster did a pretty good job here .
It is humorous to watch these Republicans spinning so badly in an attempt to attack the Democrats that they 're going from repeating Dennis Kucinich 's point about why we should have single payer in one breath and then talking about high risk pools in the next .
I do n't recall any support for single payer coming from Shadegg on the House floor over the last year .
Instead he was busy using a baby as a prop while he talked about the " dangers " of government run health care .
These Republicans never seem to run out of goal posts to move .
I know a lot of people are mad at Kucinich for changing his vote .
I 'm not happy with this whole deal but I say cut him some slack .
He did n't have any good options to deal with and not passing this bill is political suicide for the Democrats right now and he knows it .
There 's no reason we can't keep pushing these guys for a Medicare buy in as Grayson is proposing and for single payer after this passes .
This fight is n't over if the bill does pass and I know Dennis will be one of the ones continuing to push the party to do the right thing .
I 'm not ready to throw him or Bernie Sanders or any of the other progressive Democrats who vote for this bill under the bus .
They 're not what 's wrong with our Congress .
The problem is there are n't enough of them .
We can keep pushing the Democrats to do the right thing and supporting primary challengers against the ones who wo n't or we can throw our hands up and let the party that has " moved into a mental hospital " back in power .
We 're stuck with a two party system right now so I 'll take the former .
I shudder at the thought of a President Romney or Palin , a Leader McConnell , a Speaker Boehner and a Michele Bachmann chairing some committee in the House .
I had enough of the wingnuts running the show under Bush to last me for the rest of my life and that was before they started ratcheting up the crazy the way they are now .

Seeing someone perform a virtuous deed ( especially if they are helping another person ) , makes us feel good , often eliciting a warm , fuzzy feeling in our chest .
This positive , uplifting emotion , known as " elevation , " might make us feel great , but is it enough to get us to go out and perform good acts ourselves ?
According to new findings reported in Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , the answer may be yes .
Psychological scientists Simone Schnall from the University of Cambridge , Jean Roper from the University of Plymouth , and Daniel M.T. Fessler from the University of California , Los Angeles , wanted to investigate the influence of elevation on behavior .
Volunteers viewed either a neutral TV clip ( showing scenes from a nature documentary ) or an uplifting TV clip ( a segment from " The Oprah Winfrey Show " showing musicians thanking their mentors ) that was designed to induce feelings of elevation and then wrote an essay describing what they watched .
As they received their payment and a receipt , they were to indicate if they would be willing to participate in an additional study .
The results revealed that participants who watched the uplifting TV clip were more likely to volunteer for another research study than volunteers who saw the neutral TV clip , suggesting that elevation may make us more willing to help others .
However , anybody can say they will volunteer for a subsequent study or would be willing to help another person .
The researchers wanted to see if elevation can result in actual helping behavior .
In the next experiment , a different set of volunteers watched one of three TV clips : the neutral TV clip or the uplifting TV clip used previously , or a clip from a British comedy , intended to induce mirth .
After they viewed the TV clip , the research assistant conducting the study pretended to have problems opening up a computer file that was required for the experiment .
She told the volunteers that they were free to leave but as they were leaving , she asked them if they would be willing to complete a questionnaire for another study ( unbeknownst to the volunteers , the actual experiment was measuring whether or not they helped with the additional study ) .
The researcher noted the questionnaire was boring and that the volunteers could leave whenever they wanted .
The results of this second experiment were striking -- the participants who viewed the uplifting TV clip spent almost twice as long helping the research assistant than participants who saw the neutral TV clip or the comedy clip , indicating that elevation may lead to helping behavior .
The authors conclude that " by eliciting elevation , even brief exposure to other individuals ' prosocial behavior motivates altruism , thus potentially providing an avenue for increasing the general level of prosociality in society . "

Ron Shusett ( executive producer / screenwriter ) : Ridley did n't tell the cast .
He said , " They 're just going to see it . "
Sigourney Weaver ( Ripley ) :
They were crafty .
They pitched the story so that you feel John Hurt 's character would be the only true hero among us .
Veronica Cartwright ( Lambert ) : We read the script .
They showed us a mock - up , but they did n't show how it was going to work .
They just said , " Its head will move and it 's going to have teeth . "
Weaver :
All it said in the script was , " This thing emerges . "
Ridley Scott ( director ) :
The reactions were going to be the most difficult thing .
If an actor is just acting terrified , you can't get the genuine look of raw , animal fear .
Cartwright :
They take John down in the morning to prep him and we 're upstairs for four hours .
We 're sitting upstairs and nobody knows what the hell is going on .
Harry Dean [ Stanton ] is sitting in the hall playing his guitar .
Scott : Prosthetics in those days were n't that good .
I figured the best thing to do was to get stuff from a butcher 's shop and a fishmonger .
On the morning we had them examining the Facehugger ; that was clams , oysters , seafood .
You had to be ready to shoot because it started to smell pretty quickly .
You can't make better stuff than that - it 's organic .
Dan O'Bannon ( executive producer / screenwriter ) :
Once the creature was rigged up , they stuffed the chest cavity full of organs from the butcher's .
Then they ran a couple of big hoses to pump the stage blood .
During all this Ridley moved about , tending to the finest detail .
I remember easily half an hour was spent with him draping this little piece of beef organ so it would hang out of the creature 's mouth .
Scott :
We had an artificial chest screwed to the table .
John was underneath : it was an illusion his neck was attached to the body .
Cartwright :
When they finally take us down , the whole set is in a big plastic bag and everybody is wearing raingear and there are huge buckets around .
The formaldehyde smell automatically made you queasy .
And John is lying there .
Weaver : Everyone was wearing raincoats - we should have been a little suspicious .
And , oh God , the smell .
It was just awful .
Shusett : He had four cameras running .
Two guys , technicians , were under the table with a compressed blood machine .
Nobody said a word , but Sigourney looked really scared .
I said , " You 're really getting into character . "
She said , " No , I have a feeling I 'm going to be pretty repulsed right now . "
Yaphet Kotto ( Parker ) :
We were all wondering what the hell was going on .
Why is the crew looking at us the way they 're looking at us right now ?
Why are they wearing plastic shields ?
Cartwright :
They have four cameras going .
You see this thing start to come out , so we all get sucked in , we lean forward to check it out .
They shout , " Cut ! "
They cut John 's T - shirt a little more because it was n't going to burst through .
Then they said , " Let 's start again . "
We all start leaning forward again and all of a sudden it comes out .
I tell you , none of us expected it .
It came out and twisted round .
Weaver : All I could think of was John , frankly .
I was n't even thinking that we were making a movie .
Ivor Powell ( associate producer ) : I had n't expected it to be quite that intense .
Weaver : Look , I worked with Roman Polanski on Death and the Maiden - he would shoot a gun off .
You can act , sure , but when you 're surprised , that 's gold .
Shusett : Veronica Cartwright - when the blood hit her , she passed out .
I heard from Yaphet Kotto's wife that after that scene he went to his room and would n't talk to anybody .
Kotto :
Oh man !
It was real , man .
We did n't see that coming .
We were freaked .
The actors were all frightened .
And Veronica nutted out .
O'Bannon :
This jet of blood , about 3ft long , caught her smack in the kisser .

It was n't a game .

( Newser ) – What with all the breastfeeding , diaper washing , and not smoking while pregnant , mothers have become enslaved to their “ tyrant ” babies .
That ’s the opinion of French feminist philosopher Elisabeth Badinter , who sees women giving up their lives in the service of their young ones — and risking women 's liberation by becoming oppressed by their own children .
“ We live 80 or 85 years , ” she tells the Times , “ and children take up 20 to 25 years of that .
Staking your whole life on 20 years is a bad bet . ”
The mother of three does n’t hate kids ; they just become too much of a burden if you listen to the advice of breastfeeding advocates and environmentalists : “ Between the protection of trees and the liberty of women , my choice is clear . ”
Did she smoke while pregnant ?
“ Of course , ” she says .
" You do n’t enter a religious order when you have children . "
Badinter ’s conclusion : The French have “ always been mediocre mothers . ”
But “ we ’ve tended to have happier lives . ”
So lighten up , break out the formula , hire a nanny , and let the good times roll .

A team of scientists working in a ­threatened rainforest in Ecuador have discovered a species of snail sucking snake , 30 varieties of frog , and a gecko so small it can perch on top of a pencil .
But the finds come from an area that is being rapidly deforested and the animals could soon become extinct .
About 95 % of the trees around Cerro Pata de Pájaro – the area of rain and cloud forest in the west of the country where the species were discovered – have been felled for farming , said Paul ­Hamilton who led the ­expedition for ­Reptile & Amphibian Ecology International .
In the remaining forest cover , he said the scientists had come across several important discoveries .
Each ­mountaintop in the region is its own microhabitat , with its own variety of frog , lizard , and other small animal .
" In this part of ­Ecuador , if you go to one spot you can find 20 or 30 species of frog , and if you go to the next site over you will see a whole bunch of different ones , " said Hamilton .
Important discoveries included a snake with striking red markings with a blunt snout " made just perfectly for jamming into the hole of a snail shell and providing that suction to suck the snail right out of there " ; frogs which lay their eggs in trees , rather than in water ; salamanders that have dispensed with lungs and breathe entirely through their skin , geckos and least four previously unseen types of stick insect .
But the animals ' habitat is being threatened by deforestation and climate change .
The rise in temperatures and drought are forcing animals to move to higher elevation in search of cooler , wetter ­climates .
Frogs which depend on the moist tree cover to protect their eggs could be especially at risk .
“ We choose not to go to the moon .
We choose not to go to the moon in the foreseeable future and not to do the other things , not because they are hard , but because they are expensive , because that goal will serve only to waste our energies and skills , because that challenge is one that we are unwilling to pay for , one we are unwilling to continue , and one which we intend to abandon … ”
Of course , I ’m paraphrasing the speech that , nearly 50 years ago , set the lunar dream in motion .
With mere words , John F. Kennedy placed his nation on a path that would lead it to accomplish the greatest feat in human history .
As a direct result of JFK ’s inspiration , the United States has landed on the moon seven times .
Brave men with manly names like Buzz , Conrad , Shepard , Harrison and Armstrong took flight aboard craft like Eagle , Intrepid , Antares and Challenger .
Each time , the world watched , dreamed , and cheered .
In the years since the Apollo program ended , the missions have taken on nearly legendary status , leading the disillusioned to the idiotic notion that such an undertaking was simply too massive to have been real .
It was n’t .
It just took one man with vision , a person who actually believed that America could achieve the impossible , to articulate a dream .
Shortly before George W. Bush left office , he created the Constellation program and we began the adventure again .
We were to reach the Moon ’s surface by 2020 .
Unfortunately , with the stroke of the budgetary pen , President Barack Obama has gutted NASA ’s budget , ending the nascent moon mission and pounding a major nail into the coffin of U.S. - manned space exploration .
The space shuttle program has only five more missions before its retirement .
After that , Americans will reach the International Space Station aboard Russian Soyuz capsules until 2020 .
Beyond that , there are no plans for Americans to return to space .
Do n’t worry , though , Obama assures us that NASA will have enough cash to keep doing research into the bogus science of man-made global warming .
As the president said during a speech last week , there will still be funding for what he termed “ programs I care about . ”
Since the moon shot is obviously not something that captures the current presidential imagination , it ’s gone — sacrificed to the laughable notion of fiscal responsibility within the largest , most bloated , irresponsible budget in history .
Instead , Obama has taken $ 6 billion from NASA , one - third of its 2009 budget , and offered it to private companies to encourage their space initiatives .
Rather than do something that inspires pride in their country ’s ambition , Americans will be able to watch as corporations line up to kiss the federal ring , grab some tax dollars , and spend it on low - end rockets that will push the wealthy into orbit for a few seconds at a time .
Here ’s hoping they ’ve unionized , helped get the president elected , or promised some sort of future campaign donation kickback , because , as we ’ve seen with the government auto takeover , Obama does n’t embrace the private sector unless it benefits Democrats directly .
Americans will also be able to enjoy the view as China pursues its own lunar dreams , since the Chinese National Space Agency has managed to find the enthusiasm Obama lacks .
If things continue as it appears they will , the next two decades will see the CNSA emerge as the global leader in manned spaceflight , likely achieving their goal of reaching the moon sometime between 2020 and 2025 .
In the end , the most disturbing thing about the president ’s decision to eviscerate NASA is that it accomplishes absolutely nothing .
If it somehow fixed his massive budgetary problems , there might be a justification .
Sadly , it does n’t .
His budget still creates a trillion dollars of new debt , per year , for the next 10 years .
The money he ’s taken from the space program does nothing to stem the tide of red ink , will serve to increase unemployment , and fails , in every way , to advance the American cause .
So why are we choosing this course ?
Imagine how different the world would be if JFK had gone to Rice Stadium in 1962 , stood before that crowd , and opted to squash the concept of American exceptionalism in favor of a negligible , short - term , financial gain .
Obama has done just that , embracing instead the failed ideology of Walter Mondale , who once said NASA was “ a waste of money that would be better spent on welfare . ”
If Democrats were smart , they ’d ignore Mondale in favor of their flawed forebear , Lyndon Johnson , who said “ I do not believe that this generation of Americans is willing to resign itself to going to bed each night by the light of a communist moon . ”
It was true then , and it still rings true today .
Perhaps there ’s still some hope .
Maybe Congress will do the right thing and reject this nonsense .
If not , President Obama ’s most prominent legacy may be the Democrat PR disaster of a Chinese flag planted at Tranquility Base — a nightmare scenario , at least to those of us who still believe in the inherent greatness of this nation .

The auto industrial complex impacts our lives in many ways but does n’t often produce compelling fashion accoutrements , which makes sense .
However , the Gear Ring by Kinetk Design is trying to change all of that .
If this ring looks like it ’s ready to spring into action , that ’s because it ’s actually fully functional .
Six micro-precision gears running along the face simultaneously turn when the outer rims ( which are also gears ) are turned .
I can just pictures these rings being exchanged during nuptials all across the country by motor - head fanatics .
The Gear Ring is made out of 316L surgical stainless steel , the highest quality found in the jewelry market , making it resistant to rusting , tarnishing , fading and scratching .
It also wo n’t break or bend and is hypoallergenic , a plus for those with metal sensitivities .
I ’ve always appreciated the aesthetics of stainless steel accessories from companies like TENO , but the interactiveness and functionality of this ring definitely steps things up .
The Gear Ring is produced in the following standard sizes : 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 .
Amazingly , this diminutive marvel is available for the mere price of $ 165 .

In winter during the late afternoon before settling down to roost , flocks of thousands of starlings will twist and turn , turning the sky black with strange curves that seem to move with a mind of their own .
The flocks of up to a million strong form for warmth , for security , and for social contact .
These seething clouds of birds have no leader , no planning , and yet produce a dance that seems choreographed in its precision and beauty .
So how do they do it ?
Some strange ability given to them , a unique skill among the animal kingdom ?
Well , perhaps not quite .
Consider that humans seem to be able to move in crowds with the same ease , although some might say with a bit less beauty .
People seem to move in clumps , in the same direction , and manage to not trample each other or collide .
There seem to be parallels in crowds of organisms , that this order emerges consistently and that somehow each animal “ knows ” what to do on a small scale , resulting in cohesive and sensible group movement .
The question then becomes – what exactly are we doing unconsciously to organize like this ?
The Boid Model
In 1986 Craig Reynolds produced a computer model describing how large groups of animals such as schools , herds , and flocks could be able to move in unison with no central coordination .
He called his creations “ boids ” , and imagined that each would follow some simple , sensible rules to navigate around .
He also knew a single animal would never be able to keep track of every other animal in the group , and assumed that they would only pay attention to their immediate neighbors in the flock .
So if you were a boid , what rules would you follow ?
Alignment : Look around you .
Where is everyone else going ?
Probably a good idea to go there too .
Alignment is a rule that finds the average direction your neighbours are going , and tells you to go there too .
Cohesion : Predators look to pick off stragglers on the edge of the pack .
Cohesion is a rule that finds the average position of your neighbors and tells you to go there , pulling you into the relative safety of the center of the pack .
Separation :
When crowds get big , they can get dangerous .
Animals can trample each other , and birds can collide .
Separation is a rule that tells you to make sure to give your neighbors some space .
How do we know how to do this ?
Well , the tautological answer is that it simply works .
The beauty of these rules is that each of them is amazingly simple , and seem to make sense to us on an intuitive level .
We tend to go with the crowd , stick together , and still try to give everyone a bit of personal space .
But are these rules enough to produce the complex dance of the starlings , or are we missing some detail ?
A Boid Dance
It turns out these simple rules produce patterns of movement that are anything but .
We can see that it looks flowing and wonderfully organic – but it ’s not quite the same as the starling flocks .
We can play with the boid model , tuning its various parameters to see how the resulting crowds might react .
A school of fish trying to avoid predators might be modeled best by weighting the cohesiveness rule very heavily , attempting to keep together at all costs while not worrying too much about personal space or where precisely they ’re heading as long as it ’s away from what ’s trying to eat you .
A flock of geese flying south for the winter will focus on heading in a certain direction ( alignment ) , then space themselves out to ensure they can see in front of themselves ( seperation ) while staying close enough and on the same plane to experience the aerodynamic benefits of flying in a group ( cohesion ) producing the “ flying V ” we see so often in fall .
Migrating animals are primarily concerned with making sure they ’re going in the same direction as everyone else ( alignment ) while ensuring that no one is trampled ( seperation ) and that young and weak animals are protected in the center of the herd ( cohesion ) .
For instance , the wildebeest stampede that killed Simba ’s father in the Lion King was generated using the same theory as the boid model .
This simple model has a wide range of possible applications , and a huge amount of flexibility allowing it to produce a wide range of behavioural simulations .
This gorgeous installation of light graffiti uses the rules we ’ve just discussed to create hypnotizing patterns of artificial creatures .
The boid model has been used to animate realistic looking behavior over a huge range of media .
If you ’ve seen a computer generated crowd moving in a vaguely sensible manner anywhere , it likely uses the same basic theory .
The power of the model comes from its construction , assuming simple behaviors competing for influence that result in a complex outcome not unlike our own consciousness or political systems .
Not too shabby for a research project from over 20 years ago .
A paper published in Nature this week details how researchers have taken a common antenna design and replicated it on the the nanoscale level .
When a regular TV aerial that handles radio frequencies is scaled down to nanometer sizes and slightly modified , the result was a tiny antenna that could direct light of nanometer wavelengths .
The resulting optical antenna array could help improve the design of nanoscale sensors and detectors .
Those old TV antennas , consisting of multiple crossbars , are called Yagi - Uda antennas , named for their inventors .
The design of Yagi - Uda antennas is based on a simple principle : a metallic wire resonates strongly if its length matches half of the relevant wavelength .
To tune into TV and radio wavelengths , which are around a meter long , the Yagi - Uda uses bars of half that length to pick up the appropriate signals .
The design proved to be popular because it is highly directional and can receive or broadcast a strong signal .
To make the design work at the nanoscale level , scientists made tiny crossbars , about a hundred nanometers long , and arranged them in the Yagi - Uda configuration .
They made a slight alteration in the design so that the feed bar was tilted 45 degrees , allowing it to be excited by an electric field in a manner that is independent of the other bars .
Once arranged , the nano - antenna array was able to direct visible light on the scale of its tiny antenna bars .
The resonant wavelengths were around a few hundred nanometers , corresponding to the orange and red sections of the spectrum — that 's a larger multiple of the antenna bar length than the standard Yagi - Uda antenna , but still quite useful .
The nano - array 's creators hope that the itty - bitty antenna will find wide use in optical nanotechnology .

Using the latest in aberration - corrected electron microscopy , researchers at the Department of Energy 's Oak Ridge National Laboratory and their colleagues have obtained the first images that distinguish individual light atoms such as boron , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen .
The ORNL images were obtained with a Z - contrast scanning transmission electron microscope ( STEM ) .
Individual atoms of carbon , boron , nitrogen and oxygen -- all of which have low atomic numbers -- were resolved on a single - layer boron nitride sample .
" This research marks the first instance in which every atom in a significant part of a non-periodic material has been imaged and chemically identified , " said Materials Science and Technology Division researcher Stephen Pennycook .
" It represents another accomplishment of the combined technologies of Z - contract STEM and aberration correction . "
Pennycook and ORNL colleague Matthew Chisholm were joined by a team that includes Sokrates Pantelides , Mark Oxley and Timothy Pennycook of Vanderbilt University and ORNL ; Valeria Nicolosi at United Kingdom 's Oxford University ; and Ondrej Krivanek , George Corbin , Niklas Dellby , Matt Murfitt , Chris Own and Zotlan Szilagyi of Nion Company , which designed and built the microscope .
The team 's Z - contrast STEM analysis is described in an article published March 25 in the journal Nature .
The new high - resolution imaging technique enables materials researchers to analyze , atom by atom , the molecular structure of experimental materials and discern structural defects in those materials .
Defects introduced into a material - - for example , the placement of an impurity atom or molecule in the material 's structure -- are often responsible for the material 's properties .
The group analyzed a monolayer hexagonal boron nitride sample prepared at Oxford University and was able to find and identify three types of atomic substitutions -- carbon atoms substituting for boron , carbon substituting for nitrogen and oxygen substituting for nitrogen .
Boron , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen have atomic numbers -- or Z values -- of five , six , seven and eight , respectively .
The annular dark field analysis experiments were performed on a 100 - kilovolt Nion UltraSTEM microscope optimized for low - voltage operation at 60 kilovolts .
Aberration correction , in which distortions and artifacts caused by lens imperfections and environmental effects are computationally filtered and corrected , was conceived decades ago but only relatively recently made possible by advances in computing .
Aided by the technology , ORNL's Electron Microscopy group set a resolution record in 2004 with the laboratory 's 300 - kilovolt STEM .
The recent advance comes at a much lower voltage , for a reason .
" Operating at 60 kilovolts allows us to avoid atom - displacement damage to the sample , which is encountered with low Z - value atoms above about 80 kilovolts , " Pennycook said .
" You could not perform this experiment with a 300 - kilovolt STEM . "
Armed with the high - resolution images , materials , chemical and nanoscience researchers and theorists can design more accurate computational simulations to predict the behavior of advanced materials , which are key to meeting research challenges that include energy storage and energy efficient technologies .
The research was funded by the DOE Office of Science .
Small businesses , pay attention :
Now that the first six - core desktops are out , we wanted to see how the massive Excel spreadsheets we often use for testing purposes would perform , specifically on whether adding more cores would increase performance .
Now that the first six - core desktops are out , I wanted to see how the big spreadsheets I often use for tests would perform .
I tested on the first couple of Gulftown systems that PCMag received and ended up with good results , but I did n't always see the performance improvements I expected .
My results point out the strengths and limitations of multicore computing when it comes to heavy - duty applications .
Both machines I tested used the Intel Core i7-980 Extreme Edition , which has six cores and 12 threads .
The core 's official speed is 3.33 GHz , but the Extreme Edition designation means it was designed to be overclocked -- and both vendors did just that .
The machines had different speeds of memory , which also should impact performance .
One was the Falcon Northwest Mach V , which had a 4.18 - MHz version of the processor and 12GB of 1,333 - MHz DDR3 memory .
The other was a Maingear Shift , with the processor at 4.3 GHz and 6GB of 2,000 - MHz DDR3 memory .
Both had SSDs as boot disks as well as hard drives , though I do n't believe that has any impact on performance , and the spreadsheets are loaded in memory .
They also had ATI Radeon HD 5970 graphics , though again that 's irrelevant to spreadsheets .
( I 'm not going to try to review the machines here .
For PCMag 's reviews , click on the links above . )
For comparison , I looked at how these machines did on my basic Excel 2007 spreadsheet tests versus the fastest machine I had previously tested -- an overclocked Falcon Northwest Mach V running a previous generation of the Intel Core i7 - 965 quad - core chip at 3.99GHz .
There 's a slight difference in clock speed , but the bigger difference is that the older version was a 45 nm quad - core chip ; while the new one is a 32nm six - core one .
A Monte Carlo simulation I tried took 3.5 seconds on the quad - core system , compared with 2.5 seconds on the Falcon Northwest six - core system and 2.4 on the Maingear one .
( The difference between the two six - core systems is not significant ; I 'm not that accurate on the stopwatch .
As a result , it may be time to get a new test .
When I started using this , it took 78 seconds on a Pentium D - based system . )
That 's a notable improvement in moving from the four - core system to a six - core one .
Monte Carlo simulations in Excel really take advantage of a multithreaded system , and this shows up quite clearly .
On a pivot table with 87,000 rows of data , it took 48 seconds on the quad - core system , 35 seconds on the Falcon Northwest , and 34 second on the Maingear .
Again , it 's a nice improvement .
But my toughest test is a very large data table - driven spreadsheet , which took 56 minutes on the quad - core , 56 minutes on the Falcon Northwest six - core , and 51 minutes on the Maingear six - core .
Earlier , I had seen big improvements here based on improved clock speeds , but moving from four cores to six did n't seem to move the needle much ( and this in a spreadsheet where the differences are really notable ) .
As I looked more closely at this spreadsheet while looking at performance under task manager , it became apparent that most of the time it was really only using four threads .
In this case , the slight improvement in clock speed and the faster memory did seem to make a difference , but more cores did n't .
In part , this is the problem that we 're seeing with lots of desktop applications .
Many are sequential , in which case multiple cores or multiple threads do n't help .
And many applications have yet to be fully designed for multiple cores .
Excel 2007 , for example , was designed to make use of multiple cores only in certain special situations , such as Monte Carlo simulations ; the upcoming Excel 2010 adds more support for multitasking but still not for every function .
( I 'll write a bit more about this in a later post . )
The bottom line is that for some things , the additional cores make a big difference ; for others they do n't .
And that 's just in one application .

Kristian Segerstråle is telling me what makes his videogames company unusual .
“ Most of the $ 50bn [ £ 30.4 bn ] or more spent on videogames each year goes on that emotional , solitary , caveman - like journey of you versus the monsters , ” he says .
“ But our games are different .
They ’re not about what is going on between you and the screen ; they ’re about what goes on between you and your friends when you play .
They ’re much more of a medium and a catalyst , for expression , competition , co-operation . ”
They are also a stupendously good way of making money .
Segerstråle , a boyish 32 , is founder and CEO of Playfish , one of the world ’s leading “ social gaming ” companies : makers of a new kind of videogame that is rapidly becoming as essential to online life as sharing images or reading a blog .
It ’s mid-November and he is “ super excited ” — not surprisingly , given that Playfish has just been bought by one of the world ’s largest and most revered videogames publishers , Electronic Arts ( EA ) , in a deal worth up to $ 400 m ( £ 250 m ) .
Playfish did n’t exist two years ago .
Today , its games have over 60 m unique monthly players and it ’s not even the largest in its sector ( market leader Zynga boasts over 100 m after just two - and - a - half years in existence ) .
So what , exactly , has been going so right ?
The easiest answer has two words : social networks .
Facebook , the world ’s most influential social networking platform , now has over 300 m active users .
The only website to command more online traffic is Google .
Other leading social websites like MySpace and Bebo reach several hundred million users globally .
Factor into this the swelling number of smart - phones with internet capabilities , such as Apple ’s iPhone , and you have a big business opportunity .
Because , next to sending messages , the single most popular activity within these new social platforms and on these new devices is playing games .
The history of games is as old as civilisation .
Competitive games are recorded as far back as 2,600BC , while archaeologists have found game “ boards ” that were apparently scratched onto the backs of statues by bored Assyrian guards in the 8th century BC .
Technology has not changed human nature but it has given unprecedented rein to some of our innate impulses and , in particular , to those parts of us that the world of work and business have not used …

Last Sunday , we had brunch at my place .
And even though it was fairly last - minute for some , the spread was absolutely incredible !
Love them , and love that they enjoy food as much as I do . :-)
For one of my two contributions , I decided to try out a recipe I ’d had tacked to the fridge for months because it was so pretty — this yummy breakfast braid from Cooking Light .
While the filling looked simple to prepare , I was a little intimidated by the idea of trying to braid the dough .
But it turned out to be a piece of cake !!
As evidenced below , mine definitely was n’t perfect .
But it only took a few minutes , and once baked up , it was pretty cute !
( Cheers to refrigerated pizza crusts ! )
The filling was also delicious — classic breakfast ingredients , kicked up a notch with the jalapeno .
( But do n’t worry — it was n’t spicy at all . )
I think I may try this again soon with some other fillings — very fun !
So definitely bookmark this one if you ’re looking for a fun breakfast alternative !

Ali ’s Tip :
If you ’re not a huge fan of sausage ( like me ! ) , feel free to sub in some bacon instead !
But if you use regular bacon , though , be sure to drain away any extra grease as it could make the dough a little soggy .
Turkey bacon would also be fantastic ! :)
Employees of American defence contractor Blackwater took more than 500 assault rifles that were intended for the Afghan police force and routinely carried weapons without permission , it emerged in a hearing of the Senate armed services committee today .
It also emerged that to shed its sullied reputation and win contracting business in Afghanistan , Blackwater created what one senator called a shell company .
Senators said that company , Paravant , deceived US officials into thinking Blackwater was not involved even as it laid claim to Blackwater 's past performance to establish a track record .
" They made representations here that are wildly false , " said Senator Carl Levin , a Democrat .
" Everyone knew in the field it was Blackwater trying to get rid of a negative name . "
Steven Ograyensek , a US army contracting officer who testified , said : " There is no indication that they were part of Blackwater . "
Blackwater has come under intense scrutiny in recent years for its employees ' involvement in a 2007 Baghdad shooting in which 17 Iraqi civilians were killed , and other allegations .
The company has since sought to rebrand itself as Xe , and in order to win the training contract in Afghanistan , created a firm called Paravant .
Paravant represented itself as a separate company , even as the training personnel were aware they had been hired by Blackwater , according to witnesses and senators .
At the hearing today Levin warned that Afghan civilians did not distinguish between troops and contractors , and that when contractors misbehaved it turned the population against US forces and encouraged them to side with the Taliban .
The hearing focused in part on a December 2008 accident in which a Blackwater employee was shot in the head during what the company described as a vehicle training exercise but Levin called horseplay .
According to committee investigators , a Blackwater trainer jumped on top of a moving vehicle while carrying a loaded AK47 .
The vehicle hit a bump and the rifle discharged , striking another trainer in the head .
At the hearing today former Blackwater officials insisted the Americans were engaged in vehicle training .
Levin accused Blackwater of covering up misconduct by describing the shooting as an accident during " routine " training .
In May two Afghan civilians were killed in a shooting involving Paravant employees .
Investigators later determined that the Americans had " violated alcohol policies " , were not authorised to have weapons and had violated other policies .
The US department of justice said the shooting had a detrimental effect on US national security .
Former Paravant official Brian McCracken acknowledged the company 's trainers were carrying weapons without authorisation but said they often ­operated in dangerous environments among armed Afghans , without US army protection .
The recipe I am about to share with you is , emphatically , not ‘ Dude Food ’ .
Oh sure , guys will eat it .
They ’ll like it , maybe even love it .
But this is designed with me in mind , and I , quite emphatically , did not want ‘ Dude Food ’ today .
It was bright and sunny and warm and altogether spring - like all day long .
I wanted light and flavorful and exotic .
This was Made for Mom ( me . )

Details : A prebaked pizza crust * topped with silky smooth hummus ** , roasted red peppers , paper thin slices of cucumbers and red onions , black olives , crumbled feta cheese and parsley .
It is pure freshness .
It is the kind of thing I would sit down and devour with my sisters and my mother .
But since they did n’t pick up on my brainwaves ( so much for female intuition ) when the pizza was done , I was forced to eat the majority of the thing myself .
This rather defeats the whole light / fresh angle of the dish .
The Evil Genius stepped in , ate the last few slices and even uttered a , “ Hey .
This is really good ! ”
But my mom and sisters ?
They would ’ve been transported by it .
They would ’ve been ecstatic .
They would ’ve been rendered speechless .
And this would ’ve been a good thing .
There were a lot of onions on it .
* and **
In both of these cases , homemade is the best bet .
If you do n’t want to make a pre-baked pizza crust or hummus you can certainly use the store bought equivalents .
This brings me to a really hhhhhhhhelpful hhhhhhhhhhint .
( Quit moving away from your computer !
There ’s no WAY you can smell my onion breath through the monitor .
Or can you ? )
Do you know you can reduce the ‘ punch ’ that raw onions pack ?
( Which I did not do today .
Obviously .
Phew . I ’m offendin’ myself . )
It ’s a pretty simple process ; thinly slice or chop your onions as you wish to serve them .
Place in a bowl and cover generously with super cold tap water .
Let sit for 10 minutes , drain , rinse and repeat at least twice .
By the last time you rinse the onions , they should be gentle ( r ) and mild ( er ) .
The stronger your onions are to begin with , the more times you ’ll need to rinse your onions .
Of course , if you like the powerful bite of March onions , feel free .
Just remember I waaahhhhhhhh - rned you .
And not that we need an excuse to make treats for ourselves , but just in case you feel the need to justify it , check out these ‘ features and benefits ’ :
This is made with chick peas / garbanzo beans .
Beans are fantastic for your health ; fiber , vitamins , protein , and more are all packed into those tiny little packages .

Now , the question is this ; is anyone in need of a good hummus recipe ?
Because I ’m willing to share …
The school told parents Valentine cards will be confiscated A primary school in Weston - super - Mare has been criticised for banning Valentine cards to save pupils the " emotional trauma " of being rejected .
Children at Ashcombe Primary School were stopped from exchanging cards because the head teacher said they were not emotionally mature enough to cope .
Peter Turner told parents of the 430 pupils that cards would be confiscated .
One pupil 's mother said : " I think it 's outrageous .
They 're just children .
Why spoil their fun ? "
The woman , whose son attends the school , said : " It 's comical really .
I could n't believe it when I saw the newsletter .
It 's only a bit of fun once a year and it does n't mean anything to kids that age
MP Ann Widdecombe
" My son is six and he's had a little girlfriend since nursery .
They say they 're going to get married , but we do n't read anything into it . "
Mr Turner said in the newsletter that children get upset when they are " dumped " which interrupts their learning .
He said children should wait until they are mature enough emotionally and socially to understand the commitment in having a boyfriend or girlfriend .
A woman who has a seven - year - old at the school said : " I think it 's absolutely ridiculous .
' Parents laughing ' " It 's a tradition , I can remember when I used to receive cards from boys in school .
It 's a lovely thing to do .
" Most of the parents were laughing about it , but the children are wondering what 's going on because they 've sent cards before . "
Conservative MP
Ann Widdecombe also criticised the move .
She said : " It 's only a bit of fun once a year and it does n't mean anything to kids that age .
" I just think it is rather silly .
Have n't they anything better to worry about at that school ? "
A spokesman for North Somerset Council said the head teacher was happy to discuss the issue with any parents who have concerns .
He said : " Ashcombe is a primary school and they believe that children under the age of 11 are still emotionally and socially developing and therefore cards declaring love can be confusing .
" Any families wishing to send cards are asked to send them in the post or deliver to home addresses by hand . "

In the next few days , the world 's leading authority on global warming plans to roll out a strategy to tackle a tough problem : restoring its own bruised reputation .
A months - long crisis at the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has upended the world 's perception of global warming , after hacked emails and other disclosures revealed deep divisions among scientists working with the United Nation - sponsored group .
That has raised questions about the panel 's objectivity in assessing one of today 's most hotly debated scientific ...
Clowns are good for a lot of things :
Making brave children laugh , speaking on behalf of hamburger empires , saving bull riders -- all kinds of jazz .
Still , given their varying codes of pantomimage , it never occurred to me that a clown could ever share my love of comic books .
That 's where the balloon - sculpting Ronzo comes in .
The professional clown 's been making Internet magic happen since at least 2008 , teaching Marvel movie enthusiasts the magic of the Avengers in anticipation of the franchise 's pending 2012 cinematic team up .
Ronzo's kept things classic , sculpting iconic Avengers like Iron Man , Hulk , Captain America and Thor , sometimes dressed as a cigar - chomping clown Nick Fury .
And even though I have a history of coulrophobia these balloon versions of Earth 's Mightiest Heroes help to ease my impression of the entertainers .
And all jokes about clown college aside , Ronzo 's laid - back teaching skills are as impressive as his balloon craft , making for tutorials I 'm actually tempted to follow along with at home .
Now I just have to convince myself to buy some balloons .
Check out his videos after the jump .

Have we not seen , then , in our lifetime the end of the Western way of war ? ”
Two decades ago , I concluded The Western Way of War with that question .
Since Western warfare had become so lethal and included the specter of nuclear escalation , I thought it doubtful that two Western states could any longer wage large head - to - head conventional battles .
A decade earlier , John Keegan , in his classic The Face of Battle , had similarly suggested that it would be hard for modern European states to engage in infantry slugfests like the Battle of the Somme .
“ The suspicion grows , ” Keegan argued of a new cohort of affluent and leisured European youth — rebellious in spirit and reluctant to give over the good life to mass conscription — “ that battle has already abolished itself . ”
Events of the last half - century seem to have confirmed the notion that decisive battles between two large , highly trained , sophisticated Westernized armies , whether on land or on sea , have become increasingly rare .
Pentagon war planners now talk more about counterinsurgency training , winning the hearts and minds of civilian populations , and “ smart ” interrogation techniques — and less about old - fashioned , “ blow - ’em - up ” hardware ( like , say , the F - 22 Raptor ) that proves so advantageous in fighting conventional set battles .
But does this mean that the big battle is indeed on its way to extinction ?
Big battles sometimes changed entire conflicts in a matter of hours , altering politics and the fate of millions .
It is with history ’s big battles , not the more common “ dirty war ” or insurgency , that we associate radical changes of fortune as well as war poetry , commemoration , and , for good or ill , the martial notions of glory and honor .
Had the Greeks lost their fleet at “ Holy ” Salamis in 480 bc , instead of beating back the Persian invaders , the history of the polis might well have come to an end , and with it a vulnerable Western civilization in its infancy .
Had the Confederates broken the Union lines at Gettysburg and swept behind Washington , Abraham Lincoln would have faced enormous pressure to settle the Civil War according to the status quo ante bellum .
If the “ band of brothers ” had been repulsed at Normandy Beach on the morning of June 6 , 1944 , it is difficult to imagine that they would have reattempted an enormous amphibious invasion soon after — but easy instead to envision a victorious Red Army eventually camped on the Atlantic Coast and occupying Western Europe .
Yet set engagements , it ’s important to note , have never been the norm in warfare .
The 27 - year - long Peloponnesian War saw only two major ground engagements , at Delium ( 424 bc ) and Mantinea ( 418 bc ) , and a few smaller infantry clashes , at Solygeia and outside Syracuse .
In the asymmetrical struggle between Athenian naval power and premier Spartan infantry , the most common kinds of fighting were hit - and - run attacks , terrorism , sieges , constant ravaging of agriculture , and sea and amphibious assaults .
True , during the murderous Roman Civil War ( 49–31 bc ) , frequent and savage battles at Actium and elsewhere claimed more than a quarter - million Roman lives .
Yet after the creation of the Principate by the new emperor , Augustus , much of the Mediterranean world was relatively united and free of frequent major battles for nearly half a millennium .
And after the fall of the Roman Empire , for most of the Middle Ages , sieges and low - intensity conflict were more common than major engagements such as Poitiers ( 732 ) , Hattin ( 1187 ) , and Crécy ( 1346 ) .
In fact , the course of military history has been strikingly cyclical .
The eminent military historian Russell Weigley once described an “ Age of Battles ” — a uniquely destructive two centuries of pitched warfare between Gustavus Adolphus ’s victory at Breitenfeld ( 1631 ) and Napoleon ’s defeat at Waterloo ( 1815 ) — in which European armies of multifarious rivals , often in vain , sought to decide entire wars in a few hours of head - to - head fighting .
That age ended with the agreements following the Congress of Vienna , which ( along with military deterrence ) kept a general peace in Europe for nearly a century .
Set battles were common only in colonial theaters ( Tel el Kebir , Omdurman ) , in Asia ( Tsushima ) , and in the Americas ( the decisive battles of the Mexican , Spanish - American , and American civil wars ) .
Then , during the first half of the twentieth century , came another Age of Battles , with the First and Second World Wars witnessing the most destructive fighting in the history of arms .
The details of Iwo Jima , Kursk , Marne , Meuse - Argonne , Okinawa , Passchendaele , the Somme , Stalingrad , and Verdun still chill the reader .
Asia saw horrors of its own : most Westerners know little about the Huaihai campaign ( late 1948 –49 ) , in which the Nationalist Chinese lost an entire army of 600,000 to the Communists in mostly conventional fighting .
Today , the world is clearly enjoying another respite from huge set battles .
Except for the daring American landing at Inchon ( September 1950 ) and the subsequent first liberation of Seoul , few battles of the last seven decades resembled the Battle of the Bulge .
Far more common in the past half - century have been the asymmetrical wars between large Westernized militaries and poorer , less organized terrorists , insurgents , and pirates .
The list of theaters where conventional forces have battled guerrillas is long : Afghanistan , Grozny , Iraq , Kashmir , Mogadishu , the Somali coast .
Seldom does an indigenous force dare to come out in the open , marshal its resources , and test head - on the firepower and discipline of a Westernized force .
History ’s record on that score — from Tenochtitlán to Omdurman — is not encouraging for those who try .
Those who have successfully attacked the United States — in Lebanon ( 1983 ) , at the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia ( 1996 ) , at America ’s East African embassies ( 1999 ) , on the USS Cole ( 2000 ) , and in New York and Washington in 2001 — did so as terrorists .
If nation - states sponsored such radical Islamist groups , they nearly always denied culpability , avoiding an all - out conventional war with the United States that they would inevitably lose — as the brief rout of the Taliban in Afghanistan demonstrated in 2001 .
Amid the murderous fighting between well - organized armies during the Vietnam War , North Vietnam as a matter of practice did not attempt to engage Western forces in formal set engagements .
( The sieges at Khe Sanh and , earlier , against the French at Dien Bien Phu proved the exceptions rather than the rule and were themselves not traditional collisions of infantry . )
In its failed attempt in the 1980s to take over Afghanistan , the Soviet army may have killed more than 1 million Afghans without once engaging in a set collision with tens of thousands of jihadists .
We still do not know all the gory details of the Iran - Iraq war ( 1980 – 89 ) , in which more than 1 million combatants and civilians perished .
But despite the carnage that characterized that war , set engagements , out in the open , between two massed armies were not a major part of the conflict , so far as we know .
Even the “ Mother of All Battles ” in the 1991 Gulf War was largely a rout .
The tank battle at Medina Ridge involved hundreds of armored vehicles but lasted little more than an hour — the Americans suffering neither casualties from enemy fire nor a single Abrams tank destroyed , while obliterating 186 Iraqi tanks .
Today , few Americans even know what Medina Ridge was .
In other engagements , most of Saddam ’s army disintegrated rather than fight advancing American armor — as was commonly the case again during the three - week war of 2003 .
Some decisive fighting took place between British and Argentinean units during the Falklands War of 1982 , but on a minuscule scale compared with the twentieth century ’s bloody engagements .
Tank battles raged in the Golan Heights during both the Six - Day War ( 1967 ) and the Yom Kippur War ( 1973 ) .
For a few days , also in 1973 , the Israelis and the Egyptian Third Army fought each other openly in the desert expanses of the Sinai Peninsula .
But the far more usual pattern of the inconclusive Israeli - Arab conflict has been terrorism , intifadas , bombings , and missile strikes .
Why does decisive battle wax and wane in frequency , and why has it become rarer again ?
The political landscape certainly explains much .
Empire of any sort can lessen the incidence of warfare .
Unified , central political control transforms the usual ethnic , tribal , racial , and religious strife into more internal and less violent rivalries for state representation and influence .
Once Philip unified Greece under a Macedonian hegemony after Chaeronea ( 338 bc ) , set battles between city - states , so common earlier in the fourth century bc , became a rarity .
For now , anyway , the European Union lacks the interstate rivalry that plunged Europe into murderous battles for much of the first half of the twentieth century .
When the world is divided into larger blocs that have sizable , competent conventional forces — such as the Soviet and American spheres during the Cold War — confrontation can potentially turn catastrophic , given the vast resources available to each side .
Yet it ’s also possible that in such a bipolar world , battling along nationalist lines , among a variety of state players , will be less frequent .
No nation of the Warsaw Pact fought the Soviet Republic ; American allies like Iran did not threaten American allies like Israel ; Tito and Yugoslavian Communism for a time kept Bosnians , Croats , Kosovars , Macedonians , and Serbs from killing one another .
In the present age , many of the most powerful economies in the world are united under the loose rubric “ the West , ” which includes some former nations of the British Empire ( Australia , Canada , New Zealand ) , the transatlantic NATO alliance ( most of the European Union and the United States ) , and democratic nations of the Pacific ( Japan , the Philippines , South Korea , Taiwan ) , along with miscellaneous allies , capitalist and democratic , such as India and Israel .
At present , there is virtually no likelihood that we will see decisive battles between any of these similarly minded democratic states , even though a mere 70 years ago , when consensual government was less widespread among them , most of them squared off in various temporary alliances against one another in terrible engagements .
Technology also helps explain the current decline in conventional battles .
The battlefield can now be seen and mapped to the smallest pebble through aerial photography , often by unmanned drones that update pictures second by second .
Surprise is rare .
Potential combatants know the odds in advance .
They can use the Internet to download the most minute information about their adversaries .
Generals can see streaming video of prebattle preparations and calculate , to some degree , the subsequent cost .
Uncertainty and the unknown were often essential to the outbreak of decisive battles , since each opposing force usually felt it had some chance of operational success .
Had the British enjoyed satellite reconnaissance of the German lines in the days before and during the Somme , they might have curtailed their suicidal assaults .
Had the Americans possessed live streaming video of Japanese forces fortifying bunkers on Okinawa , they might not have chosen to assault the Shuri Line frontally .
Pickett ’s Charge up Cemetery Ridge at Gettysburg was predicated on an erroneous assumption that there was an especially weak spot in the Union ’s line — a conjecture that General Robert E. Lee would have easily corrected if he ’d had a Predator drone at his disposal .
Weaponry is not static .
It resides within a constant challenge - and - response cycle between offense and defense , armor and arms , surveillance and secrecy .
Body armor may soon advance to the point of offering , if only for a brief period , protection against the bullet , which centuries ago rendered chain and plate mail useless .
The satellite killer may render the satellite nonoperational .
Sophisticated electronic jamming may force down the aerial drone .
Yet for now , the arts of information - gathering about an enemy trump his ability to maintain secrecy , thus lessening the chance that thousands of soldiers will be willing to march off to massive battle .
The cost of today ’s military technology , too , renders big battles more unlikely .
To wage a single decisive battle between tens of thousands of combatants along the lines of a Gaugamela or a Verdun would cost hundreds of billions of dollars , a figure far beyond the resources of most belligerents .
A single B - 1 bomber on patrol overhead represents a $ 1 billion investment .
Abrams tanks go for over $ 4 million .
A single cruise missile can cost over $ 1 million .
One GPS - guided artillery shell may cost $ 150,000 ; one artillery platform could expend over $ 10 million in ordnance in a few hours .
Even a solder ’s M - 4 assault rifle runs well over $ 1,000 .
The result is that very few states can afford to outfit an army of , say , 100,000 infantry , supported by high - tech air , naval , and artillery fire — much less keep it well supplied for the duration of battle .
Even in the 1973 Yom Kippur War , when weapons were cheap compared with today ’s models , both Egypt and Israel needed massive amounts of new weaponry from the Soviet Union and the United States shortly after the commencement of fighting .
Globalization — accelerated by technology — is another reason that decisive battles are uncommon today .
Instant cell - phoning and text - messaging , the Internet , access to DVDs , and satellite television have created a world culture that depends on uninterrupted communications .
It frowns on massive disruptions in airline flights , banking , and the easy importation of consumer goods .
Electronic togetherness hinges on our shared appetites — and a growing communal comfort factor .
When Russia invaded Georgia , its oil buyers became upset .
So did its own aristocratic grandees , who saw international capital flee Moscow .
European states worry about oil shortages , should the U.S. bomb Iran ; China frets about its vital American export market , should it invade Taiwan .
Finally , changing mores have changed military tactics .
The current ascendant belief in the West that war is unnatural , preventable , and the result of rational grievances — that it can , with proper training and education , be eliminated — has probably made battle less tenable among the general public .
The bombing of fleeing Iraqi bandit brigades from Kuwait on the so - called Highway of Death in the first Gulf War was halted by popular outrage because of the televised carnage .
The abhorrent images of death on millions of television screens easily trumped the argument that the enemy , who had just committed rapine in Kuwait , should be punished — or preempted , since he was likely to regroup in Iraq to slaughter Kurdish and Shiite innocents again .
Russia ’s shelling and destruction of Grozny escaped world condemnation only because a news blackout ensured that Westerners saw little of mass death .
We should n’t assume , though , that these various forces will always prevent set battles .
Similar predictions have proved wrong before .
In 1909 , Norman Angell ’s The Great Illusion argued that Europe had achieved too great an interdependence of financial credit , economic integration , and prosperity to throw it all away on nihilistic warmaking .
The Somme , Passchendaele , and Verdun shortly followed .
Human beings remain emotional , irrational , and guided by intangible calculations , such as honor and fear , that collectively can induce them into self - destructive behavior .
Armed struggles that at times result in horrific collisions are as old as civilization itself and are a collective reflection of deep - seated elements within the human psyche— tribalism , affinity for like kind , reckless exuberance — that are constant and unchanging .
We are not at the “ end of history . ”
Can big battles , then , haunt us once more ?
If the European Union were to dissolve and return to a twentieth - century landscape of proud rivals , or if the former Soviet republics were to form a collective resistance to an aggrandizing Russia ( as they did for much of the nineteenth century ) , or if the North Koreans , Pakistanis , or Chinese were to gamble on an agenda of sudden aggression ( as they have on previous occasions when they were confident of achieving political objectives ) , then we might well see a return of decisive battles .
The U.S. military still prepares for all sorts of conventional challenges .
We keep thousands of tanks and artillery pieces in constant readiness , along with close - ground support missiles and planes , in fear that the People ’s Army of Korea might try to swarm across the Demilitarized Zone into Seoul , or that the Chinese Red Army might storm the beaches of Taiwan .
Waterloos or Verduns may revisit us , especially in the half - century ahead , in which constant military innovation may reduce the cost of war , or relegate battle to the domain of massed waves of robots and drones , or see a sudden technological shift back to the defensive that would nullify the tyranny of today ’s incredibly destructive munitions .
New technology may make all sorts of deadly arms as cheap as iPods , and more lethal than M - 16s , while creating shirts and coats impervious to small - arms fire — and therefore making battle cheap again , uncertain , and once more to be tried .
Should a few reckless states feel that nuclear war in an age of antiballistic missiles might be winnable , or that the consequences of mass death might be offset by perpetuity spent in a glorious collective paradise , then even the seemingly unimaginable — nuclear showdown — becomes imaginable .
In short , if the conducive political , economic , and cultural requisites for set battles realign , as they have periodically over the centuries , we will see our own modern version of a Cannae or Shiloh .
And these collisions will be frightening as never before .

Tragically , Myriam Merlet , Haiti’s Chief of Staff of the Haitian Ministry of Women , did not survive the earthquake in Port - au - Prince .
Amy Goodman , reporting from Haiti , and Eve Ensler , a personal friend of Merlet , reports from the Democracy Now ! studio .
Rush Transcript taken from Democracy Now !
AMY GOODMAN : I have to say , one of our — one of the very sad moments was when we first came in .
I had gotten a call from Eve Ensler , our guest who ’s in the studio with you , and I — and it ’s painful for me to even say this in her hearing because of this tremendous loss .
She called me — I think we talked at 2:00 in the morning — before we came in on Sunday , and said , “ Please , try to find my friend .
Try to find Myriam Merlet , ” who was more than a friend to Eve Ensler , but to so many women in this devastated community .
And she gave us an area , not even an address , because she did n’t know it .
But we went to that area in Paco .
It is not a poor area like Cité Soleil , but it is down .
It is on a hill .
And it is an entire community under rubble .
And we made it to her house as the sun was setting .
And there was a group of people who were sitting across the street crying .
And we said , “ Myriam Merlet , do you know which is her house ? ”
And they pointed , and they said , “ We ’ve just pulled her body up , and we have brought it down the street . ”
I looked around and asked if there was family .
They said , yes , her sister Eartha , Eartha Merlet , and she was sitting in the middle of the group weeping .
And we asked her if she could bring us to the makeshift grave site .
It was just down through the rubble .
They had dug a deep , deep hole and covered the casket a bit .
And Eartha talked about her beloved sister .
But we have someone who knew her like a sister , as well , and it ’s Eve Ensler .
And I want to say , Eve , yesterday when we passed the Ministry of Women , where she worked , it is completely devastated .
It ’s hard to see there was even a , you know , high - story building there .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Well , Eve Ensler , Myriam Merlet was a Chief of Staff of the Haitian Ministry .
She was a good friend of yours .
Could you tell us about her and your experiences with her when you ’ve been in Haiti ?
EVE ENSLER : Yes .
First , I just want to thank you , Amy , so much for going and finding Myriam .
It means so much to many of us .
Myriam was a — she was a light .
She was a force of Haiti .
She was one of the great feminists .
She was a radical feminist .
We joked often about the fact that it was wild that she and Marie - Laurence , who ’s the Minister of Women , were actually in power , that we had radical feminists in power .
She was a woman who left Haiti in the ’70s and then went back to fight and to stand up and to bring about social change and progression and fight for racial freedoms and equality and for gender freedom and equality .
And I had the fortune of meeting Myriam and becoming in touch with her in 2001 , when she brought The Vagina Monologues to Haiti and really began to work with V - Day as a sister in the movement , and then was there a year ago when we — they did The Vagina Monologues in a huge performance there in Port - au - Prince and in Cap - Haïtien and where we met with many women who Myriam supported , the Ministry of Women supported .
And we were able , after that visit , to do a joint project with the Women ’s Ministry to open the first Haiti Sorority Safe House , V - Day Safe House , with Myriam and Marie - Laurence in Haiti .
And I will say that I think one of the things I feel most sorry about , and it ’s really being echoed by what Amy is saying , is just I do n’t understand why relief has n’t gotten there faster and why we have n’t gotten workers there faster who can dig people out .
It just seems strange and —
JUAN GONZALEZ : Well , we ’d like to go to this tape that Amy did down there , this clip just — well , this clip of her .
MYRIAM MERLET : [ translated ]
It ’s with a lot of emotion that we are here today in New Orleans , when we know what New Orleans means to black people here and especially after Katrina .
We bring all our sorority and affection to our sisters here in New Orleans .
We are here to talk about the work that we do in Haiti at the ministry , and especially with the support of the V - Day Foundation .
This work started a long time ago with non-governmental women ’s organizations , with lack — because they were lacking resources , were never able to open a shelter for abused women in Haiti .
And now we are really proud to be able to say that we are going to have our first safe house in Port - au - Prince , Haiti .
JUAN GONZALEZ : That was Myriam Merlet , the former Chief of Staff of the Haitian Ministry of Women , who was killed in the earthquake last week .
Eve Ensler , could you — that particular speech that she gave there , could you tell us about it ?
EVE ENSLER : Well , that was in V - Day at our tenth anniversary at the Superdome in New Orleans , when women reclaimed the Superdome and transformed the suffering .
And I can’t but think of the connections and the parallels between what happened in Katrina and what is happening in Haiti right now , you know , the slow recovery , the people not getting there in time , people not getting people food , people not getting water , so that people end up feeling panicked and getting violent and then being accused of being looters .
All the same language seems to be being used right now .
But I must say about Myriam , there are so many extraordinary women in Haiti , forces of nature and resilience who know full well what to do with the country ’s future .
And I think what Danny was saying earlier , how this recovery happens will create the path for what comes after .
And we must — must — put women in the center of everything that happens .
Their voices must be heard and must be the people who determine the future of Haiti .
The outside world can no longer determine — the dependence , the control , everything that ’s been there in the — this is an opportunity for us to support the Haitians to take back their country , to have a vision of the future of their country , and to put women in the center of that envisioning .
JUAN GONZALEZ : And I ’d like to get , for the last minute , Amy , your last words .
AMY GOODMAN : Well , on the issue of Myriam Merlet , and I know the head of the — you are looking for , Eve , still the —
EVE ENSLER : We found her just now .
Right before I got on , I found out that the Women ’s — the minister is alive .
I just got a call , yeah .
AMY GOODMAN : Oh , well , that is beautiful to hear .
EVE ENSLER : Yes , yes .
AMY GOODMAN : And that is so lucky .
And right now , though , we are — it is absolutely critical that people understand that the life of Haiti is at stake , that the aid that flows in , the kind of work that has to be done with community organizations , with the UN not working — and this is one of the biggest complaints , the international aid agencies being afraid of the people , as opposed to working with the community leaders who can distribute the aid , who can empower the people in their communities .
That ’s what ’s going to make the future of Haiti stronger .
Danny said he had questions about the Bush - Clinton choice in aiding Haiti .
President Obama talked about rebuilding and reconstructing .
For the United States , we ’ll add a third R : redemption .
The US has had a very sordid history with Haiti , keeping it down , this first slave - rebellion - born black country , the first black republic .
And we can turn this around by respecting the people of Haiti .
JUAN GONZALEZ : Well , Amy , thanks for that , and stay safe .
And we ’ll get more reports from you .
That does it for today ’s program .
Eve Ensler , thank you for joining us .
The Computer Emergency Response Team warned about Firefox 3.6 Mozilla has released Firefox 3.6.2 almost a week early after security issues were found in earlier versions .
Firefox 3.6.2 was originally due to launch at the end of March , but is available to download now from the Mozilla website .
The security hole had led the German government to issue a warning about Firefox 3.6 .
The Federal Office for Information Security made a similar ruling on the safety of Internet Explorer in January .
It warned that the Firefox vulnerability , confirmed by Firefox makers , could allow hackers to run malicious programs on users ' computers .
Germany 's official cyber- security response team - BurgerCERT - had recommended that users stop using Firefox until the tested fix was released .
It was a move remarkably similar to the January announcement , in which France followed suit just days later .
Fox swap ?
The original Firefox vulnerability was confirmed by maker Mozilla last week on its security blog , when it promised that the next official release would address the issue .
It is only the current version that is affected but , given that prior releases have different vulnerabilities , reverting to an older version of the browser is ill - advised .
Switching to a different browser may not be a good solution either , said Graham Cluley , senior technologist at security firm Sophos .
" Switching your web browser willy - nilly as each new unpatched security hole is revealed could cause more problems than it 's worth , " he said .
" What are you going to do when your replacement browser itself turns out to contain a vulnerability ?
" My advice is to only switch from Firefox if you really know what you are doing with the browser you 're swapping to .
If you stick with Firefox , apply the security update as soon as it's available . "
A Mozilla spokesperson said : " Last week we informed our users that the upcoming security release of Firefox 3.6.2 would include a fix for an exploit that was disclosed to us just over a week ago .
" Mozilla is aware of the BergerCERT recommendation to avoid using Firefox 3.6 , and encourage users to download ... Firefox 3.6.2 . "

For years , rumors have circulated about the strange herd of white deer living in the former Seneca Army Depot in Seneca County , New York .
Many people have speculated that the “ albino ” breed of deer were freak - accidents in an army experiment gone wrong .
Others have attributed the animals ’ appearance to an underground supply of radioactive military weapons .
Neither of these rumors , however , are true .
The white deer were first spotted around 1941 , when the U.S. Army fenced off 24 square miles of land for the Seneca Army Depot , a munitions storage site .
Under the protection of the security fencing , the deer population thrived – and , along with it , a recessive - gene for white coloration .
Though the animals appeared to be albino , they were , in fact , White - tailed deer who carried the recessive - gene for an all - white coat .
As the white deer population proliferated through the 1950s , the U.S. Army decided to protect the unique herd .
Aiding in the process of artificial selection , a depot commander managed the brown deer population through hunting and forbade GI ’s from shooting any white deer .
Since then , the white deer population has grown to approximately 300 , making it the largest herd of white deer in the world .
The Seneca Army Depot was shut down in 2000 and has been closed to the public ever since .
That is until recently , when Seneca White Deer , Inc. , successfully turned the area into a conservation park and partial Cold War museum .
Since November 2017 , 90 - minute bus tours of the site have become available .
On the tour , you will learn about some of the base history as well as about the deer , and while sightings are not guaranteed since they are wildlife , the guides know the best places to find them for visitors to see and photograph .
Additionally , visitors will have the opportunity to go inside one of the over 500 igloos ( the earth - covered buildings used to store the munitions ) during the tour as well as a personnel bomb shelter .
The first gathering of the six main mayoral candidates erupted into a war of words between former deputy premier George Smitherman and ex-non - profit executive Rocco Rossi .
The lively three hour question - and - answer session Monday night at Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School in Scarborough was never lacking for passion as the candidates held forth on public transit , road tolls , taxes and many other issues .
But the gloves came off after Smitherman , who had directed a series of jabs at Deputy Mayor Joe Pantalone and his boss David Miller , took aim at Rossi ’s plan to direct half of development fees from downtown projects toward troubled suburban neighbourhoods .
Smitherman said the plan reminded him of the divisive policies of former Ontario premier Mike Harris .
Loud applause followed but when Rossi next got to the mic , on a question about rooming houses , he let loose : Mr. Smitherman if he had n’t blown $ 1 billion on eHealth and if he had n’t made the single biggest sole - source deal in Canadian history with Samsung then maybe , just maybe his former boss would have had the money to continue to invest in this city
Smitherman retorted : “ I have an experience and a track record and you have none . ”
Despite organizers pleas not to stack the house with supporters , there were large camps of Smitherman and Rossi supporters and they howled during the exchange .
Earlier , answering prepared questions from students , Pantalone said Scarborough is the biggest loser in the provincial governments decision last week to delay $ 4 billion in funding for the Transit City plan to snake streetcar lines through the suburbs .
“ Well go knocking on ( Premier ) Dalton McGuinty ’s door and make sure the funding gets restored and well ask George to come with me in support of that , ” said Pantalone , the lone defender of David Miller ’s legacy on transit and many other issues .
Smitherman called Pantalone a 27 - year - veteran of the status quo and said the St. Clair Ave. W. streetcar debacle showed the need for a skills - based board to help run it .
He also repeated a call for TTC chair Adam Giambrone to step down , a comment that angered Rossi and partly led to the later bitter exchange .
Sarah Thomson , a magazine publisher , pushed her main platform of more subways across the city , paid for by road tolls .
My vision for Toronto is to complete our much needed subway system , she said , a mantra often repeated , even when the question was n't transit - related .
Councillor Rob Ford said he would clean up the filthy , dirty TTC and make it an essential service , while his colleague Giorgio Mammoliti said he would try to upload the TTC to province and , failing that , focus on new subway lines rather than streetcars .
Rossi acknowledged he has taken heat for his stance that bike lanes should n't be on arterial roads but got one of the biggest cheers of the nights when he said he can't ask a motorist in gridlock to sit there staring at an empty bike lane .
Pantalone said its our kids , our sisters , our brothers who use bicycles , not Martians , and lanes should be put anywhere it ’s safe .

Smitherman said Rossi ’s bike lane stance pits one segment of Toronto against another but was drowned out by boos and calls of “ Answer the question . ”
He shot back that free alcohol might have been extended to the Rossi camp just a little bit early , referring to an offer from the Rossi camp that supporters would be transported to the Q&A and given a drink ticket for a gathering afterwards .
Rossi ’s spokesperson later said he did not approve of the offer before it was sent out .
Four - wheeling does n’t cut it on Mars .
After several months of spinning its four remaining operable wheels in deep , soft sand with no luck , NASA ’s Spirit Mars rover is now officially , permanently stuck .

When we read on photographer Eric Curry 's Web site that he views certain machines as “ metaphors for values of character , honor , integrity and pride , ” we thought his approach would be the perfect way to illustrate the affection many Earth - dwellers have come to feel for NASA ’s twin Mars Exploration Rovers , which , having long outlasted their life expectancies , are still transmitting from the Martian surface .
In this slideshow , Curry explains how he built our March 2010 magazine cover , shot by carefully lit shot .

Freeing Spirit
Legs , Bags , or Wheels ?
The rover “ has encountered a golfer ’s worst nightmare , ” said Doug McCuistion , director of the Mars Exploration Program in Washington , D.C. , “ the sand trap that , no matter how many strokes you take , you ca n’t get out of it .
Its driving days are likely over , for all intents and purposes . ”
Engineers and scientists at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory , many of them profiled in our February / March cover story , would probably keep trying to free Spirit were it not for the steady creep of the Martian winter .
From Spirit ’s perspective , at a latitude 16 degrees below the Martian equator , the days will continue to get shorter until the winter solstice in mid-May .
Worse , the rover ’s solar panels happen to be tilted about nine degrees toward the southern horizon ( away from the sun ) , further reducing the solar energy that recharges its batteries .
Even if JPL ’s rover team did extract Spirit from its sand trap , serious questions linger about what kind of mobility the rover would have as it tried to drag its lame right front and right rear wheels across the sandy landscape .
So the rover team has gone to Plan B : Try to tilt Spirit more toward the sunny northern sky , and hope that when it goes into hibernation mode , it will have enough onboard power to make it through the six - month winter .
If it does survive , there ’s still plenty of exciting science that Spirit could do as a stationary platform , principal investigator Steve Squyres says optimistically .
“ The one I ’m most excited about is tracking the radio signal from Spirit , ” he says .
Tracking the signal will give precise data on the planet ’s wobble as it orbits the sun , which in turn gives clues about its internal structure .
“ If Mars has a solid core of iron , it ’ll wobble in a certain , well - defined way , ” says Squyres .
“ But if that core is liquid , it ’ll wobble in an ever so slightly different way .
And by tracking the rover ’s position long enough , carefully enough , we can distinguish between the two . ”
Squyres and the science team would need about six months to determine if the core of Mars is liquid or solid .
“ Totally new science , never been done before , ” he says .
“ This is something that I did n’t really think much about when we first put a rover on the surface of Mars , because we were thinking about the geology of the surface .
But when you delve deeply into what this vehicle is capable of , you find new tricks . ”
Other projects suited to a stationary robot involve studying how the atmosphere interacts with the surface over time .
And Squyres can do a more comprehensive study of the unusually sulfate - rich soils around the rover , which are thought to have formed long ago , when steam vents were actively changing the surface chemistry .
“ We expect to be able to use the wheels on the rover come springtime to slightly reposition the rover , to swing it back and forth a little bit , to move it forward and backward , bringing new patches of soil within reach of the arm , ” he says .
“ The most immediate issue for Spirit right now , ” says rover mission project manager John Callas , “ is surviving the next Martian winter .
We ’re clearly seeing a decrease in energy levels for the rover . ”
Spirit is generating just enough power for about three more weeks of rocking and jostling in the fine Martian fluff .
In past winters — three in total — the team has always been able to position Spirit with its solar arrays tilted northward to maximize energy production as the bitter Martian winter sets in .
Spirit ’s twin , Opportunity , on the other side of the planet , lives almost on the equator , and receives enough light year - round that it does n’t have to hibernate .
Opportunity has traveled more than 12 miles , or about three times the distance Spirit has , since the two arrived in early 2004 .
Mountain View , CA - Sales of Google 's flagship Android phone , the Nexus One , has led many people to call the phone a flop .
However , we here at BBspot have learned that it has n't deterred Google from moving forward with the next generation phone to replace the Nexus One called the Threepio .
Our sources inside Google say the Threepio will run Android 4.0 and be released some time in 2011 .
Android 4.0 will feature Google 's Universal Translator Software ( GUTS ) , which can translate millions of spoken languages on the fly .
GUTS will require hardware that puts the speedy Nexus One to shame .
" I 'm talking light years ahead of current processors , " said my anonymous source .
Like the Nexus One the Threepio will be designed by Google , but built by HTC .
It 'll be a similar form factor to the Nexus One , but will feature a gold - toned metallic shell like its namesake .
So far nothing has surfaced about whether the phone understands the binary language of moisture vaporators , but we can keep our fingers crossed .
As further evidence of the phone for a short time this week the URL http://www.google.com/threepio had the message " We do n't serve their kind here . "
It 's unclear if by the time the Threepio has launched Android will improve on its lack of apps which many people find " disturbing . "
The news of the handset from Google is unlikely to score any points with Apple 's CEO Steve Jobs who recently called Google the leader of the " rebel alliance " and that he considered them a " traitor . "
Officially Google has neither confirmed or denied the reports on the Threepio phone , but back channel sources suggest to us that an announcement will be coming in the next couple of months .
Until that time , we 'll just have to hope we can hold off the trash compactor for a little while longer .
Stay tuned to BBspot for more details as they become available .

Earlier this morning I posted a chart showing how much money had been spent lobbying against a tax on sugared beverages by Pepsi , Coke , and the American Beverage Association .
I just want to make one more point about it .
Assuming the LA Times did its sums correctly , 1 this is one of the clearest examples you ’ll ever see of how much money can be spent lobbying on one specific piece of legislation .
Usually that ’s hard to figure out , since industries spend a lot of money lobbying all the time , and it ’s hard to say how much is spent on one issue vs. another .
But for six straight years , these three companies spent about $ 3 million on lobbying activities .
Then in 2009 that suddenly jumped to $ 37 million .
Since there was n’t much else going on that would have seriously affected them , that means they spent $ 34 million just to defeat the sugar tax .
For comparison , that ’s nearly as much as the entire aerospace industry spends on lobbying for the entire defense budget each year .
It ’s five times more than the sugar lobby itself spends lobbying on all sugar - related issues each year .
It ’s about as much as organized labor spends on all lobbying activities for everything .
That ’s the kind of muscle that the business community can bring to bear when it cares to .
As much as the entire annual lobbying budget of organized labor or the aerospace industry , all for one single piece of legislation that never really had a ton of support in the first place .
That ’s a lot of leverage .
1 The caveat here is that the Times used CRP figures for 2003 - 08 but its own research for 2009 .
So it ’s possible that the comparison is n’t apples - to - apples due to different methodologies .
Did a member of the Saudi royal family brutally strangle his aide to death in a suite of one of London ’s poshest hotels ?
Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Nasir bin Abdulaziz al - Saud ( 33 ) is the alleged attacker , who has been arrested in the British capital .
The Saudi prince is accused of murdering his assistant Bandar Abdullah Abdulaziz ( 32 ) .
Al - Saud pleaded innocent during his first hearing in court .
What really happened ?
The prince and his aide were staying for four weeks at The Landmark , a € 1,100 a night five - star hotel , for a sightseeing holiday in London .
But last week the servant was found dead in a hotel room .
The BBC reported the results of the post mortem examination – he died through strangulation and was found with serious injuries .
Al - Saud , whose grandfather is the brother of the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia King Abdullah , is known for being strict with his employees .
His assistants have to sleep on the floor in front of his bed .
CCTV footage taken in the hotel lift shows how the prince hit an aide .
The next court hearing is due to be held on May 28 .

I 'm standing in front of Tokyo's Shibuya Station , in the middle of a cheering crowd of radical right - wing nationalists .
A man in a black van is shouting about the evil of foreign influence on Japan .
I roll my eyes as the speaker spews out a racist stream of historical revisionism and slurs , while never meeting my gaze .
I do n't make a habit of attending anti-foreigner rallies ; I simply agreed to meet someone in this popular Tokyo neighborhood , and the screaming nationalists just happened to be there too .
It 's a little ironic , since the man I 'm meeting is James Kay , a Dutch - born British citizen who calls Tokyo home .
For all the anti-foreigner hate being screamed , Japan needs more foreigners -- especially those like Kay -- if it wants to fight the double threat of an aging population and declining birth rate .
It will take foreign entrepreneurs and workers to save Japan .
Kay and his business partner Paul Caristino are the founders and sole members of Score Studios , a new game development studio .
Both are industry veterans , having both worked as game makers in their native countries and Japan -- Kay at Criterion and Marvelous , Caristino at EA and tri-Ace .
Score focuses mostly on iPhone development , though it plans to branch out into PC , Xbox Live Arcade , and PlayStation Network .
Why Japan ?
Despite the allure that Japan holds for many in the games industry , Kay has no such romantic notions .
" If after three years you 're taking photos of Shibuya Crossing , there 's something going wrong .
I 'm not here for the Japanese angle .
I live in Japan for my own reasons .
I work in Japan for my own reasons . "
Kay lives in Tokyo not because of any passionate love for Japanese pop culture , video games , or manga , but for more pragmatic reasons .
" Every place has its positives and negative .
Tokyo comes out on the plus side . "
Caristino , who lives in Fukushima Prefecture , chose to stay in Japan for similar reasons .
After working as an English teacher in rural Miyagi prefecture , he found himself in Australia once again .
" Not much had changed , and I found myself wanting to go back to Japan more and more .
I ended up in Tokyo 10 months later at tri-Ace , working as a programmer in their R&D department , " he says .
Paul Caristino
The choice to live in Japan is not , in itself , a particularly exotic or novel one in 2010 .
While Japan does not have nearly as many foreigners per capita as other major industrialized democracies around the world , expatriates in Tokyo quickly find that they are just one among many .
However , most of the foreigners living legally in Japan are working for someone else .
And though many expatriates -- who are willing to leave their home country and make a life elsewhere , are on the whole more adventurous and daring than your average individual -- seem willing or able to brave the Byzantine legal system of Japan and form their own company .
To Kay , there did n't seem to be much of a choice .
" I wanted to start a company .
I just happened to live in Japan .
I live here permanently . "
The fact that his company was in Japan was inconsequential .
For Caristino , the decision came about as a matter of circumstance .
" James was talking about it for a while , and after leaving Tokyo , the prospect of working from home was one I jumped at .
It came from long talks about the direction of the company and our own ideas towards game development , and had it been anyone else I doubt I would have done it .
You could probably say it was one of those ' right place , right people , right time ' things . "
Though the fact that Score is based in Japan is almost incidental , Kay did mention that there is at least one added perk to managing a company in Japan .
" Once you start a company , you 're supporting the welfare state .
Employing Japanese , etc .
So they wo n't help you set up a company , but they will prevent you from going bankrupt .
The tax office will let you delay payment . "
FNC ’s Shepard Smith and RNC Chairman Michael Steele had a heated exchange today over the language being used by Steele and other GOP leaders to describe just how bad this health care bill actually is .
The major part of the disagreement stemmed from the use of the word “ Armageddon ” by Steele – but Shep also put Steele on the spot with his plan to fire Nancy Pelosi .
Smith asked Steele about David Frum‘s “ Waterloo ” column today , and Steele brought the conversation to firing Nancy Pelosi ( a new website he touted several times ) .
“ This is my message : I ’m asking Americans to join me across this country in firing Nancy Pelosi , ” he said , to which Shep eventually interrupted : “ I heard this talking point last night and I want to move forward . ”
More from Shep :
I want to know how people are supposed to help you fire Nancy Pelosi .
And specifically , would it be the people who had a pre-exisitng condition and could n’t get insurance but after the President signs it tomorrow can , would it be the child who had a disease but could n’t get treated because they did n’t have any money , who would be able to be treated for that tomorrow , or who would it be who would want to be firing Nancy Pelosi ?
Tough question to answer , of course .
“ The people who want to be able to make those decisions without the government sitting between them and their doctor , ” started Steele .
Then Shep turned to rhetoric .
He fired these questions while Steele tried to answer each : “ Is this Armageddon , Mr. Chairman ?
Mr. Chairman , Armageddon ?
Seriously ?
Armageddon , Mr. Chairman , would you like a definition ? ”
The conversation continued after the commercial break , with Shep sticking to his line of questioning calmly , but pointedly – and Steele stayed on message .

( CNN ) --
The latest trend at teen parties is n't warm beer or prescription medicines pilfered from parents ' medicine cabinets .
Instead , increasing numbers of youths are turning to an herb - based product to get high , and unlike marijuana , it 's perfectly legal .
It 's known as K2 or Spice , a synthetic substance that , when smoked , gives users a marijuana - like high , according to drug authorities .
Its growing popularity is causing increasing alarm among health care professionals , law enforcement authorities and lawmakers , with one Drug Enforcement Agency official calling its use the equivalent of " playing Russian roulette . "
Should some illegal drugs be legalized ?
Manufactured in Asia and sold online or in local stores , K2 and similar substances are marketed as herbal incense .
A disclaimer on a K2 - selling Web site reads : " K2 Herbal products are novelty incenses and are not for consumption . "
Sold in various flavors in 3 - gram bags , the product consists of herbs that are sprayed with synthetic substances that mimic THC , the high - causing natural chemical found in marijuana .
A call to regulate K2
Health and drug officials say the danger in using such products is the unregulated nature of their production and makeup .
" Our biggest concern is that this particular chemical is likely manufactured in a dorm - room setting .
And these dorm - room scientists are not going to be exhibiting a lot of quality assurance techniques , " says Dr. Gaylord Lopez , a toxicologist and head of the Georgia Poison Center .
As a result , there 's a potential for users to inhale contaminants along with the substance they think they 're smoking , Lopez said , which may be a contributing factor in the adverse symptoms some of its users have been experiencing .
Political activist wants K2 banned
" Synthetic drugs and herbal drug products like Spice and K2 are not made in a controlled environment and thus you are playing Russian roulette when it comes to these types of products , " said Dawn Dearden , a spokeswoman for the DEA , which first began receiving reports about abuse of the substance last year .
" There is no way , outside of a controlled laboratory environment , to determine the chemical makeup , synthetic ingredients or amounts , and therefore there is no way to determine with any accuracy what the potentially harmful effects may be . "
Lopez says his center first heard of the substance in December when Georgia hospitals began reporting patients who had used K2 or Spice .
Since then , the center has seen a spike in cases , with 20 people -- mostly teenagers -- visiting emergency rooms with such symptoms as heart palpitations and respiratory issues .
In the most serious case , an otherwise healthy teenage boy , who has since recovered , lapsed into a coma , Lopez said .
According to Dearden , additional side effects can include panic attacks , hallucinations , delusions , vomiting , increased agitation and dilated pupils .
Around the center , Lopez said his employees have begun referring to the substance as " Scary Spice . "
Earlier this month , Kansas became the first state to ban synthetic marijuana .
Kansas state Sen. Jim Barnett , a supporter of the effort , said the ban was prompted by reports of abuse of K2 and similar products in cities across the state among high school students and prison parolees who were using it as an alternative to pot to avoid a positive drug test .
Lawmakers in several other states are considering similar legislation , including Georgia , Utah , Missouri , Tennessee , Kentucky , North Dakota and Illinois .
" Although it is a synthetic drug , it is still a drug with a high potential for abuse , " says Barnett , who is a physician .
" It was our desire in Kansas to be ahead of the problem . "
K2 has already been banned in some European countries , including Britain , Germany , Poland and France , and the DEA lists it as a drug of concern in the United States .
" We are seeing several indications that these THC - like substances could become a significant problem both domestically and internationally , " Dearden says .
She says the agency is in " the preliminary stages of determining whether or not some or all of ( synthetic substances ) need to be controlled . "
When you have to be connected to the Internet at all times to be able to play a single - player game , something has gone terribly wrong with this industry .
EA 's first - party blogger and outspoken mouthpiece Jeff Green found this out the hard way , and spread the word .
" Booted twice — and progress lost — on my single - player C&C4 game because my DSL connection blinked .
DRM fail .
We need new solutions , " he posted to Twitter .
He then goes on and says that calling it a single - player game may not be fair .
" However , C&C4 experiments w / what a " single - player game " is — given it 's constantly uploading progress / stats for unlocks .
It 's complicated ...
I think if we think of C&C4 as an ' online - only ' game — which it basically is — then maybe we 'd adjust our expectations accordingly . "
Making single - player games effectively online - only is a bad solution to any problem , especially after we 've explored how many people live without reliable Internet connections .
You could save the points and progress and upload them when there is a connection , as Green points out , or simply design your games assuming players may not always be where there is Internet .
Green sent a warning to prospective players .
" The story is fun , the gameplay is interesting and different at least — but if you suffer from shaky / unreliable DSL — you 've been warned . "

Has the Journal of Geophysical Research been coerced into defending the climate alarmist faith ?
Science is best progressed by open and free discussion in which all participants have equal rights of contribution .
This is especially the case when a scientific issue is related to a matter of high public controversy - such as the hypothesis of dangerous human - caused global warming .
In July 2009 we published a paper in the peer - reviewed Journal of Geophysical Research ( JGR ) in which we described the results of comparing global atmospheric temperature since 1958 with variations in the El Nino - Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) climatic framework .
Our analysis supported earlier research that demonstrates a close link between these factors , and indicated that a large portion of the variability in global temperature is explained by ENSO variation , thus leaving little room for a substantial human influence on temperature .
On November 20 , a newly appointed , replacement JGR editor informed us that a group of scientists led by Grant Foster ( aka Tamino ) had submitted a critique of our paper for publication in JGR .
To which a reviewer responded “ But as it is written , the current paper [ Foster et al. draft critique ] almost stoops to the level of “ blog diatribe ” .
The current paper does not read like a peer - reviewed journal article .
The tone is sometimes dramatic and sometimes accusatory .
It is inconsistent with the language one normally encounters in the objectively - based , peer - reviewed literature . ”
Anonymous referee of the Foster et al. critique , September 28 , 2009 .
We were invited to write a response , which we did , submitting it to JGR on January 14 , 2010 .
On March 16 , the replacement editor contacted us again .
He included three referees ’ reports , and indicated that on the advice of these referees he was rejecting our response to the Foster et al. critique , and that the response would therefore not be published in JGR .
The practice of editorial rejection of the authors ’ response to criticism is unprecedented in our experience .
It is surprising because it amounts to the editorial usurping of the right of authors to defend their paper and deprives readers from hearing all sides of a scientific discussion before they make up their own minds on an issue .
It is declaring that the journal editor - or the reviewers to whom he defers - will decide if authors can defend papers that have already been positively reviewed and been published by that same journal .
Such an attitude is the antithesis of productive scientific discussion .
Something smells , and a hint of what is on the wind is contained in the quotations at the head of this preamble .
To set the historical record straight , we relate below in date order the events - as they are known to us - that led to the editorial censorship of our reply to the critique by Foster et al .
Thereafter , we provide three appendices :
Appendix A - the Foster et al. critique of McLean et al. , 2009 , as posted on the web prior to its publication by AGU .
Appendix B - our ( JGR - rejected ) response to this critique .
Appendix C - a recent editorial commentary about AGU publishing practices by the President of the Union ( which publishes JGR ) , Professor Timothy Grove .
The original research paper that is the subject of the critique ( Appendix A ) and the response ( Appendix B ) is : McLean , J. , de Freitas , C.R. & Carter , R.M. , ( 2009 ) Influence of the Southern Oscillation on tropospheric temperature .
Journal of Geophysical Research 114 , D14104 , doi:10.1029/2008JD011637 .
It can be accessed here .
How not to conduct a fair and impartial scientific debate : an itemised history of the AGU censorship
The following events occurred in relationship to a paper that we submitted for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research on December 12 , 2008 , up until March 16 , 2010 , when the editor rejected our reply to criticism of our paper .
December 12 , 2008 .
Initial submission of a paper by McLean , J. , de Freitas , C.R. & Carter , R.M. , titled “ nfluence of the Southern Oscillation on tropospheric temperature ” , for consideration for publication in the Journal of Geophysical Research ( JGR ) , Atmospheres .
February 17 , 2009 .
The first JGR editor that we dealt with forwards reports from three referees and a request that the authors revise the paper according to criticisms made by the referees .
One referee commented in part : “ I found the paper to be well - organized , well - written , and clear on the importance of the research .
The abstract is informative , reference section is excellent , and the graphics are of high quality .
The findings are likely to be of interest to a wide variety of readers . ”
A second referee commented in part : “ This very clear and well - written manuscript is an analysis of the relationship between MSU - derived and radiosonde - based tropospheric temperature variability and the Southern Oscillation , as modified by major tropical volcanic eruptions .
I find few faults with this analysis from a scientific standpoint ; my primary concern is the lack of novelty .
Climatologists have known about the strong linkage between the SOI ( and its cousins ) and tropospheric temperature for some time now .
The authors acknowledge as much and they include most of the key references on the subject . ”
As well as these general comments , all three referees made constructive criticisms of various technical points , to which we responded by modifying our manuscript to take account of them .
March 24 , 2009 .
After incorporating appropriate modifications in response to the referees ’ criticisms , a revised and improved manuscript is submitted to the AGU .
April 27 , 2009 .
The editor indicates acceptance of the revised paper for publication in a forthcoming issue of JGR Atmospheres .
July 23 , 2009 .
Publication of the McLean et al. paper in JGR Atmospheres .
The paper first established that a 7 - month time - lagged relationship exists between changes in ENSO and changes in average global lower tropospheric temperature , except when volcanic eruptions cause cooling , and then applied this time lag to raw data in the Discussion and Conclusions .
The establishment of the 7 - month time lag employed an unusual method , but the period was in general agreement with earlier papers by other authors , and our Discussion and Conclusions would have been essentially the same if we had sourced the time lag from one of those other papers .
The relevance of this point will become clear later .
Important note .
We note that up to this point , all persons involved - namely , the JGR editor , referees and authors - had behaved according to the normal professional code of conduct that applies to papers being processed for scientific publication , and in accordance with the sentiments expressed on this matter in a statement by AGU president Professor Timothy Groves ( see Appendix C ) .
Thereby , a paper had been submitted , refereed , modified according to the referees ’ comments , accepted by the editor , and finally published .
However , these circumstances were about to change and for the details we turn to emails that have been released into the public domain by the Climategate affair , and to our emailed exchanges with the JGR editor .
Read about what happened next as alarmist like Grant Foster , James Annan , Phil Jones , Michael Mann , Jim Renwick , Jim Salinger , Gavin Schmidt and Kevin Trenberth and then the AGU itself showed their true colors here .

Intel went for a quirky " lunch room " ad while Vizio chose star power in its Beyonce commercial .
We do n't know what inspired Boost Mobile 's ad , meanwhile , but the humor appears to miss the mark [ Update : Commenters say it 's a remake of the " Chicago Bears Super Bowl Shuffle " ] .
Our favorite : Google 's sentimental made - for - web ad — it was promoted to Super Bowl status after its success on YouTube .
FLO TV 's retrospective on American media is also a very memorable attempt .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Americans ' ratings of the job President Barack Obama is doing in three key areas are much less positive than their expectations were for him shortly after he took office .
Americans give Obama the best review for protecting the environment and the worst for making America prosperous .
" Even though Americans ' ratings for Obama 's handling of these issues have dropped sharply over the past year , they are no worse than Bush 's ratings toward the end of his term . "
The declines are understandable , given the high expectations for Obama when he took office and the erosion in his overall job approval rating over the past year .
Last March , he averaged 62 % job approval , compared to ratings in the high 40 % range today .
On a proportional basis , however , the declines in his ratings on the environment , energy , and prosperity eclipse those for his overall approval rating .
Gallup asked the same items about George W. Bush throughout his presidency .
A comparison of Bush 's year 1 vs. year 2 ratings to Obama 's yields two important distinctions for Bush .
First , expectations for how Bush would handle these issues were generally not as high at the outset of his presidency as they were for Obama .
Second , Bush 's ratings did not decline nearly as much in his second year , probably due to the rally in public support Bush enjoyed after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .
Bush 's first - and second - year ratings were similar on the environment and the economy , though he did drop significantly on energy .
Even though Americans ' ratings for Obama 's handling of these issues have dropped sharply over the past year , they are no worse than Bush 's ratings toward the end of his term .
In his second term in office , from 2005 to 2008 , Bush averaged 33 % " good job " ratings on the environment , 27 % on energy , and 39 % on the economy .
Obama 's current ratings are predictably much more positive among Democrats than among Republicans , with the largest difference of opinion ( 60 percentage points ) in ratings of the job he is doing on the economy .
Bottom Line
After more than a year in office , a slim majority of Americans say President Obama is doing a good job on the environment , and less than half say so about his handling of the economy and energy -- marking declines from the large majorities of Americans who a year ago predicted he would do a good job .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,014 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted March 4 - 7 , 2010 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
An urban guerrilla offensive seems to be underway in Athens with two major bomb attacks within the last 48 hours , one against the headquarters of the neo-nazi party Golden Dawn , and one against the Police Directorship for Immigrants .
In less than 48 hours two major bombs have hit Athens , marking what seems to be an urban guerrilla spring offensive in the greek capital .
The first bomb exploded a little after 8:00 a.m. on Friday 19 March at the headquarters of Chrisi Avgi ( Golden Dawn ) the neo - nazi party of greece , an organisation responsible for countless murder attempts , arson attacks and pogroms against immigrants , leftists and anarchists .
The group is led by Mr Mihaloliakos a convicted bomber who founded the Golden Dawn in the early 1980s under the direct orders of the imprisoned head of the colonels junta , Georgios Papadopoulos .
The daily Eleftherotypia has published documents of Mr Mihaloliakos salary details in the service of EYP , the greek secret services .
The bomb that hit the offices on Sokratous street had been pre-announced to the daily Eleftherotypia , giving 20 minutes to evacuate the building and the near by hotel .
The bomb , which has been estimated by the police as " very strong " but with a slow diffusion as to minimise the blast wave that could damage near - by buildings , has demolished the officers , creating a crater through the concrete floor and leaving none but cement columns standing .
To this moment no urban guerrilla group has claimed responsibility for the attack which the anti-terrorist bureau has coined " a classic divergence tactic " in relation to the investigations on Lambros Foundas , the 35 year old anarchist shot dead during a gun battle with the police earlier this week .
The man is proclaimed by the anti-terrorist bureau as " a key member of one of the big new generation terrorist groups " of greece .
Anarchist have launched an extended campaign in honour of Lambros Foundas with thousands of posters and a one thousand strong protest march to the spot of his assassination being realised today noon .
The second bomb exploded at 15:58 p.m on Saturday 20 March at the Police Directorship for Immigrants ( Allodapon ) at Petrou Ralli avenue , Athens .
Allodapon is the notorious camp - like place where all immigrants have to stand in line for endless hours waiting for papers applications while cops brutalise them indiscriminately .
There have been many deaths of immigrants as a result of police brutality , as well as protest marches and clashes with the police as a result ( all covered in earlier postings in libcom ) .
The explosion was pre-announced to the daily Elefterotypia with a phone - call that allowed 20 minutes to evacuate the buildings and close of the streets .
The bomb , which is claimed by the police to be " strong " has damaged part of the premises , while its blast wave has also damaged shops across the avenue , with no human injuries due to the evacuation .
Both this and the bomb in Sokratous street were time - bombs .
The bomb attacks come after more than a month of a lull by urban guerrilla groups which has launched a winter offensive during December and January .
It must be noticed that the small bomb that hit the house of the vice - president of the Pakistani community yesterday is widely considered to be related to the Pakistani secret services ( due to the fact that it has been proceeded by the assassination of an embassy official of Pakistan ) and not to domestic armed struggle .
An otherwise festive protest march against the immigration methods of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpio turned ugly Saturday afternoon when a small group brawled with police and hit a mounted officer and her horse with sticks .
Police used pepper spray to disperse the crowd and arrested five people .
Sarah Grace Daniels , 23 , Jeremiah M. Henry , 18 , and Issa A. Emadi , 26 , were booked aggravated assault on a police officer charges , Phoenix police said .
Garyn Klasek , 30 , is facing aggravated assault on a police officer and disorderly conduct charges .
Claire E. Brock , 23 , was booked for resisting arrest and disorderly conduct .
The group was dressed entirely in black with bandanas over their faces and signs read " Assassinate Arpaio " and other anarchist messages .
They had been jawing with police for most of the afternoon , chanting profanities at officers and throwing bottles at them near the beginning of the march .
Officers on bikes and horses and more in patrol cars escorted the group the rest of the way until they reached 35th Avenue and Durango , blocks from the jail .
Salvador Reza , one of the organizers of the protest , described the people who created the disturbance as an outside faction .
" There was provocation by some groups who came here for their own purpose to disrupt a peaceful march , " Reza said .
The marchers began to cut off a utility cart that had been riding alongside the demonstration and police brought in a mounted officer to separate the protestors from the officer .
The crowd surrounded the horse and a few protestors hit the animal with sticks that had black flags on them .
Two other police officers were assaulted by the suspects who threw water bottles , possibly containing rocks , police said .
The bottles missed .
Some protestors not affiliated with the outside group were sprayed , some of them were children .
Alexandra Alvarez said her six - year - old son and 11 - year - old daughter were hit with the spray .
Her son has asthma and was quickly using his prescription inhaler .
Both were crying from the sting of the spray .
" We were walking when all of a sudden there was a strong smell that started to sting , " Alvarez said .
The march began peacefully , with protesters gathering at Falcon Park in west Phoenix .
It had something of a festival feel as people spread blankets , listened to music and speakers and bought ice cream and popcorn from vendors .
By 11:45 a.m. , the group took to the streets for the more than 4 - mile march that took them south on 35th Avenue toward Tent City , which is south of Buckeye Road .
Several marchers started chanting in Spanish , urging Arpaio to stop his tactics .
Many others hoisted signs that read " We Are Human . "
There was no opposition to the marchers throughout the day as they proceeded to head towards Tent City .
Protest participants started arriving at Falcon Park before 9 a.m. , joining fellow immigrants - rights advocates in urging the Obama administration to end an agreement that lets the Sheriff 's Office check the immigration status of people booked into its jails .
Organizers believe some Valley police officers are engaging in racial profiling by arresting Latinos for minor crimes in order to check their immigration status .
In 2009 , the Department of Homeland Security took away Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's power to arrest illegal immigrants under a revised agreement that still lets jail officials enforce immigration laws .
As she mingled among others at the protest , Sarahi Uribe , a representative from the National Day Labor Organizing Network , said the hope was to stir the Obama administration into action , specifically Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano .
" We want to tell her to stop the deportation and abuses of civil rights , " Uribe said .
" We 're very inspired by the civil - rights struggle in this country , and we see this as a continued fight . "
The Rev. Liana Rowe of Shadow Rock United Church of Christ in Phoenix said she came to the protest as a show of solidarity .
" Babies are being separated from their mamas , and families are being split up in the process , all in the name of anti-immigration , " Rowe said .
Several elementary and high school teachers were among the marchers .
Tim Broyles , a social - justice teacher at Brophy College Preparatory in Phoenix , said a few students from the school came out to support their peers .
" There are kids in this group who deal with this ( immigration ) on a daily basis , " Broyles said .
" Their buddies are here because they know what 's going on . "
Ruben Rivas , 29 , a fourth - grade teacher in Mesa , also came to show his support .
" I do n't know who is documented or undocumented in my classroom , " he said , " but a lot of my kids talk a lot about not being able to visit grandparents .
It 's an injustice . "
After the morning rally at Falcon Park , the group marched to Tent City , the outdoor jail facility run by the Sheriff 's Office on Durango Street .
Singer Linda Ronstadt walked the march and was to perform later in the day , but was not able to because she was tired from the march .
By 2:45 p.m. , some marchers left .
Reza said the march was overall successful in sending out a message against the tactics of Arpaio and the policies of immigration that divide families and communities .
A group of at least 10 meat packers from San Francisco made the 12 - hour drive overnight in order protest what one described as policies that threaten laborers all over the country .
" If we were n't here it'd be 3,000 ( protestors ) minus 10 , " Geravo Sanez said .
" We wanted to make sure it was 3,000 plus 10 . "
‘ Govt official concedes no attempt to wiretap , ’ O’Keefe Tweet gloats
If there is a gag order against accused phone tamperer James O’Keefe then the once - celebrated conservative activist / journalist / prankster / defendant just might have broken it Wednesday night .
“ Govt official concedes no attempt to wiretap , ” O’Keefe Tweeted a half - hour before midnight .

Wednesday afternoon , NBC News reported that the judge had instructed O’Keefe not to talk about the case .
Contacted by RAW STORY , Professor Jonathan Turley , a nationally recognized legal expert , concurred , “ It could indeed violate an order .
It is extremely unwise for clients to be tweeting on their case even without such an order .
Mr. O’Keefe has a record of reckless conduct and this would certainly add to that record . ”
“ Having said that , these orders often create a conflict for counsel in zealous representation and protecting a fair trial , ” Turley added .
“ Mr. O’Keefe is being widely accused of an attempted wiretap .
He has an interest in rebutting such claims .
Yet , it is always problematic for a client to directly manage the media .
While a tweet is not likely to result in serious punishment in this case , it can bring a sharp rebuke and undermine the relationship with the court . ”
At his blog , Turley adds , “ O’Keefe seems to relish reckless acts .
His stunt with ACORN appears to have violated state laws .
Even without a surveillance conspiracy , the Landrieu stunt is still quite serious .
What is interesting is that O’Keefe hardly needs to directly communicate such information given the press attention in the case . ”

O’Keefe ’s
Tweet was referring to an article published on an MSNBC blog by NBC’s Pete Williams entitled “ Why tamper with Landrieu ’s phones ? ”
“ A law enforcement official says the four men arrested for attempting to tamper with the phones in the New Orleans office of Sen. Mary Landrieu ( D ) were not trying to intercept or wiretap the calls , ” Williams writes .
“ Instead , the official says , the men , led by conservative videomaker James O’Keefe , wanted to see how her local office staff would respond if the phones were inoperative . ”
Andrew Breitbart , who pays O’Keefe for his “ life rights ” believes that this signals the death to “ Tampergate ” or “ Louisianagate ” or “ Watergate Jr . ”

For those in the mainstream media committed to report the false and libelous narrative of “ Watergate Jr. , ” “ wiretapping ” and “ bugging , ” I predict much egg on your J - school grad faces .
In your rush to judgment to convict James O’Keefe and his companions , you vengeful political partisans of press forgot to ponder : “ Was Mr. O’Keefe up to one of his patented and obvious clown nose - on hidden camera tricks , trying to make his subjects look foolish ? ”
Blog commenters seem to be quicker on the uptake than six - figured Washington - based pundits these days .
And I predict there will be tape to vindicate these four pranksters , too .
One unnamed official in an MSNBC blog was enough to convince conservative blogger Patterico aka Patrick Frey that “ law enforcement and James O’Keefe ’s supporters agree : he did not intend to wiretap Mary Landrieu . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
So there was no intent to wiretap .
Let ’s dispel that idea now .
Nobody is claiming he was trying to bug Landrieu .
Everyone who compared this to Watergate was wrong , wrong , wrong — and should be embarrassed .
Period .
The only question now is what he and 3 other men did intend to do .
The Government position is that O’Keefe & Company wanted to shut down Landrieu ’s phone system
Patterico links to a theory posted at The Jawa Report which the MSNBC report seems to support :
I am postulating that the group was trying to document ( with video camera ) that Landrieu ’s office had either disconnected or re-routed the phones to deflect incoming calls – hence , why they could n’t get through .
There have been anecdotal reports that Landrieu ’s office has received complaints that it has been inaccessible by phone , particularly around the time when she was bought off by the Democrats for the now - infamous Louisiana Purchase .

Earlier Wednesday , during a cable news interview , O’Keefe ’s father said that although he did n’t know anything about the plot he thought it might have something to do with the “ Louisiana land purchase . ”
The elder James O’Keefe apparently was referring to “ Lousiana purchase , ” a nickname conservatives have applied to “ the buyoff ” Louisiana senators allegedly received to sign on to the health care reform bill .
Wednesday night , NBC News ’ David Shuster told Rachel Maddow that “ there`s every indication , Rachel , that they did not have any particular equipment on them to actually do any sort of phone tap .
In other words , what they were carrying in their blue denim and their fluorescent vests , the two guys to try to pretend that they were phone technicians .
They actually didn`t have any technical equipment . ”
“ And , secondly , what was described as a listening device by Stan Dai who was in the truck outside , we believe was simply some sort of cell phone or a walkie - talkie so that he could communicate with the people who are upstairs on the 10th floor , ” Shuster added .
In an article in Thursday ’s Washington Post entitled “ ACORN foe tweeted about planned sting of Sen. Landrieu ’s office ” Carol D. Leonnig reports , “ Supporters say O’Keefe and his friends entered Landrieu ’s office to conduct another undercover sting : to show on video that citizens trying to call Landrieu ’s office could not get through .
Now O’Keefe — a celebrated figure among some Republicans for his undercover sting last fall targeting the nonprofit Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) — and three other men face charges of entering federal property on false pretenses as part of a plot to tamper with the lawmaker ’s phone .
If convicted , they could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . ”

Prescient liberals at Daily Kos , TPMMuckraker and Democratic Underground had predicted that conservatives would attempt to downplay the story by jumping on the media for assuming “ maliciously interfering ” and reports that a suspect nabbed outside had a listening device in his possession could only mean bugging .
In his email to RAW STORY , legal expert Jonathan Turley noted that he had n’t jumped the gun like others had : “ The government is charging him with trespass with intent to commit a felony .
Many of us have been speculating on what that felony was .
I stated on the day of the arrest that I thought it was odd that the felony was not identified and that , if surveillance was the intent , no surveillance devices were referenced in the affidavit of the agent . ”
Even if “ Tampergate ” turns out to only be about shutting down a US Senator ’s phones instead of tapping them , O’Keefe and his alleged accomplices are still facing serious charges , and legal analyst Jonathan Turley speculated on MSNBC ’s Countdown with Keith Olbermann Tuesday night that more could be tagged on at a later date .
Turley blogs ,
They have been charged with entering federal property under false pretenses with the intent of committing a felony .
However , that is likely only the first charge .
There are a host of additional charges , particularly if the prosecutor support the widespread speculation of an alleged conspiracy to wiretap the office of a federal official .
It is not clear if the authorities confirmed an effort to wiretap or found such equipment — as opposed to another prank - like video .
Moreover , I would expect other possible arrests .
Usually there are other individuals with knowledge of such a boneheaded plan .
As for Flannagan ’s father , he is in Shreveport and thus not necessarily involved in any official capacity .
Obviously , he will be insulated from any role in any investigation under standard procedures for conflicts . ….
Depending on who they spoke to in the course of this day , they could also conceivably face charges under 18 U.S.C. 1001 , in giving false information to federal officers .

At Poligazette , Michael Merritt writes that the theory may “ perhaps , turn it more into the category of a ‘ prank ’ rather than an attempt to listen in on a Senator ’s private conversations , though I suppose in these more secure times they could have winded up with a tele - terrorism charge on their record . ”
Louisiana ’s WDSU reports , “ sources are telling NBC News that the whole thing was a prank and not a conspiracy to tap Landrieu ’s phones .
“ Post 9/11 , there are no pranks , ” said WDSU Crime and Safety Specialist Howard Robertson .
“ Every time someone pulls a prank , it affects every one of us . ” ….
Sources tell NBC
News that the men posing as telephone repairman had cameras on their work helmets so that they could capture their work cutting Landrieu ’s phone lines .
Those same sources said O’Keefe then , using a cell phone camera , hoped to record Landrieu staffers making embarrassing remarks about the phones not working .
Robertson added , “ We ’re talking about national security when this country is at war .
You do n’t do that , and I hope the judge tells them that by giving them jail time . ”
On Wednesday , RAW STORY reported that “ two of the three men arrested on Tuesday along with ‘ ACORN pimp ’ James O’Keefe for ‘ maliciously tampering ’ with Sen. Mary Landrieu ’s ( D - LA ) phones in her New Orleans office have ties to the United States intelligence community . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ All four of the men arrested in the plot Monday have well - documented conservative ties , The Associated Press revealed , ” RAW STORY ’s DC correspondent Sahil Kapur reported .
“ Three of the suspects wrote for conservative publications while in college , and Flanagan has written for the national Pelican Institute . ”

In Optimizing HTML , I mentioned that state of HTML minifiers is rather crude at the moment .
We have a large variety of JS and CSS minification tools , but almost no HTML ones .
This is actually quite understandable .
First of all , minifiying scripts and stylesheets usually results in better savings , overall .
Second , the nature of document markup is much more dynamic than that of scripts and styles .
As a result , HTML minification has to be done “ on demand ” , and carries certain overhead .
Only when this overhead is less then difference in time for delivering minified - vs - original document , there ’s a benefit in minification .
In some cases , though , savings in document size ( and so bandwidth ) can be more important than time spent on minification .
It ’s no suprise that HTML minification is almost always a low - priority optimization .
When it comes to client - side performance , there are certainly other more important things to pay attention to .
Only when other aspects are taken into consideration , it is worth minifying document markup .
Few weeks ago , I decided to experiment with Javascript - based HTML minifier and created an online - based tool , with lint - like capabilities .
After some tweaking , the script was able to parse and minify markup of almost any random website .
The goal was to see how easy it is to implement something like this , learn HTML a bit more , and have fun in a process .
Ultimately , I wanted to minify some of the popular websites and see if savings are worth all the trouble .
Today , I ’d like to share this tool with you .
I ’ll quickly go over some of the initial features , explain how minifier works , and look into possible side effects of minification .
Please note that the script is still in very early stage , and should n’t be used in production .
If you are not interested in inner workings , feel free to skip to tests or conclusions .
How it works
Parser
At its core , minifier relies on HTML parser by John Resig .
John ’s parser was capable of handling quite complex documents , but would sometimes trip on some of the more obscure structures .
For example , doctype declarations were not understood at all .
Whenever attribute name contained characters like “ - ” ( e.g. as in “ http- equiv ” ) , parser would fail .
There were also some defficiencies in regular expressions for matching comments and CDATA sections : newlines inside them were not accounted for , so multiline comments simply were n’t matched .
CDATA sections and comments inside elements with CDATA content model ( e.g. SCRIPT and STYLE ) were getting stripped for no apparent reason .
All of these are now fixed .
Minifier
Minifier is a very small “ wrapper ” on top of parser .
As of now it ’s only about 250 LOC .
It takes input string and configuration object ; passes this input string to parser , and builds final output according to specified options .
For example , we can tell it to remove comments :
var input = '<!-- foo --><div>baz</div><!-- bar
moo -->'; minify ( input , { removeComments : true } ) ; // '< div>baz</div >'
or to collapse boolean attributes :
var input = ' < input disabled =" disabled " >' ; minify ( input , { collapseBooleanAttributes : true } ) ; // '< input disabled >'
Test suite
One of the goals I had for this little project was to have a robust test suite .
HTML minifier is fully unit tested with ~ 100 tests at the moment .
This has few benefits : anyone can change , tweak or add things without worrying to break existing functionality .
It takes literally seconds to tell if script is functional in certain browser ( or even in non-browser implementation , such as node.js on a server ) — simply by running a test suite .
Finally , tests can serve as documentation for how minifier handles some of the edge cases .
Lint
While working on minifier , I realized that oftentimes the most wasteful part of the markup is not white space , comments or boolean attributes , but inline styles , scripts , presentational or deprecated elements and attributes .
None of these can be simply stripped , as that could affect state of the document and is just too obtrusive .
What can be done , however , is reporting of these occurences to the user .
HTMLLint is even a smaller script , whose job is exactly that — to log any deprecated or presentational elements / attributes encountered during parsing .
Additionally , it detects event attributes ( e.g. onclick , onmouseover , etc. ) .
The rationale for this is that moving contents of event attributes to external script allows to take advantage of resource caching .
Options
Before we begin , it 's important to understand that minifier parses documents as HTML , not XHTML .
This allows to employ such optimizations as " remove optional tags and quotes " , " collapse boolean attributes " , etc .
Note that almost none of the options affect document validity , as per HTML 4.01 .
XHTML support might be added in the future , but considering that in context of pubilc web it 's mostly pointless at the moment , I see little reason in doing so .
Besides , minifying XHTML documents ( given that they 're actually served to clients properly , with " application /xhtml+xml " ) does n't reduce size as much as if they were HTML .
The following is a list of current options in minifier .
It is far from being exhaustive , and will most likely be extended in a future .
Let ’s look at each one of them quickly :
var input = '<!-- some comment -->< p>blah </p >' ; var output = minify ( input , { removeComments : true } ) ; output ; // '< p>blah</p >'
This one should be self - explanatory .
Passing truthy removeComments tells minifier to strip HTML comments .
Note that comments inside elements with CDATA content model , such as SCRIPT and STYLE , are left intact ( but see next option ) .
var input = ' < script type = " text / javascript " ><!-- some comment --></script >' ; var output = minify ( input , { removeComments : true } ) ; output ; // '< script type = " text / javascript " ><!-- some comment --></script >'
When this option is enabled , HTML comments in scripts and styles are stripped as well :
var input = ' < script type = " text / javascript " ><!--
alert (1 ) --></script >' ; var output = minify ( input , { removeCommentsFromCDATA : true } ) ; output ; // '< script type = " text / javascript " > alert (1)</ script >'
It 's worth pointing out that there 's a slight difference in the way HTML comments are treated inside SCRIPT and STYLE elements .
In scripts , comment start delimiter ( " <!-< span></span >-" ) tells parser to ignore everything until newline :
<!-- alert ( 1 ) ; // alert never happens ! <!-- alert ( 2 ) ; // but this one does ! // " <!--" acts as a single - line JS comment ( " // " ) .
In styles , however , " <!--" is simply ignored when it 's present in the beginning of input ( I have n't tested what happens in other parts of a stylesheet ) .
Contrary to script behavior , anything that follows " <!--" still remains present :
<!-- body { color : red ; } --> /* treated as : body { color : red ; } */
Explanation of why you might want to strip comments .
Remove CDATA sections
This option removes CDATA sections from script and style elements :
var input = ' < script >/* <![ CDATA [
*/ alert ( 1 ) /* ] ]> */</script >' ; var output = minify ( input , { removeCDATASectionsFromCDATA : true } ) ; output ; // '< script>alert (1)</ script >'
Explanation of why you might want to do this .
Collapse whitespace
This options collapses white space that contributes to text nodes in a document tree .
For example :
var input = ' < div > < p > foo </ p> </div >' ; var output = minify ( input , { collapseWhitespace : true } ) ; output ; // '< div >< p> foo</p></div>'
It does n’t affect significant white space ; e.g. in contents of elements like SCRIPT , STYLE , PRE or TEXTAREA .
var input = ' < script > alert ( " foo bar " ) </ script >' ; var output = minify ( input , { collapseWhitespace : true } ) ; output ; // '< script > alert ( " foo bar " ) </ script >' input = ' < textarea > x x x </textarea >' ; output = minify ( input , { collapseWhitespace : true } ) ; output ; // '< textarea > x x x </textarea >'
Now , it ’s worth mentioning that this modification can have side effects , and significantly change document representation .
For example , markup like < span > foo < / span > < span > bar </ span > is usually displayed as “ foo bar ” in browsers , with one space character in between two words .
White space in markup is represented as text node in document tree .
This text node ’s value is a white space ( e.g. U+0020 ) , and as long as two adjacent elements are inline - level — as they are in this example — it is this white space that contributes to a gap in between “ foo ” and “ bar ” .
As soon as we remove that white space ( i.e. changing markup to < span > foo < / span > < span > bar </ span > ) , representation changes from “ foo bar ” to “ foobar ” .
There are two ways to work around this issue .
First one is not to rely on such white space for document representation , and instead style elements to have margins and paddings as needed .
In previous example , this could have been : < span class = " foo " > foo</ span >< span>bar</span>
( where foo class would be declared with , say , margin - right : 0.25em ; ) .
At first , this might seem like an overkill .
After all , adding class seems to defeat the purpose , resulting in larger output , when compared to a version with just one white space character .
However , depending on a context , giving few elements a class for styling purposes , and then stripping white space from the entire document , can result in a smaller output .
Second option is to never fully remove white space characters , and instead always collapse them to one white space character .
HTML 4.01 is actually specified to do just that , so there ’s no harm in doing it upfront .
Because of this , the following 2 snippets should render identically :
< span>foo</ span > < span>bar</span >
and :
< span>foo</ span > < span>bar</span >
... with one space in between “ foo ” and “ bar ” .
Note how in first case , there ’s an entire sequence of white space characters ( including line breaks ) .
This second option — collapsing to one white space — has not yet been added to minifier .
Another noticeable effect white space removal can have on a document is related to CSS white - space property .
As I mentioned earlier , by default , adjacent sequences of white space in most of the elements collapse into one space character .
But white - space property changes it all .
Some of its values result in different collapsing behavior .
white - space : pre , for example , makes whitespace render exactly as it occurs in a markup .
As a result , snippet like this :
< span style = " white - space : pre ; " > foo bar </ span >
foo bar
renders exactly as is , and becomes :
As of now , minifier does n’t respect space - preserving white - space values ( i.e. “ pre ” and “ pre-wrap ” ) .
It does n’t even understand them .
Unfortunately , computing elements ’ styles and determining their white - space values would be just way too complex and impractical [ 1 ] .
On a bright side , it seems that white - space property is not used very often .
In a future , it should be possible to add an option to minifier for specifying a way to prevent certain elements from having their content collapsed .
A filtering can be based on a class , a simple selector , or maybe even by parsing element ’s style attribute .
Collapse boolean attributes
HTML 4.01 has so - called boolean attributes — “ selected ” , “ disabled ” , “ checked ” , etc .
These may appear in a minimized ( collapsed ) form , where attribute value is fully ommited .
For example , instead of writing < input disabled =" disabled " > , we can simply write — < input disabled > .
Minifier has an option to perform this optimization , called collapseBooleanAttributes :
var input = ' < input value = " foo " readonly =" readonly " > ' ; var output = minify ( input , { collapseBooleanAttributes : true } ) ; output ; // '< input value= " foo " readonly >'
A potential caveat here is that if you target elements by attribute name and value , things might break after applying this optimization .
Granted , this kind of case seems rather unreal , but here ’s an example .
If we had these rules :
input [ disabled ] { color : red } input [ disabled =" disabled " ] { color : green } input : disabled { color : blue }
and markup like < input disabled =" disabled " > , then after transforming it to < input disabled > , second rule — input[ disabled =" disabled " ] — would stop matching an element .
First and third ones , however , would still work as expected .
I ca n’t imagine why someone would use this second version , and you probably wo n’t ever stumble upon issues like these , but it ’s good to be aware of them .
Remove attribute quotes
By default , SGML ( which HTML originates from ) requires that all attribute values be delimited using either double or single quotes .
But in certain cases — when attribute values contain a specific set of characters — quotes can be omitted altogether .
Note that HTML specification recommends to always use quotes .
There ’s also an interesting explanation of why always quoting is a good idea by Jukka Korpela ( although none of the dangers he ’s talking about apply here ) .
Please , use this optimization with care .
Relevant option is removeAttributeQuotes , and it tells minifier to omit quotes when it is safe to do so :
var input = ' < p class = " foo - bar " id =" moo " title= " blah blah " > foo < /p >' ; var output = minify ( input , { removeAttributeQuotes : true } ) ; output ; // '< p class =foo - bar id=moo title= " blah blah " > foo < / p >'
Remove redundant attributes
Some attributes in HTML 4.01 have default values .
For example , input ’s type attribute defaults to “ text ” and form ’s method — to “ get ” .
When enabling corresponding option in minifier ( removeRedundantAttributes ) , these default attribute name - value pairs get stripped from the output .
There are also few other redundancies that are taken care of as part of this optimization .
One of them is removing deprecated language attribute on SCRIPT elements .
It was among markup smells I mentioned recently .
Another one is coexisting “ name ” and “ id ” attributes on acnhors .
And finally , redundant “ javascript ” labels in event handlers .
Use short doctype
This optimization is the only one affecting document validity .
That is if document is defined to be anything but HTML5 ( such as HTML 4.01 ) .
When useShortDoctype option is enabled , existing doctype is replaced with its short ( HTML5 ) version — <! DOCTYPE html > .
As mentioned before , this replacement is generally pretty safe , but you should decide for yourself if this is something worth doing .
Remove empty ( or blank ) attributes
The corresponding option is removeEmptyAttributes , and when enabled , all attributes with empty values are simply removed from the output .
This includes blank values as well — those consisting of white space only .
var input = ' < p id= " " STYLE= " " title= "
" > foo < /p > ' ; var ouptut = minify ( input , { removeEmptyAttributes : true } ) ; output ; // < p>foo</p>
Note that not all “ empty ” attributes are removed .
For example , both “ src ” and “ alt ” attributes are required on IMG elements , so we ca n’t remove them , even if they ’re empty .
Right now , only core attributes ( id , class , style , title ) , i18n ones ( lang , dir ) and event ones ( onclick , ondblclick , etc. ) are considered “ safe ” for removal .
The caveat here is that , similar to “ collapse boolean attributes ” option , this change can affect certain style or script behavior .
For example , you might want to target all elements with class attribute — *[ class ] { ... } .
This will apply to elements with empty class , such as < p class= " " > bar < / p> , but obviously not to those without — < p> bar </p> .
This might not be a big issue , but take it into consideration .
Some elements in HTML 4.01 are allowed to have their tags omitted .
Optional tags are either end one ( e.g. < /td > ) or both — start and end ones ( e.g. < tbody > and </tbody > ) .
Note that start tag can never be optional on its own .
Corresponding option in minifier is removeOptionalTags .
Currently , it only strips end tags of HTML , HEAD , BODY , THEAD , TBODY and TFOOT elements .
I do n’t fully understand the process of creating document tree from “ unclosed ” markup , so I ’m not sure when it ’s safe to omit tags like </p > .
For example , I can see how removing BODY start tag can have side effects .
Let ’s say we have a markup like this ( with omitted HTML 4.01 doctype , for brevity ) :
< head > < title >x </ title > </ head > < body >< script type=" text / javascript " ></ script > < p >x</p> < script type =" text / javascript " > document.write(document.body.childNodes[0].nodeName ) ; </ script > </ body >
and the same markup with HEAD and BODY tags removed :
< title >x </ title > < script type=" text / javascript " ></ script > < p >x</p> < script type =" text / javascript " > document.write(document.body.childNodes[0].nodeName ) ; </script >
Note that second version is a perfectly valid document .
It just has start and end tags of HEAD and BODY elements omitted .
Now what seems to happen here , in a second version , is this :
Browser starts parsing , encounters TITLE tag , and given lack of starting HTML and HEAD tags , creates both elements implicitly ( first , HTML , then HEAD as its immediate child ) .
It then continues parsing , up until it stumbles upon P element , which , as per DTD , can not be a child of HEAD .
Browser is therefore forced to implicitly close HEAD element , start BODY element , and continue parsing further .
P element becomes first child in BODY , and SCRIPT element becomes last child in HEAD .
Now , if we were to display both of these documents , first one would alert “ SCRIPT ” and second one — “ P ” .
This is becase in original version , SCRIPT element is defined explicitly to be a child of BODY , and in modified version — child of HEAD ( due to the way parsing works ) .
The behavior of two documents is therefore not identical .
We 've got a " problem " .
Just like with previous “ gotchas ” , I ’m not sure how likely this type of scenario is to appear in real life .
From what I can see , the only other element ( besides SCRIPT ) , allowed as child of both — HEAD and BODY , is OBJECT .
As for the future , it should be possible to make minifier strip other optional tags as well .
But only in safe scenarios .
It ’s also worth mentioning that unclosed elements can result in slightly slower parsing times .
Unfortunately , there are no extensive benchmarks done on this topic , and results seem to vary across browsers .
Remove empty elements
This optimization is probably one of the most obtrusive ones , which is why it is disabled by default .
Think of it as an experimental addition , and employ with great care .
There are dozens of valid use cases for occurence of empty elements in a document .
They can be used as placeholders for content inserted later with scripting ; or for presentational purposes , such as to implement rounded corners , shadows , float clearing , etc .
There are probably other cases , which I ca n’t think of at the moment .
When enabled , minifier simply removes all elements with empty contents ( but not those with empty content model , such as IMG , LINK , or BR ) .
For example :
var input = ' < p ></p>' ; var output = minify ( input , { removeEmptyElements : true } ) ; output ; // '' input = '< div>blah< span></span></div >' ; var output = minify ( input , { removeEmptyElements : true } ) ; output ; // '< div>blah</div >';
There are few things to be aware of .
First of all , elements containing only other empty elements are not removed .
For example :
var input = ' < div >< div > < div></div></div></div >' ; var output = minify ( input , { removeEmptyElements : true } ) ; output ; // '< div >< div></div></div >'
Note how only inner DIV element — the one with actual empty contents — is removed .
Second of all , only truly empty string is considered an empty content .
This does not include spaces , newlines , or other white space characters :
var input = ' < p >
</p >' ; // note one space character in between var output = minify ( input , { removeEmptyElements : true } ) ; output ; // '< p> </p >'
Also note that comments are parsed as separate entities and so do n’t affect “ emptiness ” of elements :
var input = '< p ><!-- comment --></p>' ; var output = minify ( input , { removeEmptyElements : true } ) ; output ; // ''
As with other optimizations , some of these limitations will likely be removed in the future .
This option simply toggles linting .
You can create new HTMLLint object and pass it to minifier .
During minification , lint object silently logs all " suspicious " activity .
It exposes populate method , which accepts element and inserts its log into this element :
var lint = new HTMLLint ( ) ; minify ( ' some input ... ' , { lint : lint } ) ; lint.populate(document.getElementById(' someElement ' ) ) ;
Field - testing
So how does minifier stand against real - life markup ?
Let ’s take a look at minification results of some of the popular websites ( note that when gzip 'ing documents , 6th level of compression ( default ) was used ) :
Amazon.com
Original size : 217KB ( 35.8 KB gzipped )
Minified size : 206.6KB ( 34.3 KB gzipped )
Savings : 10.4KB ( 1.5 KB gzipped )
Minifying home page of amazon.com saves about 10KB with uncompressed document , and only 1.5KB with compressed one .
What ’s interesting is that humongous 217KB is actually a result of miriad of inline styles and scripts scattered throughout a document .
Replacing those with external scripts would be the best optimization .
Getting rid of occasional style attributes would help too .
Digg.com
Original size : 82KB ( 18.2 KB gzipped )
Minified size : 74.9KB ( 17.2 KB gzipped )
Savings : 7KB ( 1KB gzipped )
On digg.com , reduction is slightly smaller — 7KB ( 1KB gzipped ) .
The markup is not as cluttered as on amazon , but still has smells : inline scripts ( and unnecessary comments in them ) , deprecated attributes , anchors defunct without scripting , etc .
The benefits of minification are rather small here .
Ajaxian.com
Original size : 177.6KB ( 32.4KB gzipped )
Minified size : 157.3KB ( 29.7 KB gzipped )
Savings : 20.3KB ( 2.7KB gzipped )
Trying out home page of ajaxian.com , we see a difference of ~ 20 KB — even better reduction in size .
And again , compressed documents show savings of only 2.7KB .
Speaking of compression , ajaxian.com shamelessly serves its 177KB - large document uncompressed .
There ’s also some redundant markup , like unnecessary ’s , excessive style attributes , lots of comments , and few inline scripts .
Removing all of those , and turning on compression would be an ultimate optimization .
Linkedin.com
Original size : 128.8KB ( 19.8 KB gzipped )
Minified size : 89.4KB ( 17.1 KB gzipped )
Savings : 39.4KB ( 2.7KB gzipped )
linkedin.com surprises with savings of almost 40 KB (! ) after minification .
Looking at the source , we see that large number is explained by excessive amount of whitespace .
This is a good example of how carelessly used whitespace can add up to huge number like this .
And again , gzip saves the day ; minifying compressed document reduces it only by 2.7KB .
ECMAScript language specification
Original size : 703KB ( 122.5 KB gzipped )
Minified size : 572KB ( 106.4KB gzipped )
Savings : 131KB ( 16 KB gzipped )
Large static documents is where HTML minification truly shines , and HTML version of ECMAScript ( 3rd ed. ) language specification is a clear demonstration of it .
Minifying document results in savings of 131KB (! ) for an uncompressed document , and 16KB for compressed one .
Since document is served statically , there ’s hardly any reason not to apply minification here .
Cost and benefits
It ’s pretty obvious that the best candidates for html minification are large static documents .
Or just static documents — FAQ ’s , standalone articles , etc .
Anything that ca n’t be compressed ( e.g. if there are not enough access rights , to enable gzip on a server ) would benefit from minification as well .
Even when serving gzipped content , it ’s worth remembering that not everyone is getting gzip .
So clients that are being sent gzipped content could receive 2 - 3KB smaller file , whereas those receiving uncompressed content could end up with files up to whopping 10 - 20 KB smaller than original ones .
One of the biggest problems I see , when it comes to dynamic minification , is the possibility of error .
The core of the issue is that minification relies on parsing , and parsing HTML is a pretty tricky business .
Even though minifier applies a strict set of rules — removing quotes and optional tags only when it is absolutely safe to do so , a single misplaced character in start tag can trip parser and wreak havoc on an entire document .
This is especially relevant when there ’s an inclusion of user - generated content .
As an example , browsers usually understand empty end tags ( allowed in HTML ) — < p > test </> , but parser , which minifier is based on , would immediately choke here and stop .
Another example is attributes containing “ weird ” characters — < a href = " http://example.com " " > test </a> ( note trailing quote after an attribute ) .
Many browsers happily parse this element , ignoring trailing quote .
But parser , once again , falls short and bails out .
It ’s certainly possible to tame errors and simply output original , uncompressed document .
But this brings us to another downside — time spent on minification .
Even when errors are not an issue , there ’s an actual overhead of parsing and processing document tree .
Minifying home page of amazon.com in pretty speedy nightly webkit , for example , takes exactly 1 second .
Most of that time is consumed by parsing .
1 second is quite a lot .
An acceptable time for real - time minification would be somewhere around 50 - 100 ms .
This problem can be mitigated by optimizing parser , or porting script to be executed in a faster environment ( v8 on a server ? ) .
Curiously , Opera 10.50 beta ( on Mac OS X ) managed to beat WebKit and completed this task almost twice faster ( ~500 ms ) .
Unfortunately , this version suffers from some bugs in regex matching , and fails half of the test suite .
Hopefully , those issues will be resolved in later revisions .
Another interesting performance observation was with V8 engine .
When testing with version 1.3.x , the time it took to minify amazon.com home page was 0.6 secs .
However , version 2.1.2.6 ( currently latest stabe ) performed same task in excruciatingly long 2 seconds .
Future
I can think of many other things to improve in minifier .
Unfortunately , I do n’t have much time to work on it .
The project is licensed under MIT , and is free for use / modification by anyone interested .
Test suite should make collaboration easy .
There ’s a short todo list on a bottom of project page .
Among other things , it lists some of the known bugs .
As always , any questions , corrections , and suggestions are very much welcomed .
Enjoy .

Unfortunately there is n’t enough room on that blackboard , because I can think of a whole lot more of these .
For example :
Apocalypse =
When Democrats pass a bill that is virtually identical to one passed by Mitt Romney , not to mention one Republicans proposed back in 1993
Fascist =
What to call someone when you ’ve used the word “ Socialist ” too much
Fiscal Restraint =
“ Do as I say , not as I do ”
Disrespect =
Ok when used against Obama , not ok when used against Bush .
I ’m sure you can think of some … leave them in the comments !
Guess which one 's the friend of working families ?
Although leading Democrats thought the bill 's chances were threatened when House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) condemned it , about half of the GOP House members backed the measure .
The lopsided House tally sent shock waves across the financial sector .
Officials predicted dire results , saying the brightest talent could flee institutions that remain wobbly as the firms themselves leave the rescue program prematurely .
The average executive at Bank of America received a $ 400,000 bonus one year after the bank took $ 45 billion from taxpayers through the TARP program .
The average worker in Ohio makes just over $ 41,000 a year .
Last week , insurance giant AIG -- which received $ 182 billion in government assistance -- paid out more than $ 100 million in bonuses to employees .
Last year , when news of the company ’s bonus plans were unearthed , employees pledged to return $ 45 million in bonuses .
Despite this , the company has recouped less than half of that pledged amount .
Investment bank Goldman Sachs -- which received $ 10 billion from the TARP program and $ 12.9 billion in taxpayer aid through the AIG bailout -- reported last week that it would pay out $ 16 billion in bonuses .
Despite the assistance they have received from taxpayers , many banks receiving TARP funds have cut small business lending .
In November , the U.S. Treasury Department reported that the 22 largest financial institutions receiving taxpayer assistance reduced lending by $ 10.5 billion over the previous six - month period .
These same banks reduced small business loans by another $ 1 billion according to a new report released in December .
Brown ’s bill would impose a 50 percent tax on all bonuses -- both cash and stock pay - outs -- in excess of $ 25,000 given to executives at firms that received taxpayer - funded assistance through the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 .
The revenues would be used to fund direct loans for small businesses administered by the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) .
Small businesses create more than 64 percent of jobs nationwide , but many are struggling to access credit during the recession .
Brown is the author of the Small Business Emergency Loan Relief Act , which would temporarily raise the maximum loan amounts for Small Business Administration ( SBA ) loan products and waive certain fees .
Through the SBA provisions passed in the Recovery Act , more than 2,100 Ohio small businesses have received loans .
Brown worked to connect more than 1,000 Ohio small businesses with resources on Recovery Act opportunities through a series of workshops he hosted across the state .
Similar legislation has been introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Rep. Peter Welch ( D - VT ) .
“ Fifteen months after Wall Street drove our economy off a cliff , the same big banks that survived thanks to taxpayer support have returned to their old ways .
Rather than invest in our nation ’s economic recovery or shore up their balances , these banks have chosen to reward themselves with excessive bonuses , ” Welch said .
“ By diverting outsized bonuses to small business lending , this legislation will support our local economies in a way that Wall Street has failed to . ”
I can imagine Rahm Emanuel and Lawrence Summers throwing darts at a picture of Sherrod Brown now , maybe even calling up Kyl and McConnell to plan some strategy .
Or asking the other Senator Brown if he'd like to work with them on something more ... um ...
Wall Street - oriented " bipartisan . " Yesterday Sherrod Brown ( D - OH ) introduced an even more stringent bill that targets any bonus over $ 25,000 -- where the Boxer - Webb bill goes after anything over $ 400,000 .
I 'm with Sherrod on this one .
He says he wants to use the proceeds to help small businesses expand and hire new employees .
In a talk about how Wall Street benefited from the infusion of taxpayer dollars via TARP , he explained why he thinks Main Street needs to be helped along now and how this is a way to get that started .
“ It ’s time , " he said , " for Wall Street to return the favor to Main Street .
While big banks have rebounded thanks to the help of American taxpayers , small businesses are still struggling .
If a big firm that received taxpayer help is now paying out massive bonuses , they should be able to help American small businesses expand operations and hire new workers .
Small business growth will create jobs and get our economy back on track . "
His office sent out details after his press conference : I can imagine Rahm Emanuel and Lawrence Summers throwing darts at a picture of Sherrod Brown now , maybe even calling up Kyl and McConnell to plan some strategy .
Or asking the Senator Brown if he'd like to work with them on something more ... um ... " bipartisan . "
On March 19 -- so just shy of a year ago -- the House overwhelmingly ( 328-93 ) passed a bipartisan bill introduced by Charlie Rangel ( D - NY ) to tax excessive bonuses paid by and to top executives of firms receiving TARP bailouts .
This was aimed at AIG executives and other greed - obsessed Wall Street banksters and career criminals .
In the Senate , " Republicans voiced strong objections to the tax approach , calling it a smokescreen for the administration 's faulty oversight of the Troubled Assets Relief Program .
' It sounds to me like these guys are trying to cover their tracks , ' said Sen. Jon Kyl ( Ariz . ) , the No. 2 Republican leader " -- who has accepted $ 3,728,644 in thinly disguised bribes from the Finance Sector since first being elected to Congress .
When the House voted , the only Democrats crossing the aisle to vote with Boehner were Wall Street shills Melissa Bean ( IL ) , Larry Kissell ( NC ) , Michael McMahon ( NY ) , Walt Minnick ( Blue Dog - ID ) , Harry Mitchell ( Blue Dog - AZ ) and Vic Snyder ( AR ) .
On the Republican side , even the very worst and most dependable Wall Street puppets -- Paul Ryan ( WI ) , Eric Cantor ( VA ) , Roy Blunt ( MO ) , Mark Kirk ( IL ) , Mike Castle ( DE ) , Pete Hoekstra ( MI ) , Ken Calvert ( CA ) , Brian Bilbray ( CA ) and Mean Jean Schmidt ( OH ) -- abandoned Boehner , McKeon , Dreier Hensarling , Sessions and Bachus to vote with the Democrats .
It was Boehner 's worst defeat since he became minority leader : only two more Republicans voting with him and Wall Street than with the Democrats and Main Street .
The bill seems to have gotten lost in the Senate , a wholly owned Wall Street subsidiary .
Oh , wait -- notowned .
There is a small group of progressive Democrats -- very small -- who are actually independent of Wall Street .
You may have noticed that last week Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) and Jim Webb ( D - VA ) introduced a bill targeting outrageous bonuses of banksters who are getting it out of TARP money .

Google today announced a new service , Google Buzz , that automatically brings social networking into Gmail and the rest of the Google - sphere .
Whether or not you 're big on social networking sites like Twitter or Facebook , Buzz offers a somewhat new and intriguing approach .
Advertisement
What 's Buzz All About ?
Buzz 's five key features , as laid out in the event at Google HQ today , include :
Automatic friends lists ( friends are added automatically who you have emailed on Gmail )
" Rich fast sharing " combines sources like Picasa and Twitter into a single feed , and it includes full - sized photo browsing
Public and private sharing ( swap between family and friends )
Inbox integration ( instead of emailing you with updates , like Facebook might , Buzz features emails that update dynamically with all Buzz thread content )
" Recommended Buzz " puts friend - of - friend content into your stream , even if you 're not acquainted .
Recommendations learn over time with your feedback .
Advertisement
Buzz lets you share photos , video , links to web sites , and other content from all over the web with your closest contacts or with the public at large .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
It feels a whole lot like Facebook 's newsfeed — or even more like FriendFeed , though fewer people ever got to know FriendFeed all that well — but it lives inside Gmail and integrates automatically with your most frequent Gmail contacts .
Advertisement
Apart from working directly inside Gmail , it can pull content from Twitter , from Flickr , and from various other popular social sites from across the web .
Currently social services supported include :
Flickr
Twitter
Picasa Web
YouTube
Blogger
Any feed connected to your Google profile ( like your blog )
When you publicly post something via Buzz , it automatically and instantaneously adds the post to your Google Profile page ( which it creates for you if you have n't already created one ) .
If you want to post privately , you can create and choose specific groups you want to share with — in what looks like an attempt to offer both the public aspects of Twitter and the private aspects of Facebook .
Advertisement
Buzz is ( or will soon be ) available as a new sidebar link in Gmail , but it also integrates with your Gmail inbox .
If you 're worried about email overload , here 's the skinny — Buzz items end up in your inbox in three ways :
Someone comments on your stuff
You comment on something and other people continue the conversation .
Someone @'s you , Twitter style .
Buzz also suggests a Recommended Buzz , pulling content from users you are n't following using an algorithm based on what your friends like or are following .
The idea is that they 'll bring you the " good buzz " even if you 're not friends with who 's delivering it .
If you do n't agree with the recommended " good buzz " , you can tell Google so and it'll tweak its algorithm , so hopefully it'll more closely match what you like next time .
Advertisement
When your friends post content that 's not all that exciting ( " ate a bagel for breakfast " ) , Buzz will attempt to identify it and automatically " collapse the bad buzz . "
Buzz on Your Mobile Device
Google is also launching three different mobile products that integrate with Buzz .
First , they 've integrated Buzz into the Google.com mobile homepage .
The new homepage has small UI tweaks , but the big change is that the Buzz icon now appears in the upper right corner of the screen .
Click on it and you can post to Buzz , but more importantly , when you click there , Buzz will find your location and turn it into a real place — not just an address , but an actual , meaningful place .
( When demoing , Buzz asked the user " Are you at Google ? " )
In normal use , it 'll try placing you at wherever it thinks you are , whether it's a business , your home , a restaurant , or wherever .
Advertisement
A mobile Buzz webapp for Android and iPhone ( available at buzz.google.com , screenshotted below ) gives the user mobile - friendly version of Buzz , providing a stream of people you 're following .
You can also grab nearby buzz to see what people around you are saying ( say you 're at a concert and want to hear what people are saying about it ) .
Advertisement
Finally , Google Mobile Maps has added a new Buzz layer , which allows you to post to Buzz quickly from Google Maps .
( We 're doubting this will work on the iPhone soon because it would require Apple to update Google Maps , which it normally only does on OS updates , but it will likely be pushed out to other devices soon . )
Like the webapp , you can post from the Maps app , it 'll grab your location and snap you to a real place rather than just an address .
Google says they want Buzz to be the poster child for what it means to make a social tool that plays nice — one that has an open API , that respects the user 's privacy decisions , and that does n't lock up your data .
( As opposed to some other popular social networks . )

Google Buzz in the Business
Last , Google explained that they 'll eventually be adding Buzz to Google Apps accounts so businesses can use them internally , something that Google thinks will be a very important use in time .
Advertisement
Google Buzz will begin rolling out at 11 am PST , and will continue slowly rolling out to users over the course of the next couple of days .

A professor at Indiana University has instituted a system of gaining experience points through classwork instead of receiving traditional grades .
Lee Sheldon is an accomplished screenwriter and game writer , having worked on TV shows like ST : TNG and Charlie ’s Angels as well as the Agatha Christie series of games from The Adventure Company .
He now teaches game design courses for Indiana University ’s Department of Telecommunications .
Instead of assigning his students a grade at the end of the course , he instead starts every student at 0 xp and they earn points through completing quests like solo projects and quizzes in addition to grouping up for guild projects and pick up groups .
How many points they have at the end of the course determines their actual “ grade . ”
Sheldon put the system in place so that his students were motivated by the game theory with which they were familiar .
“ The elements of the class are couched in terms they understand , terms that are associated with fun rather than education , ” Sheldon said .
Escapist Magazine : Professor Abandons Grades for Experience Points
I could see this being a little more granular as well – awarding points in specific areas .
At the end of the course , students could really assess where their strengths are .
Over the course of a larger program of study ( 2 - 6 years or whatever ) , “ experience points ” in certain areas would really start to stack up .
Having a bigger assessment of strengths would be more useful than a GPA or a list of pass / fails .
My alma mater Evergreen State College works something like this .
You take only one class at a time .
Each class is worth 16 credits , and the credits are usually spread across a few different areas .
For example , I took a class called “ Science of Mind ” which awarded credits in cognitive psychology , neuroscience , philosophy , and statistics .
If you do n’t meet the objectives for one area of study , say statistics , you might lose credit for that subject , ending up with only 14 credits that quarter .
There are no grades , so your GPA does n’t suffer , but you wo n’t have as many statistics credits .
However , having a more defined set of areas that one could accumulate points over time through different classes and projects ( “ written communications , ” “ leadership , ” “ technical problem solving , ” “ mechanical aptitude , ” etc. etc. ) seems like it would be very useful for both the students themselves and for potential employers or graduate program committees or whoever else might need to evaluate a students strengths .
As I was making corned beef hash the other day , I wistfully realized that I would have to drive over 12 miles outside the city , toward the coast , to the city of Pacifica if I wanted fresh - out - of - the - oven hot pan de sal to go with my corned beef .
I suddenly missed home .
Pan de sal is the classic Filipino bread .
It is actually not Spanish in origin , but Portuguese .
Pan de sal means salted bread but it is actually sweeter than it is salty .
It is traditionally served as a breakfast roll — buttered and dipped in coffee — but it has made its way to the dinner table .
Savory pan de sal sandwiches always hit the spot : corned beef , fried spam , fried egg , fried tocino , or mini-pizza with sweet spaghetti sauce .
Or it can be a sweet treat : butter with sugar , sweetened condensed milk , peanut butter with jelly , strawberry jam , mango jam , coconut jam , ube jam , or homemade ice cream sandwiches .
Buttered pan de sal also goes well with a hot bowl of champorado .
The possibilities are endless .
A key thing to remember when making pan de sal is patience .
Be patient , let the bread rise , and you will be rewarded with light and fluffy rolls .
Pan de Sal Recipe
Recipe adapted from Kulinarya : a Guidebook to Philippine Cuisine , makes 30 to 40 rolls
Activating the yeast
1 package active or instant yeast , about 2 - 1/ 4 teaspoon
1/4 cup warm water
1 teaspoon sugar
Dissolve yeast in warm water with a temperature anywhere between 100 and 110 degrees F .
To proof yeast , add sugar and let stand for 10 minutes .
If the mixture doubles in volume then yeast is active .
It is very important to make sure that yeast is active .
Water that is too hot kills the yeast so make sure that the water temperature is around 100 to 110 degrees F .
Making the dough
5 - 1/2 cups ( 750 grams ) bread flour , more for dusting
1/2 cup ( 100 grams ) sugar
1 - 1/2 cups warm water
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup ( 90 grams ) shortening
canola oil for greasing a large bowl
1 cup breadcrumbs
Combine flour , sugar , warm water , salt , and shortening in a large bowl and mix until well combined .
Add yeast .
If the mixture is too wet , add more flour and mix until well combined .
On a clean surface dusted with flour , knead the mixture into a smooth elastic dough , for about 10 minutes .
To test the dough if it ’s ready , pinch a piece and stretch it into a square .
The dough is ready if it ’s elastic enough to be stretched into a translucent sheet of dough .
If it tears continue kneading .
The dough can be kneaded by hand or in a mixer fitted with a dough hook .
Grease a large bowl with canola oil .
Place the dough in the bowl , cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise to about twice its size .
Punch the dough , knead again to redistribute the yeast , and divide the dough into two pieces .
Roll each piece of dough into a rectangular sheet and then roll the sheet into a log , about 20 inches long and 2 inches in diameter .
Let the dough rest for an hour .
Using a dough cutter or a flat knife , cut the log into 1 - inch thick pieces .
Roll each piece in breadcrumbs , place on a baking tray with the cut side up .
Make sure there is enough space , about two inches , between pieces .
Sprinkle dough with more breadcrumbs and let the dough rest for one more hour before baking .
Meanwhile , preheat the oven to 350 degrees F .
Bake the bread for 20 minutes or until the pan de sal becomes lightly toasted .
Pan de sal is best enjoyed straight from the oven but these rolls freeze really well .
Place rolls in a freezer bag and store in the freezer for up to a month .
To reheat them , toss frozen rolls in the microwave or toaster oven .

Kleppa åpner for privat veihjelp
Samferdselsminister Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa ( Sp ) vil ha forslag fra næringslivet om investeringer i bygging av vei og jernbane .
22 . mars 2010
Artikkelen er over ti år gammel
I Norge blir bygging av vei og jernbane hovedsakelig finansiert gjennom offentlige bevilgninger og bompenger , men Kleppa er åpen for å diskutere såkalt offentlig privat samarbeid ( OPS ) .
- Jeg er interessert i en bredere drøfting av finansiering av samferdselsprosjekter enn det jeg selv har deltatt i til nå .
Jeg ser at her er det et bredt engasjement over hele landet for å sikre flere prosjekter , og jeg vil ha drøftet om vi også kan prøve ut andre modeller for finansiering , sier hun til Aftenposten .
Bare tre veistrekninger i Norge er bygget etter OPS - modellen .
Det er E39 Klett - Bårdshaug , E39 Lyngdal - Flekkefjord og E18 Grimstad - Kristiansand .
I utlandet er slik finansiering langt mer vanlig .
- Det blir viktig i denne debatten å ytterligere evaluere de tre prosjektene som er gjennomført , sier Kleppa .

The European Commission is putting pressure on the British government to drop the exemptions from equality legislation by religious organisations who currently have the right to refuse to employ LGBT ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgendered ) staff .
The opt out allows churches and other organisations to refuse to employ gay people in order “ to avoid conflicting with the strongly held religious convictions of a significant number of the religion ’s followers ” .
Although there have been successful cases at employment tribunals questioning the implementation and interpretation of the opt-out
The Observer reports that the Commission wrote to the British government to warn that it has not fully implemented EU directives that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexuality .
The National Secular Society had complained to the commision saying that the current exemptions “ illegal discrimination against homosexuals ” .
The Commission reportedly agreed with the complaint saying “ exceptions to the principle of non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation for religious employers are broader than that permitted by the directive ” .
EU equal opportunities commissioner , Vladimir Špidla , told the Observer : “ We call on the UK government to make the necessary changes to its anti-discrimination legislation as soon as possible so as to fully comply with the EU rules . ”
The ruling means the government will be be forced to place new clauses into the Equality Bill which is currently making its way through parliament .
But it will still allow churches to refuse to employ a gay man as priest for example .
“ This ruling is a significant victory for gay equality and a serious setback for religious employers who have been granted exemptions from anti-discrimination law , ” gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell told the Observer .
“ It is a big embarrassment for the British government , which has consistently sought to appease religious homophobes by granting them opt-outs from key equality laws .
The European Commission has ruled these opt-outs are excessive . ”
Christian charity Care told the Observer : “ If evangelical churches cannot be sure that they can employ practising evangelicals with respect to sexual ethics , how will they be able to continue ? ”

This report discusses two aspects of economic mobility in the United States .
The first is the question of intergenerational mobility , or the degree to which the economic success of children is independent of the economic status of their parents .
A higher level of intergenerational mobility is often interpreted as a sign of greater fairness , or equality of opportunity , in a society .
The second aspect is the short - term question of the amount by which family incomes change from year to year .
By studying short - term mobility we can determine whether incomes are rising or falling for families at different points in the income distribution .
We can also determine whether the size of these income variations , or the level of annual income volatility , is changing over time .
Increased volatility is undesirable to the extent that it represents an increase in economic insecurity .
The key findings relating to intergenerational mobility include the following :
Children from low - income families have only a 1 percent chance of reaching the top 5 percent of the income distribution , versus children of the rich who have about a 22 percent chance .
Children born to the middle quintile of parental family income ( $ 42,000 to $ 54,300 ) had about the same chance of ending up in a lower quintile than their parents ( 39.5 percent ) as they did of moving to a higher quintile ( 36.5 percent ) .
Their chances of attaining the top five percentiles of the income distribution were just 1.8 percent .
Education , race , health and state of residence are four key channels by which economic status is transmitted from parent to child .
African American children who are born in the bottom quartile are nearly twice as likely to remain there as adults than are white children whose parents had identical incomes , and are four times less likely to attain the top quartile .
The difference in mobility for blacks and whites persists even after controlling for a host of parental background factors , children ’s education and health , as well as whether the household was female - headed or receiving public assistance .
After controlling for a host of parental background variables , upward mobility varied by region of origin , and is highest ( in percentage terms ) for those who grew up in the South Atlantic and East South Central regions , and lowest for those raised in the West South Central and Mountain regions .
By international standards , the United States has an unusually low level of intergenerational mobility : our parents ’ income is highly predictive of our incomes as adults .
Intergenerational mobility in the United States is lower than in France , Germany , Sweden , Canada , Finland , Norway and Denmark .
Among high - income countries for which comparable estimates are available , only the United Kingdom had a lower rate of mobility than the United States .
Key findings relating to short - run , year - to - year income movements include the following :
The overall volatility of household income increased significantly between 1990 - 91 and 1997 - 98 and again in 2003 - 04 .
Since 1990 - 91 , there has been an increase in the share of households who experienced significant downward short - term mobility .
The share that saw their incomes decline by $ 20,000 or more ( in real terms ) rose from 13.0 percent in 1990 - 91 to 14.8 percent in 1997 - 98 to 16.6 percent in 2003 - 04 .
The middle class is experiencing more insecurity of income , while the top decile is experiencing less .
From 1997 - 98 to 2003 - 04 , the increase in downward short - term mobility was driven by the experiences of middle - class households ( those earning between $ 34,510 and $ 89,300 in 2004 dollars ) .
Households in the top quintile saw no increase in downward short - term mobility , and households in the top decile ( $ 122,880 and up ) saw a reduction in the frequency of large negative income shocks .
For the middle class , an increase in income volatility has led to an increase in the frequency of large negative income shocks , which may be expected to translate to an increase in financial distress .
The median household was no more upwardly mobile in 2003 - 04 , a year when GDP grew strongly , than it was it was during the recession of 1990 - 91 .
Upward short - term mobility for those in the bottom quintile has improved since 1990 - 91 , with no significant offsetting increase in downward short - term mobility .
Households whose adult members all worked more than 40 hours per week for two years in a row were more upwardly mobile in 1990 - 91 and 1997 - 98 than households who worked fewer hours .
Yet this was not true in 2003 - 04 , suggesting that people who work long hours on a consistent basis no longer appear to be able to generate much upward mobility for their families .
If you 're thinking of buying second - hand computer equipment off eBay , you 'd better make sure it does n't have " Intel inside " because – and this is official – Intel regards re-selling its equipment as voiding any warranty .
The example we have is an 80 GB solid state disk drive , brand new in July last year .
A customer bought it from Scan , and then re-sold it in November complete with all warranty and receipt documents .
In February the drive failed , and when the new owner asked Scan for a replacement , they were refused on the grounds that a refund could only be claimed if the device was sent back by " the original purchaser " .
So our broken - hearted broken disk owner contacted Intel directly .
He wrote :
Rather than ship the item from London to Scotland , where the original purchaser lives , then [ have him ] ship it to Scan in England who will no doubt ship it to you … and the the whole process gets reversed ( not withstanding the extra unnecessary shipping costs why would the guy in Scotland be bothered doing this ? )
I had a thought that perhaps I could try and save the planet a barrel of oil and short circuit the whole process by returning the drive directly to yourselves .
I am happy to provide you copies of the original invoice and the E - Mail address of who I purchased it from to verify it 's legitimate .
Short and sweet came the reply from Intel :
Thank you for contacting Intel® Customer Support .
Intel® provides warranty support only to the original owner of the product as per our terms and conditions .
Ah , and where are these terms and conditions , then ?
We spent a morning searching for them so as to provide a link , and had to give up .
Two questions need answering : first , how on earth can reselling a Flash memory chip affect its warranty ?
Second , why are these ts and cs so well hidden ?
If we get an articulate response from Intel on either question , we 'll be sure to pass it on . ®

The editorial in the Watsonville Register - Pajaronian offered local voters some blunt advice : “ Shield your eyes , ” it said , “ because the City Council is preparing to spit in your face . ”
That was this month , as the council inched toward finally fluoridating the city ’s water -- a state - mandated action that has been bitterly debated since city residents narrowly voted to block it in 2002 .
At a council meeting in January , an anti-fluoridation activist held up a sign alluding to Nazis .
When speakers threatened to boycott local businesses if fluoridation goes through , a council member told them to jump off the parking - garage roof .
Although the argument in the Santa Cruz County agricultural town of 50,000 has raged for years , people on both sides see a resolution as urgent .
Health officials say that Watsonville , with a large population of migrant workers , is in the throes of a dental - decay epidemic .
One study of local students found an average of two dental abscesses in every classroom , not to mention an outsize number of cavities .
Still , one of the biggest employers in town -- the Martinelli beverage company , famous for its sparkling apple cider -- said it would rather move a planned expansion elsewhere than use fluoridated water in a new line of juices .
“ We believe fluoride is bad for your body so , morally and ethically , we simply cannot put that water in our products , ” said John Martinelli , president of S. Martinelli & Co. , his family ’s business for 142 years .
“ If half the people in this town do n’t want to be mass - medicated , then we should n’t be . ”
Although water supplies across the U.S. have been fluoridated for decades and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called the process “ one of the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th Century , ” California has been late to embrace it .
Opponents link it to bone cancer , thyroid problems , kidney malfunction , fetal damage and a host of other conditions .
Their critics , including most mainstream medical and dental organizations , accuse them of distorting scientific studies .
Suspicion of fluoridation comes from the right and the left .
Some see it as a dangerous erosion of liberty .
Others believe it ’s an underhanded way for businesses to get rid of industrial waste .
In Watsonville , the issue is also economic .
Fields surrounding Watsonville are planted with strawberries , raspberries and a variety of vegetables .
But unemployment in the city is estimated at 25 % , in part because of the slow agricultural season .
Martinelli ’s nonalcoholic sparkling cider was concocted during Prohibition and has been a reliable stand - in for champagne ever since .
The company ’s cider and apple juice use no water except that in the fruit the company buys by the ton from area orchards .
But this summer , the company plans to roll out juices -- acai , pomegranate , blueberry and others -- made from concentrate and water .
And if that water is fluoridated , Martinelli said , customers will balk .
“ What we ’re talking about is our growth opportunity , ” said Martinelli , who says the expansion could add dozens of workers to his 200 - person staff .
“ Watsonville wo n’t benefit from the growth of our business if I have to take it somewhere else . ”
Despite facing a $ 5 million deficit , city officials said they might help Martinelli pay for the high - tech equipment required to remove fluoride from water .
“ We want to make sure he feels welcome to stay in Watsonville , ” said Councilman Manuel Bersamin , a fluoridation supporter .
“ He heads a company that placed Watsonville on the map . ”
Meanwhile , say local healthcare professionals , the problem is only getting worse .
Michelle Simon , a pediatrician whose joint practice treats 6,000 Watsonville children , said she “ has never seen such bad teeth outside Nicaragua . ”
Dentists swap stories of families who are unable to afford toothpaste and brush only with water .
Salud Para La Gente , a Watsonville clinic , has retrofitted old trailers to offer dental care at local schools .
“ It ’s an epidemic , ” said Dr. Hugo Ferlito , the clinic ’s associate dental director .
“ We ’re there in the trenches , and we ’re asking government to stand with us and help us out . ”
In 2002 , residents upset with a city decision to fluoridate thwarted it with an initiative that passed by 2 % .
Subsequently , courts ruled that the initiative violated a 1995 state requirement that larger jurisdictions add fluoride to their water if outside money is available .
In Watsonville ’s case , the CDA Foundation , an arm of the California Dental Assn. , is willing to donate more than $ 1.5 million .
Jon Roth , the foundation ’s executive director , said a statewide task force looking at Watsonville found “ a significant amount of dental disease and a lack of infrastructure to care for underserved residents . ”
Whether the foundation ’s money will be enough is unclear , as are questions of who would be liable if the city were sued over claims that its water poisoned consumers .
At its contentious meeting last month , a divided council formed a committee to negotiate with the foundation -- a move that some council members saw as a betrayal of democracy .
“ The voters have been ignored , ” said Greg Caput , a painting contractor completing his first council term and running for Santa Cruz County supervisor .
“ We should fight all the way to the end .
People will have to drink fluoridated water , wash with it , cook with it , water their plants with it and wash their clothes in it .
It ’s literally being forced down their throat . ”

A Problem with ‘ Standard Candles ’ ?
Type Ia supernovae have become important ‘ standard candles ’ in judging cosmic distances , telling us how far away the host galaxy of a given supernova is .
The idea here is that this kind of supernova produces a consistent luminosity because the white dwarfs that explode in the process are of uniform mass .
The Type Ia supernova happens like this : A white dwarf gathers material from a companion star , growing in pressure and density so that the dwarf approaches the Chandrasekhar limit , beyond which it cannot support its own weight .
The result is a violent explosion that , like Cepheid variable stars , offers astronomers a way to gauge distances , and thereby to probe the shape of the cosmos at various distances and eras .
Just how fast is the universe expanding , and in what ways ?
It was in 1998 , prompted by supernovae of this kind , that the High-z Supernova Search Team discovered that the universe was not only expanding , but that its expansion was accelerating .
Suddenly we were talking about ‘ dark energy , ’ which evidently operated against the gravitational force and seemed to offer a cosmic future in which the universe expanded without end .
Image : Cosmologists use Type Ia supernovae , like the one visible in the lower left corner of this galaxy , to explore the past and future expansion of the universe and the nature of dark energy .
Credit : High - Z Supernova Search Team , HST , NASA .
It ’s significant , given the importance of Type Ia supernovae in this analysis , that we ’re now talking about exceptions to the Chandrasekhar limit , which is a critical mass of about 1.4 times that of the Sun .
Four supernovae since 2003 have been discovered whose white dwarfs evidently surpassed the limit , the events being dubbed ‘ super - Chandrasekhar ’ supernovae .
Richard Scalzo ( Yale University ) and a team of American and French physicists have measured the mass of one of the white dwarfs involved in the supernova SN 2007if , finding that it did indeed exceed the Chandrasekhar limit .
Now work intensifies on modeling its structure .
Measuring the mass of the central star along with a shell of material ejected in the explosion and a surrounding envelope of pre-existing material , Scalzo and crew determined that the star had a mass of 2.1 times that of the Sun , significantly above the limit .
So what ’s going on here ?
In the paper on this work , Scalzo speculates that SN 2007if is the result of the merger of two white dwarfs , but other possibilities are also discussed in a paragraph that seems quite significant for our studies of dark energy :
The single - degenerate scenario… ensures that the white dwarf slowly approaches M Ch [ the Chandrasekhar mass limit ] via accretion from a non-degenerate companion .
In contrast , the double - degenerate scenario… , in which two white dwarfs in a binary system merge and explode , provides a way for SN Ia progenitors to exceed M Ch and to give rise to more luminous events …
There may therefore be a population of SNe
Ia with a distribution of masses greater than M Ch , with different explosion physics that interferes with luminosity standardization [ italics mine ] .
And here is the nub of the problem :
The relative rate of such events among SNe Ia in general may also depend on redshift , and unless they can be identified or their luminosities accurately calibrated , they need not be common to produce significant biases in reconstructions of the dark energy equation of state .
Let me quote Scalzo as well from this Yale University news release on the same point :
“ Supernovae are being used to make statements about the fate of the universe and our theory of gravity .
If our understanding of supernovae changes , it could significantly impact our theories and predictions . ”
And that ’s why a paper studying a rare type of star that seems to ignore the Chandrasekhar limit swims into focus as we discuss a much broader issue .
We ’ve been speculating about the nature of dark energy for some time in these pages , even wondering if it might offer a clue to a far - future propulsion system by harnessing a force that appeared to operate against gravity .
Now we find evidence that at least in some rare instances , the standard candles used in this work may be suspect .
We need to find out how such supernovae can exist above the Chandrasekhar limit and learn whether they exist in sufficient numbers to compromise our measurements of the universe ’s expansion .
The paper is Scalzo et al. , “ Nearby Supernova Factory Observations of SN 2007if : First Total Mass Measurement of a Super - Chandrasekhar - Mass Progenitor , ” to be published in the Astrophysical Journal ( preprint available ) .

" If voting changed anything , they 'd make it illegal , " declared Emma Goldman in a ringing indictment of the feeble mechanism by which the state claims to be restrained and directed .
Of course , in invoking this quote anarchists argue against counting upon elections to change the status quo .
We are n't going to bring about the voluntary society by listening to politicians , casting votes for them , and pressuring them to abolish their own offices .
The statist means and the anarchist ends are clearly opposed .
But there 's another argument against voting : that by casting a ballot , one registers endorsement of the state and its violence .
Advocates of this argument do not hold that you must have chosen the politician who wields power .
They disregard personal intent , interests , and any issues at hand .
The argument is quite simple : by participating in the election , one is bound to its results .
Given the anarchist view of those results - violence , fraud , and lies - one can only conclude that voting makes one an accessory to the crime .
This constitutes a body blow for those who define themselves by their rejection of the authoritarianism so intrinsic in the state .
It 's one thing for voting to be a silly ritual .
But a decidedly different attitude must be adopted if pulling the voting lever leaves one with blood - stained hands .
Faced with such an awful proposition , the task becomes one of avoiding complicity with the system .
An absolute break with the state is the only path of conscience .
In theory , this break seems reasonable to achieve : one simply ceases to cooperate with its agents and directives .
But the state reaches far into the world we live in .
It does n't just direct the police , military , teachers , judges , and other bureaucrats who intervene overtly .
The very civil society we seek to unleash through the spirit of voluntarism , mutual aid , freedom , and solidarity seems hopelessly bound up in the state .
Anarchism is not absolution
The biggest statist distortion lies in the minds of people - the very people so foundational to our dream of a voluntary society .
They are conditioned to behave in ways congruent with governance , to think of themselves in terms that reinforce the primacy of governance , and therefore too often to mistake their largely voluntary lives as a gift from authority .
Allegiance to the state and allegiance to one 's country , locality , and neighbors are seen as not merely connected but rather the same idea .
It is the behavior of these people that provides the underlying legitimacy to the state .
After all , were it not for the people , there could be no power to rule .
It is the people who elect the politicians , pay the taxes , enforce the laws , fight the wars , and more .
As Étienne de la Boétie argued centuries ago in the Discourse on Voluntary Servitude , inciting the masses to organized resistance is totally unnecessary .
Rather , all that is required is for the people to stop obeying .
So to address the problem of the state , we must address the people 's obedience .
Sociologically , psychologically , spiritually - why do they obey ?
This leads one to wonder whether mere withdrawal of consent is even sufficient .
Symbolic micro-secession by an individual does little to address the behaviors inherent in statist society .
Where does the state end and civil society begin ?
For that matter , what 's so fundamental about the individual that its removal from the equation affects the problem of authoritarian society ?
How does one isolate oneself from the crimes and violence of the state when its institutions pervade our society - especially when it is in that very society the seeds of voluntary association must be planted ?
A break is impossible without at least an implicit answer to these questions .
This is not to say that personal reflection and a critical review of one 's choices is not necessary .
The example of one 's own life and actions is likely more effective persuasion than the most articulate thesis .
What I object to is a pseudo - christian guilt that demands an absolute purge of statist sin .
To focus on distinguishing oneself from statist society can only detract from the task of engaging with that statist society .
We must resist adopting an anarchist identity so foolishly consistent and exacting that it destroys our connection to the people in whom we hope to realize a free society .
Our goal cannot be simply to free our persons of perceived statist taint .
Anarchism is not some sort of political puritanism .
We are not seeking some form of absolution for the " sin " of being born in a statist society .
To view the state as this intelligent , malignant entity out there influencing people to initiate force and fraud is to invoke the Christian 's concept of perpetual spiritual struggle with a malevolent Satan .
This conception of the state is also an unfounded superstition , since we understand that it is people 's actions that not only reinforce its perceived legitimacy but make it possible in the first place .
The state is an abstraction ; an institution formed out of ancient patterns of behavior .
But it does n't exist as an independent thing , so rejecting it as such can only lead to confusion .
There is no state : there are only people - people enforcing laws , people obeying laws , people paying taxes , people going to schools , people believing that the guy sitting in the oval office is special .
The question is surely not how to isolate oneself from these people , but how to influence them to change their mindset and thereby their behavior .
The only " state " we will ever apprehend is an apparition formed from the inertia of people 's habits of thinking and acting .
From this point of view , one can hardly ascribe to voting the degree of evil anarchists often do .
It 's just another abstraction .
Pulling a lever , writing words on a piece of paper , or pushing buttons on a screen do not in and of themselves do anything .
In fact , even if you accept the significance of an electoral outcome , it 's hard to assign responsibility when the odds of an individual affecting it are so astronomical .
A double standard
So what does the vote mean in real , concrete terms , divorced from the popular myths of state legitimacy ?
It merely influences the way other people will behave .
That behavior will influence the way yet other people will behave , just as we all have an effect on everybody else in small but indeterminate ways .
Some of these people will assign a title to one person instead of the other .
They will treat the one person 's words as " official " , unlike the other's .
They will do what the one person says , but not the other .
Who can fathom the will of government employees and other interested affiliates ?
After all , it is the people materially prosecuting the agenda resulting from the election of a public figure who inflict the real damage .
The President does n't do anything ; only agents of the state arrest , tax , jail , and kill .
The behavior of legions of bureaucrats define the agenda , the interests , the nature of what we lament as " the state " .
We should worry less about whose orders they 're following and worry more about what they 're actually choosing to do .
If this seems like splitting hairs , consider that one of the best anarchist arguments against the state lies in the behavior of its agents .
A robber is a clear menace , and yet we let these state actors confiscate our wealth with hardly a peep .
Nobody would gladly accept the help of a mafia - style protection racket , and yet we allow state racketeers into our neighborhoods constantly simply because they sport a badge .
We look down on those who indiscriminately kill in our society , and yet we fund state bureaucrats with rifles to go out and commit these crimes against humans - so long as they 're " our troops " and not " theirs " .
Our society has internalized a blind spot far more systemic and significant than the election cycle , and the resulting behavior crucially underwrites the state agenda .
Anarchists point out the inconsistency between how we regard normal crime and state crime to illustrate a core value : what people actually do , not their institutional affiliation or authority , is what matters .
Murder is murder , theft is theft , and kidnapping is kidnapping .
Only a double standard prevents people from judging such actions as less objectionable merely because they are performed in an " official " capacity .
The anarchist proposes a radical consistency : people are responsible for their own actions , regardless of their position in some organizational hierarchy , governmental or otherwise .
And yet , many anarchists themselves apply this maddening double standard to those who do nothing more than write words on a piece of paper .
They call them enablers of the state , as if the mere act of casting a ballot makes one responsible for the crimes of the state 's actors .
This ascribes to the state precisely the mythical legitimacy we claim to reject - as if there could exist a magical transfer of permission from one person to another making crime acceptable .
We cannot combat the statist double standard by promulgating its myths ourselves .
Understanding civil society
At the same time , anarchists must acknowledge how integral the political order , including elections , are perceived to be to the majority of the social body .
Because people conflate the state with civil society , they often view its institutions as portals to engagement with their neighbors .
As anarchists , we can either secede from this engagement on puritan grounds , or we can risk the taint of the state by meeting them in the world we jointly occupy , warts and all .
It is a sad fact that the social deliberative functions necessary for true community occur within the trappings of government ; yet to reject interaction because the state is involved divorces us from important opportunities to influence others .
And it is in convincing our brothers and sisters to change their mindset and behavior - not in breathless denunciations of formless institutions - that we genuinely oppose " the state " .
Remember that voting for politicians has about the same direct physical effect as an online survey : it has no power or authority but what people attribute to it .
An election may convince certain individuals to commit ( or abstain from committing ) violations of rights , but since we hold that those individuals are solely responsible for their own actions , and nothing can absolve them of that responsibility , are the results of that election relevant ?
In the end , it is the behavior , not the myths and abstractions , that matter .
So if by voting , you can engage with your neighbors to influence them within this mixed society , or possibly influence state actors to behave more peaceably , why would you insist on abstaining ?
None of this is to say an obligation exists to participate in every election ; only that we should not blow these rituals out of proportion and turn them into boogeymen .
Every situation is unique , and every election is a singular moment in the social body .
Only an individual can decide the right course of action in a given scenario ; indeed , it is highly authoritarian to dictate rules to the individual .
The danger is not in voting or not voting , but in tilting at windmills out of ideological self - importance or moralistic high - handedness .
Blaming voters for state - sponsored crime is only meaningful in the sense that the voters stand by while the crimes are committed - not in the sense that we somehow mystically sanction it through some statist ceremony .
The problem lies not in the ballot , but in our patterns of thinking and behavior that lead us to treat the vote 's outcome as anything more substantive than an internet poll .
We allow state actors to engage in activities we all know are deeply wrong ; it is that habit of complacency towards authority which we must address in ourselves and others .
Voting may be many things , but it is not abject complacency .
In fact , most people see it as a form of civic engagement .
Given that , should we not start from where they are , rather than washing our hands and demanding they make the long and difficult mental transitions we 've already achieved ?
Whether or not we vote , we must engage these enabling attitudes where they are , whether in political parties , city council meetings , the lines at the polls , or at family dinner tables .
To abandon this society because it does n't meet our standards is to surrender the anarchist project totally .
Anarchism as a movement is concerned with this society , like it or not .
Conclusion
If we fear accusations of hypocrisy by participating in institutions tied to the state , perhaps we should take a harder look at our motivations .
What are we in this struggle to accomplish ?
To be seen rejecting the state loudly and publicly ?
To have an impeccably consistent argument that no debater can assail ?
To shield ourselves from any chance of statist entanglement ?
To maintain a black and white moral superiority that makes it easy to judge the world ?
Or does our project transcend the immediate political realities by posing a deeper question about human relationships and individual responsibility ?
Are we comfortable enough with ourselves and our principles to entertain doubt , to risk making mistakes , to remain vulnerable to misunderstanding and grey areas - all for a chance at reaching our brothers and sisters within institutional statism ?
Can the message of mutual liberation be heard if it is not taken into the mire of authoritarian culture in which most people find themselves , on terms they can grasp ?
It has never been enough for anarchists to win debates ; we must win the hearts of our fellow man , wherever they are found .
We do this by engaging with them where they are , not where we'd have them be .
The vote is a meaningless , superstitious ritual that masks deeper social issues and sanctions nothing .
It does not bolster our argument to agree with statists that elections matter .
Instead , we should treat them as what they are : the trivial rites of a false religion .

Tonight , there will likely not be a dry eye in the house , as America says goodbye to Jay Leno .
Again .
This time for three whole weeks .
After The Jay Leno
Show ends tonight , Jay will head back to the Tonight show beginning March 1 .
And what can you do in the meantime , while Tonight is on hiatus for the Olympics ?
Well , you can always watch some online reruns of the Tonight show with Conan O’Brien .
Oh , wait — you can ’t .
Because NBC has silently scrubbed all episodes of Conan ’s Tonight show from NBC.com and Hulu .
Now , NBC has no moral or historical obligation to rerun shows online that it no longer airs .
But , as a rule , that ’s what it generally does .
You can watch Knight Rider on Hulu , and Kings , and Crusoe .
That ’s kind of what Hulu , part owned by NBC Universal , is for : monetizing , even if just a tiny bit , archival as well as current shows .
Is there a contractual or business reason the network pulled the reruns ?
Does it believe they somehow undermine its relaunch of Jay ?
Would it be helping to promote an entertainer they expect to be competing with them before too long ?
Or is this another personal swipe out of pique ?
I do n’t know .
NBC answered my inquiries about yanking the Conan reruns with an official “ No comment . ”
There may well be a good reason that it would cost NBC to leave the shows up , in which case I would n’t expect them to do other than they have done .
But if they have a good reason , I ca n’t see why they would n’t just give it .
In the meantime , you can still see Conan talk to James Lipton about Leno in an old episode of Inside the Actors ’ Studio , above .
And enjoy those classic episodes of Surface !
I think for a lot of people there 's also appeal in playing the " lone wolf . "
I grouped with other people a few times out of necessity , to take care of some difficult quests .
I 'd rarely talk to them and I left without a backward glance as soon as my objectives were completed , which can make one feel appealingly mercenary .
That 's the best explanation I can come up with , even if it 's incredibly pathetic .
So to summarize briefly , people who play MMOGs without socializing are a lot like goths in real life ; angry loners who want to be angry loners where everyone can see .
" You always say that you never do online gaming and yet you 've played / play TF2 ... would n't it only be far to at least check out other game 's online play ? "
- RottingAwesome
I 'll let you in on a little secret .
See , I love Team Fortress 2 .
When it came out it was probably the best - designed online shooter out there , and not just in gameplay , in every aspect of sound and visuals .
I follow the TF2 blog and keep abreast of every new update and achievement list they bring out .
I love the different personalities of the classes and am still hoping they 'll bring out the last two Meet the Team videos at some point .
But here comes the shameful secret part : I have n't actually played Team Fortress 2 since they brought out the first class - specific update , just under two years ago .
The first class update was the Medic , you may recall , which I thought would be great , because Medic was my favorite class to play .
But the first time I logged on after the update , half of every team were Medics trying to unlock all the new weapons .
And I could n't play as Medic then because I did n't want to seem like some conformist , even though I 'd been Medic before it was cool .
So I gave it time , waiting for things to level out again .
But then came the Pyro update , and all the other updates , each one dishing out more and more funny weapons and maps I 'd need time to familiarize myself with , and now there 's so much extra shit going on since the last time I played that , frankly , I 'm afraid to venture back in lest I be immediately flattened by twenty guys who 've all spent the last two years mastering the double - piped bong rifle or whatever .
Please do n't waste the internet 's precious pixels by trying to convince me to get back into it .
I definitely do n't have the time these days , and besides , I 'm really not sure I approve of what Valve is doing with all these updates - it 's endless tinkering with something that already worked perfectly fine .
And all the changeable hats business is affecting that sterling visual design I liked so much .
There was a painter in the 19th century called Richard Dadd , who famously went insane , murdered his father and spent the rest of his life in an asylum .
There he created his most famous painting , " The Fairy Feller 's Master - Stroke , " which he worked on for nine years .
It 's absolutely covered in minute obsessive detail , and bits of it were re-done so many times that the layers of paint extrude unevenly from the canvas .
And he still considered it an unfinished work .
So the point I 'm getting at is that Valve 's work with Team Fortress 2 reminds me of a patricidal Victorian fuckhead .
Yahtzee is a British - born , currently Australian - based writer and gamer with a sweet hat and a chip on his shoulder .

Launching the Tories ' energy policy in July 2006 , David Cameron , gave a convincing and well - reasoned argument explaining why nuclear power must be a " last resort " .
Later that year he described Labour 's enthusiasm for nuclear power as " irresponsible " .
As Cameron rightly pointed out : " The problems of nuclear waste have n't been dealt with .
They have got to be dealt with in order to make any new investment possible . "
Four years on , we 're no closer to finding out how to deal with highly toxic nuclear waste and the Tory leader 's point stands as strong as ever .
But unfortunately , the Tories no longer seem to care .
Indeed , the Tories ' new green paper on energy security shows remarkable dexterity in rewriting history , now criticising the Labour government for dragging its feet before finally coming round to support new nuclear .
This political journey neatly epitomises the Conservative 's new energy policy : confused , incoherent and lacking in credibility .
Nuclear power has always required huge amounts of public money and David Cameron 's signal that the Tories are ready to turn on the taps of taxpayer support risks billions which we simply can't afford .
Both Labour and the Tories claim that they will not provide any public subsidy , but both know that this cannot be true when the nuclear industry that has never been able to survive without it .
Like the banks , new nuclear is too big to fail .
And like the banks , new nuclear depends on a more or less explicit taxpayer guarantee .
Once a nuclear power station is running we will have it for the next 40 years , come what may .
No responsible government could ever let a nuclear power generator go bankrupt .
This has happened before , when the taxpayer had to bail out British Energy £ 10bn and accept £ 73bn of their liabilities .
As my colleague Vince Cable has said , nuclear power is the Royal Bank of Scotland of the energy industry .
There has been a lot of talk of energy security .
It is the case that a lot of our generating capacity will come offline in the near , future leaving us with the possibility of an energy gap .
If nothing is done now we will start to see an energy gap emerge around 2016 .
It is something that politicians from all sides must take seriously .
It is also another reason why we can not rely on nuclear power .
One nuclear reactor takes seven years to build .
The designs for the reactors that have been proposed by the energy companies have yet to be approved , and the health and safety executive has said already that they will require a major redesign .
Realistically we are at least a decade away from new nuclear power in the UK .
The only way we can guarantee a clean , safe and secure energy supply is to invest now in renewable energy which can come online today .
Cameron will say that he wants this too , but this is where the Tory energy policy falls down .
Nuclear power – large , immovable and expensive is the antithesis of a free and fair energy market based on renewables .
Building a new generation of nuclear power could dry up all investment in other sources of energy .
Nuclear power costs an incredible amount of money .
The government estimates that a new reactor will cost £ 3 bn but the latest bids from the companies to build the same reactors in other countries are around twice that .
A programme of 10 reactors , as proposed by the government , ( and Cameron has said he wants no limit on the number ) , will cost at least £ 60 bn in upfront costs .
This is capital that could be used to invest in renewables .
Of course , the economics of nuclear are only part of the problem .
There are also many large and intractable problems associated with nuclear waste .
The nuclear waste which will be produced by the new generation of reactors will be hotter and more radioactive than the last generation .
It will need to be stored onsite for 160 years and will remain radioactive for the next 30,000 .
After 40 years of civil nuclear power in this country we still have no safe means of disposing of it .
It is an environmental disaster .
The potential for nuclear power to divert resources from renewables , and the dangerous legacy of highly radioactive toxic waste , mean that serious environmentalists cannot support a large programme of nuclear power , and indeed none of the large environmental campaign groups do .
The Conservative party , which just a few years ago became briefly a new champion of environmental causes when they needed to improve their image , now drops serious green causes like a hot stone in the run-up to the election .
This is an alarming sign of what Conservative change now means .
For a real change , a change that works for a fair and green Britain , and sound economics , there is the Liberal Democrats .
• Simon Hughes is the Liberal Democrats ' shadow secretary of state for energy and climate change .
Oracle 's top brass might have committed to merging its Java technology with that of Sun Microsystems but the specifics are still being worked out .
The plan on how to merge Oracle 's JRockit Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) and Sun 's HotSpot JVM is " still evolving " , Oracle principal engineer Mark Reinhold has said .
Leads from two JVM 's engineering teams are " spending lots of quality time together " Reinhold told an Oracle Technology Network webcast audience , but he admitted " it 's not an easy problem taking the best of each [ JVM ] and figuring out the long - term convergence . "
Reinhold , formerly of Sun , speculated that integration of the two to produce a single JVM probably would n't happen soon but might finally take place in the next year - and - a - half to two years .
The goal to integrate of JRockit and HotSpot was announced by Oracle as part of its strategy day in January , where managers laid our the plan for Sun 's middleware and operating systems in the wake of Oracle 's successful closure of its $ 5.6 bn acquisition of Sun .
Oracle did not provide a timeframe for the JVMs ' merger .
By planning to merge the two , Oracle 's management has set engineers from Oracle and the former Sun the Darwinian task of picking the best features and dumping the rest .
What 's unclear is whether that means keeping most of one application server and building in the best from the loser or building a new application server that combines both .
Reinhold noted Oracle is renowned for being willing to set aside its own technologies should it come across something better .
It kept the former BEA 's JRockit at the expense of its own Java application server , after all .
" It 's pretty clear , Oracle both engineering - wise and management - wise is committed to figuring out what the best is , " he said .
Speaking personally , Reinhold said one option might be for a merged VM with the JRockit garbage collector and surfacabilty along with the HotSpot runtime compiler .
Reinhold reckoned JRockit has enviable mission control - management - systems , while there was room for improvement on the server compiler , which HotSpot could provide .

When you start working as an escort you quickly realize each client is different .
In every girl ’s life there will be a lot of men , each one with their own desires , but all of them looking for the same thing .
Learning the main types of clients and what they want is going to help you become a better escort , so here is a list of the most common types of men who come looking for a once in a lifetime experience from a gorgeous woman .
The powerful one
One of the most common types of men who visit Cheap London escorts is the powerful man , the one who has reached the top of the social ladder .
He is confident , wealthy and is used to manage people all day long .
Most of the times , this type of client is looking for a change – something out of the box for him .
In some cases , it is all about being dominated by the woman , either by requesting expensive gifts , either by a soft form of BDSM .
The one looking to dominate
Opposed to the former type of client , this man is looking for a woman he can dominate between the sheets .
In this category there are many escort clients , most of them being rather shy in their daily life .
You can expect them to need a drink before they can actually grab the reins and try to push things over the edge to feel powerful .
The rescuer
For some men the most powerful feeling in the world comes from saving a damsel in distress .
One of the place they can turn this fantasy true is by saving a woman from her Escorts London life and turn her into a regular girl who works in a 9 to 5 job .
These men just want to hear from you that you are eager to start a new life , the one they propose and plan for you , so they can feel good about themselves .
Of course , very few escorts are Vivian from Pretty Woman , but you can always play the part for your client ’s pleasure .
The groom ( and his best man )
Men who are getting married the very next day often want to experience stag life one more time , so they book an escort and might come with their best man for a double date .
The cuddle type
Not all men are looking to have sex , some only want to be with someone one night .
They are looking to talk , cuddle and have a nice dinner with London escorts .
This client can be difficult , as they require extra attention and can be very emotional .
These men can be people who recently lost their partner or people who enjoy a wealthy life but lack a connection with a loving partner .
These are only a small part of the many types of clients you will encounter as a professional London escort .
The key to being the best in your job is to adapt to each one ’s needs and give them what they want , regardless if it is a passionate , crazy night of love or a deep , meaningful talk .

I like run of the mill parliamentary systems , where ordinarily no single party can dominate and must find coalition partners through various compromises in order to govern , with no party totally without influence .
I think it 's time for a constitutional convention .
I believe Ron Paul should clearly have a national voice , even though some of his positions force me to see him as warranting quarantine until he is demonstrably rabies - free .
I say , Bring him on !

On behalf of so many of us who fought to get the Constitutional Candidates ( Dr. Paul and Dennis Kucinich ) a fair shot at the same access and coverage as the rest of the corporate - friendly candidates - THANK YOU , BRAD .
Just amazing to re-visit those videos and be reminded of the hoards of people they all ignored , belittled , and DISENFRANCHISED . (**)
This underscores Karen from Illinois ' astute and largely unexplored point re : the recent TEABAG convention in Memphis with only 600 - 1,000 attendees getting round - the - clock play on FOX and CNN , with regular updates from MSNBC and non -stop coverage of Palin 's sloppy , awkward , high school SCA pitch written on her hand splashed all over HuffPo.
REAL Constitutionalists ( formerly Ron Paul / Tea Party Patriots ) are not as involved in the nasty neocon TEABAGGING EXPRESS fighting factions as the Republicans and the lying , corporate media would have you believe .
( A real danger this scary false meme , setting up the false narrative potentially designed to make a manipulated election in their favor more palatable / easier to accept . )
This was evidenced by the " boos " heard from the CPAC Grinchy elders when the results of CPAC Straw Poll was announced .
Five 'll get you ten that the Birch Society / CPAC people did n't see it coming and used hand counted paper ballots .
( ** Ron Paul 's numbers were consistently manipulated throughout the Primaries , and were caught on tape as early as the IOWA STRAW POLL where delegates for ROMNEY and McCAIN were being allowed to vote multiple times , and large swaths of RP delegates were kept from voting at all .
I believe there were also some allegations of " vote flipping " from the ... Sequoias Voting Systems used ?
Mighta been Diebold .
I could be off , going from memory .
But after that , my MUCH SMARTER than the TEABAGGERS Paulites did not need to be schooled on election fraud .
They schooled themselves .
There is a UNIVERSE of difference in the intellect quotients / collective reasoning / reading and comprehension levels / organizational capacity between the original groups seen marching above and this Bastardized Army of Delusional Retirees .
This is rarely addressed or explored or reported .
Thank you again , Brad .**)

First of all , I am a gay man - in a stable relatinoship .
I deeply resent your homophobia in using an anti-gay slur to describe people with whom you disagree .
Do you call blacks " jigaboos " or " jungle bunnies " when you disagree ?
Why not just call us fags and queers and have done with it ?
I think you owe a sincere apology to gays everywhere for this stunning and shocking attack on our sexuality .
The other is to ask you what I missed in terms of court rulings on the constitutionality of torture .
Last I heard no less an authority than Alan Dershowitz wrote that there is no such constitutional ban , so long as the information gained from such actions are presented in court , at which time a judge would have no choice but to rule that informtion unconstitutional ... the information , not the methods used to extract it .
Very important difference .
What have you read in the consitution that the great constitutional scholar from Harvard missed ?
While you are at it perhaps you could indicate what it is that you are calling " torture " , or are you just devaluating the horror of the concept for the sake of minimizing the suffering of those poor souls currently being tortured in regimes around the world ?
You have my personal email but I would greatly appreciate seeing a published response , following a public apology for your intolerance and judgemental condemnation of a vast percentage of the human race .

It was n't an anti-gay slur .
What have you read in the consitution that the great constitutional scholar from Harvard missed ?
For a start , perhaps , Article 6 , which reads in part :
This Constitution , and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ; and all Treaties made , or which shall be made , under the Authority of the United States , shall be the supreme Law of the Land I 'm sure you and Prof.
Dershowitz are well - familiar with the Torture Treaty signed by Ronald Reagan .
There are other aspects of the Constitution and Rule of Law violated by the Bush / Cheney torture regime , but the above should give you enough to chew on for a while .
While you are at it perhaps you could indicate what it is that you are calling " torture " , or are you just devaluating the horror of the concept for the sake of minimizing the suffering of those poor souls currently being tortured in regimes around the world ?
No , I 'm calling things like waterboarding torture , just as this country did when it actually tried Japanese soldiers after WWII for War Crimes that included waterboarding and put some of them to death in the bargain .
Or are you just devaluating the horrors of torture for the sake of minimizing the war crimes carried out by the politicians you voted for and who betrayed and lied to you ?
You have my personal email but I would greatly appreciate seeing a published response , following a public apology for your intolerance and judgemental condemnation of a vast percentage of the human race .
You have my published response , and no , you will not be getting an apology for anything .
Happy tea bagging !

For Charles at # 6 , There is no specific ban on torture contained within the constitution .
However , constitutional authority banning torture is derived from treaties we , as a nation , have signed , thereby giving them the full weight of American law .
We are signatories here :
http://www.hrweb.org/legal/cat.html
http://findarticles.com/...is_n2137_v88/ai_6742034/
The following google search is of the key words " Constitution " and " Treaties " and offers discussions on how treaties affect the law here in America .
( Treaties do NOT trump the constitution , but they DO define legal standing .
http://www.google.com/se...mp;aq=f&aqi=&oq=
As for the use of the phrase TeaBaggers , please research it 's history in this context , as the group that morphed from the Ron Paul patriot movement actually chose that name for themselves .

It must be then that the term " teabaggers " is not an attempt to dehumanize your opponents by using the word ?
I am curious , what is a teabagger to you ?
If you are talking about gentle ladies having high tea in Rittenhouse Square that would be a very different thing .
With apologies to Dan in PA , I do not think that Brad means anything other than a homosexual act in the use of the term .
Nor do I believe that he ( and his Brown Shirt fans who also posted ) have any intent beyond projecting their own hate for gays onto people who simply hold different ideas .
On revisiting this site to see if a response or comment was posted I was shocked to see not only the defense of a homophobic and dehumanizing epithet , and then the restating of that same hate speech in the form of a demeaning attempt at making a joke my sexuality and my feelings of being offended .
I will not be coming back to " explore " this site , what I will be doing is contacting the Stonewall Democrats Club in which I am active and discuss with them where to go from here , without giving you the pleasure of being the object of a mainstream media news story .
You so - called Born Again Christion bigots make me sick with your constant hate speech and that you oppose some idea so much simply means that idea must be dangerous to you .

First of all , Charles - from your first comments :
What does it matter whether you were in a stable relationship or not ?
Does that somehow make you better than homosexual men who are not in a stable relationship ?
Or is it your own bias showing through - that you think people who are in stable relationships somehow have more credibility than those who are n't ?
I think you are bigoted against single people .
Second , the term " teabagging " does NOT apply strictly to a homosexual act .
To think that male homosexuals somehow " own " that term is yet another representation of your own bigotry against straight women .
Third , where did you get the idea that anyone here is a Born - Again Christian ?
I do n't believe any of us regulars have claimed to be such ( I know a few of us have claimed atheism , and I know Brad is n't a B.A.C. )
You are stereotyping Born - Again Christians , though , and showing yet another side of your intolerance .
( Feel free to continue that , though . )
Fourth , PLEASE direct the Stonewall Democrats here .
We could use their assistance in getting the word out on election fraud and other assorted malfeasances committed by BOTH major political parties and the mainstream media .

I 've been told that a modern frag grenade explodes in a cone , so if you 're laying on the ground next to one , no shrapnel would hit you .
I also have a friend whom was hit by a grenade while serving in Iraq .
I asked him what it felt like after he was hit , and he described as feeling hot and painful , and his muscles around the entry point grew stiff .
Luckily , there was no long - term damage .
Funny thing is ... his twin brother , whom had n't incurred any injuries , became an Army recruiter , while he got shipped back to Iraq .
It was 245 years ago today , that The Stamp Act of 1765 , one of the first of the many punitive taxes imposed on the American colonies and precipitated the Revolution , was passed by Parliament .

Act look like a walk in the park .
Just sayin ’
Maxwell Montes , containing the highest point on the surface of Venus .
I know what you 're thinking .
Venus ?
Surface temperature of 490 degrees Celsius with about 92 times the atmospheric pressure of Earth 's surface ?
Does n't sound very hospitable .
The prototype Switched Reluctance Motor ( SRM ) has been operated non-continuously for over 20 hours at Venus - like conditions ( 460 ° C temperature , mostly CO2 gas environment ) and it remains functional .
A drilling system , actuated by two SRMs was tested in Venus - like conditions , 460 ° C temperature and mostly CO2 gas environment , for more than 15 hours .
A mission to the surface of Venus would have high scientific value , but most electronic devices and sensors cannot operate at the 450 °C ambient surface temperature of Venus .
460
Surface temperature : 450 °C
Atmospheric pressure : 92 bars
Surface temperature : 380 ~ 450 °C
Atmospheric pressure : 46 ~ 92 bars
I 've noticed that the numbers given in articles about the temperature and surface pressure of Venus are often quite misleading .
Let me give a few examples before I explain why .
Okay , so what 's the problem here ?
Venus clearly has a surface temperature of about° C and an atmospheric pressure 90 times that of Earth , does it not ?
Well , in most places , yes .
But let 's not forget that this area ( Ishtar Terra ) technically counts as the surface as well : Ishtar Terra is a highland region with a surface area between Australia and the United States , and as you can see on the map has a large relatively flat area about 5000 m above the surface of the planet .
And in the same manner that we see on Earth , the higher up you get on Venus the lower the temperature and pressure .
5000 m above the surface reduces the temperature to 424 °C and the pressure from 92 x that of Earth to 66 x .
At the very highest regions of the planet this falls to 385 °C and 47 x the pressure .
This is naturally still extremely hot and the pressure is still immense , but since every degree counts when carrying out a mission , a surface mission to this part of the planet would be that much easier to carry out .
That 's why when discussing the attributes of a hot planet like Venus I think we should always give the temperature and pressure as a range , not a single number that only shows what conditions are like at " sea level " , because there is no sea there in the first place , and Ishtar Terra is no less the surface of Venus than any other part of the planet .
Therefore , change : to : and we finally have a more realistic picture of what Venus is like at the surface .
This could be applied for other colder planets as well like Mars , but since spacecraft we send to planets have already withstood the extreme cold of space on the way over it 's not really an issue .
With Venus we 're often conceiving surface missions using the assumption that surface temperatures and pressures are going to be around 460 °C and 90 bars when simply landing in a different part of the planet will result in numbers lower than this .
Note that this is n't about questioning the knowledge of the people that wrote the three examples I gave above ( indeed , I'm a big Geoffrey Landis fan ) but rather the fact that always including this one number for surface temperature and pressure is misleading to those that do n't know a great deal about the planet .
The sponsor of New Jersey ’s medical marijuana law is speaking out against the delay tactics of Governor Chris Christie .
As the program sits right now , patients are not only out of luck when it comes to registering , they also have to break the law in order to medicate in the meantime .
The law says that patients with certain conditions can use marijuana for medical purposes .
However , since New Jersey does n’t give the right to patients to ‘ grow your own , ’ the patients continue to suffer .
They are only allowed to purchase medicine from dispensaries , yet no dispensaries exist due to the greed of the New Jersey Legislature .
This is yet another byproduct of an implementation process gone awry .
“ Certainly we can create this window where we allow them to obtain it on their own , ” Assemblyman Reed Gusciora ( D - Mercer ) said .
“ It could help alleviate a lot of suffering . ” I ’m gonna ‘ one up ’ you Mr. Gusciora ; I ’m going to suggest that the State of New Jersey take an approach that would cost NOTHING and would alleviate the suffering of countless New Jersey residents INSTANTLY — give the medical marijuana program participants the right to grow their own medicine .
By granting the patient the right to grow their own medicine , by default , it allows the patient to legally possess the medicine they are already obtaining .
Giving the patient the right to grow their own marijuana has other implementation benefits as well .
Something that I have said since the beginning of the New Jersey program is ‘ how in the f are you going to grow that many plants , for that many patients , at such a small amount of locations ? ’
Think about it , 30,000 patients and as few as six grow sites ?
I have seen gardens for four patients , and they take up an entire 2,000 square foot house .
Do the math on that , and the only facility that is worthy of housing a New Jersey medical marijuana garden is a football stadium .
How is that cost effective ?
And for that matter , how long is that going to take to become a reality ?
If you give the patient the right to grow their own medicine , that garden space will be spread out to thousands of gardens .
The cost of producing and maintaining the gardens would be the patient ’s responsibility , and would result in the medicine being grown faster .
Think about the amount of electricity it would require to grow a football stadium full of plants ?
Is the local power company aware of NJ ’s plan ?
Is that even possible ?
I have seen grow ops that have a few hundred plants , and the electrical setup that it requires would scare Nicola Tesla .
At the rate things are going , not only will the law fail to be implemented by the October deadline ( told you so Marianne Bays ) , but I would have doubts about a 2011 deadline as well .
If anyone does n’t think so , just think about how many things are figured out versus how many things are still up in the air … then think about the amount of problems no one is even considering ( such as electricity , byproduct waste , balanced funding , etc ) and the fact that people are still haggling over the rules .
Government moves like molasses , and this New Jersey blend of syrup is looking thicker by the minute … .

South Dakota Rep .
Don Kopp does n’t believe we descended from apes , but he claims that ’s not why he wrote a resolution to cast doubt on climate change .
His feelings on climate change , he says , have nothing to do with evolution .
Still , the connection is hard to ignore .
Last month , Kopp successfully led efforts to adopt a resolution in his state calling for a “ balanced approach ” to global climatic change in public schools .
As Donald R. Prothero , Occidental College geology professor and lecturer in geobiology at the California Institute of Technology , says , “ It ’s all out of the creationist playbook . ”
The New York Times raised the connection in a March 3 article “ Darwin Foes Add Warming to Targets . ”
But just how much do anti-evolutionists and global warming deniers have in common ?
There is one clear connection : just as there is virtually no debate in the scientific community regarding the validity of evolution , there is also little disagreement among scientists actively studying climate change .
“ The overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that global warming is occurring due to man ’s activities on the planet , ” said Jeffrey Shaman , assistant professor of Atmospheric Science at the College of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences at Oregon State University .
“ The problem is that there are enormous economic and political consequences to accepting this idea . ”
A peer - reviewed study by the University of Illinois at Chicago from January 2009 of US - based scientists showed that of scientists most specialized and knowledgeable with regard to climate change ( those who listed climate science as their area of expertise , and who also have published more than 50 percent of their recent peer - reviewed papers on the subject of climate change ) 96.2 percent answered ‘ risen ’ to the question , “ When compared with pre-1800s levels , do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen , fallen , or remained relatively constant ? ”
Of those same climate scientists , 97.4 % answered ‘ yes ’ to the question , “ Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures ? ”
Despite these figures , some state lawmakers are now part of a misinformation campaign to foster the notion that there is no consensus — just as they have with evolution .
And they ’re using the educational system to get out that message .
Astrology and the Gas of Life
Rep .
Kopp says his primary reason for doubting the role of humans in climate change is because he does n’t think that humans actually have that much impact on the earth .
“ I think we like to think we do , ” he said .
“ I think we tend to think we ’re more important than we are . ”
Though Kopp , a forester by training , presents himself as well - versed in the scientific debate , there are religious roots at the heart of his arguments .
His research as a forester was on fire - dependent plant species , and he claims to have read extensively on the issue .
As a retired forester , he says he has witnessed firsthand the positive agricultural effects of carbon dioxide on atmospheric fertilization .
But he also says evolution disproves the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics ( Entropy in a closed system will tend to increase over time ) , a common creationist misinterpretation since life is not a closed system .
Kopp attends the Open Bible Christian Center , “ an association of autonomous evangelical Pentecostal / Charismatic churches , ” which embrace speaking in tongues and the resurrection in the Apocalypse .
He is married to Joanne , the church ’s executive secretary and community pastor and has written a book , Modern Science and an Ancient Text , about how he came to embrace biblical literalism .
Admitting to climate change would , he claims , lead to a world government takeover and risks bankrupting the United States .
Still , he is clear that he has no intention of returning to this topic in the House , nor will he be bringing up evolution .
“ People are tired of government telling them what to do .
Since I ’m against big government , I do n’t believe government should be telling the schools what they should be teaching .
This was just a resolution . ”
Since his resolution passed , he says , he ’s been overwhelmed by emails from educators around the country accusing him of trying to promote religion .
Indeed , the version of the resolution that passed the Senate and was amended in the House said , “ Evidence relating to global climatic change is complex and subject to varying scientific interpretations , “ and that “ all instruction in the public schools relating to global climatic change be presented in a balanced and objective manner . ”
For anyone who follows the culture war debate of religion and science , the phrase “ presented in a balanced and objective manner ” sounds eerily familiar .
“ Balanced treatment ” was used in the ’80s in the US Supreme Court case Edwards v. Aguillard , in which teaching creation science in Louisiana ’s public schools was ruled unconstitutional .
Teach evolution , Louisiana lawmakers had told educators , but you must then balance it by also teaching “ creation science . ”
Kopp also received criticism for the wording in the original resolution , which passed in the House , which said that a variety of other factors play a role in “ weather phenomena , ” including “ astrology . ”
Although he wrote the first paragraph , Kopp said , the section that mentioned ‘ astrology ’ was added by the House Legislative Research Council , which meant to write ‘ astronomy . ’
“ I will admit it was quite embarrassing to me , ” he said .
“ After the changes came back , I did n’t read the entire bill again . ”
The bill states that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant but a highly beneficial gas , also known as the “ gas of life . ”
Supporters of this language may have forgotten the lesson from health class that excess carbon dioxide in the bloodstream is fatal to humans .
Academic Freedom
Just as not all Christians are fundamentalists ( indeed , most mainstream faiths have no problem with evolutionary theory ) , not all conservative Christians deny climate change .
The Evangelical Call to Action on Climate Change and its lobbying arm Evangelical Climate Initiative seek to address environmental problems from a Christian perspective of charity , social justice , and biblical stewardship .
“ With climate change , it ’s not as directly tied into a literal interpretation of the Bible , it ’s more piggybacked , ” said Prothero , whose book , Greenhouse of the Dinosaurs , presents a narrative account of the science of climate change .
“ Denialism goes very deep ; evolution or climate change , it ’s the same vein .
They view science as a threat . ”
Prothero says .
“ Creationists tend to think the world was created for us .
They do n’t see us as a part of the planet .
The climate change denial is part of that worldview . ”
“ But beat the bushes hard enough , you ’ll find corporate money behind dissenters on any topic . ”
South Dakota boasts the first resolution to focus solely on climate change without any mention of evolution , though other states could soon follow .
In Utah earlier this month , the House approved legislation that urges the Environmental Protection Agency to put any plans for regulating carbon dioxide emissions on hold , “ until climate data and global warming science are substantiated . ”
“ I think there may be a tangential connection in terms of methods to creationism and intelligent design , but perhaps not a direct linkage or advisement , ” says Steven Newton , a spokesman for the National Center for Science Education .
As the Times article points out , “ academic freedom ” bills that are being introduced by state lawmakers around the country instruct educators to teach students about “ both sides ” of controversial issues — most notably on evolution .
The Seattle - based , pro-intelligent design Discovery Institute is behind efforts to introduce many of these bills and has proposed sample legislation for lawmakers to follow .
Since the Louisiana bill was passed ( making it the only state to have actually passed an academic freedom bill into law ) , proposed bills have included global warming and human cloning on the list of “ controversial topics , ” as they encourage “ thinking critically ” about the “ relationships between explanations and evidence . ”
More recently , in Kentucky , a bill was introduced in the Legislature that would encourage teachers to discuss “ the advantages and disadvantages of scientific theories , ” including “ evolution , the origins of life , global warming , and human cloning . ”
The inclusion of other topics is part of a legal strategy to show that evolution is not being singled out for special scrutiny .
The strategy ’s roots are in a 2005 Cobb County , Ga. case , in which the school board put warning stickers on biology books , saying evolution is “ just a theory , not a fact . ”
A judge struck down the warning stickers as unconstitutional because it unfairly targeted evolution for special scrutiny .
“ I think it speaks to a religious purpose , one of the prongs of the Lemon test , ” said Steve Newton .
The hot - button issues of human cloning ( a code word for abortion , Newton says ) and global warming are linked to increase the appearance of evolution ’s controversy .
Fostering Fear of Science
The science blog Denialism has a list of themes used in the global warming debate that have been similarly deployed in intelligent design battles :
Well - funded think tanks are capable of derailing a scientific consensus , in this case the consensus on global warming which has existed for nearly three decades ;
The goal of denialists is not to propose an alternative theory that is explanatory and useful , but to create controversy and doubt where it does not exist ;
These attempts are highly effective despite a complete absence of controversy in the scientific literature .
Attacks in the lay press are more than sufficient to create a false debate using an appeal for parity or balanced presentation of ideas .
In fact , the Discovery Institute has become quite vocal in the past several months about climate change .
Since Jay Richards ( who co-authored the intelligent design book Privileged Planet with Guillermo Gonzalez ) returned to the Discovery Institute this year , he has been writing extensively on climate change skepticism and questioning the notion of scientific consensus .
In his May 16 column for the American Enterprise Institute , Richards wrote :
Anyone who has studied the history of science knows that scientists are not immune to the non-rational dynamics of the herd .
Many false ideas enjoyed consensus opinion at one time .
Indeed , the ‘ power of the paradigm ’ often shapes the thinking of scientists so strongly that they become unable to accurately summarize , let alone evaluate , radical alternatives .
Question the paradigm , and some respond with dogmatic fanaticism .
To raise doubt about the validity of evolution and climate change , members of the Discovery Institute are now trying to get around the fact that the scientific community has reached a consensus by trivializing the years of empirical research , testing and peer - reviewed study that led to the conclusion as “ dogmatic fanaticism . ”
“ What is going on is broader than attacks on specific scientific disciplines .
In a way , it does n’t matter to them which scientific discipline they are criticizing , whether it ’s evolution or global warming or medicine — their main thrust is a denial of the validity of science itself , ” Newton said .
“ Ironically , these right - wing deniers find common ground with extreme left - wing postmodernists , who deny textual meaning independent of a social context .
These science deniers think that empirical experiments cannot have an independent , objective meaning outside of a social context , whether that be a “ Darwinist ” perspective or an “ Al Gore ” perspective .
At the same time , intelligent design proponents have done no research advancing their ideas beyond a poorly thought - out hypothesis .
Rather , they cherry pick data to raise doubt about evolution .
For the most part , dissenters of climate change are also not engaged in active research , but review the tracking of temperature trends , picking apart any inconsistencies in the overall pattern .
For instance , skeptics say that the earth has cooled in the years since 1998 .
However , 1998 was an unusually hot year due to El Nino effects .
Additionally , while the increase in atmospheric and land temperatures may have slowed , ocean temperatures continue to increase .
And just as the Discovery Institute has a Dissent from Darwin petition , which attempts to cast doubt on “ natural selection and random mutation being able to account for the complexity of life , ” global warming skeptics have their own list as well .
The Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine petition has 31,000 scientists who reject the science behind human - caused climate change .
The petition ’s purpose is to create the impression that there remains a vast debate among climate scientists .
However , to be considered a qualified scientist , the list only requires a B.S. degree in a range of areas including food science , general science , veterinary science , and electrical engineering .
Meanwhile , climate research directly incorporates data from a myriad of scientific disciplines , including paleontology , oceanography , chemistry , geology , and ecology .
The conclusions from these fields are remarkably unified , but skeptics jump on any disagreement or differing conclusions , however small , to argue that there ’s no legitimate consensus .
“ That ’s the way scientists hammer out their differences , ” Prothero said .
( Prothero offered an example in which the scientific community has not reached consensus .
Despite the recent publication of a paper asserting that scientists have reached the conclusion that an asteroid in the Yucatan killed the dinosaurs , paleontologists generally do not accept the theory , and no vertebrate paleontologists were part of the publication ’s research . )
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded in its 2007 Synthesis Report , “ Warming of the climate system is unequivocal , as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures , widespread melting of snow and ice , and rising global average sea level . ”
Additionally , the report said , “ There is very high confidence that the net effect of human activities since 1750 has been one of warming . ”
At its most simplistic , Shaman says that “ dumping more selective absorbing gases ( greenhouse gases ) into the atmosphere produces a radiative imbalance that increase the energy and temperature of the earth ’s atmosphere , land , and oceans .
We can measure the CO₂ increase by infrared spectroscopy from satellites as well .
And we know that a doubling of CO₂ from 180 ppm to 360 ppm ( which has happened and been surpassed ) leads to a ~ 1 degree Celsius increase of temperature on average . ”
Still , there is legitimate debate regarding climate change .
“ Not as to whether we are affecting the planet , but how much , ” Shaman said .
Various feedbacks , such as cloud cover , could decrease warming , while others , such as water vapor , could increase it .
In light of last fall ’s email scandal in which some members were accused of trying to push data , it ’s relevant that the IPCC document is a consensus document , Shaman said .
This means that every participant from every country has to agree to every word in both the summary and the full 1000 page report …
This consensus process , which is long and painful and grays all its participants produces an inherently conservative document — i.e. middle of the road assessment of the state of our understanding of the climate system and global warming .
There is slim chance that an extreme position can get into the document when any one person can object and demand it be stricken .
However , even a middle of the road document can have errors that ongoing scientific inquiry should correct .
Just as scientists have been reaching a consensus , acceptance by the general public has declined .
The latest survey by the Pew Research Center found that 57 percent of Americans think there is solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades , down from April 2008 , when 71 percent said there was solid evidence .
“ I do n’t know what the tangible proof would be , ” Shaman said .
“ The collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Shelf ?
Would it take that ? ”
Just as with evolution , Shaman said that climate scientists have n’t been their best advocates in responding to attacks of misinformation .
He said climate change desperately needs a Ken Miller , the Brown University biology professor best known for his cheerful smackdowns of creationists and intelligent design proponents .
“ Climate change requires people to get out there and talk about it , ” Shaman said .
“ You need people like [ Miller ] who get out and articulate themselves , who do n’t get ruffled in any way . ”
At this fall ’s Tea Party protest I attended in Washington DC , many participants decried the rather wonkish issue of cap - and - trade legislation .
Shaman said the Tea Party opposition is actually a perfect fit .
People view any attempts by government to legislate solutions as a restriction on personal liberty .
“ Unfortunately , this requires a larger worldview , that resources on the planet are limited and must be utilized in a sustainable way , ” he said .
[ Originally published in the Cambridge Chronicle , August 2002 ]
Cambridge has been doubly blessed in terms of its natural architecture –both by a long history reflected in the trees and also by its progressive contemporary policies toward them .
Take a walk or bike ride one of these summer days when the weather is warm and the foliage at its peak to learn about some of Cambridge ’s most prominent trees .
The Houghton Beech
The magnificent but slightly claustrophobic looking beech tree at 1008 Mass Ave is the Houghton Beech , Cambridge ’s only living landmark .
Planted over 150 years ago on the estate of Henry O. Houghton , Cambridge ’s one - time mayor and founder of the Houghton Mifflin Company and Riverside Press , the tree was threatened but saved in the 1970s when MIT acquired the property and demolished the original buildings .
Then in the 1980s , the tree was scheduled to be destroyed to make way for the sprawling apartment complex that now occupies the site .
Neighborhood activists intervened and in 1985 , the tree was declared a historic landmark .
The Washington Elm
If you travel carefully across the busy intersection at Mason and Garden Streets , you ’ll see all that remains of the most famous of Cambridge ’s trees , a brass plate commemorating where the Washington Elm once stood .
Born in the forests of pre-Colonial Cambridge , the elm is said to have sheltered George Washington as he took command of the American Army in July 1775 .
For almost 150 years , it was the most beloved of American elm trees–a prime tourist destination and subject of countless accolades .
Its last decades saw it decline to a sad shadow of its former glory , and the remains were toppled by a storm in 1923 .
Today its scion lives nearby in the Cambridge Common .
Winnie - the - Pooh ’s House
[ Note : does this still exist ? ]
Children will be delighted to learn that Winnie - the - Pooh keeps a city apartment on Hurlbut Street , between Harvard and Porter Squares for his trips away from Pooh Corner .
Carved from the stump of a 100 - year old silver maple by prolific Cambridge artist Mitch Ryerson and local resident Irven DeVore , the Pooh Tree has attracted thousands of well - wishers from around the world since it was created in 1998 .
Visitors are encouraged to sign
Pooh ’s guest book and inspect his tiny bedroom ( complete with Hunny Pot ) by peeking through the windows at the base of the tree .
Longfellow ’s Linden
To the right of the poet ’s famous house at 105 Brattle Street is the only living survivor of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ’s era— - a grand linden tree more than 200 years old and 110 feet high .
Longfellow mentioned the tree in his diary : “ Fanny sits under the linden tree and reads to me Heine ’s poems … ”
The Memorial Drive Sycamores
It ’s only thanks to the efforts of two men , John Moot and Edward L. Bernays ( aka the “ Father of Public Relations ” that the grand row of sycamores still lines the stretch of Memorial Drive near Harvard Square .
In 1964 , a proposed highway interchange project was approved that would have destroyed the trees .
Moot and Bernays caught wind of the project and mobilized widespread support for the trees .
The project was halted and the sycamores continue to grace the roadway as they have done for over 150 years .
Mount Auburn Cemetary
The first and greatest of America ’s garden cemeteries is home to one of the world ’s greatest collections of trees and other plants .
With over 6,000 mature trees marked clearly with identifying tags , Mount Auburn Cemetery is the perfect place to learn to identify new trees or just admire the view .
Many of the trees here were planted in the 1830s when the cemetery was consecrated and are now reaching their full maturity and glory .
UCL scientists and surgeons have led a revolutionary operation to transplant a new trachea into a child , using the child 's own stem cells to rebuild the airway in the body .
The operation -- a world first -- involved laboratory - based scientists and hospital - based clinicians working in partnership with colleagues in Europe to treat a 10 - year - old British boy .
The boy , who has not been named , is recovering from surgery but his condition is stable and he is breathing unaided .
He was born with a rare condition called Long Segment Tracheal Stenosis -- a tiny windpipe that does not grow and restricts breathing .
Shortly after birth , he underwent a conventional trachea transplant at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children ( GOSH ) , but his condition deteriorated last November when a metal stent implanted in that operation began to erode into the aorta , a key artery , causing severe bleeding .
Scientists and surgeons at UCL , GOSH , the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust , and the Careggi University Hospital in Florence , Italy , developed a new technique to treat the life - threatening condition .
advertisement
They stripped cells from a donated trachea , used it to replace the entire length of the damaged airway , and then used the child 's own bone marrow stem cells to seal the airway in the body .
Dr Mark Lowdell , Director of Cellular Therapy at Royal Free Hospital and a senior lecturer at UCL Medical School , received the donor trachea from Italy and some bone marrow from the patient at the beginning of surgery .
He and his colleagues prepared two different types of stem cells from the bone marrow together with some growth signalling chemicals and returned them to GOSH with the donor trachea .
Professor Paolo Macchiarini , from Careggi University Hospital , who is an Honorary Consultant at GOSH and Honorary Professor at UCL , applied the cells and the growth factors to the trachea in the operating theatre .
Martin Elliot , Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at UCL and Director of the Tracheal Service at GOSH , led the operation to repair the damaged aorta and implant the new trachea .
advertisement
The application of this technology -- which has never been used on a child before -- should reduce greatly the risk of rejection of the new trachea , as the child 's stem cells will not generate any immune response .
Professor Martin Birchall , UCL lead for translational regenerative medicine , who is also a head and neck surgeon specialising in airways and voice , led on ethics and regulatory approvals .
Professor Birchall and Professor Macchiarini achieved the world 's first stem cell - based organ transplant on an adult patient in 2008 .
Since moving to a Chair at the UCL Ear Institute in 2009 , Professor Birchall has developed a research programme with Professor Elliott which includes , for example , the absorbable stent ( supporting tube ) used in this 10 - year - old patient .
When the patient presented to Professor Elliott , Professor Birchall pulled together the various team members into a functional unit capable of delivering a stem cell implant as quickly as possible .
He said : " Professor Macchiarini 's seminal work , together with the UCL team , has now saved the life of two adults and one child .
We have shown that stem cell - based treatments can save lives and can be used in the creation of living structures which draw upon the body 's own natural healing mechanisms for their support .
" The step - wise progression in technique from first patient to the present has delivered a highly streamlined , rapid process .
This means that such treatments potentially can be moved out of the hands of a tiny number of specialist centres into many hospitals around the world , including those in developing countries . "
This family boldly goes where no other family has gone before .

Getting a bit sick of your Motorola DROID with its vanilla stylings ?
Well fear not ( unless you ’re afraid of a bit of warranty - voiding tinkering ) because HTC ’s Sense UI has been ported over to the DROID thanks to the work of AllDroid user Greek35T et al .
Things are still very rough seeing as this build is about as alpha as a release can get , but so far most users have good things to say with this in mind .
Of course not everyone will be willing to put up with some of the current quirks which include minor data glitches and the inability to make calls over 3G ( data works , but voice requires 2G ) or use Bluetooth and GPS , but that does n’t mean you ca n’t live vicariously through others on the internet , now does it ?

Rain caused havoc on major citybound roads around Sydney this morning with a crash on the Anzac Bridge bringing traffic to a standstill .
A Transport Management Centre spokeswoman said traffic was heavy on the bridge all morning but a crash just after 8.40 am was the final straw .
Two of four citybound lanes on the bridge were closed while emergency services responded to the crash .
And flooding on the westbound side of the bridge closed one of five lanes at the same time .
A bus breakdown on the Eastern Distributor closed one lane at Woolloomooloo just after 8.30 am .

NBC Universal Boss Jeff Zucker Lies To Congress About Boxee
from the but - what - about - the - corn - farmers dept

Rep. Rick Boucher ( D - VA ) : What about Boxee ?
Mr. Zucker you probably are in a better position to answer that .
Did Hulu block the Boxee users from access to the Hulu programs ?
Zucker ( NBC ) :
This was a decision made by the Hulu management to , uh , what Boxee was doing was illegally taking the content that was on Hulu without any business deal .
And , you know , all , all the , we have several distributors , actually many distributors of the Hulu content that we have legal distribution deals with so we do n't preclude distribution deals .
What we preclude are those who illegally take that content .

NBC Universal management gets more and more ridiculous every time we come across anything they do .
While they 've left most of the more ridiculous statements to their chief lawyer , Rick Cotton ( who is worried about the poor corn farmers harmed by movie file sharing ) , CEO Jeff Zucker has made his fair share of whoppers .
While he got a lot of attention last month for his cowardly handling of the whole Leno / Conan mess , his latest move is to flat out lie to Congress .
In a hearing in front of Congress as a part of NBC 's effort to merge with Comcast , Rep. Rick Boucher asked Zucker about Hulu being forced to block Boxee ( a battle that 's gone back and forth a few times ) .
When the whole thing started , Hulu management was very upfront about how they were pressured by their content partners like NBC to block Boxee , which is just another browser .
It was quite clear that Hulu did n't want to do the block , but had no choice due to pressure from the likes of partial owner NBC : So how did Zucker respond when asked about it by Congressman Rick Boucher ?
He blamed Hulu for making the decision , and falsely claimed that Boxee illegally access Hulu content
Of course , that 's a flat out wrong , as Boxee was not illegally " taking " the content at all .
Boxee is a browser , like Firefox .
If what Boxee does is illegal so is accessing Hulu with Firefox or IE .
But it 's even worse than that , because last year , in a different situation , Zucker admitted that he had been a part of the decision makers to have Hulu block Boxee , telling Kara Swisher that " our vision " was to block Boxee in an effort to keep " Hulu being an online experience " rather than one you could access via a TV .
So why would Zucker flat out lie during a Congressional hearing , and throw Hulu under the bus while doing so ?
Does he not understand how Boxee works ?
Did he forget his own dealings with Hulu ?
Or is he just making stuff up in a Congressional hearing ?

The European Parliament is fed up with the secrecy surrounding the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) .
Today , representatives from all the major parliamentary coalitions introduced a resolution demanding that the European Commission release all negotiating texts , inform Parliament about the negotiating process , and absolutely refuse to countenance any sort of " three strikes " Internet disconnection penalty for online copyright infringement .
The measure comes up for a vote tomorrow and looks set to pass — it has the support of all the important groups in Parliament , including the EPP , S&D , ALDE , and the Greens / EFA .
One notable supporter : Christian Engström , the Pirate Party 's lone MEP in Parliament , who aligns with the Greens / EFA group .
The resolution does n't take long to get to the point .
Parliament wishes to " express its concern over the lack of a transparent process in the conduct of the ACTA negotiations " and complains that " no parliamentary approval has been asked for the mandate [ to negotiate the agreement ] . "
Parliament wants immediate access to all documents and demands that it be " immediately and fully informed at all stages of the negotiations . "
If not , the resolution threatens legal action against the European Commission .
Engström , the jolly pirate
The resolution specifically demands that European negotiators not assent to " any so called ' three strikes ' procedures " given the European Parliament 's long dislike for such practices .
The resolution does not call for ACTA to scrapped , however .
Instead , negotiations should center only on more effective " counterfeiting " enforcement .
As Engström put it in a blog post on the new resolution , " If there is to be an ACTA agreement , the parliament wants it to be about combating goods counterfeiting ( i.e. , fake Rolexes and hand bags , fake Viagra on the net , fake cigarettes that are even more harmful that proper ones , etc. ) .
It should not be about restricting our fundamental civil liberties on the net ...
Today is a day when it feels good to be a Pirate in the European Parliament . "
Parliament has called for such information before ; as long ago as March 2009 it asked the Commission to turn over all documents related to ACTA .
Nothing happened .
But the resolution claims that , thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon coming into force on December 1 2009 , Parliament will have to approve ACTA before it comes into force .
If the Commission refuses to involve Parliament , a " no " vote might be the eventual result of two years of negotiating work .

New York , February 12 , 2010 — The Committee to Protect Journalists is concerned about reported border incidents involving journalists attempting to enter Canada from the United States to cover protests and other events related to the Olympic Games , which begin tonight .
John Weston Osburn , a Salt Lake City freelance journalist associated with the news organization IndyMedia , was interrogated and denied entry by Canadian border authorities near Vancouver on Tuesday due to a past conviction for a misdemeanor , according to a report by Vancouver Media Co-op .
After being turned away by Canadian authorities a second time at the same crossing , Osburn was interrogated by U.S. border authorities who detained him for two hours and searched through his journals , computer and digital camera , the journalist told Vancouver Media Co-op in an interview .
The interview was rebroadcast on the U.S. - based syndicated broadcast program , “ Democracy Now ! ”
A second journalist , Martin Macias Jr. , a contributor to Vocalo , an online news outlet and affiliate of Chicago Public Radio , was detained for two hours and interrogated by Canadian authorities on Saturday , before being turned away and put on a plane to Seattle , according to a report in the Huffington Post .
Macias was planning to attend a press conference by the Olympic Resistance Network , a group critical of the games .
“ I was in the passport line in Vancouver , ” Macias is quoted saying on Huffington Post , “ and I told them I was a radio journalist and a student at Malcolm X College .
The agent put a big circle and x on my ticket .
I was pulled out the line and questioned aggressively for two hours .
They wanted to know what I was going to do in Vancouver , who I was meeting with , who organized the conference , and what they looked like .
They took all my contact information and business cards of journalists and other people I was to connect with while in Vancouver . ”
Canadian authorities provided no explicit reason for denying entry to Macias , according to press reports .
CPJ has documented two other incidents of harassment related to the Olympics .
In December , news videographer Ian Robertson was shoved to the ground and struck in the head by Canadian security officers in Toronto while covering the Olympic torch relay .
Robertson was hospitalized with a concussion , according to the Canadian Press .
Another journalist , photographer Dave Thomas , was pushed several times by officers but was not injured , the Canadian Press reported .
Canadian officials told the Canadian Press that the officers acted in an “ appropriate manner . ”
In November , the host of “ Democracy Now ! ” was detained by Canadian authorities for 90 minutes when she tried to cross the border near Vancouver .
Host Amy Goodman , who had been invited to speak at Vancouver Public Library about her new , unrelated book , was issued a limited visa stipulating that she had to leave Canada within 48 hours .
Jennie Chen , a spokeswoman for the Canadian Embassy in Washington , said she could not discuss specific incidents because of privacy restrictions .
In general , she said , travelers seeking to enter Canada are assessed on a case - by - case basis based on considerations that include security .
Chen said authorities did not alter admission standards for the Olympics .
Joanne Ferreira , spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the Department of Homeland Security , said the agency would not discuss specific cases .
“ Canadian authorities should clarify why these journalists have been prevented from entering the country to cover the Winter Olympics and related events , ” said CPJ Deputy Director Robert Mahoney .
“ Silence reinforces the impression that a journalist who intends to cover protests around the Games risks being denied entry . ”
Back in business : Pompeii snack bar re-opens ... nearly 2000 years after it was destroyed by the eruption of Mt Vesuvius
In AD79 it was Pompeii 's most popular hang out , where locals would stop off to meet friends and partake in a snack of baked cheese smothered in honey .
Now , nearly 2000 years after the Italian city was buried under ash and rubble by the devastating eruption of Mount Vesuvius , its favourite snack bar has re-opened .
For the first time the thermopolium , as it is called in Italy , will be open to tourists after having undergone and excavation and restoration process over the past few months .
Open for business :
An ancient thermopolium , or snack bar , is to be open to the public 1921 years after it was destroyed by the eruption of Mt Vesuvius
Tomorrow 300 VIPs selected at random will attend an advance opening of the snack bar where they will enjoy a taste of Roman cafe society , including the sweet , calorific treats enjoyed by the all sections of Pompeii society before the city was destroyed .
Pompeii , which is near Naples in the Italian region of Campania , was destroyed , and completely buried , during a catastrophic two - day eruption of the volcano Mount Vesuvius on August 24 , 79AD .
The volcano collapsed higher roof - lines and buried Pompeii under many meters of ash and pumice , and it was lost for nearly 1700 years before its accidental rediscovery in 1748 .
Since then , its excavation has provided an extraordinarily detailed insight into life during the Roman Empire .
Step back in time : Customers at the snack bar enjoyed treats of baked cheese and honey during ancient Roman times
Restored :
The entrance to the snack bar , which features an internal garden and dining room
Visitors to the thermopolium will be taken on a guided tour of Vetutius Placidus 's snack bar which features an L - shaped counter and a painting on its back wall depicting Mercury , the god of commerce and Bacchus , the god of wine .
The thermopolium features a cellar , garden and dining area - or triclinium , which was decorated with a painting showing the rape of Europa with Jupiter disgused as a bull .
Excavations suggest the internal garden once featured a pergola , herb garden and grapevines .
The snack bar has been closed for years in order to protect if from further damage .
But soon all visitors will be able to venture inside to get a taste of an ancient Roman cafe .
The bar used to face onto a main street , the Via dell ' Abbondanza , and all sections of society would call in for a Mediterranean lunch or the famous snack of ricotta cheese and sticky honey .

Update : Abiword and Gnumeric are now most likely to replace OpenOffice .
According to the latest Ubuntu Netbook Remix Blueprint , the Ubuntu community are planning to drop OpenOffice from the default installation of Ubuntu Netbook Edition for the upcoming Lucid Lynx release , atleast for now .
Now documents will be opened by default in Google Docs .
( After this article , the blueprint got a lot of feedbacks and complaints against inclusion of Google Docs .
Now they have decided to use Abiword and Gnumeric instead of Google Docs . )
We have previously told you about Gimp being dropped from Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu replacing Google with Yahoo as the default search engine .
The developers have been removing applications that are irrelevant on a netbook .
While document editing is clearly a not irrelevant on a netbook , the developers feel that with netbooks being used mostly for internet related works , Google Docs will suffice .
Apart from this , some other changes have also been introduced .
Several applications have been hidden by default :
Brasero / CD Creator hidden
Disk Usage Analyzer hidden
Print job management hidden
Take screenshot hidden
Dictionary hidden
Log system viewer hidden
And some other have been dropped in addition to OpenOffice :
Tomboy dropped
PalmOS pilot dropped
Graphics applications removed
While new ones have been added to provide better netbook functionalities :
gbrainy added ( gbrainy is a brain teaser game )
Gwibber added ( Gwibber is a microblogging client )
Cheese added ( Cheese is an application to take pictures and videos from webcam )

It 's hard not to be envious of Sheila Kelley .
For one thing , she 's calling from the Lost set in Hawaii .
For another thing , she 's calling from the Lost set in Hawaii .
The good news ?
The 48 - year - old actress — who 's married to actor Richard Schiff and has two kids — is ready to deliver the goods about her role as mysterious
Zoe on the almost - over ABC hit ( Tuesdays , 9 PM ) to UsMagazine.com .
Let the micro-analyzing begin !
Us : You 're currently filming the second - to - last episode .
What 's the vibe on the set , considering that the end is near ?
It 's very …impending .
Everybody feels like there is something coming .
Like , this will lead to better things .
There 's a little sadness as well .
I was on L.A. Law for five years , and my husband was on The West Wing for seven years .
I know this is a huge transition for everybody .
So you can feel that uncertainty .
Like the last week of high school !
See what your favorite Lost stars looked like before they hit the small screen !
Us : So who 's the homecoming king of the cast ?
That 's got to be Matthew Fox .
And Josh Holloway is the bad boy .
I have crushes on all them .
I have never been around more attractive men in my life .
See more hot TV hunks !
Us : Was it weird being the new girl ?
It feels like Sandy in Grease .
I came to a very well - established set .
It was a little nerve - racking , but the character that was written was so intriguing and multi-faceted and a little bad ass .
That made things easier .
I 've had an amazing time .
These are such open - hearted people .
Us : What else can you tell Us about your character , Zoe ?
Other than the fact that she wears glasses .
She is Charles Widmore 's right hand .
She does all his dirty work .
But she has her own strategy and agenda as well .
In one script , I 'm going in one direction .
In another script , I 'm going 180 degrees the other way .
Us : That 's not enough information .
What else you got ?
She is looking for someone on the island .
Us : Anything else ?
Maybe this will make sense to you :
This beautiful journey of this entire show , between good and evil , between science and faith , lies within Zoe .
After I got the role , one of the first things I did was look look up what the name meant because there is so much mythology to everything .
And I learned that " Zoe " is Greek and it means life .
Us : Give a cryptic clue that means nothing right now yet means everything in the long run .
Ok .
Here is Zoe 's clue : Zoe has the answer .
Zoe knows .
That 's as good as it's going to get .
Us : Have you seen the final script yet ?
I saw the final script in someone else 's hands , but I have n't read it .
I feel like I won the lottery !
But the producers are very protective .
And I totally respect that .
After all , what is left in the world that is new and that exciting for people ?

Over at Cato , Reason Contributing Editor Julian Sanchez expands on what was mentioned in today 's Morning Links :
It looks as though we 'll be getting a straight one - year reauthorization of the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act , without even the minimal added safeguards for privacy and civil liberties that had been proposed in the Senate 's watered down bill .

In a July 17th conference call , Stupak 's C Street housemate Jim DeMint told conservative activists that " ... if we 're able to stop Obama on this [ health care ] it will be his Waterloo .
It will break him . "
Congressman Stupak has lied about his extensive association with The Family , whose members have been reported as calling the group a " Christian mafia . "
News broke late Friday that Michigan Representative Bart Stupak ( D - Mich ) has used his leverage as Co-Chair of the House Pro-Life Caucus to win from Democratic Party House leadership the opportunity for a vote on attaching an anti-abortion amendment to H.R. 3200 .
Reproductive rights groups warn Stupak 's amendment could further restrict the already limited access Americans have to a currently legal medical procedure , abortion .
As I 've recently covered , Republicans have openly discussed Bart Stupak and his Pro-Life Democrats as being the GOP 's best hope for sinking health care reform .
Although Rep. Stupak ( D - Mich ) has said he will vote for the H.R. 3200 health care bill if it comes to the House floor , he may well succeed in sinking the current health care reform effort by weakening the support of reproductive rights advocates for the bill .
For several months , Representative Stupak has been appearing on hard right and Christian conservative media venues and declaring his intent to either force a " clean up or down vote " on his proposed Stupak - Pitts amendment or else lead a block of Democrats to join with House Republicans in blocking the H.R. 3200 health care reform bill from coming to the House floor .
But there 's reason to question Stupak 's role ; for the better part of the decade Bart Stupak has enjoyed subsidized , below - market rent living in the now - notorious " C Street House " that is legally registered as a church and is run by " The Family " , an anti-democratic fundamentalist Washington influence peddling group covered in journalist Jeff Sharlet 's New York Times bestselling book The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart Of American Power .
Sharlet accuses
The Family , also known as The Fellowship , of being an unregistered lobby .
Bart Stupak has openly lied about his association with The Family .
Although Stupak in 2002 told LA Times reporter Lisa Getter , concerning the C Street House , " We sort of do n't talk to the press about the house . "
But more recently , in a July conference call with journalists , Representative Stupak declared to Michigan Messenger reporter Ed Brayton , " I do n't belong to any such group .
I rent a room at a house in ' C Street . '
I do not belong to any such group .
I do n't know what you 're talking about , [ The ] Family and all this other stuff . "
On April 9 , 2008 , at the 56th National Prayer Breakfast , Stupak told attendees , " I am Bart Stupak , co-chair of the House Prayer Breakfast .
In my sixteen years in the house this is the second time that I have had the honor to address you from the dais . "
Both the National Prayer Breakfast and the House Prayer Breakfast are institutions established over half a century ago by The Family , and speaking spots at the National Prayer Breakfast are reported to be tightly controlled by Family head Doug Coe .
In an April 2008 NBC exclusive story , Andrea Mitchell and Jim Popkin covered the astounding influence The Family has developed in Washington , DC over the last half - century .
Footage obtained obtained by NBC revealed Coe 's distinctly unorthodox views :
In one videotaped sermon from 1989 , Coe provides this account of the atrocities committed under Chairman Mao in Communist China : " I 've seen pictures of the young men in the Red Guard ... they would bring in this young man ’s mother ... he would take an axe and cut her head off .
They have to put the purposes of the Red Guard ahead of father , mother , brother sister and their own life .
That was a covenant , a pledge .
That 's what Jesus said . "
In his preaching , Coe repeatedly urges a personal commitment to Jesus Christ .
It ’s a commitment Coe compares to the blind devotion that Adolph Hitler demanded from his followers -- a rhetorical technique that now is drawing sharp criticism .
" Hitler , Goebbels and Himmler were three men .
Think of the immense power these three men had , these nobodies from nowhere , " Coe said .
Later in the sermon , Coe said : " Jesus said , ‘ You have to put me before other people .
And you have to put me before yourself . '
Hitler , that was the demand to be in the Nazi party .
You have to put the Nazi party and its objectives ahead of your own life and ahead of other people . "
The C Street House , where Bart Stupak has lived since 2002 , is owned by Youth With a Mission , an international Christian evangelizing organization whose founder is on record encouraging Christians to infiltrate key sectors of society such as government , business , education , and media .
As I described in a Friday , November 6th post , Family members were responsible for inserting language , into the 1996 Welfare Reform Act , that enabled George W. Bush 's Faith Based Initiative .
Representative Stupak has recently been accused of crafting legislation that would be unconstitutional and violate separation of church and state .

A reddish jet of gas emanates from the forming star HH - 30 , which is surrounded by a protoplanetary disk .
The search for water on other planetary bodies has taken agiant leap forward in recent months .
In November , NASA announced that it hadfound substantial quantities of water on the Moon .
Earlier this month , the Cassini spacecraft obtained data about one of Saturn 's moons , Enceladus , that mayconfirm the presence of sub - surface liquid water .
While these missions scour our solar system for tracesof water — a necessary condition for life — a group of scientists islooking beyond , at solar systems light years away .
A recent study published inthe journal Astrobiology described using infrared spectroscopy to model thedust surrounding young extrasolar stars to try to detect the presence of hydrousminerals called phyllosilicates .
One of the simplest examples of phyllosilicates is clayminerals .
Water is an important part of their chemical structure .
" If you find phyllosilicates , you have most likelyfound liquid water , " says lead author Melissa Morris , a visiting professorin the Department of Physics , Astronomy and Materials Science at Missouri StateUniversity and an affiliate of Arizona State University 's School of Earth and Space Exploration .
" The objective was to try to determine whether we couldactually detect these wonderful signatures of hydrated minerals almost alwaysproduced by the interaction of liquid water with rock . "
In order to determine whether the surface of an extrasolarplanet would contain water , scientists can look at what is called the protoplanetarydisk — a disk of gas and dust surrounding a star during its early stages ofdevelopment .
Scientists think planets are born from protoplanetary disksthrough gravitational and electrostatic interactions between particles .
So ifscientists can determine the elemental composition of the dusty disks thatorbit young stars , they should be able to predict what sort of planets will eventuallyform .
One school of thought suggests that the Earth acquiredits surface water from asteroids or asteroid - like bodies that were present in itsprotoplanetary disk .
The authors of this study used the same assumption forpotential Earth - like planets in othersolar systems .
Therefore , if phyllosilicates are found in the protoplanetarydisk of a young extrasolar star , the assumption is that water would most likelybe found on the surface of planets that are later born within the disk .
?( Ofcourse , as Mercury , Venus and Mars illustrate , other conditions will affectwhether a rocky planet ultimately has water . )
The scientists hope to someday use instruments such asthe Spitzer Space Telescope and the Stratospheric Observatory for InfraredAstronomy ( SOFIA ) to determine the composition of exozodiacal dust inextrasolar protoplanetary disks .
Before that can be done , however , scientistsmust first determine if detection of particular minerals in these distant systemsis even possible .
This study helps scientists determine what signatures to lookfor in disks .
The composition of the dust is identified by studying itsemission features .
A common procedure is to use infrared spectroscopy toidentify substances by the infrared wavelengths they absorb or emit .
Thisprocedure is often used to detect water on planetary bodies .
Morris and her colleagues began by modeling the infraredemission features of dust that did not contain hydrated minerals , orphyllosilicates .
They then changed the mineral mixture by addingphyllosilicates amounting to three percent of the total mixture .
In the paper , Morris and her co-author Steve Desch ofArizona State University claim that unique features indicative of phyllosilicatesin the mid-infrared spectra should make it possible to detect those minerals inprotoplanetary disks .
Scott Sandford , a research astrophysicist at the NASA AmesResearch Center in California who has experience conducting spectroscopy inmeteorites , disagrees .
He says proving the presence of phyllosilicates in aprotoplanetary disk is a challenge .
" It is somewhat difficult to identify phyllosilicateswhen they are present in mixtures because they are relatively featureless asopposed to other minerals , which have a lot of structural features in theirspectrum , " says Sandford .
Morris says the outcome of this study shows only that , basedon the computer models , it should be possible to detect the presence ofphyllosilicates in protoplanetary disks .
It is only the first step in the detectionof water in other solar systems .
" My part was developing the model to determine whetherit could be done , " says Morris .
" What instruments are available ?
Of theinstruments we have , do they have the resolution ? "
The next step , which Morris has already begun , is to applythis technique to actual data .
Morris is now comparing the models to dataobtained from the Spitzer Space Telescope .
Sandford says that will be the real test .
" The basic idea they are espousing is a perfectly goodone , " says Sandford .
" I 'm personally kind of skeptical that you canlocate the phyllosilicates in this disk to the level they suggest .
How applicableare those models to the real world ? "
Morris says this type of research is also important inunderstanding how planetary systems form in general .
" I'm a huge advocate for looking for water in our ownsolar system , " says Morris , " but just to understand the process ofplanetary system formation , we need to go outsideour solar system and look at other systems as well . "
The Church of Greece said yesterday that it would not fight the government 's attempt to tax some of its operations after certain provisions in the recently tabled bill were watered down .
The Church 's Holy Synod met yesterday to discuss the government 's decision to impose various levies as part of its bid to increase revenues in the framework of efforts to reduce the public deficit .
« We have never refused , nor do we now refuse to be taxed , » said the Holy Synod in a statement .
« The Church wants to find a way in which it can support the state in its efforts but which does not damage its humanitarian work , so that people can benefit . »
The government has proposed a 20 percent tax on the income that the Church makes from its real estate , which is estimated to be some 10 million euros a year .
However , the Finance Ministry has accepted calls to accept as tax deductable the wages paid to personnel working for the Church and to factor in a 5 percent depreciation for buildings that are rented out for accommodation and 3 percent for those that are leased by businesses .
The government also conceded ground on the tax it wanted to impose on donations made to the Church .
It had initially aimed to tax these at 10 percent for cash donations and 5 percent for any real estate that is gifted to the Church .
However , this has been severely diluted , so the donations will be taxed at 0.1 and 0.5 percent respectively .
The Holy Synod said that it would submit a list of proposals to the Finance Ministry regarding its plans to tax the Church 's property and charity organizations but did not reveal what these suggestions would be .

For the past few months , national retailer J.C. Penney has been fighting an under - seal court battle to keep you from knowing that its payment card network was breached by U.S. and Eastern European hackers .

after [ hacker 2 ] got domain admin i stopped Source : Government court filing in U.S. v. Gonzalez
The intrusions , by TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez and his overseas accomplices , occurred beginning in October 2007 .
J.C. Penney admits it was “ wholly unaware ” of the breach until the Secret Service told the company about it in May 2008 , but now says with certitude that no identity or bank - card data was stolen in the breach it failed to detect .
That ’s why the company did n’t want to be identified to the public , says spokeswoman Darcie Brossart
“ Because there was no reason to think that the hackers were successful , there was no need to alarm J.C. Penney customers , ” says Brossart , “ We believed we had a legitimate interest in not being linked to criminal activity that resulted in major thefts from other companies . ”
So in court filings , J.C. Penney argued that it was entitled to anonymity under the 2004 Crime Victims ’ Rights
Act , a law intended to protect the “ dignity and privacy ” of victims .
A federal judge on Friday ordered the company ’s identity unsealed anyway , as well as that of a second breached company , clothing retailer Wet Seal .
It ’s a familiar story .
Companies have never been eager to have their security slip - ups revealed to consumers .
What was different , and remarkable , this time around is that an assistant U.S. attorney argued that J.C. Penney and Wet Seal should be identified .
The lead prosecutor in the largest identity - theft hacks in U.S. history argued for disclosure .
From a motion by Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Heymann , which was unsealed Monday :
The Secret Service went to J.C. Penney with the information and evidence that its computer system , used to process payment card transactions , had been broken into .
Although the protective system used by J.C. Penney had unquestionably failed , the Secret Service had no evidence as to whether payment card numbers had been stolen .
Our presumption of public disclosure in charged criminal cases does not depend on the costly proof of evidence of negligence by the corporation , which we rarely can obtain , and then only with the full cooperation and guidance of the company .
Most people want to know when their credit or debit card numbers may have been put at risk , not simply if , and after , they have clearly been stolen .
The presumption of disclosure has an additional significant benefit , though … .
Knowing that card holders will be concerned whenever their credit or debit card information is put at risk , if they know of it , provides an incentive to companies to invest in the protections their customers would want .
Transparency makes the market work in this area .
It ’s a bit jarring to see a lucid pro-transparency , pro-security argument from a federal prosecutor .
For years , law enforcement has had an informal policy of protecting companies from the public relations consequences of their poor security — a kind of omerta among intruders , the companies they hack and the feds , where only the public is left in the dark .
To be sure , it ’s never been set in stone , and not all feds have played ball .
But it ’s a common practice , and it corrodes accountability .
It began with the first big for - profit card breach of the internet era — the 1997 case of Carlos Salgado Jr. , who was caught trying to sell 80,000 stolen credit card numbers on IRC .
The government persuaded Salgado ’s judge to permanently seal the identity of the company he hacked , in order to shield it from “ loss of business due to the perception by others that computer systems may be vulnerable . ”
That the perception would be completely accurate did n’t matter in the least .
Back then , the feds were worried that companies would stop reporting intrusions if they got bad press .
J.C. Penney raised this argument as well , warning that outing the company “ may discourage other victims of cybercrimes to report the criminal activity or cooperate with enforcement officials . ”
It takes real cajones to tell a judge that chain stores around the country are prepared to commit the federal crime of misprision if J.C.
Penney does n’t get its way .
U.S. District Judge Douglas
Woodlock shot back that he was “ astonished ” that a company would even think to not cooperate with law enforcement , and ultimately determined “ there should n’t be privacy for corporations . ”
“ It is so absurd to think that [ corporations ] are entitled to special benefits , ” he said on Friday .
California ’s 2003 breach - disclosure law , and similar laws now in effect in 45 states , have already done a lot to shatter the code of silence surrounding breaches , but that did n’t stop New Jersey federal prosecutors from initially promising J.C. Penney anonymity .
It was only when the Gonzalez case was transfered to Boston — and a new prosecutor — that the public gained an advocate in the case .
Heymann ’s successful defense of transparency suggests a sea change in law enforcement : a recognition that data breaches do n’t occur in a vacuum .
They fester under a rock , and wither and die only when flooded with sunlight .
As Heymann acknowledged in his filing ( .pdf ) , there can be valid law enforcement reasons for withholding identification of an intrusion target .
But protecting the “ dignity ” of the company is n’t one of them .
The Justice Department should adopt this prosecutor ’s position as its default in identity - theft breaches .

Using arrays of long , thin silicon wires embedded in a polymer substrate , a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) has created a new type of flexible solar cell that enhances the absorption of sunlight and efficiently converts its photons into electrons .
The solar cell does all this using only a fraction of the expensive semiconductor materials required by conventional solar cells .
" These solar cells have , for the first time , surpassed the conventional light - trapping limit for absorbing materials , " says Harry Atwater , Howard Hughes Professor , professor of applied physics and materials science , and director of Caltech 's Resnick Institute , which focuses on sustainability research .
The light - trapping limit of a material refers to how much sunlight it is able to absorb .
The silicon - wire arrays absorb up to 96 percent of incident sunlight at a single wavelength and 85 percent of total collectible sunlight .
" We 've surpassed previous optical microstructures developed to trap light , " he says .
Atwater and his colleagues -- including Nathan Lewis , the George L. Argyros Professor and professor of chemistry at Caltech , and graduate student Michael Kelzenberg -- assessed the performance of these arrays in a paper appearing in the February 14 advance online edition of the journal Nature Materials .
Atwater notes that the solar cells ' enhanced absorption is " useful absorption . "
" Many materials can absorb light quite well but not generate electricity -- like , for instance , black paint , " he explains .
" What 's most important in a solar cell is whether that absorption leads to the creation of charge carriers . "
The silicon wire arrays created by Atwater and his colleagues are able to convert between 90 and 100 percent of the photons they absorb into electrons -- in technical terms , the wires have a near - perfect internal quantum efficiency .
" High absorption plus good conversion makes for a high - quality solar cell , " says Atwater .
" It 's an important advance . "

The key to the success of these solar cells is their silicon wires , each of which , says Atwater , " is independently a high - efficiency , high - quality solar cell . "
When brought together in an array , however , they 're even more effective , because they interact to increase the cell 's ability to absorb light .
" Light comes into each wire , and a portion is absorbed and another portion scatters .
The collective scattering interactions between the wires makes the array very absorbing , " he says .
This effect occurs despite the sparseness of the wires in the array -- they cover only between 2 and 10 percent of the cell 's surface area .
" When we first considered silicon wire - array solar cells , we assumed that sunlight would be wasted on the space between wires , " explains Kelzenberg .
" So our initial plan was to grow the wires as close together as possible .
But when we started quantifying their absorption , we realized that more light could be absorbed than predicted by the wire - packing fraction alone .
By developing light - trapping techniques for relatively sparse wire arrays , not only did we achieve suitable absorption , we also demonstrated effective optical concentration -- an exciting prospect for further enhancing the efficiency of silicon - wire - array solar cells . "
Each wire measures between 30 and 100 microns in length and only 1 micron in diameter .
" The entire thickness of the array is the length of the wire , " notes Atwater .
" But in terms of area or volume , just 2 percent of it is silicon , and 98 percent is polymer . "
In other words , while these arrays have the thickness of a conventional crystalline solar cell , their volume is equivalent to that of a two - micron - thick film .
advertisement
Since the silicon material is an expensive component of a conventional solar cell , a cell that requires just one - fiftieth of the amount of this semiconductor will be much cheaper to produce .
The composite nature of these solar cells , Atwater adds , means that they are also flexible .
" Having these be complete flexible sheets of material ends up being important , " he says , " because flexible thin films can be manufactured in a roll - to - roll process , an inherently lower - cost process than one that involves brittle wafers , like those used to make conventional solar cells . "
Atwater , Lewis , and their colleagues had earlier demonstrated that it was possible to create these innovative solar cells .
" They were visually striking , " says Atwater .
" But it was n't until now that we could show that they are both highly efficient at carrier collection and highly absorbing . "
The next steps , Atwater says , are to increase the operating voltage and the overall size of the solar cell .
" The structures we 've made are square centimeters in size , " he explains .
" We 're now scaling up to make cells that will be hundreds of square centimeters -- the size of a normal cell . "
Atwater says that the team is already " on its way " to showing that large - area cells work just as well as these smaller versions .
Their research was supported by BP and the Energy Frontier Research Center program of the Department of Energy , and made use of facilities supported by the Center for Science and Engineering of Materials , a National Science Foundation Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at Caltech .
In addition , Boettcher received fellowship support from the Kavli Neuroscience Institute at Caltech .

Blake was one of four defendants charged over a robbery at Heathrow airport in 2004 .
The sources pointed out that Blake 's bail application had been opposed by the prosecution on the grounds that he might abscond and because of the serious nature of the offences .
Suspicions were first raised when Blake did not appear in the dock after the lunch break on Wednesday .
When he failed to show up again yesterday morning it became clear he might not be returning .
Detective superintendent Stuart Cundy , of the Flying Squad , said yesterday that an all ports alert had been issued and police were actively hunting Blake , 57 , whom he described as dangerous .
" We would ask members of the public not to approach Peter Blake , but if they do see him to call 999 immediately , " said Cundy .
The raid for which Blake is standing trial took place in February 2004 when six men arrived at a Heathrow warehouse in the back of a security van .
They were wearing identical masks , black woolly hats and fluorescent jackets and had been tipped off by an insider to the arrival of a huge haul of foreign currency from Austria .
Sixteen members of staff were tied up as the armed gang raided the vault before fleeing the airport site in what has been described as a ' professionally planned and professionally executed ' inside job .
The crown alleges that Blake fired at one of the warehousemen , David Westwood , and then struggled with him , discharging his handgun again .
The prosecution case is that Blake 's DNA was found on a balaclava and mask which was pulled from one of the robbers ' heads .
Blake states that he was at his terminally ill mother 's home on the night of the raid , later visiting his sister to give her a birthday card .
He states his DNA matched that on the clothing because he was approached to join the gang during a meeting at the home of Chris McCormack , a known enforcer for the north London criminal gang , the Adams family .
Too scared to upset McCormack he said he tried the outfits on during the meeting .
' There was a bag of hats , masks and reflective coats , " he has told the court .
" I tried the clothing on because he [ McCormack ] told us to .
I was thinking ' Jesus Christ what have I got myself in to ' .
I did n't want to lose face . "
Blake 's departure from court 35 of the high court is the latest in a string of costly setbacks to hit the investigation and prosecution of those responsible for an audacious , professional armed raid .
The ongoing saga has included the use of a supergrass insider , the acquittal by jury of one team of suspected robbers , a key defendant suffering a heart attack at Belmarsh prison , a hung jury , repeated whispers from police and prosecution sources of jury tampering , and a criminal judge admitting that the case had left him devastated .
In the meantime no one – except the supergrass who pleaded guilty – has ever been convicted for the robbery at the John Menzies warehouse , the costs have soared to tens of millions of pounds , and the historic judge - only trial was granted by the court of appeal which ruled there was a serious risk of interference with any future jury .
At the opening last month Blake , who has previous convictions known to the court for armed robbery , and his co-defendants were all on conditional bail having put up sureties worth tens of thousands of pounds .
On the first day they were pictured outside the high court , free to come and go during the proceedings having handed over their passports to the authorities as part of their bail conditions .
Blake , who lives in Notting Hill , west London , was only arrested in July 2005 – after the first criminal trial at the Old Bailey had failed to convict anyone of the heist .
The jury - less trial is continuing in Blake 's absence .
Two protesters were arrested Saturday in Nashua , New Hampshire at a marijuana rally ( click here for original story ) .
According to news reports out of New Hampshire , about 50 people gathered in downtown Nashua at 4:20 p.m. for a public protest against marijuana prohibition .
However , not all of the protesters were legit ; some of them were undercover NARCS .
One of the protesters was arrested by the cops for simple marijuana possession .
When the police put the suspect in the back of a patrol car , another protester laid down in front of the patrol car so it could n’t leave !
He was also arrested ( disorderly conduct ) .
After the second man was arrested , the crowd became unruly .
“ It was pretty calm at first when the two undercover agents arrested this man , it was n’t until they got out of the car and called for backup that everyone came in , ” said one protester , Sam Dodson .
After more officers arrived as backup , the protestors decided to march all the way to the police station .
After an unspecified amount of time , they disbursed .
I remember when I was a teenager I participated in a pro-marijuana rally in Salem , Oregon with some of my classmates .
We had heard from some old schoolers in Eugene that every year , on the State Capital steps in Salem at 4:20 p.m. , people gathered to smoke pot in public and hold a ‘ peaceful protest . ’
I was totally skeptical until I got there , and saw about 300 people smoking down on the capitol steps in plain view of dozens of state police officers .
It was crazy , because the cops did n’t even do anything !
I was later told that a guy applied for a ‘ peaceful protest permit , ’ decades ago , and that as long as he renewed his permit the event was allowed to go on .
As long as the protesters were peaceful , and only consumed marijuana in the designated area on the capitol steps , there would be no arrests from 4:15 p.m. to 4:45 p.m.
I went from 1998 to 2002 , and had such a great time .
However , I went this last year to see if it was still going on , and there were only state police there ( no protestors ) .
I got the balls up to ask one of the cops what the deal was and he told me that the original permit was not renewed .
So sad !
Could you imagine if rallies like the one I attended , and the one in New Hampshire , were held regularly across the nation , multiple times a week ?
A lot of martyrs would get arrested , but I ’d imagine the attention would result in a constructive conversation about marijuana prohibition at the federal level !

IF THE United States is going to curb its greenhouse gas emissions , it desperately needs a replacement for the high - carbon coal that fuels almost half the nation ’s electricity .
Unfortunately , there are downsides to all the alternatives , from nuclear power , which carries a high cost and emits toxic waste with no place to store it , to wind turbines , which also have a high cost and require extensive transmission lines to link windy areas with cities .
Now new deposits of natural gas previously locked in shale formations are making that fuel look like a possible transition to a low - carbon future .
Federal and state regulators have to ensure , however , that the rush to exploit this new source of gas does not cause severe environmental damage .
The US Environmental Protection Agency could have been an effective referee over this process .
Yet the gas industry managed to slip into the 2005 energy bill an exemption from EPA review of the special drilling that shale formations require .
Congress should repeal that provision .
Natural gas emits half the carbon dioxide of coal , per unit of energy .
Until recently , limited supplies of gas kept its price relatively high .
But in the past decade gas drillers have learned to tap into deposits of shale gas that are abundant in areas ranging from New York to Texas .
Back in 1990 , gas from “ unconventional ’’ sources like shale made up just 10 percent of total US production .
Today it ’s 40 percent and rising rapidly , with shale gas leading the way .
Proven reserves have expanded so dramatically that the United States is now estimated to have at least a 90 - year supply of the fuel .
The catch is to ensure that producing the gas from shale does not pollute water supplies , either at the surface or underground .
To free the gas from the rock , drillers blast it with a mixture of water , sand , and toxic chemicals .
The industry says this hydraulic fracturing or “ fracking ’’ occurs at levels too far underground to affect aquifers , but critics say that the drilling process itself and surface discharges have contaminated many water supplies .
There is also concern that drilling equipment can introduce harmful invasive species to new bodies of water .
Increasingly , gas producers will be fracking in populated states like Pennsylvania and New York .
Residents of those states should be able to rely on the EPA and not just state regulators to ensure that their wells and reservoirs are not poisoned by the new drilling operations - however beneficial they are to the nation ’s effort to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions .

Theirs was a whirlwind New York City Christmas , but while true love is timeless , vacations are not .
Sadly , it came time for one of the lovebirds to fly home to California , and the other , Haisong Jiang — love - struck as if Cupid hit him not with an arrow , but with a two - by - four to the head — saw his beloved to the security line at Newark Liberty International Airport .
One thing led to another , and they kissed .
And whatever else that kiss sealed , it certainly included his fate : to ladle out meals at some soup kitchen to be determined as a way toward working off 100 hours of community service for his crime that afternoon in January .
“ At that moment , I ’m very excited with my girlfriend , and I did n’t think too much , ” Mr. Jiang , 28 , said Tuesday in his first interview since causing the six - hour shutdown at the airport and the five - day manhunt that followed .
“ I did n’t mean to cause trouble at the airport . ”
Mr. Jiang walked past a Terminal C exit on Jan. 3 to see his girlfriend to her departure gate , prompting an evacuation of the terminal on one of its busiest days .
About 200 flights were delayed or canceled , and thousands of passengers had to be screened all over again as officials looked for a suspect who was not only oblivious , but also long gone .

Ada Lovelace met Charles Babbage in 1833 .
Ada Lovelace has emerged as the most popular role model in a day dedicated to celebrating women working in the fields of science and technology .
So far , 2,239 people around the world have posted blogs , videos and podcasts online nominating their heroines .
Additionally , events were held in London , Copenhagen , Dresden , Montreal and Brazil to mark the day , named after Ada Lovelace , held on 24 March .
Ada Lovelace worked with mathematician Charles Babbage in the 1800s .
Mr Babbage 's invention , the Analytical Engine , formed the basis of modern computing .
Ada Lovelace is therefore credited with writing the world 's first computer program when she came up with a way of using the machine , which was never actually built , to calculate a mathematical sequence known as Bernoulli numbers .
Other nominees included scientist Marie Curie , mathematician - turned - actress Hedy Lamarr , programmer Grace Hopper and Lisbeth Salander , fictional creation of the late author Stieg Larsson .
Wonder women
" For years I 've worked in technology , and every time you see a list of the top people in tech , it 's dominated by men , " said Suw Charman - Anderson , who created Ada Lovelace Day in 2009 and runs the annual event .
" There 's always a discussion about where the women in technology are .
I thought , I know loads of women in technology .
Why are we asking where they are ? "
Ms Charman - Anderson invited people to nominate any woman in technology who had been a positive influence or inspiration - including teachers , parents and lecturers .
She chose broadcaster Maggie Philbin as her own role model , having watched her present BBC science programme Tomorrow 's World during her teenage years .
" Here was a woman who looked very cool and talked about technology articulately - technology was second nature to her , " she told BBC News .
" This was someone who understood what was going on and could communicate very clearly . "
Having a role model is important , it means you do n't question whether you can do something because you can see another woman doing it already
Suw Charman - Anderson
Ms Charman - Anderson was one of only two girls in her school year to study maths , physics and chemistry at A - level and now works as a social media consultant .
" Having a role model is important , it means you do n't question whether you can do something because you can see another woman doing it already , " she said .
Early inspiration Maggie Philbin told BBC
News she was flattered by the nomination , although she had not considered herself to be a role model at the time .
" When I watched Tomorrow 's World in the 60s and early 70s , it was just blokes .
It was fabulous to watch , but at that stage I never imagined that it would have anything to do with me , " she said .
" Look at the archives from the 60s - there are so many references to secretaries .
That 's what I , as a 10 - year - old , was consuming . "
Ms Philbin 's interest in science was sparked because of an early , and unrealised , ambition to become a vet , she added .
She now credits social media such as Twitter for introducing her to inspirational women such as Ms Charman - Anderson and Dr Sue Black , who orchestrated a social media campaign to save World War II code - breaking centre Bletchley Park .
" These are my role models and technology heroines - they are using technology in a really ambitious and positive way .
I 'm learning a huge amount from them , " she said .

SQL Server Impersonation
By Deanna Dicken
SQL Server impersonation , or context switching , is a means to allow the executing user to assume the permissions of a given user or login until the context is set back , set to yet another user , or the session is ended .
Deanna Dicken shows you two mechanisms for accomplishing this task and walks through some examples .
Introduction
SQL Server impersonation , or context switching , is a means to allow the executing user to assume the permissions of a given user or login until the context is set back , set to yet another user , or the session is ended .
In the following sections we will discuss two mechanisms for accomplishing this task and walk through some examples .
SETUSER
If you have cause to require context switching in SQL Server 2000 , you have but one choice : SETUSER .
Execution of this statement with a provided username temporarily sets the execution permissions to that of the supplied account .
Multiple calls can be made and the context will continue to switch until reverted back to the original context by calling SETUSER without a username .
Permissions
Contrary to Books Online , an account wishing to call SETUSER must have the sysadmin server role .
Books
Online mistakenly states users with dbo rights can also utilize this statement , however this does not work .
Examples
The following example shows context being switched from the logged in account , adminacct in this case , to a specific SQL login , to another SQL user , and back again .
Notice how the context reverts to the logged in account with the first execution of SETUSER without a username .
SETUSER ' jdoe ' SELECT SUSER_SNAME ( ) SETUSER ' jschmoe ' SELECT SUSER_SNAME ( ) SETUSER SELECT SUSER_SNAME ( )
Results :
----------------------- jdoe ( 1 row (s ) affected )
----------------------- jschmoe ( 1 row (s ) affected )
----------------------- adminacct ( 1 row (s ) affected )
It s important to note that in the above example jdoe must have the sysadmin role for the SETUSER jschmoe command to complete successfully .
If jdoe does not have sysadmin , the following error is thrown .
Msg 15157 , Level 16 , State 1 , Line 3
Setuser failed because of one of the following reasons : the database principal ' jschmoe ' does not exist , its corresponding server principal does not have server access , this type of database principal cannot be impersonated , or you do not have permission .
SETUSER has an optional directive WITH NORESET , which can be used with the above example to cause the impersonation to not revert to the sysadmin that kicked it off .
So again , logged in as adminacct , we kick off the following .
SETUSER ' jdoe ' WITH NORESET SELECT SUSER_SNAME ( ) SETUSER ' jschmoe ' SELECT SUSER_SNAME ( ) SETUSER SELECT SUSER_SNAME ( )
Results :
----------------------- jdoe ( 1 row (s ) affected )
----------------------- jschmoe ( 1 row (s ) affected )
-----------------------
jdoe
The results show that the context did not revert to the original account , but did revert to the previous context jdoe even though that account also has sysadmin .
To revert the context all the way back to the adminacct , the session will have to be closed and a new one opened .
EXECUTE AS
Starting with SQL Server 2005 , the EXECUTE AS statement has taken the place of SETUSER for context switching .
SETUSER is deprecated and should not be used in SQL Server 2005 or later .
There are two incarnations of EXECUTE AS , EXECUTE AS LOGIN and EXECUTE AS USER .
The former allows the calling account to take on the server level permissions of the login such as securityadmin .
The latter , provides access to the database level permissions of the passed in username .
To end the impersonation , the REVERT statement can be issued or the session terminated .
EXECUTE AS LOGIN
Should you have a particular need to impersonate a login and require its server level permissions , you will need to use the EXECUTE AS LOGIN .
In the following example , assume we are logged in as adminacct , which has the sysadmin role .
We have a list of requests for new logins to be created in one of the companys many databases .
Because of some auditing procedures we have in place , we need to use a particular login , securacct , which has the securityadmin server role .
Rather than hunting down the password and logging in as this account , we can just execute our stored procedure to create these logins as securacct .
EXECUTE AS LOGIN = ' securacct ' EXEC spCreateNewLogin ' jdoe ' REVERT
EXECUTE AS USER
If your needs are contained to the permissions at the database level , EXECUTE AS USER will do just fine .
An example of this is a system account that logs into the database , but needs to impersonate the user that actually kicked of the transaction in the front - end application .
The context of the transaction can be switched to the executing users username .
In this case , the system account need only have dbo rights in the database .
Say the system account that s logging in on behalf of the user is MyDomain \AppAcct .
The SQL username of the user that initiated the transaction is jdoe .
The system account logs into the SQL Server database and issues the following :
EXECUTE AS USER = ' jdoe ' EXEC spSaveOrderItem ' B123 ' , 1 , '9484844 ' REVERT
Issuing the REVERT statement at the end of the transaction allows the context to switch back to the system account in this case .
In the case of connection pooling , this would ensure that the session opened by the system account is consistently impersonating the application user and then switching back to itself for the user whose transaction is next in line for that session .
As with SETUSER , it is possible to constrain the impersonation to prevent it from returning the context to the original account .
To do this with EXECUTE AS , add WITH NO REVERT to the end of the statement as below .
The REVERT at the end has no effect on the context .
EXECUTE AS LOGIN = ' jdoe '
WITH NO REVERT EXEC sp_SaveOrderItem ' B123 ' , 1 , '9484844 ' REVERT
Permissions
Whereas SETUSER required sysadmin permissions , EXECUTE AS USER requires just dbo permissions to execute the statement .
EXECUTE AS LOGIN requires the sysadmin server role since the permissions you wish to impersonate are at the server level .
An alternative to granting these roles to UserA who has a legitimate reason to impersonate UserB is to have UserB explicitly grant impersonation rights to UserA .
GRANT IMPERSONATE ON USER :: UserB TO UserA
Now UserA can use EXECUTE AS USER =  UserB  before his statements without being granted the dbo database role .
Similarly , this can be done for a login if server level permissions are needed .
In this example , LoginD is going on vacation and temporarily needs to grant LoginC his abilities as a securityadmin without divulging his password .
When he returns from vacation , he can simply execute a REVOKE to remove the impersonate permission .
GRANT IMPERSONATE ON LOGIN :: LoginD TO LoginC
Impersonation across Linked Servers
Impersonation can get a little tricky when the task at hand crosses SQL Server linked servers .
If impersonation is being handled using SETUSER , a call that crosses linked servers will fail .
The context needs to be reverted to the original user prior to crossing servers .
With the introduction of EXECUTE AS , crossing link servers as an impersonated user or login becomes a possibility .
To make this happen , the principle ( user\login ) needs to be recognized on the linked server .
Additionally , the linked servers need to be trustworthy .
To make the databases trustworthy , you will need to set their TRUSTWORTHY property to TRUE by issuing an ALTER DATABASE command such as this :
ALTER DATABASE mydatabase SET TRUSTWORTHY ON
Conclusion
When working in SQL Server 2000 , SETUSER is your option for implementing impersonation ( or context switching ) .
Be aware of the elevated rights needed by the account executing SETUSER and the security risk involved .
It s also important to note the limitation on linked server usage .
SQL Server 2005 and above offer a better context switching method in EXECUTE AS .
Understanding the requirements for impersonation will help determine if the impersonation is at the server level ( the login ) or the database level ( the user ) .
If the impersonation is one off , consider the use of GRANT IMPERSONATE instead of elevating privileges for the logged in account .

Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) was on CNN ’s Larry King Live last night , and he pulled no punches when the discussion turned to Dick Cheney ’s recent criticisms of Obama ’s national security policy .
Paul said , “ Well , I think he had his eight years and he ’s caused a lot of trouble for our country and he perpetuated a war in Iraq that was unnecessary and wrong - headed . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :

When host Larry King asked Paul for his thoughts on Cheney ’s complaints , Paul answered , “ Well , I think he had his eight years and he ’s caused a lot of trouble for our country and he perpetuated a war in Iraq that was unnecessary and wrong - headed .
So I would say that it would be best he not be so critical right now .
But I ’m still not only critical of that policy —
I think the policy remains the same and we ’ve hear it on the show tonight already .
Paul continued , “ They , they are going to attack us and they ’ve declared war against us .
And it ’s always they and them .
But , but who are they ?
You know , after 9/11 , 14 or 15 of the terrorists came from Saudi Arabia .
I mean we did n’t attack Saudi Arabia , we attacked Iraq .
So it , it does n’t make sense . ”
Ron Paul and Barack Obama are n’t going to agree on much , but the one thing that do agree on is the misguided foolishness of the neo-cons on the terrorism issue .
More than anything else it was the Bush administration and the war in Iraq that motivated Paul to run for president again .
He openly hates the way his party has abandoned its conservative foreign policy roots .
Obama ’s handling of the terrorism issue , and the president ’s willingness to look beyond the black and white , good guy / bad guy mode of thinking is more in line Rep .
Paul ’s own position on the issue , so it is n’t a surprise that Paul lashed out at Dick Cheney , because in his mind , Cheney and Bush took the GOP down a ruinous , which most of the Republican is still clinging on to .
Foreign and Commonwealth Office sources last night confirmed that five British sailors have been detained by the Iranian Navy while sailing a yacht from Bahrain to Dubai .
The sailors were delivering the Kingdom of Bahrain to Dubai , where it was due to take part in an international race .
It is thought the yacht was stopped by an Iranian gunboat and boarded last Wednesday , but the FCO issued a statement about the incident only last night , and admitted the boat may have strayed into Iranian territorial waters .
It is believed that the FCO had wanted to keep the matter " private " in order to increase the chance of a resolution .
It is understood that negotiations have also been ongoing between Iran and Bahrain , which was a joint partner in the yacht project with the British businessman Andrew Pindar .
The five being held in Iran were last night named as Oliver Smith , 31 , from Southampton , Oliver Young from Plymouth , Sam Usher , Luke Porter and Dave Bloomer .
The first four are all yachtsmen in their mid-20s to early 30s .
Mr Bloomer is a Sports DJ for Radio Bahrain , believed to be in his mid-50s .

The crew members are still in Iran , but all are understood to be safe and well .
Last night the Foreign Secretary , David Miliband , said : " FCO [ Foreign and Commonwealth Office ] officials immediately contacted the Iranian authorities in London and in Tehran on the evening of 25 November , both to seek clarification and to try and resolve the matter swiftly .
Our ambassador in Tehran has raised the issue with the Iranian Foreign Ministry and we have discussed the matter with the Iranian embassy in London .
I hope this issue will soon be resolved .
We will remain in close touch with the Iranian authorities , as well as the [ sailors ' ] families . "
An FCO spokesperson confirmed the sailors were from Team Pindar , an independent sailing team which had been due to arrive in Dubai on Thursday for the start of the Dubai - Muscat Offshore Sailing Race .
The spokesperson said that negotiations had been made more difficult owing to the Muslim festival of Eid ul - Adha , but that they were hoping things would proceed more swiftly now it was over .
Iranian authorities have said they will make a statement on the detained yachtsmen today .
The race began on Thursday , passing through the shallows of the Arabian Gulf , into the deep waters of the Indian Ocean via the Straits of Hormuz , before finishing two days later in the Bandar Al - Rawdah marina of the Oman capital Muscat .
The most experienced sailor on board , Oliver Smith , completed a degree in Ocean Science and Marine Navigation at the University of Plymouth whilst sailing on the University Mens ' 1st Team .
He had also spent six months skippering a 50ft survey yacht and doing delivery work in South America and the Caribbean .
Mr Smith 's father told the thisisplymouth website : " We 're confident this will be resolved very quickly .
We 're all concerned and the sooner they are released the better .
It is dragging along longer than we thought it would do . "
The yacht was due to be skippered by Nick Crabtree , an experienced offshore sailor and Team Director of Sail Bahrain , who was not on board when the boat was stopped .
According to the Team Pindar website , Bahraini national Sami Kooheji , Captain Peter Gronberg , the managing director of a local shipping company , and two Omani sailors were to crew the yacht for the race .
Team Pindar is owned and named after Andrew Pindar , a Yorkshire businessman who has been supported several British yachting ventures for more than a decade .
He sponsored Emma Richards MBE , a British yachtswoman who in 2002 - 2003 became the first British woman and youngest person to complete the Around Alone , a 29,000 mile , single - handed round - the - world yacht race with stops .
Mr Pindar had recently bought the 60ft Kingdom of Bahrain , and another Volvo 60 racing yacht in Bahrain , in order to support sailing as a way of expanding the sporting interests of the country .
His printing company based in Scarborough has commercial links in Bahrain , including printing the state 's national examination papers .
The detained boat was first launched in 2001 , when it took part in the Volvo Ocean Race as part of Team News Corp .
The incident has drawn comparisons with an incident in March 2007 when Iranian authorities captured 15 British service personnel in the same body of water .
They were held hostage for 13 days with footage of them broadcast on Iranian television .
The Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinehjad eventually agreed to pardon them .
Since then , relations between the UK and Iran have become strained further when the UK raised concern over Iran 's disputed presidential elections earlier this year and after the Islamic republic announced on Sunday its intention to build 10 further nuclear enrichment plants , to widespread international condemnation .
In the four years since it swept Palestinian parliamentary elections , Hamas has neither moderated its policies nor adopted democratic principles .
Constantly torn between its ideology as an Islamist jihadi movement and its responsibilities as a governing authority in the Gaza Strip , Hamas has proven unwilling to transform itself .
The result has been an ongoing ideological and political crisis for Hamas and , more generally , the Palestinian Authority .
Last October , Hamas was faced with the challenge of new elections mandated by Palestinian law and set for January by the Palestinian Authority president , Mahmoud Abbas , whose Fatah faction is Hamas ’ chief rival .
Hamas ’ reaction was to ban any voting from taking place in Gaza .
Consequently , Abbas postponed the elections indefinitely , sparking heated debate with Hamas over the legitimacy of his continued tenure as president .
Soon after Hamas ’ 2006 electoral victory , I identified some conditions necessary for co-opting ideologically extreme and violent political movements ( “ Can Hamas Be Tamed ? ” March / April 2006 ) .
I argued that Hamas was unlikely to become more moderate in the foreseeable future , primarily because there was neither a strong Palestinian government nor a viable political center capable of containing and co-opting the group .
Unfortunately , this has proven to be true -- and it remains so today .
After winning the 2006 election , Hamas immediately began grappling with various conflicting pressures .
The Israeli government , which evacuated its citizens and military from Gaza in 2005 , reacted strongly -- militarily , economically , and diplomatically -- to the continued firing of rockets from Gaza into southern Israel , first by factions other than Hamas and later by Hamas itself .
Meanwhile , immediately after Hamas ’ electoral victory , the Quartet ( the United States , the European Union , the United Nations , and Russia ) demanded that Hamas , in order to gain international legitimacy , commit to nonviolence , recognize Israel , and accept previous agreements signed between Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
All the while , Hamas felt a domestic imperative to secure Palestinian national unity .
In the face of these pressures , it consistently tried to govern without moderating its ideology .
It remained dedicated to “ resistance ” and to Israel ’s destruction -- and therefore opposed to any concept of a real peace process .
When forced to make hard choices , Hamas has been repeatedly pulled down by the weight of its dogma .
In early 2007 , in an attempt to halt escalating intra-Palestinian bloodshed and secure international aid , Hamas agreed to share power with Fatah in a national unity government .
But Hamas adamantly refused to include in the government ’s platform any acceptance of the Quartet 's conditions or of the 2002 Arab peace initiative , which proposed that Arab states normalize relations with Israel following a comprehensive settlement of Arab - Israeli issues .
By June 2007 , the national unity government had collapsed .
Under the initiative of its more radical military wing , Hamas forcibly overran Gaza and brutally established its rule , in many cases throwing Fatah members from rooftops or shooting them in the knees .
Thus , despite the expectations of some who encouraged Hamas ’ participation in politics , political inclusion did not contain or domesticate the group .
Rather , Hamas resisted domestication until finally bursting out and forming an independent political entity .
The violent end of the unity government split the Palestinian territories into two entities -- one in the West Bank , one in the Gaza Strip -- with vastly different governments and political climates .
In the West Bank , Abbas and Salam Fayyad , the Palestinian Authority prime minister , embarked on an overdue and unprecedented reform process , which included clamping down on Hamas grassroots groups through widespread arrests , the discharging of radical preachers from mosques , and the seizure of Hamas funds .
The reform effort has brought improved security and impressive economic growth to the West Bank .
In Gaza , by contrast , Hamas focused on being the flag - bearer for Islamists in the Middle East .
This attitude led the group to cast aside practical realities in favor of pursuing ideological goals .
In addition to forcing itself on local clans and usurping traditional power bases , Hamas initiated a gradual yet determined process of Islamization in all spheres of life .
These included legislation and the courts ; the education system ; the media ; and social life , as the group , in accordance with its Islamic code of conduct , demanded " modest " dress for women , banned mixed - gender social events , closed or monitored Internet cafés , and even condemned chewing gum because it “ arouses the passion of the youth . "
Hamas ’ Islamization has also meant the systematic persecution of Gaza ’s Christians .
As Abbas recently put it , Hamas ’ policies turned Gaza into " an emirate of darkness . "
Despite this record , debate still persisted among Western commentators over whether Hamas was becoming moderate .
This was because Hamas performed some window dressing to maintain its domestic legitimacy and garner international approval .
Over the last two years , it has been conducting intermittent national unity talks with Fatah ( to no avail ) .
It also reached out to the West , suggesting a dialogue with Western governments .
And some Hamas leaders occasionally expressed willingness to accept a long - term cease - fire with Israel if a Palestinian state were established along the 1967 borders .
Hamas assumed these seemingly moderate postures as a way to address political pressures without reforming its ideology : there has been no evidence that Hamas leaders are reconsidering their core beliefs -- only that they are , at most , debating which tactics best serve those beliefs .
After Israel ’s pullout from Gaza , one of Hamas ’ main tactics was to allow , and later orchestrate , the regular firing of rockets from Gaza into nearby Israeli towns .
Eventually , in December 2008 , this rocket fire provoked Israel to launch Operation Cast Lead , a massive military operation in Gaza .
It dealt a crippling blow to Hamas and deterred further rocket fire : whereas 7,000 rockets and mortar shells were fired into Israel in the three years before the operation , only about 300 were fired in the 12 months following January 2009 , as Hamas has enforced a near - total cease - fire since Operation Cast Lead ended that month .
At the same time , however , Hamas has been rearming , especially with long - range rockets , despite enhanced Egyptian efforts to curb the smuggling of weapons through tunnels under the Egypt - Gaza border .
Hamas is helped in this smuggling effort by Iran .
In October 2009 , Hamas test - fired an Iranian - manufactured rocket capable of hitting Israel ’s largest city , Tel Aviv .
This history and the fact that the group seems to be ignoring strong pressures to reform -- including rising domestic unpopularity and an unprecedented crisis in relations with Egypt -- suggest that Hamas cannot be part of an Israeli - Palestinian peace process based on recognizing Israel and making historic compromises , nor part of a Palestinian body politic based on democracy and free elections .
Reaching a temporary cease - fire with Israel and claiming willingness to accept a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders is no true sign of moderation when Hamas is simultaneously building its arsenal and treating terrorism as a tactical tool .
" Hamas will never give up the option of resistance , " the Hamas political chief Khaled Mashal stated at a rally last month , " no matter how long it takes . "
Hamas ’ seemingly moderate political statements are always accompanied by forbidding conditions -- for example , that in exchange for only a cease - fire on Hamas ’ part ( not the recognition of Israel ) , Israel would have to withdraw to the 1967 lines and accept all Palestinian refugees .
Likewise , participating in the 2006 elections and flirting with national unity arrangements is not proof that Hamas has accepted the rules of democracy .
The real test of a ruling party is if it agrees to a second round of elections , even if it might lose .
Hamas failed that test recently when it undermined the scheduled Palestinian presidential and parliamentary elections .
The sad conclusion is that Hamas presents one of those policy problems that are only manageable , not solvable .
No force in Palestinian politics today has the power to break Hamas ’ ideological basis or grip on power in Gaza .
For internal pressure to be effective -- that is , for it to move Hamas to become more moderate , relinquish violence , endorse the peace process , and embrace democratic practices -- it would have to be coupled with solid , sustained external pressure .
If international powers , led by the United States and the other members of the Quartet , grant Hamas a free pass , the group will continue to play the spoiler , threaten Abbas and other moderates in the West Bank , and serve Iranian interests .
No matter what , changing Hamas will be a long - term journey , like any process of co-optation .
The challenge is to manage it in a way that mitigates the impact on innocent Palestinians , minimizes the risk of all - out escalation , and leaves room for a viable peace process .
These imperatives , in turn , underscore the urgency of relaunching the peace process under a supportive Arab umbrella that , based on shared concerns over Iran ’s bellicosity , would foster moderation and stability in the face of extremism .
But the policy conundrum remains :
Will the peace process progress with Hamas , or in spite of it ?
Unless Hamas unexpectedly changes course , the group will exclude itself from the process .
That would be for the better .
The challenge for policymakers in Washington , Europe , Jerusalem , and Ramallah then becomes how to deny Hamas the capacity to play the spoiler .
The timing could n’t be worse .
After reporting its first ever annual loss last year , Toyota announced Tuesday that it will suspend US sales and manufacturing of eight Toyota models to fix faulty gas pedals .
The unprecedented move comes days after the unveiling of a Toyota recall list of 2.3 million vehicles .
The decision may have serious consequences for Toyota .
It lost $ 7.1 billion last year , and the Tuesday announcement will hamper its ability to return to profitability through increased sales , as well as potentially dent its reputation as a producer of reliable vehicles .
“ It ’s a humbling experience for them , ” says Jeff Bartlett , Deputy Editor Online for Consumer Reports .
“ For them to stumble is a bit of a blow to their consumer image and their standing in the industry . ”
Toyota said it will halt production of eight models at six North American assembly plants for the week of Feb .
1 . The models represented 57 percent of Toyota ’s 2009 US sales , according to the Wall Street Journal .
They also represent some of America ’s best - selling models , including the Camry and Corolla .
Which cars have the problem ?
The models that will be recalled or subject to a sales suspension include :
• RAV4 ( 2009 - 10 models )
• Corolla ( 2009 - 10 )
• Camry ( 2007 - 10 )
• Matrix hatchback ( 2009 - 10 )
• Avalon large sedan ( 2005 - 10 )
• Highlander crossover ( 2010 )
• Tundra pickup ( 2007 - 10 )
• Sequoia large SUV ( 2008 - 10 )
The suspension is due to problems with gas pedal mechanisms that may cause the accelerator to get stuck , triggering sudden acceleration .
The problem has been traced to a US parts supplier .
The parts from that manufacturer are used in Toyotas sold in the US and Europe .
Toyota is considering a recall of 2 million cars in Europe , as well .
Similar sticking accelerator problems have arisen in the past , driving the car company to recall 4.2 million vehicles in November , and another 2.3 million last week .
So far , Toyota has been unable to correct the problem .
How to drive if the gas pedal sticks
Mr. Bartlett offers several recommendations for owners of affected vehicles .
First , he says , “ The key is to be aware of what to look for .
We know that this is a progressive problem , one that gets worse over time , so be mindful if your pedal begins to stick . ”
Barlett says Consumer Reports has done extensive testing on how to regain control of vehicles experiencing sudden acceleration .
Drivers who experience sudden acceleration should put the transmission into neutral , he says .
They should not pump the brakes .
“ If you put it into neutral , you will retain full steering and full braking capability .
This will save your life . ”
As Toyota works to fix the problem , it must also address the issue of its image .
These setbacks will threaten the carmaker ’s reputation for quality and safety .
Bartlett says Toyota is handling the problem well .
“ They seem to be handling this in a Toyota manner , looking at the long - term , ” says Bartlett .
Consumer Reports does an annual nationwide survey on brand perception , he adds , and Toyota has always led by a very significant margin .
“ They did even better this year , ” he says , “ just months after the acceleration issues came into light [ last August ] .
For Toyota , that ’s a promising indicator that if they ’re acting with transparency , earnestness , and swiftness , that they may weather this storm as good as can be expected . ”

The European Commission said that the measures it applied to internet technology are needed throughout the economy and society to protect Europeans ’ privacy and personal data .
The European Commission warned that data protection rules must be updated to keep abreast of technological change to ensure the right to privacy , legal certainty for industry , and the take - up of new technologies .
EU rules say that a person ’s information can only be used on legitimate grounds , with their prior consent .
With the Lisbon Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights now in force , the Commission said it wants to create a clear , modern set of rules for the whole EU guaranteeing a high level of personal data protection and privacy , starting with a reform of the 1995 EU Data Protection Directive .
The announcement is a kind of answer to the statement of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg , according to which the concept of privacy has become an anachronism .
“ People have really gotten comfortable not only sharing more information and different kinds , but more openly and with more people .
That social norm is just something that has evolved over time ! ” – Zuckerberg said .
“ EU rules are there to protect everyone ’s personal data .
The European Commission has proved its commitment to making these rules fully respected by all 27 EU countries .
Innovation is important in today ’s society but should not go at the expense of people ’s fundamental right to privacy .
Now we have to make sure that the general data protection rules are up - to - date with technology and as comprehensive the Lisbon Treaty requires , ” said Viviane Reding , the EU ’s Information Society and Media Commissioner .
“ EU rules should allow everyone to realise their right to know when their personal data can be lawfully processed , in any area of life , whether boarding a plane , opening a bank account or surfing the internet , and to say no to it whenever they want . ”
Viviane Reding replied that the necessary rules for the modern Privacy Policy on the site like MySpace , Twitter and Facebook .
The improved rules would be vigorously applied across all policy areas and international agreements , be it new technologies , consumer rights or public security .
According to her , the future on Social Services will be profiles on Social Services have to be invisible , unless they are single user decides to make public .

Advertisement Sri Lanka has angrily rejected UN claims that footage which apparently shows extra-judicial killings by Sri Lankan troops is genuine .
The government described a UN inquiry into the video's authenticity as " highly subjective and biased " .
It says the footage was " fabricated " .
UN human rights investigator Philip Alston earlier said three independent experts confirmed it was authentic .
The video shows a man dressed as a soldier shooting a man in the head .
The footage was allegedly filmed in January during the final stages of Sri Lanka 's bloody war with Tamil Tiger rebels .
After a man in army uniform shoots a naked , bound and blindfolded man in the back of the head , the video shows the bodies of eight others in a field nearby .
Mr Alston has called for a war crimes investigation .
' Crusade '
" We do n't accept his conclusions and we believe his conclusions are highly subjective and biased , " Human Rights Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said of Mr Alston 's investigations into the footage .
Sri Lankan troops defeated the Tamil Tigers in May " We believe he is on a crusade of his own to force a war crime inquiry against Sri Lanka . "
Mr Samarasinghe said the government 's own investigation into the footage revealed that it was riddled with " discrepancies and shortcomings " .
Mr Alston said that three independent experts had confirmed the video was authentic .
" The conclusion clearly is that the video is authentic , " he said on Thursday .
He named the three investigators as Peter Diaczuk , an expert in firearms evidence , Daniel Spitz , a prominent forensic pathologist , and Jeff Spivack , an expert in forensic video analysis .
At the same time he noted that there were " a small number of characteristics of the video which the experts were unable to explain " .
" Each of these characteristics can , however , be explained in a manner entirely consistent with the conclusion that the videotape appears to be authentic , " he added .
The UN official called on the Sri Lankan government to hold an independent inquiry into possible war crimes committed by both sides of the conflict .
The video was provided to the BBC and other media organisations by a group called Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka , which said it showed " the reality of the behaviour of the government forces during the war " .
Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka said the video had been taken in January 2009 using a mobile phone .
Analysts say that the row over the footage could complicate the country 's efforts to persuade international donors to pay for its costly post - war rebuilding plans .
Last month , a Sri Lankan newspaper printed allegations attributed to former army general Sarath Fonseka - who is running as a candidate in forthcoming elections - that the government had ordered rebels to be killed and not allowed to surrender .
Last May , Sri Lankan troops defeated Tamil Tiger rebels fighting for a separate homeland for the country 's Tamil minority after 26 years of war which left more than 70,000 people dead .

Bill Murray is one of the greatest comedic performers of all time and his performance in Groundhog Day is arguably his best .
This is a comedic performance of the highest caliber with Murray at his acerbic best , but what really sells the performance is the roller coaster of an emotional journey that the performer takes us through .
Not only does Murray deliver consistent laughs in whatever state his character is in ( irritation , ego - mania , depression , selflessness ) , but he also pulls at your heart strings because underneath the laughs we see a real human being in a real struggle with heavy themes of existentialism , mortality , suicide , God complexes and proper communication in a romantic relationship , all on his absurd course to genuine enlightenment .
Had he been nominated for Best Actor in 1994 he would have competed against the likes of Daniel Day - Lewis , Laurence Fishburne , Anthony Hopkins , Liam Neeson , and Tom Hanks ( who won for his first prominent dramatic role as a lovable lawyer dying of AIDS in Philadelphia ) , so even if Murray had been nominated he probably would n't have stood a chance .
Groundhog Day
Lost in Translation
Ironically , Murray beat Tom Hanks for the lead in .
Murray has been nominated once since : for his perfect , subtle turn in .
And despite being considered a front runner , lost to Sean Penn ... another comedic actor turned deadly serious .
We have a bit of a divide developing between the EU and the U.S. on banking and bank reform .
The most significant move in this tiff has come in retaliation for Wall Street ’s role in helping countries like Greece hide their debt burdens .
According to the Guardian newspaper , all American banks have been shut out of the sovereign bond market in Europe .
While many might think the U.S. government does not have a role to play in this dispute , I know from my own experience as a diplomat that the U.S. government is very aggressive about advocating for U.S. firms abroad .
The Guardian says :
European countries are blocking Wall Street banks from lucrative deals to sell government debt worth hundreds of billions of euros in retaliation for their role in the credit crunch .
For the first time in five years , no big US investment bank appears among the top nine sovereign bond bookrunners in Europe , according to Dealogic data compiled for the Guardian .
Only Morgan Stanley ranks at number 10 .
Goldman Sachs does n’t make the table .
Goldman made it to number five last year and in 2006 , and number eight in 2007 , the data shows .
JP Morgan was in the top ten last year and in 2007 and 2006 but does n’t appear this year .
" Governments do not have the confidence that the excessive risk - taking culture of the big Wall Street banks has changed and they still cannot be trusted to put the stability of the financial system before profit , " said Arlene McCarthy , vice chair of the European parliament ’s economic and monetary affairs committee .
" It is no surprise therefore that governments are reluctant to do business with banks that have failed to learn the lesson of the crisis .
The banks need to acknowledge the mistakes that were made and behave in an ethical way to regain the trust and confidence of governments . "
European sovereign bond league tables are now dominated by European banks such as Barclays Capital , Deutsche Bank , and Société Générale , the Dealogic table shows .
Their business model is usually seen as more relationship - based , while US investment banks have traditionally been focused on immediate deal - making .
Being left out of government bond sales means missing out on one of the top fee - earning opportunities this year , given the relative drought in mergers and acquisitions and stock market flotations .
Western European governments need to raise an estimated half a trillion dollars this year to refinance debts and pay for bank bailouts and rising unemployment .
I would expect the U.S. bank lobby to pressure the Obama Administration into developing demarche communiqués at the State and Commerce Departments condemning this as a protectionist move .
This is the type of work that State and Commerce does regularly on behalf of companies like Chiquita Brands International .
The bank lobby is much more powerful .
So , one should expect this to rise to an Ambassador - level talking point .
But apart from American firms being shut out of European sovereign debt deals , there are a lot of other ideas in the hopper which indicate an increasing friction between Europe and the United States on bank reform .
Obama proposed a $ 117 billion bank levy ( the so - called “ financial crisis responsibility fee ” ) which is to tax banks in order to pay back taxpayers for the bailout he and President Bush conducted .
European leaders have been cool to this plan .
Obama received support from Bank of England Governor Mervyn King on the issue of banning proprietary trading under the Volcker rule .
But , on other meaningful banking sector reforms , there has been little agreement .
Moreover , an influential German politician has floated a contentious idea for a European Monetary Fund to replicate the functions of the International Monetary Fund .
The fund proposal is an implicit recognition that the IMF would be a palatable option for a workout of the Greek sovereign debt crisis if not for American influence and control at the IMF .
This idea has been panned by other leading German political figures .
However , German Chancellor Merkel has some praise for it .
The fact that plans for an EMF are proceeding despite its irrelevance to the current debt crisis in Europe tells you that it is a political move to gain independence from the IMF .
On the surface , relations between Europe and the U.S. appear to be mostly harmonious .
However , recent developments demonstrate a significant divide on finance and banking between the U.S. and Europe .
To date , President Obama ’s popularity in Europe has not translated into any substantive trans -Atlantic initiatives , at least on the banking and finance front .
And judging from this anti-Wall Street move , I do n’t imagine it will anytime soon .
The interesting bit is how much of this is just politics .
In the Greek case , up to fifteen banks may have helped Greece hide debt .
Yet , the focus here is on Wall Street firms – I suspect purely for demagoguery .
Should we expect a tit - for - tat move of some sort ?
Stay tuned .

Millions pray for global warming as cold spell grips the planet
January 7 , 2010
By Carey Roberts
For global warming protesters , the week was a total downer .
A University of Utah " scream - in " for the failed Copenhagen climate conference had to be iced , thanks to an errant December blizzard .
Then faced with historic snowfalls in Europe , bicyclist Thaneite Khandekar cut short his global awareness trek .
" There were times when my feet would be frozen , " a dejected Khandekar had to admit .
Meanwhile , newspapers in North America , Europe , and Asia warned readers of the deep freeze that lay ahead .
In the United States , over 1,200 new records for cold and snow were set in a single week .
In Europe , the UK Telegraph warned readers of " one of the coldest winters in 100 years . "
A jet careened off a snow - covered airport runway in Germany .
And avalanches rumbled down the Swiss Alps .
The India Meteorological Department announced , " It could turn out to be the coldest Calcutta winter ever . "
Traffic bedlam reined as Seoul , Korea struggled to cope with a foot of snow .
Meanwhile a dwindling number of climate alarmists struggled to keep the faith .
" In the context of global warming , extreme atmospheric flows are causing extreme climate incidents to appear more frequently , " explained Mr. Guo , head of the Beijing Meteorological Bureau , as the Chinese capital dug out from its biggest snow dump since 1951 .
While temperatures took a nosedive , the Climategate scandal continued to surge out of control like an El Niño - driven tidal wave .
Dr. Rajendra Pachauri , head of the UN Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Control , reverted to damage - control mode .
" It is a well - known fact that powerful vested interests and those opposed to action on climate change are working overtime to see that they can stall action for as long as possible , " he blustered .
And what of pesky rumors that Pachauri stood to take in millions if proposed fossil fuel surcharges took effect ?
" As for pecuniary benefits from advice that I may be rendering to profit making organisations , these payments are all made directly to my institute , without a single penny being received by me , " Pachauri explained with a straight face .
Canadian climatologist Tim Ball laid much of the blame for the Climategate fiasco on a " Blind and Biased Mainstream Media . "
And in the Canadian arctic , Inuit hunters report the polar bears are doing fine .
Harry Flaherty , chairman of the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board , says the bear population has become so , well , unbearable , that its numbers need to be trimmed .
No surprise , laws based on the fraudulent climate research came under fire as well .
In the U.S. Senate , President Obama 's signature " cap- and - trade " bill was shunted to the back burner .
Six Georgia Congressmen charged the EPA 's emission regulations were based on " questionable and potentially fraudulent data . "
In France the Constitutional Council KOed an impending national carbon tax as unconstitutional .
And come to think of it , where is Al Gore these days ?
Following a disastrous Copenhagen speech where he predicted a polar melt - down within 5 - 7 years , the Guru of Global Apocalypse has been keeping a low profile .
Nothing on his personal blog : http://blog.algore.com/
And at his ClimateProject.org , eco-speech requests for 2010 have petered off .
At $ 100,000 a pop , corporations hit by a weak economy are having doubts about inviting the high - priced Nobel Peace Prize winner .
Meanwhile back in India , New Delhi remained under the grip of an intense cold wave .
In the northern territories , 154 are reported dead from weather - related causes .
But hopefully the cold snap will end by next week .
Beginning January 14 , millions of Hindus will congregate for the holy Kumbha Mela , the largest gathering of Hindus in the world .
In attendance will be the renowned Naga Sadhus , members of a Hindu sect who parade through the streets unclothed .
Any guesses what naked men's mantra will be ?

Michael Moore ’s Capitalism : A Love Story comes home to the issue he ’s been examining throughout his career : the disastrous impact of corporate dominance on the everyday lives of Americans ( and by default , the rest of the world ) .
But this time the culprit is much bigger than General Motors , and the crime scene far wider than Flint , Michigan .
From Middle America , to the halls of power in Washington , to the global financial epicenter in Manhattan , Michael Moore will once again take film goers into uncharted territory .
With both humor and outrage , Michael Moore ’s Capitalism : A Love Story explores a taboo question :
What is the price that America pays for its love of capitalism ?
Years ago , that love seemed so innocent .
Today , however , the American dream is looking more like a nightmare as families pay the price with their jobs , their homes and their savings .
Moore takes us into the homes of ordinary people whose lives have been turned upside down ; and he goes looking for explanations in Washington , DC and elsewhere .
What he finds are the all - too - familiar symptoms of a love affair gone astray : lies , abuse , betrayal … and 14,000 jobs being lost every day .
Capitalism : A Love Story is both a culmination of Moore ’s previous works and a look into what a more hopeful future could look like .
It is Michael Moore ’s ultimate quest to answer the question he ’s posed throughout his illustrious filmmaking career :
Who are we and why do we behave the way that we do ?

Why Hegelian Dialectics Is Not a Vulgar Evolutionism
Which , then , is the dimension of the law that the law cannot admit publicly ?
The best way to discern it is through a logical paradox deployed by Jean - Pierre Dupuy in his admirable text on Hitchcock ’s Vertigo :
An object possesses a property x until the time t ; after t , it is not only that the object no longer has the property x ; it is that it is not true that it possessed x at any time .
The truth - value of the proposition “ the object O has the property x at the moment t’ therefore depends on the moment when this proposition is enunciated . ” [ 1 ]
One should note here the precise formulation : it is not that the truth - value of the proposition “ the object O has the property x ” depends on the time to which this proposition refers – even when this time is specified , the truth - value depends on the time when the proposition itself is enounced .
Or , to quote the title of Dupuy ’s text , ” when I ’ll die , nothing of our love will ever have existed . ”
Think about marriage and divorce : the most intelligent argument for the right to divorce ( proposed , among others , by none other than the young Marx ) does not refer to common vulgarities in the style of “ like all things , love attachments are also not eternal , they change in the course of time , ” etc. ; it rather concedes that indissolvability is in the very notion of marriage .
The conclusion is that divorce always has a retroactive scope : it does not only mean that marriage is now annulled , but something much more radical – a marriage should be annulled because it never was a true marriage .
And the same holds for Soviet Communism : it is clearly insufficient to say that , in the years of Brezhnev “ stagnation , ” it “ exhausted its potentials , no longer fitting new times ” ; what its miserable end demonstrates is that it was a historical deadlock from its very beginning .
Perhaps , this paradox provides a clue for the twists and turns of the Hegelian dialectical process .
Let us take Hegel ’s critique of the Jacobin revolutionary Terror as an exercise in abstract negativity of the absolute freedom which cannot stabilize itself in a concrete social order of freedom , and thus has to end in the fury of self - destruction .
However , one should bear in mind that , insofar as we are dealing here with a historical choice ( between the “ French ” way of remaining within Catholicism and thus being obliged to engage in the self - destructive revolutionary Terror , and the “ German ” way of Reformation ) , this choice involves exactly the same elementary dialectical paradox as the one , also from The Phenomenology of Spirit , between the two readings of “ the Spirit is a bone ” which Hegel illustrates by the phallic metaphor ( phallus as the organ of insemination or phallus as the organ of urination ) :
Hegel ’s point is not that , in contrast to the vulgar empiricist mind which sees only urination , the proper speculative attitude has to choose insemination .
The paradox is that the direct choice of insemination is the infallible way to miss it : it is not possible to choose directly the “ true meaning ” , i.e. one has to begin by making the “ wrong ” choice ( of urination ) – the true speculative meaning emerges only through the repeated reading , as the after - effect ( or by - product ) of the first , “ wrong , ” reading .
And the same goes for social life in which the direct choice of the “ concrete universality ” of a particular ethical life - world can only end in a regression to pre-modern organic society that denies the infinite right of subjectivity as the fundamental feature of modernity .
Since the subject - citizen of a modern state can no longer accept his immersion in some particular social role that confers on him a determinate place within the organic social
Whole , the only way to the rational totality of the modern State leads through revolutionary Terror : one should ruthlessly tear up the constraints of the pre-modern organic “ concrete universality , ” and fully assert the infinite right of subjectivity in its abstract negativity .
In other words , the point of Hegel ’s analysis of the revolutionary Terror is not the rather obvious insight into how the revolutionary project involved the unilateral direct assertion of abstract Universal Reason , and was as such doomed to perish in self - destructive fury , since it was unable to organize the transposition of its revolutionary energy into a concrete stable and differentiated social order ;
Hegel ’s point is rather the enigma of why , in spite of the fact that revolutionary Terror was a historical deadlock , we have to pass through it in order to arrive at the modern rational State .
This is why Hegelian dialectics is not a vulgar evolutionism claiming that a phenomenon was justified in its own time , but deserves to disappear when its time passes : the “ eternity ” of dialectics means that the de-legitimization is always retroactive , what disappears “ in itself ” always deserved to disappear .
Recall also the paradox of the process of apologizing : if I hurt someone with a rude remark , the proper thing for me to do is to offer him a sincere apology , and the proper thing for him to do is to say something like “ Thanks , I appreciate it , but I was n’t offended , I knew you did n’t mean it , so you really owe me no apology ! ”
The point is , of course , that , although the final result is that no apology is needed , one has to go through the entire process of offering it : “ you owe me no apology ” can only be said after I DO offer an apology , so that , although , formally , “ nothing happens , ” the offer of apology is proclaimed unnecessary , there is a gain at the end of the process ( perhaps , even , the friendship is saved ) .
( A scene in Ernst Lubitch ’s wonderful To Be Or Not to Be , a short dialogue between the two famous Polish theatre actors , Maria Tura and her self - centred husband Josef , playfully subverts this logic .
Josef tells his wife : “ I gave orders that , in the posters announcing the new play we are starring in , your name will be at the top , ahead on mine – you deserve it , darling ! ”
She kindly replies : “ Thanks , but you really did n’t have to do it , it was not necessary ! ”
His answer is , of course : “ I knew you would say that , so I already cancelled the order and put my name back on the top … ” )
There is a well - known joke about cooking which relies on the same logic : “ How anyone can make a good soup in one hour ?
You prepare all the ingredients , cut the vegetables , etc. , boil water , put the ingredients into it , cook it in not too hot water for half an hour , occasionally stirring the water ; when , after three quarters of an hour , you discover that the soup is tasteless and unpalatable , you throw it away , open up a good can of soup and quickly warm it up . ”
This is how we , humans , make soup .
Is it not that , here also , one has to do it ( offer an apology , choose terror ) in order to see how it is superfluous ?
This paradox is sustained by the distinction between the “ constative ” and the “ performative ” dimensions , between “ subject of the enunciated ” and “ subject of the enunciation ” : at the level of the enunciated content , the whole operation is meaningless ( why do it – offer an apology , go through terror – when it is superfluous ? ) ; however , what this common sense insight forgets is that it is only the “ wrong ” superfluous gesture which creates the subjective conditions which made it possible for the subject to really see why this gesture is superfluous .
It only becomes possible to say that my apology is not necessary after I offer it ; it only becomes possible to see how Terror is superfluous and destructive after one goes through it .
The dialectical process is thus more refined than it may appear ; the standard notion is that , in it , one can only arrive at the final truth through the path of errors , so that these errors are not simply discarded , but “ sublated ” in the final truth , preserved in it as its moments .
What this standard notion misses is how the previous moments are preserved precisely as superfluous .
So the obvious critical approach “ But is this idea of retroactively canceling the contingent historical conditions , of transforming contingency into Fate , not ideology at its formally purest , the very form of ideology ? ” misses the point , which is that this retroactivity is inscribed into reality itself : what is truly “ ideology ” is the idea that , freed from “ ideological illusions , ” one can pass from moment A to moment B directly , without retroactivity – say , that , in an ideally - authentic society , I can apologize and the other can say “ I was hurt , apology was needed , and I accept it ” without breaking any implicit rules ; that we could get the modern rational State without having to pass through the “ superfluous ” detour of Terror .
There is a well - known joke about cooking which relies on the same logic : “ How anyone can make a good soup in one hour ?
You prepare all the ingredients , cut the vegetables , etc. , boil water , put the ingredients into it , cook it in not too hot water for half an hour , occasionally stirring the water ; when , after three quarters of an hour , you discover that the soup is tasteless and unpalatable , you throw it away , open up a good can of soup and quickly warm it up . ”
This is how we , humans , make soup .
How is this circle of changing the past possible without recourse to travel back in time ?
The solution was already proposed by Henri Bergson : of course one cannot change the past reality / actuality , but what one can change is the virtual dimension of the past – when something radically New emerges , this New retroactively creates its own possibility , its own causes / conditions . [ 2 ]
A potentiality can be inserted into ( or withdrawn from ) past reality .
Falling in love changes the past : it is as if I always - already loved you , our love was destined , “ answer of the real . ”
My present love causes the past which gave birth to it .
The same goes for legal power : here also , synchrony precedes diachrony .
In the same way that , once I contingently fall in love , this love was my necessary Fate , once a legal order is here , its contingent origins are erased .
Once it IS here , it was always - already here , every story of its origins is a myth , like the Swift story of the origin of language in Gulliver ’s Travels : the result is already presupposed .
In Vertigo , it is the opposite that occurs : the past is changed so that it loses objet a .
What Scottie first experiences in Vertigo is the loss of Madeleine , his fatal love ; when he recreates Madeleine in Judy and then discovers that the Madeleine he knew already was Judy pretending to be Madeleine , what he discovers is not simply that Judy is a fake ( he knew that she is not the true Madeleine , since he recreated a copy of Madeleine out of her ) , but that , because she is NOT a fake – she IS Madeleine -, Madeleine herself was already a fake – objet a disintegrates , the very loss is lost , we get a “ negation of negation . ”
His discovery changes the past , deprives the lost object of objet a .
Are , then , today ’s ethico - legal neoconservatives not a little bit like Scottie in Hitchcock ’s Vertigo : in wanting to recreate the lost order , to make a new distinguished Madeleine out of today ’s promiscuous and vulgar Judy , they will be sooner or later forced to admit not that it is impossible to restore to life Madeleine ( the old traditional mores ) , but that Madeleine WAS already Judy : the corruption they are fighting in modern permissive , secular , egotist , etc. society was there from the beginning .
It is like with Zen Buddhism : those who criticize the Westernized New Age image and practice of Zen , its reduction to a “ relaxation technique , ” as the betrayal of the authentic Japanese Zen , obliterate the fact that the features they deplore in the Westernized Zen were already there in Japanese “ true ” Zen : after WWII , Japanese Zen Buddhists immediately started to organize Zen courses for business managers , during the WWII their majority supported Japanese militarism , etc .
In true love , after discovering the truth , Scottie would have accepted Judy as “ more Madeleine than Madeleine herself ” ( he DOES that just before the rise of the mother superior … ) : here Dupuy should be corrected .
Dupuy ’s formula is that Scottie should left Madeleine to her past – true , but what should he have done upon discovering that Judy IS Madeleine ?
Past Madeleine was an imaginary lure , pretending to be what she was not ( Judy played Madeleine ) .
What Judy is doing now in playing Madeleine is TRUE LOVE .
In Vertigo , Scottie does NOT love Madeleine – the proof is that he tries to recreate her in Judy , changing Judy ’s properties to make her resemble Madeleine .
This is why the idea to clone a child to parents who lost him ( or her ) is an abomination : if the parents are satisfied , their love was not true love – love is not love for the properties of the object , but for the abyssal X , the je ne sais quoi , in the object .
In his Wissen und Gewissen , Viktor Frankl reports on one of his post - WWII patients , a concentration camp survivor who reunited with his wife after the war ; however , due to an illness contracted in the camp , she died soon afterwards .
The patient fell into total despair , and all Frankl ’s attempts to drag him out of depression failed , till , one day , he told the patient : “ Imagine that God would give me the power to create a woman who would have all the features of your dead wife , so that she would be indistinguishable from her – would you ask me to create her ? ”
The patient was silent for a short time , then he stood up , said “ No , thanks , doctor ! ” , shook his hand , left and started to lead a new normal life . [ 3 ]
This patient did what Scottie , who precisely tried to recreate the same woman , was n’t able to do : he became aware that , while one can find the same woman as to her positive features , one cannot recreate the unfathomable objet a in her .
There is a science - fiction story , set a couple of hundred years ahead of our time when time travel was already possible , about an art critic who gets so fascinated by the works of a New York painter from our era that he travels back in time to meet him .
However , he discovers that the painter is a worthless drunk who even steals from him the time machine and escapes to the future ; alone in today ’s world , the art critic paints all the paintings that fascinated him in the future in made him travel into the past .
Surprisingly , it was none other than Henry James who already used the same plot :
The Sense of the Past , an unfinished manuscript found among James ’ papers and published posthumously in 1917 , tells a similar story which uncannily resembles Vertigo , and caused penetrating interpretations by Stephen Spender and Borges .
( Dupuy notes that James was friend with H.G. Wells – The Sense of the Past is his version of Wells ’ The Time Machine . ) [ 4 ]
After James ’ death this novel was converted into a very successful play Berkeley Square , which was made into a movie in 1933 with Leslie Howard as Ralph Pendrel , a young New Yorker who , upon inheriting an 18th century house in London , finds in it a portrait of a remote ancestor , also named Ralph Pendrel .
Fascinated by the portrait , he steps across a mysterious threshold and finds himself back in the 18th century .
Among the people he meets there is a painter who was the author of the portrait that fascinated him – it is , of course , his own portrait .
In his commentary , Borges provided a succinct formulation of the paradox : “ The cause is posterior to the effect , the motif of the voyage is one of the consequences of this voyage . ” [ 5 ]
James added a love aspect to the trip into the past : back in the 18th century , Ralph falls in love with Nan , a sister of his ( 18th century ) fiancée Molly .
Nan eventually realizes that Ralph is a time - traveller from the future , and she sacrifices her own happiness and help him return to his own time and to Aurora Coyne , a woman who had previously rejected Ralph but would now accept him .
James ’s story thus psychotically ( in the real ) mystifies the circle of symbolic economy , in which effect precedes the cause , i.e. , retroactively creates it – and exactly the same holds for the legal status of the rebellion against a ( legal ) power in Kant : the proposition “ what the rebels are doing is a crime which deserves to be punished ” is true if pronounced when the rebellion is still going on ; however , once the rebellion wins and establishes a new legal order , this statement about the legal status of the same past acts no longer holds .
Here is Kant ’s answer to the question “ Is rebellion a legitimate means for a people to employ in throwing off the yoke of an alleged tyrant ? ” :
The rights of the people are injured ; no injustice befalls the tyrant when he is deposed .
There can be no doubt on this point .
Nevertheless , it is in the highest degree illegitimate for the subjects to seek their rights in this way .
If they fail in the struggle and are then subjected to severest punishment , they cannot complain about injustice any more than the tyrant could if they had succeeded .
/…/
If the revolt of the people succeeds , what has been said is still quite compatible with the fact that the chief , on retiring to the status of a subject , cannot begin a revolt for his restoration but need not fear being made to account for his earlier administration of the state .
Does
Kant not offer here his own version of what Bernard Williams developed as “ moral luck ” ( or , rather , “ legal luck ” ) ?
The ( not ethical , but legal ) status of rebellion is decided retroactively : if a rebellion succeeds and establishes a new legal order , then it brings about its own circulus vitiosus , i.e. , it erases into ontological void its own illegal origins , it enacts the paradox of retroactively grounding itself – Kant states this paradox even more clearly a couple of pages earlier :
If a violent revolution , engendered by a bad constitution , introduces by illegal means a more legal constitution , to lead the people back to the earlier constitution would not be permitted ; but , while the revolution lasted , each person who openly or covertly shared in it would have justly incurred the punishment due to those who rebel .
One can not be clearer : the legal status of the same act changes with time .
What is , while the rebellion goes on , a punishable crime , becomes , after a new legal order is established , its own opposite – more precisely , it simply disappears , as a vanishing mediator which retroactively cancels / erases itself in its result .
The same holds for the very beginning , for the emergence of the legal order out of the violent “ state of nature ” – Kant is fully aware that there is no historical moment of “ social contract ” : the unity and law of a civil society is imposed onto the people by violence whose agent is not motivated by any moral considerations : since a uniting cause must supervene upon the variety of particular volitions in order to produce a common will from them , establishing this whole is something no one individual in the group can perform ; hence in the practical execution of this idea we can count on nothing but force to establish the juridical condition , on the compulsion of which public law will later be established .
We can scarcely hope to find in the legislator a moral intention sufficient to induce him to commit to the general will the establishment of a legal constitution after he has formed the nation from a horde of savages .
What Kant is struggling with here is nothing other than the paradoxical nature of the political act .
Recall , from the history of Marxism , how Lenin saved his utmost acerb irony for those who engage in the endless search for some kind of “ guarantee ” for the revolution .
This guarantee assumes two main forms : either the reified notion of social Necessity ( one should not risk the revolution too early ; one has to wait for the right moment , when the situation is “ mature ” with regard to the laws of historical development : “ it is too early for the Socialist revolution , the working class is not yet mature ” ) , or the normative ( “ democratic ” ) legitimacy ( “ the majority of the population is not on our side , so the revolution would not really be democratic ” ) – as Lenin repeatedly put it , it is as if , before a revolutionary agent risks the seizure of power , it should get the permission from some figure of the big Other – say , organize a referendum which will ascertain that the majority supports the revolution . [ 6 ]
With Lenin , as with Lacan , the point is that a revolution ne s’autorise que d’elle - même : one should assume the revolutionary act not covered by the big Other – the fear of taking power “ prematurely , ” the search for the guarantee , is the fear of the abyss of the act nicely rendered in the anecdote about the exchange between Lenin and Trotsky just prior to the October Revolution : Lenin said : “ What will happen with us if we fail ? ”
Trotsky replied : “ And what will happen if we succeed ? ”
Se non e vero e ben trovato …
What is unimaginable within the positivist vision of history as an “ objective ” process which in advance determines the possible coordinates of political interventions is a radical political intervention which changes these very „ objective “ coordinates and thus in a way creates the conditions for its own success .
An act proper is not just a strategic intervention into a situation , bound by its conditions – it retroactively creates its conditions .
We can see where Kant ’s weakness resides : there is no need to evoke “ radical Evil ” in the guise of some dark primordial crime – all these obscure fantasies have to be evoked to obfuscate the act itself .
The paradox is clear : Kant himself , who put such an accent on the ethical act as autonomous , non-pathological , irreducible to its conditions , is unable to recognize it where it happens , misreading it as its opposite , as the unthinkable “ diabolical Evil . ”
Kant is here one in the series of many conservative ( and not only conservative ) political thinkers , from Pascal and Joseph de Maistre , who elaborated the notion of illegitimate origins of power , of a “ founding crime ” on which state power is based ; to obfuscate this origins , one should offer to ordinary people “ noble lies , ” heroic narratives of origins .
One cannot but respect this brutal honesty of the first - generation founders of the State of Israel who in no way obliterated the “ founding crime ” of establishing a new state : they openly admitted they have no right to the land of Palestina , it is just their force against the force of the Palestinians .
On 29 April 1956 , a group of Palestinians from Gaza that had crossed the border to plunder the harvest in the Nahal Oz kibbutz ’s fields ; Roi , a young Jewish member of the kibbutz who patrolled the fields galloped toward them on his horse brandishing a stick to chase them away ; he was seized by the Palestinians carried back to the Gaza Strip ; when the U.N. returned his body , his eyes had been plucked out .
Moshe Dayan , then the Chief of Staff , delivered the eulogy at his funeral the following day : Let us not cast blame on the murderers today .
What claim do we have against their mortal hatred of us ?
They have lived in the refugee camps of Gaza for the past eight years , while right before their eyes we have transformed the land and villages where they and their ancestors once lived into our own inheritance .
It is not among the Arabs of Gaza but in our own midst that we must seek Roi ’s blood .
How have we shut our eyes and refused to look squarely at our fate and see the destiny of our generation in all its brutality .
Have we forgotten that this group of young people living in Nahal Oz bears the burden of Gaza ’s gates on its shoulders ? ” [ 7 ]
Apart from the parallel between Roi and the blinded Samson ( which plays a key role in the later mythology of the IDF ) , what cannot but strike the eye is the apparent non sequitur , the gap , between the first and the second paragraph : in the first paragraph , Dayan openly admits that the Palestinians have the full right to hate the Israeli Jews , since they took their land ; his conclusion , however , is not the obvious admission of one ’s own guilt , but to fully accept “ the destiny of our generation in all its brutality . ” i.e. , to assume the burden – not of guilt , but – of the war where might will be right , were the stronger will win .
The war was not about principles or justice , it was an exercise in “ mythic violence ” – the insight totally obliterated by the recent Israeli ’s self - legitimization .
This brings us to today ’s liberal idea of global justice whose aim is not only to bring out all past ( acts which appear from today ’s standards as ) collective crimes ; it also involves the Politically Correct utopia of “ restituting ” the past collective violence ( towards Blacks , native Americans , Chinese immigrants … ) by payment or legal regulations – this is the true utopia , the idea that a legal order can pay back for its founding crime , thereby retroactively cleansing itself of its guilt and regain its innocence …
What is at the end of this road is the ecological utopia of humanity in its entirety repaying its debt to Nature for all its past exploitation .
And , effectively , is the ecological idea of “ recycling ” not part of the same pattern as that of the restitution for past in justices ?
The underlying utopian notion is the same : the system which emerged through violence should repay its debt and thus regain ethico - ecological balance .
The ideal of “ recycling ” involves the utopia of a full self - enclosed circle in which all waste , all useless remainder , is sublated : nothing gets lost , all trash is re-used .
It is at this level that one should accomplish the shift from circle to ellipse : already in nature itself , there is no circle of full recycling , there is un-usable waste .
Recall the methodic madness of Jeremy Bentham ’s “ Panopticon ” in which everything , up to the prisoners ’ excrements and urine , should be again put to use .
For urine , Bentham proposed the following ingenious solution : the external walls of the cells should not be fully vertical , but lightly curved inside , so that , when prisoners will urinate on the wall , the liquid will drip downwards , keeping the cells warm in winter …
This is why the proper aesthetic attitude of a radical ecologist is not the one of admiring and longing for a pristine nature of virgin forests and clear sky , but the one of accepting waste as such , of discovering the aesthetic potentials of waste as such , of decay , of the inertia of rotten stuff which serves no purpose .
IV .
The Utopia for a Race of Devils And , finally , this brings us to the core of the liberal utopia .
For liberalism , at least in its radical form , the wish to submit people to an ethical ideal that we hold for universal is “ the crime which contains all crimes , ” the mother of all crimes – it amounts to the brutal imposition of one ’s own view onto others , the cause of civil disorder .
Which is why , if one wants to establish civil peace and tolerance , the first condition is to get rid of “ moral temptation ” : politics should be thoroughly purged of moral ideals and rendered “ realistic , ” taking people as they are , counting on their true nature , not on moral exhortations .
Market is here exemplary : human nature is egotistic , there is no way to change it – what is needed is a mechanism that would make private vices work for common good ( the “ Cunning of Reason ” ) .
In his “ Perpetual Peace , ” Kant provided a precise formulation of this key feature : many say a republic would have to be a nation of angels , because men with their selfish inclinations are not capable of a constitution of such sublime form .
But precisely with these inclinations nature comes to the aid of the general will established on reason , which is revered even though impotent in practice .
Thus it is only a question of a good organization of the state ( which does lie in man ’s power ) , whereby the powers of each selfish inclination are so arranged in opposition that one moderates or destroys the ruinous effect of the other .
The consequence for reason is the same as if none of them existed , and man is forced to be a good citizen even if not a morally good person .
The problem of organizing a state , however hard it may seem , can be solved even for a race of devils , if only they are intelligent .
The problem is : ‘ Given a multitude of rational beings requiring universal laws for their preservation , but each of whom is secretly inclined to exempt himself from them , to establish a constitution in such a way that , although their private intentions conflict , they check each other , with the result that their public conduct is the same as if they had no such intentions . ’
A problem like this must be capable of solution ; it does not require that we know how to attain the moral improvement of men but only that we should know the mechanism of nature in order to use it on men , organizing the conflict of the hostile intentions present in a people in such a way that they must compel themselves to submit to coercive laws .
Thus a state of peace is established in which laws have force . [ 8 ]
One should follow this line to its conclusion : a fully self - conscious liberal should intentionally limit his altruistic readiness to sacrifice his own good for the others ’
Good , aware that the most efficient way to act for the common good is to follow one ’s private egotism .
The inevitable obverse of the Cunning of Reason motto “ private vices , common good ” is : “ private goodness , common disaster . ”
There is in liberalism , from its very inception , a tension between individual freedom and objective mechanisms which regulate the behavior of a crowd – it was already Benjamin Constant who formulated clearly this tension : everything is moral in individuals , but everything is physical in crowds ; everybody is free as individual , but a cog in a machine in a crowd .
Nowhere is the legacy of religion clearer : this , exactly , is the paradox of Predestination , of the unfathomable mechanism of Grace embodied , among others , in a market success .
The mechanisms which will bring about social peace are independent of the will of individuals as well as of their merits .
The inner tension of this project is discernible in two aspects of liberalism , market liberalism and political liberalism .
Michea perspicuously links this to two meanings of “ right ” : the political Right insists on market economy , the politically - correct culturalized Left insists on the defense of human Rights – often its sole remaining raison d’être .
Although the tension between these two aspects of liberalism is irreducible , they are nonetheless inextricably linked , like the two sides of the same coin .
Today , the meaning of “ liberalism ” moves between two opposed poles : economic liberalism ( free market individualism , opposition to strong state regulation , etc. ) and political libertarian liberalism ( accent on equality , social solidarity , permissiveness , etc. ) – in the US , Republicans are more liberal in the first sense and Democrats in the second sense .
The point is , of course , that , while one cannot decide through closer analysis which is the “ true ” liberalism , one also cannot resolve the deadlock by way of trying to propose a kind of “ higher ” dialectical synthesis , or by way of “ avoiding the confusion ” through on a clear distinction between the two senses of the term : the tension between the two meanings is inherent to the very content that “ liberalism ” endeavors to designate , it is constitutive of this notion , so this ambiguity , far from signaling the limitation of our knowledge , signals the innermost “ truth ” of the notion of liberalism .
Traditionally , each basic form of liberalism necessarily appears as the opposite of the other form : multiculturalist liberal advocates of tolerance etc. as a rule fight economic liberalism and try to protect the rights of the unencumbered market forces , while market liberals as a rule advocate conservative family values , etc .
We thus get the double paradox of the traditionalist Rightist supporting the market economy while ferociously fighting the culture and mores it engenders – with its counterpoint , the multiculturalist Leftist , fighting the market ( less and less , it is true ) while enthusiastically enforcing the ideology it engenders .
( Half a century ago , the symptomatic exception was the unique Ayn Rand , who advocated market liberalism and full individualist egotism deprived of all traditional morality of family values and sacrifice for the common good . )
Today , however , we seem to be entering a new era in which both aspects can be combined : figures like Bill Gates pose as market radicals and as multiculturalist humanitarians .
Here we encounter the basic paradox of liberalism .
Anti-ideological and anti-utopian stance is inscribed into the very core of the liberal vision : liberalism conceives itself as a “ politics of lesser evil , ” its ambition is to bring about the » least evil society possible , « thus preventing greater evil , since it considers any attempt to directly impose a positive Good the ultimate source of all evil .
Churchill ’s quip about democracy as the worst of all political systems , the only problem being that all others are worse , holds even more for liberalism .
Such a view is sustained by a profound pessimism about human nature : man is egotistic and envious animal , if one builds a political system which appeals to his goodness and altruism , the result will be the worst terror ( both Jacobins and Stalinists presupposed human virtue ) .
However , the liberal critique of the “ tyranny of the Good ” comes at a price : the more its program permeates society , the more it is turning into its opposite .
The claim to want nothing but the lesser of evils , once asserted as the principle of the new global order , gradually takes over the very feature of its enemy it wanted to fight .
The global liberal order clearly asserts itself as the best of all possible worlds ; the modest rejection of utopias ends with imposing its own market - liberal utopia which will become reality when we will properly apply market and legal Human Rights mechanisms .
Behind all this lurks the ultimate totalitarian nightmare , the vision of a New Man who left behind the old ideological baggage .
As every close observer of the deadlocks of Political Correctness knows , the separation of legal Justice from moral Goodness – which should be relativized - historicized – ends up in a stifling oppressive moralism full of resentment .
Without any “ organic ” social substance grounding the standards of what Orwell approvingly referred to as “ common decency ” ( all such standards are dismissed as subordinating individual freedom to proto - Fascist organic social forms ) , the minimalist program of laws which should just prevent individuals to encroach upon each other ( to annoy or “ harass ” each other ) reverts into an explosion of legal and moral rules , into an endless process of legalization / moralization ( where “ endless ” refers to what Hegel called “ spurious infinity ” ) called “ the fight against all forms of discrimination . ”
If there are no shared mores that are allowed to influence the law , only the fact of “ harassing ” other subjects , who – in the absence of such mores – will decide what counts as “ harassment ” ?
There are , in France , associations of obese people which demand that all public campaigns against obesity and for healthy eating habits be stopped , since they hurt the self - esteem of obese persons .
The militants of Veggie Pride condemn the “ specism ” of meat - eaters ( who discriminate against animals , privileging the human animal – for them , a particularly disgusting form of “ fascism ” ) and demand that “ vegetophobia ” should be treated as a kind of xenophobia and proclaimed a crime .
And so on and so on : incest - marriage , consensual murder and cannibalism …
The problem is here the obvious arbitrariness of the ever new rules – let us take child sexuality : one can argue that its criminalization is an unwarranted discrimination , but one can also argue that children should be protected from sexual molestation by adults .
And we could go on here : the same people who advocate the legalization of soft drugs usually support the prohibition of smoking in public places ; the same people who protest against the patriarchal abuse of small children in our societies , worry when someone condemns members of foreign cultures who live among us for doing exactly this ( say , Gypsies preventing children from attending public schools ) , claiming that this is a case of meddling with other “ ways of life . ”
It is thus for necessary structural reasons that this “ fight against discrimination ” is an endless process endlessly postponing its final point , a society freed of all moral prejudices which , as Jean - Claude Michea put it , “ would be on this very account a society condemned to see crimes everywhere . ” [ 9 ]
The ideological coordinates of such a liberal multiculturalism are determined by the two features of our “ postmodern ” zeitgeist : universalized multiculturalist historicism ( all values and rights are historically specific , any elevation of them into universal notions to be imposed onto others is cultural imperialism at its most violent ) [ 10 ] and universalized “ hermeneutics of suspicion ” ( all “ high ” ethical motifs are generated and sustained by “ low ” motifs of resentment , envy , etc . – say , the call to sacrifice our life for a higher Cause is either the mask for a manipulation of those who need war for their power and wealth , or a pathological expression of masochism – and this either / or is an inclusive vel , i.e. , both terms can be true at the same time ) .
Another way to formulate Badiou ’s insight that we live in a world - less universe is to claim that today ’s functioning of ideology no longer relies on the mechanism of interpellation of individuals into subjects : what liberalism proposes is a value - neutral mechanism of rights etc. , a mechanism “ whose free play can automatically generate a desired political order , without at any point interpellating individuals into subjects . ” [ 11 ]
The nameless jouissance cannot be a title of interpellation proper ; it is more a kind of blind drive with no symbolic value - form attached to it – all such symbolic features are temporary and flexible , which is why the individual is constantly called upon to “ re-create ” itself .
There is a problem with this liberal vision of which every good anthropologist , psychoanalyst , or even perspicuous social critic like Francis Fukuyama , is aware : it cannot stand on its own , it is parasitic upon some preceding form of what is usually referred to as “ socialization ” which it is simultaneously undermining , thereby cutting off the branch on which it is sitting .
On the market – and , more generally , in the social exchange based on the market – individuals encounter each other as free rational subjects , but such subjects are the result of a complex previous process which concerns symbolic debt , authority , and , above all , trust ( into the big Other which regulates exchanges ) .
In other words , the domain of exchanges is never purely symmetrical : it is an a priori condition for each of the participants to give something without return so that he can participate in the game of give - and - take .
For a market exchange to take place , there has to be subject here who participate in the basic symbolic pact and display the basic trust in the Word .
Of course , market is the domain of egotist cheating and lying ; however , as Lacan taught us , in order for a lie to function , it has to present itself and be taken as truth , i.e. , the dimension of Truth has to be already established .
Kant missed the necessity of unwritten , disavowed , but necessary rules for every legal edifice or set of social rules – it is only such rules that provide the “ substance ” on which laws can thrive , i.e. , properly function .
( One can again imagine , along these lines , yet another version of the Kantian secret clause enjoining the states to always take into account the unwritten rules , without publicly admitting it . )
The exemplary case of the efficiency of such unwritten rules is “ potlatch ” ; the key feature that opposes potlatch to direct market exchange is thus the temporal dimension .
In the market exchange , the two complementary acts occur simultaneously ( I pay and I get what I paid for ) , so that the act of exchange does not lead to a permanent social bond , but just to a momentary exchange between atomized individuals who , immediately afterwards , return to their solitude .
In potlatch , on the contrary , the time elapsed between me giving a gift and the other side returning it to me creates a social link which lasts ( for a time , at least ) : we are all linked together with bonds of debt .
From this standpoint , money can be defined as the means which enable us to have contacts with others without entering in proper relations with them .
( Is the function of the masochist practices of bonding not ( also ) to supplement this lack of social bond proper , so that , in it , the foreclosed returns in the real – the suspended symbolic bond returns as literal bodily bonding ? ) [ 12 ]
This atomized society where we have contacts with others without entering in proper relations with them , is the presupposition of liberalism .
The problem of organizing a state thus cannot be solved “ even for a race of devils , ” as Kant put it – that it can be is the key moment of the liberal utopia .
One should link this Kant ’s reference to a race of devils to another detail of his ethical thought .
According to Kant , if one finds oneself alone on the sea with another survivor of a sunken ship near a floating piece of wood which can keep only one person afloat , moral considerations are no longer valid – there is no moral law preventing me from fighting to death with the other survivor for the place on the raft ; I can engage in it with moral impunity .
It is here that , perhaps , one encounters the limit of Kantian ethics : what about someone who would willingly sacrifice himself in order to give the other person a chance to survive – and , furthermore , is ready to do it for no pathological reasons ?
Since there is no moral law commanding me to do this , does this mean that such an act has no ethical status proper ?
Does this strange exception not demonstrate that ruthless egotism , the care for personal survival and gain , is the silent “ pathological ” presupposition of Kantian ethics – namely , that the Kantian ethical edifice can only maintain itself if we silently presuppose the “ pathological “ image of man as a ruthless utilitarian egotist ?
In exactly the same way , the Kantian political edifice , his notion of ideal legal power , can only maintain itself if we silently presuppose the “ pathological ” image of the subjects of this power as “ a race of devils . ”
There is in liberalism , from its very inception , a tension between individual freedom and objective mechanisms which regulate the behavior of a crowd – it was already Benjamin Constant who formulated clearly this tension : everything is moral in individuals , but everything is physical in crowds ; everybody is free as individual , but a cog in a machine in a crowd .
Nowhere is the legacy of religion clearer : this , exactly , is the paradox of Predestination , of the unfathomable mechanism of Grace embodied , among others , in a market success .
The mechanisms which will bring about social peace are independent of the will of individuals as well as of their merits – to quote Kant again :
The guarantee of perpetual peace is nothing less than that great artist , nature ( natura daedala rerum ) .
In her mechanical course we see that her aim is to produce a harmony among men , against their will and indeed through their discord .
This is ideology at its purest .
One can claim that the notion of ideology was posited “ for itself ” only in the liberal universe , with its founding distinction between ordinary people immersed in their universe of Meaning , of ( what appears from the properly modern perspective ) the confusion between facts and values , and the cold rational realistic observers who are able to perceive the world the way it is , without moralistic prejudices , as a mechanism regulated by laws ( of passions ) like any other natural mechanism .
It is only in this modern universe that society appears as an object of a possible experiment , as a chaotic field on which one can ( and should ) apply a value - free Theory or Science given in advance ( a political “ geometry of passions , ” economy , racist science ) .
Only this modern position of a value - free scientist approaching society in the same way as a natural scientist approaches nature , is ideology proper , not the spontaneous attitude of the meaningful experience of life dismissed by the scientist as a set of superstitious prejudices – it is ideology because it imitates the form of natural sciences without really being one .
“ Ideology ” in a strict sense is thus always reflexive , redoubled in itself : it is a name for neutral knowledge which opposes itself to common “ ideology . ”
( Even in Stalinist Marxism , which – in total opposition to Marx – uses the term “ ideology ” in a positive sense , ideology is opposed to science : first , Marxists analyze society in a neutral scientific way ; then , in order to mobilize the masses , they translate their insights into “ ideology . ”
All one has to add here is that this “ Marxist science ” opposed to ideology is ideology at its purest . )
There is thus a duality inscribed into the very notion of ideology : ( 1 ) “ mere ideology ” as the spontaneous self - apprehension of individuals with all their prejudices ; ( 2 ) neutral , “ value - free ” knowledge to be applied onto society to engineer its development .
In other words , ideology always is ( or , rather , appears ) as its own species .

Even some Lacanians praise democracy as the “ institutionalization of the lack in the Other ” : the premise of democracy is that no political agent is a priori legitimized to hold power , that the place of power is empty , open up to competition .
However , by institutionalizing the lack , democracy neutralizes – normalizes – it , so that the big Other is again here in the guise of the democratic legitimization of our acts – in a democracy , my acts are “ covered ” as the legitimate acts which carry out the will of the majority .

The limit of this historicism is discernible in the way it coincides with ruthlessly measuring all the past with our own standards .
It is easy to imagine the same person who , on the one hand , warns against imposing on the other cultures our Eurocentric values , and , on the other hand , advocating that classics like Mark Twain ’s Tom Sawyer – Huck Finn novels should be removed from school libraries because they are racially insensitive in their portrayal of Blacks and Native Americans …

The tiger may be more ancient and distinct than we thought .
Tigers are less closely related to lions , leopards and jaguars than these other big cats are to each other , according to a new comprehensive study .
The genetic analysis also reveals the tiger began evolving 3.2 million years ago , and its closest living relative is the equally endangered snow leopard .
The discovery comes as the BBC launches a collection of intimate videos of wild tigers and the threats they face .
Despite the popularity and endangered status of tigers , much remains to be discovered about them , including how they evolved .
It has long been known that the five species of big cat - the tiger , lion , leopard , jaguar and snow leopard , which belong to the Panthera genus - and the two species of clouded leopard are more closely related to each other than to other smaller cats .
But it has been difficult to pin down the exact relationships between them .
So to find out more , scientists Mr Brian Davis , Dr Gang Li and Professor William Murphy conducted an analysis of the DNA of all these species .
By looking at similarities in DNA held in mitochondria and within the sex chromosomes among other places , the researchers found that the five big cat species are related to each other in a different way to previously thought .
Their data strongly suggests that lions , leopards and jaguars are most closely related to each other .
Their ancestor split from other cats around 4.3 to 3.8 million years ago .
About 3.6 to 2.5 million years ago , the jaguar began to evolve , while lions and leopards split from one other about 3.1 to 1.95 million years ago .
But the tiger had already emerged by this point .
The ancestor of tigers and snow leopards also branched off around 3.9 million years ago .
The tiger then began to evolve into a unique species toward the end of the Pliocene epoch , about 3.2 million years ago .

That makes the tiger and snow leopard " sister species " , the researchers report in the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution .
Both tigers and snow leopards are among the world 's most endangered big cats .
Fewer than 3500 tigers are thought to survive in the wild .
One subspecies , the Sumatran tiger , is so enigmatic that the first film of a wild individual was only recorded this year , and Indonesia is considering entrusting them to private individuals for safe - keeping .
Last year , a study revealed that the largest sub species , the Amur tiger , may be on the genetic brink , as so few individuals remain .
Young people and their parents had two reasons to celebrate yesterday ’s passage of the sweeping health care reform bill .
In addition to extending the age limit under which children are covered by parents ’ insurance from 18 to 26 , the bill included a historic change in college financial aid .
For four decades , the student loan program has relied on private lenders , which were both subsidized and guaranteed by the government .
The bill ( an updated form of the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act ) , removes those “ middlemen ” from the equation , at a projected savings of $ 61 billion dollars .
The United States Student Association ( USSA ) campaigned hard for the change , calling it “ inexcusable to continue the current student loan system , which is nothing more than corporate welfare . ”
Other organizations working for passage of the bill included the NAACP , the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights , and the National Council of La Raza .
Rep. George Miller ( D - CA ) , called the legislation “ the single largest investment in college affordability ever at no cost to the taxpayers . ”
The savings from the change will go towards increasing Pell Grants and funding of higher education institutions , including the historically Black colleges and community colleges , which will receive $ 4 billion .
In addition , $ 1.5 billion will be used to make it easier for student borrowers to repay their loans .
The bill will increase Pell Grants each year by the consumer price index , but proposes no additional increases over the next two years and a modest increase over the five years that follow .
The maximum grant will now increase to $ 5,900 .
These levels are less than President Obama and House Democrats had wanted .
The original proposal – to add an additional 1 % over and above the consumer price index – was scrapped due to Republican opposition , as was the proposal to increase the maximum grant to $ 6,900 .
$ 13.5 billion is earmarked help fill a $ 19 billion Pell Grant shortfall caused by the unemployment crisis and resulting influx of students pursuing new career training .
USSA has cautioned that “ opponents of student aid reform are gearing up for a fight , ” and has an online letter campaign aimed at the Senate , which will vote later this week .
Republican opposition to the bill is clearly based on allegiance to the bottom line for the banks , which under the old system received billions every year from the federal government to originate loans and also guaranteed loan repayment up to 97 percent .
Inclusion of the education bill in the health care reconciliation was a key part of the Democrats ’ strategy for winning .
In order to use the reconciliation method , it must be proven that the measure can help produce $ 1 billion in deficit savings over each of the next 10 years .
The health care bill alone would not have been able to show this savings , but the insertion of the education bill met that requirement .
Some of the savings ( $ 19 billion ) from cutting the private lenders out of the student loan system will go to deficit reduction and to offset expenses in the health care legislation .
The Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair is going to be held the weekend of March 13 - 14 in San Francisco at Golden Gate Park .
It ’s a great time ; it ’s also one of the largest annual Anarchist community events in North America .
And I ’m in the process of organizing a table for A.L.L. at the bookfair .
In addition to a great lineup of speakers , panels and workshops , the main event ( this is a bookfair , after all ) will be the space in main hall with dozens of vendors with tables to show off their Anarchist books and materials from 10:00 am–6:00 pm on Saturday , March 13 and 11:00 am–5:00 pm on Sunday , March 14 .
Among them will be us — members of the Alliance of the Libertarian Left from Vegas , California , and around the Western U.S. I ’ll be there , along with fellow Anarchists from Southern Nevada ALL .
We ’ll have books , journals , buttons , and more from the Southern Nevada ALL Distro available for sale as fundraisers , along with a lot of free pamphlets , smaller pieces to give away , and information about ALL as an organization and what we do back in our hometowns .
This will be Southern Nevada A.L.L.’s third appearance at an Anarchist bookfair ( after appearances at last year ’s Bay Area bookfair , and this year ’s Los Angeles bookfair ) .
These bookfairs are a real blast to work : partly because the bookfair a great opportunity to make connections with fellow Anarchists and to get the good word out about individualist anarchism , market anarchism , mutualism , counter - economics , to an audience of engaged radicals and movement anarchists .
And also because , for a dispersed , Internet - coordinated network like the A.L.L. , working the bookfair table is great opportunity to posse up with ALLies from many different towns , meet folks you ’ve only known online , have some great conversations , and work together on some practical counter - economic outreach .
( It ’s also a good opportunity for local organizing on the ground — since we can put out a sign - up sheet and get contacts for people who are interested in ALLiance in the Bay Area . )
Anyway .
If all this sounds like something you ’re down with , interested in , excited by , here ’s three things you can do :
If you ’re in the Bay Area , or will be around March 13 - 14 , drop on by the table and say hi and see what we ’re doing .
If you ’ll be there and you ’re interested in selling books or merchandise for your hometown Alliance of the Libertarian Left local — or if you ’re interested in hanging out with ALLies from other towns and helping with the table — then get in touch with me to coordinate .
We ’ll definitely have space for you , and it ’d be great to posse up .
If you want to help support the A.L.L. presence at the Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair ( and other bookfairs in the future ) , you can help us out by covering the costs of the table and the transport .
Bound Together Books just recently boosted the cost of reserving a table ( last year it was $ 100 for both days ; now it ’s $ 150 ) .
We ’re doing this on as thin a shoestring as possible .
With support from y’ALL , we can make the most of these opportunities to do local organizing , make connections between our locals , and put the word out and about among our fellow Anarchists .
Here ’s the shoestring , for reference .
ALL @ Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair 2010 shoestring budget Cost Description $ 150 Table reservation ( Saturday and Sunday ) $ 87 Car rental for transport from Vegas ( driving up Friday ; returning car Monday ) .
$ 86 Cheap hotel in Bay Area ( Friday and Saturday night ) ~ $0 ~
Gas costs will be covered by carpooling ALLies and our allies from Vegas up to the Bookfair and to the Empowering Women of Color conference , which is being held at UC Berkeley the same weekend .
Food costs will be covered through Food Not Bombs .
$ 333 Total costs
Hope to see y’ALL there !
A postáról már hazafelé vitt az utam , leparkoltam szépen , összeraktam a dolgaimat , aztán a felismerés : nincs meg a szifon .
Zsebek , kabát , táska , kocsi — sehol .
PÁNIK .
Még háromszor ugyanez a pattern , semmi .
PÁNIK .
Ezerrel pörgő gondolatok : a kocsiba beszállás előtt még megvolt a telefonom , mert írtam egy SMS -t , amíg oda sétáltam , tehát nem a postán tűnt el .
Viszont , és ezen kezdtem el igazán parázni , úgy emlékeztem , hogy a telefont az autó TETEJÉRE raktam indulás előtt .
Márpedig pénztárcával egyszer már szívtam meg így , akkor meglett szerencsére .
Nem tudtam elhinni , hogy ekkora szarvaslövő hibát követtem el .
Idegesen kapkodva beviharzottam a lakásba , kabát - bakancs , lebasztam mindent a FÖLDRE , kurvára beloginoltam a gépbe és azonnal elkezdtem két dolgot :
1. SKYPE
2. MOBILEME
A skype azért , hogy felhívjam a telefont .
Nem futott a program , SZÁZ ÉVIG loginolt .
Kiderült , hogy valami spammer közben authorizáltatni akarja magát , KICK - BAN - IGNORE gombra gondolkodás nélkül rátenyereltem .
Minden másodperc csiga lassan haladt .
Közben Safari dobott egy strandlabdát , ütöm neki a mobileme -t , mennyél már te dög , erre kiírja , hogy Find My iPhone currently not available — sorry for the inconvenience an y ád !!
Azonnal refresh .
Skype - on megcsöngettem a telefont .
Kicsöngött .
Jó jel .
Nem vette fel senki , de a lakás is néma volt .
( Kobi elég csendes jószág . )
Bejött közben a mobileme frankósra , azonnal böktem neki egy direkt message - et azzal a szöveggel , hogy hívják fel az öcsémet ezen meg ezen a számon , mellette Skype-ról hívtam öcsémet , baszott felvenni ( mint később kiderült , sztárallűr , soha nem vesz fel telefont ismeretlen hívószámról ) , írtam neki egy SMS-t .
Mindezek mellett pedig ugye kattintottam a locate my phone gombra .
Ennek ugye több id ő kell , percekig tarthat , mire megtalálja a telefont .
Megtalálta .
A lakóhelyem közelét jelölte meg , semmiképpen nem a postát .
Ez nagyon jó jel volt .
Átpakoltam mégegyszer a cuccaimat , sehol semmi , aztán azt mondtam magamnak :
“ Józsi , most te vagy RAMBÓ .
Rambó vagy bazmeg .
Fogd meg az irataidat , a kulcsaidat , vedd fel a kabátod és backtrackelj vissza a kocsival egészen a postáig .
A feladatod most az , hogy megtaláld a telefont .
Vegyél ki egy kis sminket Linda szettjéből , kend a fejedre , mert most te va gy Rambó .
A telefonnak szüksége van rád . ”
Az autóban megtaláltam az anyósülés alatt .
Leesett valahogy .
Húbazmeg. 40 éves lettem !!!
Remek cucc egyébként a MobileMe dolga , mert legalább megtudtam , hogy a lakás körül kell keresnem .
Komolyan .
Ha nem így lett volna , nem kezdem el az autót újra átvizsgálni .
Lehet , hogy hosszabbítok egy év előfizetést ezek után .
Sokba kerül , de az , hogy van benne üzenetküldés , helymeghatározás , remote lock és wipe — ilyenkor kiderül , mennyit is ér .
Függöny .
Israel 's Supreme Court has ordered the release of an Australian woman who was arrested during a pre-dawn military raid in the West Bank .
Bridgette Chappell , 22 , from Canberra , was arrested with a Spanish woman after Israeli soldiers burst into the apartment they shared in Ramallah .
The Israeli government says Ms Chappell , who was studying Arabic and politics at Birzeit University in the West Bank , was arrested for overstaying her visa .
But she was also active in the International Solidarity Movement ( ISM ) - a pro-Palestinian organisation committed to resisting Israel 's occupation of the West Bank .
Israel alleged Ms Chappell had taken part in illegal protests against Israel 's occupation of the West Bank .
But Ms Chappell 's lawyer argued in court that Israel had no jurisdiction in Ramallah on matters unrelated to security .
Ms Chappell lashed out at Israel from the dock before being led away .
" It 's completely illegal what they 're doing .
They 're trying to crush the popular resistance in Palestine , " she said .
The court has ordered the women 's release on bail until it can consider their appeals against deportation .
They have been ordered not to return to the West Bank .
Ms Chapell says she is currently in Tel Aviv and has been in touch with the Australian consulate .
" It 's still pretty up in the air .
I was released but I also have to appear in court again , " she said .
" I can stay as long as the trial continues but we 'll see what happens .
I 'm really going to try and fight to stay as long as I can . "
She said that on the night of the raid she woke up at 3 am to heavy banging on her door at the headquarters of the ISM in Ramallah .
" I looked out the window and I could see a line of army jeeps outside in the street .
The next thing I knew about 15 soldiers came bursting into the house pointing their guns at us , " she told ABC radio .
" The soldiers barged in , pointed their guns at us and asked us for our passports , which is actually illegal .
" IDF ( Israel Defence Force ) soldiers do n't have the jurisdiction to ask you for your passports .
" It was ridiculous .
It was a complete military operation .
The IDF can say it was to do with our visas all they like but we know that 's not the real reason .
It was a very convenient excuse for them to take us . "

GDB : The GNU Project Debugger
GDB : The GNU Project Debugger
What is GDB ?
GDB , the GNU Project debugger , allows you to see what is going on `inside ' another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed .
GDB can do four main kinds of things ( plus other things in support of these ) to help you catch bugs in the act :
Start your program , specifying anything that might affect its behavior .
Make your program stop on specified conditions .
Examine what has happened , when your program has stopped .
Change things in your program , so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another .
What Languages does GDB Support ?
Ada
Assembly
C
C++
D
Fortran
Go
Objective -C
OpenCL
Modula-2
Pascal
Rust

Russia Plays Space Monopoly With Soyuz Rides
by Staff Writers
Moscow ( AFP ) Feb 9 , 2010
Russia , which is set to hold a monopoly on flights to the international space station ( ISS ) , wants to charge more for rides on its Soyuz rocket , the space agency head said Tuesday .
" At a meeting of the space agency chiefs in Tokyo , I want to discuss the maintenance of transport to the station , " Roskomos head Anatoly Perminov was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying .
" We have an agreement until 2012 that Russia will be responsible for this .
But after that ?
Excuse me but the prices should be absolutely different then ! "
When NASA retires its long - serving shuttle fleet as planned later this year , the United States and other countries will be wholly dependent on Russia to fly the station 's six - man crew to and from orbit .
NASA has signed a deal worth 306 million dollars ( 224 million euros ) with Roskomos for six rides to the ISS in 2012 and 2013 , or a charge of 51 million dollars per US astronaut .
But with space now limited aboard the Soyuz rocket , Russia looks set to curb its lucrative space tourism service , for which it had charged cosmos-crazed tycoons 35 million dollars ( 28 million euros ) for the ultimate adventure .
The floating ISS research station was to be closed in 2015 and ditched in ocean like its predecessor the Russian Mir station , but the 16 countries involved are in talks to extend the station 's life to 2020 .
A US - backed proposal to ban the international trade of polar bear skins , teeth and claws was defeated today at a UN wildlife meeting over concerns it would hurt indigenous economies and arguments the practice did n't pose a significant threat to the animals .
The US argued at the 175 - nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species , or Cites , that the sale of polar bears skins was compounding the loss of the animals ' sea ice habitat due to climate change .
There are projections that the bear 's numbers , which are estimated at 20,000 to 25,000 , could decline by two - thirds by 2050 because of habitat loss in the Arctic .
" We 're disappointed , " said Jane Lyder , the Department of Interior 's deputy assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks .
" But we understand that Cites is still trying to understand how to incorporate climate change into its decision making . "
Canada , along with Norway and Greenland , led the opposition to the US proposal .
They said the threat from trade was minimal and the hunting done by Aboriginal communities was critical to their economies .
Only 2 % of Canadian polar bears are internationally traded and the country strictly manages the commerce , Canada said .
" There is no doubt that action must continue to ensure the conservation of polar bears .
Canada 's goal is long - term survival of polar bears , " the Canadian representative Basile Van Havre said .
" But Canada does not think the proposal is supported by facts . "
Frank Pokiak , an indigenous leader from Canada , said communities in the Arctic have hunted bears for generations , mostly for meat and pelts for clothing and shelter .
He said they hunt them in a sustainable way and would continue doing so with or without an international ban .
" We have always cared for land and the wildlife because we have a lot to lose , " Pokiak told delegates .
" If it was n't for polar bears and other wildlife that we harvest , we would n't exist today . "
The big white bear , the world 's largest land meat - eater , nanuq to the Inuit , may be uniquely susceptible to climate change as rising temperatures fast shrink its habitat , the Arctic sea ice .
Many bears spend their whole lives on the ice , mating , giving birth and hunting for their main prey , the ringed seal .
But Arctic summers may be almost free of sea ice within 30 years , the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted last April .
Data available on polar bear trade shows that since the early 1990s the market for polar bear carcasses and parts has increased .
From 1992 to 2006 , approximately 31,294 live polar bears , carcasses or parts were exported to 73 different countries , according to data collected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species .
Skins are the most popular export item , and Canada is the largest commercial exporter .
Almost immediately after Google Buzz launched , people started raising privacy concerns ( “ F*ck You , Google ” ) .
But Google quickly responded with a series of fixes .
So did the PR move work ?
Yup .
Social media monitoring and analytics company Viralheat analyzed thousands of Tweets about Buzz , prior to the privacy hubbub and after :
Basically , Google managed to squash them before anyone wrapped their heads around the service–and the pretty vast privacy loophooles that existed up front with Buzz .
The graphic is basically a diagram of what any crisis - management team lusts after .
The privacy flap itself seemed to get largely drowned out by the initial hype ; once that hype died down , the lull in interest also muted the backlash .
Thus , it seems not to have even registered before Google nipped the problem .
And then after that , Buzz seems to have settled happily into overwhelmingly positive responses .
Which goes to show you :
When something goes wrong , act swiftly and comprehensively .
Do n’t be Toyota .
Their mistake was n’t in handling the current crisis–it was already too late then .
Rather , it was burying all the previous crises before , so that they all boiled over at once .

Nature editor Philip Campbell forced out of independent panel after saying there was nothing to suggest a cover up by scientists at the University of East Anglia
A member of an independent panel to investigate claims that climate scientists covered up flawed data on global warming has been forced to resign after sceptics questioned his impartiality .
Philip Campbell , editor in chief of Nature , stepped down from the panel yesterday , just hours after its official launch , after an interview emerged in which he said there was nothing to suggest a cover - up by climate scientists at the University of East Anglia .
Resigning , Campbell said : " I made the remarks in good faith , on the basis of media reports of the leaks .
As I have made clear subsequently , I support the need for a full review of the facts behind the leaked emails .
There must be nothing that calls into question the ability of the independent review to complete this task , and therefore I have decided to withdraw from the team . "
Sir Muir Russell , the chairman of the inquiry , said : " I regret the loss of his expertise , but I respect his decision . "
In an interview last year with Chinese state radio , Campbell said : " The scientists have not hidden the data .
If you look at the emails , there is one or two bits of language that are jargon used between professionals that suggest something to outsiders that is wrong .
In fact , the only problem there has been is on some official restrictions on their ability to disseminate data , otherwise they have behaved as researchers should . "
The interview , posted on the Bishop Hill blog run by the climate sceptic Andrew Montford and shown on Channel 4 News , risked undermining Muir 's claim that the inquiry team was impartial .
A press statement about the panel members said : " They were selected on the basis that they have no prejudicial interest in climate change and climate science , and for the contribution they can make to the issues of the review . "
The inquiry was set up and paid for by the university after allegations that the emails , released in November , showed scientists had manipulated data , censored critics and failed to comply with requests to share their data with critics .
Campbell was invited to sit on the panel because of his expertise in the peer review process as editor of one of the world 's most renowned science journals .
Nature has published some of the most significant papers on climate change research , including those supporting the " hockey stick " graph of historical temperatures condemned by climate sceptics .
The review is one of a handful into the affair , dubbed " climategate " by some commentators , which has focused attention on climate science andprovoked calls for resignations .
Separately , the university yesterday said it had asked the Royal Society , Britain 's premier scientific academy , to help reappraise the unit 's scientific conclusions .
Trevor Davies , pro-vice chancellor of the university , said : " The process and findings of our researchers have been the subject of significant debate in recent months .
Colleagues in Climate Research
Unit have strenuously defended their conduct and the published work , and we believe it is in the interests of all concerned that there should be an additional assessment considering the science itself . "
The balance organs live deep inside the ear Minute organs hidden deep within the ear appear to directly alter blood flow to the brain , scientists have revealed .
Until now , experts thought the inner ear 's job was to control balance alone .
But the Harvard Medical School team , working with Nasa , found the balance organs also affect brain blood flow in their study involving 24 people .
They told BMC Neuroscience journal that the connection probably evolved to enable man to stand upright and still get enough blood up to the brain .
The organs of balance are deep within the ear , inside a maze of bony chambers .
Off kilter
Two sacs , called the utricle and saccule , make up the inner ear 's vestibule and three fluid - filled loops , known as the semi- circular canals , detect the rotation and tilting movements of the head .
Dr Jorge Serrador and his team from Harvard Medical School asked 24 healthy people to undergo a range of tests normally used on astronauts .
These included a tilt test where the individual sits strapped to a chair that is then tilted to different angles , plus a ride inside a giant , spinning centrifuge .
Standing up places the head above the heart and thus makes it harder to provide blood flow to the brain
Dr Jorge Serrador
In this way , the researchers were able to stimulate the different parts of the balance organs and monitor the effects on blood flow around the body .
This revealed that the utricle and saccule , also known as the otoliths , directly affected brain blood flow regulation , independent of other factors , such as blood pressure .
Dr Serrador explained why the connection may exist : " Standing up places the head above the heart and thus makes it harder to provide blood flow to the brain .
" Having a connection between the otoliths , which tell us that we are standing , and the cerebrovasculature may be part of the adaption that allows us to maintain our brain blood flow when upright .
" The knowledge gained from this study might lead to new treatment options for these conditions . "
Age link
For example , some people who suffer from faints and dizzy spells when they stand up quickly , known as postural hypotension , could have poor brain blood flow linked to underlying inner ear problems , he said .
Ear , nose and throat expert Andrew McCombe , of ENT UK , said the balance organs may be one of the many reflexes that ensures our blood is sent to where it is needed .
" It makes sense that any organ that tells you that you are standing upright and not lying down will do this .
" And we know that as we age the whole inner ear does not work so well , so this may be involved in postural hypotension . "
But he said it was only a small part of the equation , alongside the heart and blood vessels .

﻿﻿Like most programmers , I suppose , I ’m arrogant enough to think I ’m pretty good ( although see The Dunning - Kruger effect ) .
But through the last thirty years ’ programming , I ’ve worked with plenty who I know are better than me .
Today I want to talk about three of them , and about how very different their skills are ; and I ’ll finish up by thinking about what the rest of us can learn from them , and what we can do to maximize our own abilities .
I agonized about whether to name them , but eventually concluded that I can say more about their work if I am specific ; and what the heck , they might enjoy being held up as examples .
They certainly deserve it !
So step forward ( in chronological order ) Steve Sykes , Mike Selway and Adam Dickmeiss !
The hacker : Stephen Sykes
I met Steve back at Warwick University in , I think , 1986 , and we ’ve been in touch on and off ever since .
Our first interaction was him introducing me to GNU Emacs , which has been my editor of choice pretty much ever since , and he is one of the very few people I know who ’s contributed patches to the Emacs kernel ( and had them accepted ) .
I ’ve seen him track down bugs in the Emacs event loop for fun ; I seem to remember him also fixing bugs in GDB , although that might be my memory playing tricks on me .
I ’ve sometimes joked of Steve that when he needs to write a program , he starts with any other randomly chosen chunk of code , and debugs it until it does what he wants .
As far as I know , that ’s not literally true … but I can imagine how it might be .
I ’d say that Steve ’s greatest asset , aside for his sheer appetite for detail , is his knack of looking at other people ’s code and very quickly understanding its intent .
I do n’t know how it feels from behind his eyes ( I might interview him here one day if he ’s up for it ) , but to me it seems little short of magical : it ’s almost as though he just looks at the tarball and somehow zens it .
I do n’t know , but I ’m guessing he does n’t suffer from Framework Fear : probably he can zen the stacks of massive documentation that go with these things , intuitively finding the half - dozen pages out of thousands that tell him what he actually needs to know .
Maybe the best evidence of Steve ’s knack for seeing order in the midst of chaos is his run of winning entries in the IOCCC ( International Obfuscated C Code Competition ) : he won the prestigious Best Abuse of Indentation category in 2004 , followed it up with the 2005 award for Best Emulator , and completed the hat - trick in 2006 with not one but two awards : Best Assembler and Best One - Liner .
His winning entries are available on his own web - site .
The 2005 entry is my favourite , and I think it ’s frankly a disgrace that it did n’t win Best of Show : in 3.5 Kb of source code which forms an ASCII - art picture of a Commodore Pet , he wrote a PET emulator , which provides enough hardware to load and run programs from virtual tape in both 6502 machine code and BASIC ( the latter using an image of Commodore ’s ROM , of course ) .
Of the programmers I discuss here , Steve is the one who most resembles the prototypical “ hacker ” ( in the original , positive sense ) .
If I were NASA , and realised thirty minutes before a probe was due to enter the Martian atmosphere that there was a bug in the machine code controlling the landing sequence , Steve would be person I ’d want tracking it down and fixing it .
( Admittedly , by the time the fix was transmitted to Mars , it would be too late to help , but you have to make the effort . )
The architect : Michael Selway
After I left Warwick , I spent nine years working for System Simulation , a small but long - lived software house based in Covent Garden , London .
( I am told that the building where we had our office , above the Rock Garden cafe , was previously a banana warehouse . )
System Sim have been going for well over thirty years , and in that time they ’ve grown and shrunk and repurposed more times that it would be easy to track , but when I joined I became the fifth member of the team — and the third called Mike .
We were referred to informally as Mike 1 , Mike 2 , and Mike 3 ; or sometimes as Mike 40 , Mike 30 and Mike 20 , since that ’s how old we were at the time .
Since then , the company ’s gone from strength to strength , and now employs lots more people .
Mike 2 was Mike Selway , who ’s still with System Sim after what must be the best part of 30 years now .
I hesitated about calling him an “ architect ” above because that word seems in recent years to have come to mean someone who toys with UML diagrams all day and never writes any code , which could not be further from Mike ; but the word divested of this connotation fits , so I used it .
Mike was and is The Main Guy behind Index + , a proprietary non-relational database optimised for structured and textual data and widely used in museums and art galleries — the system that much of System Sim ’s work is based on .
I wish I could show you the code ( they ’ve been talking on and off about open - sourcing it for about ten years , but nothing seems to have come of it yet ) because it is the most beautifully structured C you could ever wish to see .
It ’s a significant chunk of software that covers everything from low - level details like the forms of compression used for the bit-patterns that represent the indexes on disk , up through a network / RPC layer to an application - level API and a set of application libraries — yet the whole thing makes perfect sense .
The code was a joy to work on , and gives the lie to the idea that C ca n’t be used for big , complex systems .
( That ’s not to say that other languages would n’t be a better bet these days , but remember that the core of the code dates back to the days before C++ was a realistic option , let alone Java or Ruby . )
Putting a body of code like that together , and keeping it coherent across decades as multiple other people work on it , is no simple task .
I was going to write that Mike has the talent of holding the whole of a complex system in his head , but actually that ’s not it .
His skill lies in designing that system in such a way that you do n’t have to hold it all in your head at once .
In a sense , that ’s “ only ” encapsulation ; but doing it right is an art - form .
Mike also cares more about the beauty of his code than anyone else I know .
He was talking about code - quality metrics long before the idea caught on ; he talked about , and practiced , refactoring decades before the word was coined .
It ’s not enough for him that code merely works ; it has to be right in a deep sense .
When I am installed as NASA Supremor , I ’m going to get Mike to design the probe - landing code ; that way , I wo n’t need to get Steve in to debug it at the last moment .
The superhero : Adam Dickmeiss
Since 2002 , I ’ve worked more or less full - time for Index Data , another small software house , based in Denmark and the USA , with offices also in England ( that ’s me ! ) , Germany and Canada .
( Yes , that is a lot of offices for eleven of us — we ’re a very distributed company . )
We started sixteen years ago as the joint project of Sebastian Hammer and Adam Dickmeiss , releasing open source software such as the YAZ Toolkit and the Zebra database from day one .
In fact , I used some of this software in my work with System Sim , and it was the quality of their code that drew me to Index Data a couple of years later .
Most people at Index Data are pretty hardcore coders , but I think most of us would admit that Adam is on a different plane again .
To be frank , he frightens me a little bit .
All the tricky stuff that the rest of us have to sit and think about — events , concurrency , asynchronicity — he seems to just chew up and spit out without having to think about it .
I think he has the widest mind I ’ve ever encountered .
An anecdote might illustrate it .
In the world of libraries , which is where we do a lot of our work , the most important standard protocol is the seductively named ANSI / NISO Z39.50 , an old - school binary - on - the - wire protocol in which the packets are defined in an ancient IDL called ASN.1 and encoded using BER .
If you ’ve never heard of these technologies , that ’s forgiveable : although they are robust , efficient and battle - proven , they are profoundly unfashionable , and so near the turn of the millennium , the Z39.50 implementors ’ group decided to recast the Z39.50 semantics in more web - friendly terms , as a protocol implemented over HTTP and using XML for the encoding .
( In an easy - to - avert disaster , the resulting family of protocols was given , if possible , an even less memorable name : SRW / SRU .
But that ’s not my point right now .
Another time , I might rant about the importance of names , but not today . )
So we had a problem : one of the most important tools in the kit was what we call the Generic Frontend Server , or GFS for short : a Z39.50 server framework that calls out to application - specified handler functions to fulfill searches and other requests .
But some customers were going to want to send SRW / SRU requests instead of classic Z39.50 .
And to make it worse , that ugly SRW / SRU designation hides two distinct though related protocols : SRW uses SOAP , and SRU uses HTTP GET requests and raw XML responses .
We could make two new GFSs or — I discussed this possibility with Seb — might we possibly find a way to extend the existing GFS so that it could handle all three protocols ?
We started to email back and forth , discussing whether such a thing might be feasible , scoping out the possible approaches , starting to think about how much time we ’d need to allocate .
And ( as you no doubt saw coming ) , in the middle of this flood of emails came a CVS commit notification : not knowing about our discussion , Adam had gone right ahead and implemented the two new protocols into the GFS — seemingly not even realising that it was a big deal .
Not only that , he ’d made it so that a single listener on a single port could accept all kinds of connections , and would sniff the first incoming packet to decide which set of handlers to use .
And while he was at it , he ’d upgraded the GFS so that it could act as a generic HTTP server in its spare time ( so it could provide , for example , XSLT stylesheets to be used in rendering SRU responses as human - readable HTML ) .
Well , I mean to say .
It ’s embarrassing .
Adam would be a lot scarier if he was n’t such a nice bloke .
I just hope his brain has an industrial - sized heatsink , because it ’s obvious that he ’s overclocking that baby .
If I do n’t become NASA supremor until one week before the Mars probe is launched , then Adam is the person I ’ll get in to write the control software in a real hurry .
And the winner is …
Haha , as if I ’m going to pick one !
Not gonna happen .
The interesting thing about these three programmers , to me , is that each of them surpasses me along a different dimension .
Of the three , Steve would likely be the best at immediately grokking someone else ’s code ; Adam would probably produce a given program more quickly than Mike , but Mike ’s version would likely be easier for mortals to maintain .
( Sometimes Adam ’s very wizardliness can be an impediment : he thinks nothing of dashing off a 300 - line C++ function that fits comfortably into his skull but not so easily into our mortal minds . )
I do know that it ’s been a privilege to know and work with all three .
But what can I learn from them ?
I ‘d like to wrap up this article with a nice , neat bow .
You know the kind of thing : “ from Steve , I learned the importance of understanding state transition ; from Mike I learned that every human being is beautiful and unique ; from Adam I learned to trust in myself and follow my dream ” .
But it does n’t actually work that way .
Although there are surely plenty of micro-techniques I could learn from Steve and Adam ( and hopefully have done ) , the bottom line is that both of them have intrinsic skills and abilities — maybe the best word is capacities — that I just do n’t have .
In a way , trying to learn programming by reading their code is like trying to improve your football by watching a superhuman genius like Matthew Le Tissier — the only lesson is “ be incredibly skillful ” .
But maybe I can do better at learning from Mike .
I do n’t know whether it ’s because design and organisation are more transferrable skills than debugging and wizardry , or because Mike is so intentional about software quality , or just because his quality of Goodness happens to be a better match for where my own natural aptitudes lie , but I think I ’ve benefitted most from working with him .
Like me , Mike is a disciple of those old Bell Labs Guys With Beards ( hereafter OBLGWBs ) —
Thompson , Ritchie , Kernighan and their buddies , who gave us Unix and C , but also a legacy of outstanding books that embody important principles of software design .
In my earlier review of The Elements of Programming Style , I drew attention to the second rule in the book — “ Say what you mean , simply and directly ” .
Mike ’s programming is a lesson in how applying that principle absolutely does not mean dumbing down — there is Deep Magic in the low levels of Index + — but does mean making the magic as comprehensible as possible .
That is high and lofty goal .
And in my own best code , I think or hope that I approach that ideal — at least , much more closely than I do Steve ’s and Adam ’s qualities .
If you ’ll forgive me a moment of immodesty , there are times when I re-read some of my own code , and my mental reaction is just “ yes , of course ” .
The code looks obvious ; in retrospect , it seems impossible that it could have been written any other way .
But of course getting it into that state is not so trivial as it looks .
A great ski racer makes skiing look easy , but that impression of ease is gained only with years of learning , experience and practice ; ease is attained only by great effort .
And as we strive to write simple code , we need to recognise that simplicity is attained by the same means .
Update ( 22 March 2010 )
Some good discussion at Reddit .
Also at Hacker News .
The interesting thing here for me is that ( based admittedly on a very small sample ) , programmers seem to self - classify more or less evenly into these three buckets .
Barack Obama confirmed the details of a new nuclear arms - reduction treaty with Russia this morning .
The agreement is our first major step in arms - reduction since 1991 .
Now we just need 8 Senate Republicans to vote to ratify it .
And I am sure that 'll be easy .
Right ?
What possible problem could the Republicans have with an agreement to reduce our stockpiles of deployed warheads by 30 % ?
Of course , this represents long overdue action on an issue tackled by both Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush .
Arms control treaties have been a broadly bipartisan goal for decades .
Which is to say that there will soon be a shitload of pressure from the Fox / activist wing of the Republican party to deny Obama the 67 Senate votes needed to ratify this carefully negotiated treaty .
Which will be hilarious !
We can't wait to see Tea Party signs about Putin and nukes .
Get crackin ' , patriots !
( But the correct talking points have obviously not yet been finalized : The Corner so far has one completely incomprehensible Bart Stupak joke and no other right - bloggers seem to have come up with a good reason to be outraged yet .
Give it time ! )

BEIJING / HONG KONG ( Reuters ) -
Two days after shutting its Chinese portal over censorship , Google Inc said it plans to phase out deals to provide filtered search services to other online or mobile firms in China .
It has already been shunned by at least one of those partner firms and was attacked by a state newspaper after pulling the plug on its mainland Chinese language portal Google.cn .
It now reroutes searches to an unfiltered Hong Kong site .
The Google dispute , which involves cyber attacks as well as Internet censorship , is one of many thorny trade , financial , political and security issues that are roiling U.S. - China ties this year .
On Wednesday , Google ’s search services remained erratic across Beijing , frustrating users unsure about the future of its other services -- from maps to music -- over two months after its bombshell announcement it may quit China .
While Google is the world ’s top search engine , it held only an estimated 30 percent share of China ’s search market in 2009 , compared with home - grown rival Baidu Inc ’s 60 percent .
Activists who gathered at Google ’s Beijing headquarters to show support appeared to be Google ’s only vocal allies in China .
Google said it is not providing direct access to censored searches , but will fulfil existing contracts with other firms .
“ We have over a dozen syndication deals with partners in China .
We obviously have contractual obligations to them , which we want to honor , ” a Singapore - based Google spokeswoman said .
“ Over time , we will not be syndicating censored search to partners in China .
But we will of course fulfil our existing contractual obligations , ” she added .
Google has already been taken off the popular tom.com portal , owned by Li Ka-shing , a Hong Kong billionaire who is one of the richest men in the world and has good ties to Beijing , according to Bloomberg .
Many of Google ’s often well - educated , professional fan - base in China , who use the company ’s software for both work and play , said they were already suffering some fallout on Wednesday with erratic service .
Several of Google ’s international search sites were failing to open , and when they could be accessed some users found that all searches , including for non-sensitive terms like “ hello , ” were returning blank pages or error messages .
Businesses , university students and people in private homes reported intermittent problems on the main Google.com site , the Google.co.uk site and Google.ca .

“ Google.com.hk is not currently being blocked , although it seems that some sensitive terms are .
However , if you search for a sensitive term and trigger a government blockage , that may affect subsequent searches ... for a short period , ” Google said .
ACTIVISTS SUPPORT
Around 100 people , including human rights lawyers and other activists , gathered at Google ’s Beijing base late on Tuesday -- the day when news of the pullout reached China -- to pay tribute .
After arguments with police , they approached the company ’s door to leave messages including “ Google forever ” and “ Long live freedom ! , ” said Teng Biao , a prominent activist who visited the building after a rights meeting .
“ It will bring some inconvenience , but we really support this move by Google .
They put freedom of expression ahead of business , and we hope that it will encourage more people to pay attention to human rights situation in China , ” Teng told Reuters by phone .
But Google ’s move has angered the government , and on Wednesday an official Communist Party newspaper accused it of colluding with U.S. spies , in China ’s latest blast at the company .
“ Google is not a virgin when it comes to values .
Its cooperation and collusion with the U.S. intelligence and security agencies is well - known , ” a front page commentary in the overseas edition of the People ’s Daily said .
“ All this makes one wonder .
Thinking about the United States ’ big efforts in recent years to engage in Internet war , perhaps this could be an exploratory pre-dawn battle , ” the paper said .
Minority Leader John Boehner has posted an 8 second clip of Rep. Alcee Hastings saying " All these rules around here , we make 'em up as we go along . "
It is flying around the wingnutisphere .
The reason the clip is only 8 seconds is because in the preceding 10 seconds , Mr. Hastings attributes the comment to Thomas Edison .
I have extracted the Rep . Hasting 's broader statement below the fold .

“ So now we give just the objective facts , ” Díaz says as he sits facing me in a stuffy , windowless rear room of the radio station , in Nuevo Casas Grandes ’s central business district .
He and the co-host of his afternoon show , David Andrew ( pronounced Da-veed An - dray - oo ) , explain that the “ objective facts ” are those reported by the police or city hall or some other official source .
Though the accuracy of such facts is often questionable , no questions dare be asked .
“ We say nothing more , ” Díaz adds .
“ As long as we do n’t get too deeply into a story , we are safe . ”
I am reminded of Winnie Verloc , the character in Joseph Conrad ’s The Secret Agent who “ felt profoundly that things do not stand much looking into . ”
More than 14,000 people have been killed in the almost three years since President Felipe Calderón mobilized the army to fight Mexico ’s half - dozen major drug cartels .
Virtually none of those homicides has been solved , partly because witnesses suffer short - term memory loss when questioned , and partly because the police , for various reasons , also feel profoundly that things do not stand much looking into .
Rodríguez ’s death is illustrative .
His colleagues believe he was killed for an article he wrote linking relatives of Patricia González , the Chihuahuan state attorney general , to narcotics trafficking .
That is not idle theorizing .
Jorge Luis Aguirre , a writer for LaPolaka.com , an online Juárez news service , had written extensively about corruption in the Chihuahuan state government , and did not spare González either .
On the night of November 13 , 2008 , as he was driving to Rodríguez ’s wake , he got a call on his cell phone .
The male caller said , “ You ’re next , son of a bitch ! ” and hung up .
Aguirre immediately packed up his wife and sons and fled to El Paso , where he sought asylum .
In March , testifying at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs , he stated that he ’d identified the source of the threats :
“ Victor Valencia , a representative of the governor of the state of Chihuahua , had sent people to warn me to ‘ tone down ’ my criticisms of the prosecutor , Patricia González , because if I did n’t , he was going to kill me , using the Juárez cartel ’s preferred method of kidnapping followed by execution . ”
The aftermath reveals a lot about today ’s Mexico .
Patricia González remains in her post .
Victor Valencia has been promoted to chief of public security in Juárez .
The federal deputy attorney general handling the Rodríguez murder case , Jesús Martín Huerta Yedra , was shot to death in his car , along with his secretary .
The investigation has since gone nowhere , to no one ’s surprise .
As the newspaper El Diario editorialized ,
Friends of the journalist , who preferred not to give their names for security reasons , mentioned that they do not feel frustrated by the lack of advances in the case since from the beginning , they felt that the authorities had no intention of doing anything to clarify the crime .
To clarify the crime .
Of the many things Mexico lacks these days , clarity is near the top of the list .
It is dangerous to know the truth .
Finding it is frustrating .
Statements by U.S. and Mexican government officials , repeated by a news media that prefers simple story lines , have fostered the impression in the United States that the conflict in Mexico is between Calderón ’s white hats and the crime syndicates ’ black hats .
The reality is far more complicated , as suggested by this statistic : out of those 14,000 dead , fewer than 100 have been soldiers .
Presumably , army casualties would be far higher if the war were as straightforward as it ’s often made out to be .
When Alexander Lebedev and his son , Evgeny , took over The Evening Standard of London 14 months ago , the media coverage focused on the father ’s status as a former K.G.B. agent and Russian oligarch , and on both men ’s taste in beautiful women .
Many news reports asked whether they would be an unhealthy influence on one of Britain ’s major newspapers .
By last Thursday , when they struck a deal to buy another respected but failing British paper , The Independent , the question had become whether the Lebedevs had improbably emerged as among the best hopes for preserving serious journalism in Britain .
“ I think it was too flattering for me , ” Alexander Lebedev , 50 , said wryly of the recent coverage , in an interview by telephone from Moscow , while on his way to meet a business partner , Mikhail Gorbachev , the former Soviet leader .
“ I hope I do n’t get spoiled . ”
Reports in Britain on the Independent deal once again mentioned his K.G.B. past , his vast riches ( $ 2 billion , according to Forbes ) and his political aspirations .
But this time around , much of it also credited the Lebedevs with keeping alive two money - losing daily papers that probably would have died without the new owners , and not interfering with The Standard ’s news coverage .
UK Inflation Smashes Through 3 % , Hits 3.5 % , Bank of England Says Don't Panic !
The inflation mega - trend continues to forcefully manifest itself in the continuing surge higher of UK Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) which soared from 2.9 % to 3.5 % for January data .
Inflation has virtually doubled in a little over 2 months rising from 1.9 % for November data to now stand at 3.5 % , the surge in inflation has caught the whole mainstream media and academic economists by surprise that barely 2 months ago were still contemplating deflation .
The RPI continued its spike higher rising to 3.7 % from 2.4 % the month before , and the real UK inflation rate as measured by the Market Oracle rose from 2.7 % to now stand at 4.3 % .
Mervyn King , the Governor of the Bank of England was forced to write a letter to Alistair Darling to explain why he is incapable of doing his job i.e. keeping CPI inflation within the 1 % and 2 % band .
The excuses contained within his latest letter include the VAT rise to 17.5 % and rise in petrol prices , both of which he sees as highly temporary .
Therefore it will be interesting to see what he writes in the letters to follow during the next 6 months as inflation stays above 3 % .
My analysis since November has been warning of a spike in UK inflation as part of an anticipated inflation mega- trend ( 18 Nov 2009 - Deflationists Are WRONG , Prepare for the INFLATION Mega - Trend ) that culminated in the forecast of 27th December 2009 ( UK CPI Inflation Forecast 2010 , Imminent and Sustained Spike Above 3 % ) as the following updated graph shows today 's inflation rate is virtually exactly inline with the forecast that continues to project towards a sustained trend of above 3 % for most of the year :
During 2010 the workers of Britain will increasingly be squeezed by the twin forces of inflation and tax hikes that could spark the dreaded wage price spiral that the Bank of England so fears , hence the repeatedly soothing public words that soaring inflation is temporary whilst privately panicking that they have lost control of inflation .
Workers under intense pressure could boil over during the summer into serious civil unrest on a scale not seen since the 1980's , especially after the next general election when the realisation dawns that Britain is EXACTLY where GREECE is in terms of the impact of the debt crisis and requirement for steep tax hikes and severe spending cuts .
Whilst the risk of wage price spiral is still some way off , which usually follows a prolonged period of worker discontent , i.e. a outbreak of strikes right across the country which so far to large extent has yet to materialise as a consequence of the high unemployment following the recession .
Therefore the risks of a wage price spiral are more likely to occur during 2011 than 2010 as British workers are forced to endure the pain , the only outlet for which they have is the next General Election .
However the government recognising this , is engaged in a policy of bankrupting Britain to minimise voter discontent .
Apart from hitting workers in terms of falling pay in real terms , inflation also eats into the real value of savings deposited at virtually ALL British banks and building societies that even now , are engaged in cutting the rates offered to savers to as little as 0.1 % , as my earlier analysis illustrated ( 23rd Jan 2010 - UK Savers Losing Money on Virtually ALL Instant Access Savings Accounts )
That virtually all accounts LOSE savers money in real terms AFTER inflation and AFTER the 20 % Savings tax .
That situation has now deteriorated even further as savers subsidise the bankster bonuses via loss of value of savings deposited in tax payer bailed out banks .

UK Interest Rate Implications
The mainstream view is for little if any change in UK interest rates this year , this is illustrated by Roger Bootle of the Daily Telegraph continuing his assertions even as recently as last week that he expects UK interest rates to stay below 1 % for the next 5 years .
However my in depth analysis of 13th January ( UK Interest Rate Forecast 2010 and 2011 ) concluded with the following forecast :
UK Interest Rates Forecast 2010 - 11 : UK interest Rates to Start Rising From Mid 2010 and Continue into end of 2010 to Target 1.75 % / 2 % , Continue Higher into Mid 2011 to Target 3 % .

It 's probably the worst kept secret in the country that both parties plan to increase Vat from 17.5 % to 20 % after the next election .
Bearing that in mind I 'd say it is very optimistic of King to expect inflation to be within his targeted band .
It 's awfully tempting to go into the banks and building societies and just take the cash out and tell them to talk about it with the BOE .
I for one am running out of patience at subsidising other peoples mortgages , cash for clunkers , the bankers yield curve .
Basically having made prudent decisions I 'm heartily sick of not getting my nose in the trough especially when I ' own ' part of that trough .

Naddem , Your UK inflation and interest rate forecast is looking embarrassing now .
Your forecast of UK rate hikes for last year was wrong and will be wrong again this year .
The BoE will keep rates at 0.5 % for the rest of 2010 .
Nadeem_Walayat
23 Mar 10 , 09:49 Embarrasing ?
Embarrasing ?
I do n't think so ....
BoE wants to keep rates at 0.5 % , but I expect it wo n't be allowed to do so .
As for last year , I warned that UK interest rates would start to crash lower when rates were at 5 % , and suggested savers fix their savings for 1 - 2 years at rates of between 6.5 % and 7.3 % ( available at the time ) .
Advice which I followed ! :)
http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article6675.html
NOTHING to be embarrassed about being out on year end rates by 1 % based on aforecast made a YEAR earlier .
The point is this I analyse the markets with a view to monetizing on trends by putting my own money on the line on the basis of my analysis , so it has to be accurate or I WILL lose money .
Which is why I caught the stock market bottom in March and concluded unequivably ( none of this bear market rally BS ) that we were in a STEALTH bull market that I expected would run for many years .
So I invested , and profited , now if that bull market had not transpired then being embarrased would far easier to deal with than the hole in my portfolio .
I expect interest rates to rise , 1.5 % to 2 % by end of this year , and 3 % by mid 2011 .
Watch and learn ;)
DH
23 Mar 10 , 10:56 Embarrasing ?
As far as the stock market , congratulations but I do n’t think I even mentioned that ??
On rates I was referring to the fact that you thought rates would rise to 1.5 % by the end of 2009 .
As far as this year ’s forecast , there is no way the BoE will raise rates this year at all , let alone to your forecast of 2 % .
Watch and learn
Nadeem_Walayat
23 Mar 10 , 12:20 Interest rates
The reason interest rates did not rise is because since March 2009 we have had no market , the rates are being kept artificially lower as a consquence of QE and other mechanisms .
UK inflation bottomed in mid 2009 as expected and had trended higher into the end of 2009 as forecast .
Interest rates would have followed this trend had they market not been actively manipulated where the Bank of England abandoned its policy of keeping inflation at 2 % .
Which is why we have inflation above 3 % .
If interes rates were at 1.5 % then inflation would be at 2 % .
I could have done what all other academic economists do that is to change their forecasts every month , but I chose NOT TO as that is basically a worthless excercise when it comes to attempting to monetize on trends .
Everyone can be right if they change their forecasts every month , but you cannot go back and make investments in hindesight .

Given your interest rate predictions I am in a quandry what to do with my Cash ISAs ...
Current Cash ISA offerings especially for transfering are around the 2.5 % mark , you can get fixes for 3 - 5 years at around 4 % and Northern Rock is offering a stepped account to 5.5 % if you tie the money up for 5 years .
Does that seem sensible or do you think there will be very large increases in inflation over the 3 - 5 year period ?
Nadeem_Walayat
24 Mar 10 , 14:22 Cash ISA
I can only say what i would do .
I wound 'nt ' fix for 3 to 5 years at 4 % , minimum would have to be 6 % .
The Northern Rock equates to an AER of 4.5 % Only 18 months ago ISA interest rates were between 6 % and 7 % , so 5 years is a long time to fix at 4.5 % .
IF I was transferring , I would be aiming for a 1 year fix at between 3 % and 3.5 % .

The resulting images look like the view froma low - altitude aircraft .
This enhanced view shows material that has ponded and isbacked up behind massive blocks of bedrock in the crater 's terrace walls .
Hundreds of Martian impact craters have similar ponding with pitted surfaces .
Scientists believe these " pitted ponds " arecreated when material melted by the crater - causing impacts is captured behindthe wall terraces .
Mojave Crater , one of the freshest large craters on Mars , isabout 37 miles ( 60 kilometers ) in diameter .
Analysis of the crater suggests itmay be as young as about 10 million years , very young for a crater of thissize .
Because it is so fresh , it helps scientists better understand thefeatures of other Martiancraters .
Other craters of this size generally have already beenaffected by erosion , sediment and other geologic process .
Fresh craters likeMojave reveal information about the impact process , including ejecta , meltingand deposits .
The top QC , his vanished sister and the mystery of Mossad 's first British hitwoman
To her neighbours in the nearby Rue Verdun , Penelope was just another eccentric foreigner living her life as best she could in the heart of war - torn west Beirut .
The attractive 30 - year - old Englishwoman passed her days seemingly doing nothing more than looking after stray cats and sketching from her window .
Then came January 22 , 1979 .
At 3.35 pm the street was rocked by a huge explosion as a 100 lb car bomb was detonated .
Nine people lost their lives in the blast but it was the death of Ali Hassan Salameh , ripped apart in the back of his Chevrolet station wagon , that would send shockwaves around the world .
Dubbed the Red Prince , he had been the chief planner for the terrorist organisation Black September and was behind the raid at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games in which 11 Israeli athletes were killed .
Erika Chambers ( left ) : Named as a Mossad assassin .
One of the alleged Dubai team who posed as ' Gail Folliard ' ( right )
Ever since , assassination squads from Mossad , the Israeli intelligence service , had been set loose on the world hell - bent on revenge .
And on that January day , their hunt for Salameh finally came to an end .
Of course , amid all the chaos and the confusion , nobody would have noticed Penelope slipping quietly out of her flat .
She had first taken the trouble to fill the cats ' dishes with food and had told a neighbour that the commotion had upset her so much she intended to rest in a hotel nearby .
But in fact she would never return and , to this day , her whereabouts remain a mystery .
All the hostages were killed in a botched rescue
What has , however , become apparent is that far from being an innocent Englishwoman abroad , Penelope was a Mossad spy trained to use her feminine wiles to inveigle her way into the life of one of the world 's most feared terrorists - and then help kill him .
Indeed , the evidence strongly suggests that it was she , a modern - day Mata Hari , who activated the detonator that blew up Salamah and his bodyguards .
Hers is an extraordinary story and this week it gained a grim new fascination .
The murder in Dubai of Hamas leader Mahmoud al - Mabhouh by an 11 - strong team of assassins has parallels to the murder of Salameh .
Not only is Mossad widely believed to be behind al - Mabhouh 's execution but , as with the killing of Salameh , a woman played a central role on the hit squad .
While doubts remain about the actual identities of the Dubai assassins , the years have provided some intriguing clues as to who ' Penelope ' really was .
Evidence that has emerged over the years suggests that she was in fact a British woman by the name of Erika Maria Chambers , and she was born and brought up in London as part of a wealthy Anglo - Jewish family .
The first female assassin :
The woman pretending to be Irish citizen Gail Folliard smiles as she passes under a CCTV camera during surveillance of the hotel
Living in Notting Hill , her early life , including stints of babysitting for the family of near - neighbour Labour MP Tony Benn , never hinted at the drama to come .
But having travelled to Israel to further her studies at a Hebrew university she was targeted by Mossad and persuaded to become an agent after learning more about the Holocaust , and how many of her relatives had died in it .
Having spent years as a ' sleeper ' in Germany , she was activated and sent to Beirut for her one and only mission .
After that , she was smuggled into Israel , where it is believed she has been in hiding ever since .
Such was her fear of PLO reprisals her only contact with her parents , both now dead , was the occasional Christmas card bearing an Israeli postage stamp .
But there is one further , extraordinary , twist to the story .
Erika Maria Chambers , ' Mossad assassin ' , has a brother .
His name is Nicholas Chambers - and he is a QC and leading civil court judge who is a pillar of the British judicial establishment .
Operation ' Wrath of God ' was set up to take revenge
With six days of the 1972 Olympics left to run , at 4.30 am on September 5 , five Palestinian gunmen , dressed in tracksuits and carrying sports bags scaled the 6ft 6in fence surrounding the Olympic Village .
Armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles and grenades they headed for the building housing the Israeli team .
Within an hour nine hostages had been taken and two athletes were dead .
A list of demands was issued and , after 21 hours of negotiations , the German authorities agreed to fly the gunmen and their captives to a nearby airfield .
There , live on television , a botched rescue attempt was staged .
It resulted in the death of all the hostages , five of the Palestinians and a policeman .
Determined to wreak their revenge for the Munich massacre , Mossad almost immediately embarked upon a clinically executed programme of assassinations .
Known as ' Operation Wrath of God ' , its targets were Yasser Arafat 's Palestine Liberation Organisation and the Black September guerillas believed to be behind Munich .
Within 41 days of the athletes ' kidnap , Mossad chalked up its first kill .
Their target was Wael Zwaiter , the suspected leader of Black September , who was shot in Rome by a hit squad as he returned to his flat one evening .
The day after his death , Israeli radio proudly reported the ' liquidation ' of the first of those involved in the planning of the Munich massacre .
A woman posing as Gail Folliard stakes out the hallway
Next , in December , was the execution of Mahmoud Hamshiri , the PLO 's top man in France .
The hit was carried out in Paris and involved a table in Hamshiri 's flat being switched with one built by Mossad that was packed with plastic explosives .
A telephone call lured him to the table and the bomb was detonated .
As the months passed , the missions got increasingly daring .
A raid into the heart of Beirut involving special forces dressed as women claimed the lives of three high - ranking targets , while in Cyprus a woman agent lured a man to his death on an exploding mattress .
But then , in the small Norwegian town of Lillehammer things started to go wrong .
Targetting Ali Hassan Salameh , second in the hit list only to Arafat himself , a case of mistaken identity led to the death of an innocent Moroccan waiter .
Arrests swiftly followed with the result that that five - strong team of assassins were jailed for murder .
Israel was directly linked to the killing and others around Europe , forcing the cancellation of Operation Wrath of God .
But Mossad was n't about to forget the unfinished business with Salameh .
She scored a direct hit as the car passed
Five times they would try to kill him , but every time the poster - boy of Arab terrorism escaped .
By 1979 he was chief of security of Al Fatah , the guerilla arm of the PLO and was directly responsible for Arafat 's safety .
Combined with his fondness for silk shirts and elegant Western suits , it earned him the nickname of the ' playboy cop ' - a reputation enhanced by the fact that his second wife was Lebanon 's 1972 Miss Universe .
But behind all this , Salameh was a deadly serious player and was widely regarded as Arafat 's anointed heir .
For this reason - and for his involvement in planning the Munich Massacre - the Israelis were determined to continue with their policy of international assassination .
With this in mind , they put together a plan to recruit an international team to facilitate his liquidation .
And it was here that their English recruit - ' Penelope ' - would come into play .
Following Salameh 's murder , a British passport was discovered in Penelope 's apartment in the Rue Verdun .
It was in the name of Erika Maria Chambers and gave her date of birth as February 10 , 1948 .
From this document alone it is , of course , impossible to be sure that this was her true identity .
Today , following the ' hit ' in Dubai , it has emerged that the killers were almost certainly travelling on false British passports , using details taken from the identities of individuals born in this country but now living in Israel .
The same could , of course , be true in the case of Erika Chambers .
But the evidence suggests otherwise .
Her birth certificate reveals that her parents were Marcus and Lona , who had married in London during the war .
The five - star Al - Bustan Rotana Hotel in Dubai where the murder took place
Marcus , a winner of the Le Mans 24 hour race and successful motor sport manager , came from a well - to - do English background ( his father was an admiral ) .
His wife Lona , whose maiden name was Gross , came from a Jewish family from Czechoslovakia and had fled to Britain to escape the Nazis .
Erika and her older brother Nicholas , who was three years older , were brought up in comfortable surroundings in Holland Park , West London , and both were privately educated .
But their parents separated as they were growing up , with Erika living with her mother .
She would go on to study geography at Southampton , where tutors remember her as dedicated to her work but at the same time something of a daredevil , owning a Mini Cooper that she would drive around the city at high speed .
After university she travelled briefly to Australia before moving to Israel to study .
She arrived at much the same time as the Munich massacre and soon after , according to intelligence sources in Israel and Germany , she was targeted by Mossad as they ' talent - spotted ' for an agent to help them kill Salameh .
Erika was perfect .
Thanks to her mother she spoke German fluently ( a talent cleverly exploited by Mossad 's masterplan ) and her allegiance to the Israeli cause was cemented after Mossad supplied her with harrowing details of how some of her maternal relatives had died in Nazi gas chambers .
' She was like a good , ordinary English girl , ' explains Wilhelm Dietl , a German expert on Mossad who has written a book on the assassination of Salameh , and has had access to intelligence file on the hit .
' As far as Mossad was concerned she was clean and , crucially , did n't look Jewish . '
Several years of intensive training followed , after which she moved to Germany in 1975 .
She lived there for three years .
The purpose was two - fold .
First , it distanced her from her time in Israel .
Second , following the assassination , it would suggest that the German security services were behind the killing - not Mossad .
At the end of 1978 , having been given a visa for Lebanon by the Lebanese Embassy in Bonn , Erika travelled to Beirut .
Using the name Penelope , she rented a flat overlooking the Rue Verdun , close to where Salameh lived , posing as an eccentric painter and PLO supporter .
After several months she penetrated the welfare organisation of the Palestinians and from there on to reach Salameh was not a problem , ' one of the Mossad agents involved in planning the hit has since revealed .
' So she went to the same swimming pool as him and later on they got friendly . '
Whether or not she slept with him is unclear , but what we do know , according to sources , is that having established Salameh 's daily routine another Mossad agent flew into Beirut two weeks before the hit .
Also using a British passport , he used the name Peter Scriver ( both the name and the passport have been shown to be fake ) and after checking into a hotel rented a Volkswagen from the Lenacar agency .
Some time on January 17 , the two met up , after which Scriver drove the VW to a secret garage where it was equipped with a 100 lb payload of explosives .
Shortly afterwards , his work done , the mysterious Scriver left the country , with a third agent parking the VW in the Rue Verdun 100 yards from Salameh 's apartment , and in view of Penelope 's flat , on January 22 at 2.30 pm .
An hour later , Salameh left his home in his Chevrolet , in the company of four bodyguards .
As they passed the VW the bomb was detonated , mortally wounding the occupants of the station wagon as well as killing four passers - by - including a German nun and an English student .
A further 18 bystanders were injured .
Although some reports suggest the bomb was set off by a timing device , the Mossad agent involved in the hit claims that it was detonated by Erika .
' Her role was only to press the button at the right time when his car was passing the Volkswagen , ' he said .
' Co-ordinating it was very difficult and she was trained to do it .
But she managed so well that when he passed she pressed the button and got a direct hit . '
Even as the smoke settled , there was little doubt as to what had happened .
Israel - and Wrath of God - had finally got their man .
The Palestinians were furious .
When Arafat learned of Salameh 's death he said : ' We have lost a lion . '
And he ordered those responsible to be hunted down .
But by then it was already too late .
Like the hit , the Mossad agents ' escape had been meticulously planned .
By the time the PLO was beginning to understand the role played by ' Penelope ' she was in Israel , having driven to the Christian port of Jounieh before being spirited out of Lebanon on an Israeli gunboat .
In her flat she had left a British passport - sowing the seeds of a mystery that would last to this day .
At the time it was widely assumed that the Erika Chambers 's identity must have been a Mossad creation .
After all , not only was it a tried and tested espionage technique but checks on her accomplice , Scriver , showed that he did not exist .
Could the same be said of Erika Chambers ?
It would seem not .
Respected author Aaron J. Klein says the passport was genuine and that Erika had been able to use her own identity , as this was a one - off hit .
' Erika Chambers was a nice British lady who even used her own passport , ' explains Klein , whose book Striking Back details the Israeli response to Munich .
' She was an ad hoc operative recruited for a specific mission .
She was used and no longer needed after the operation .
A common procedure .'
Wilhelm Dietl , the German Mossad expert , has further confirmed her identity .
He travelled to Britain in the early 1990s and spoke with Erika 's father .
' They did n't have a great relationship , but he said there was the odd Christmas card with an Israeli postmark on it , ' he says .
' What was clear , however , was that she did remain in touch with her brother . '
He is Oxford - educated Nicholas Mordaunt Chambers , a QC since 1985 and civil court judge .
The Mail contacted him on two occasions to discuss the alleged involvement of his sister in the killing of Salameh .
Asked if the Erika Maria Chambers named as a Mossad agent was in fact his sister , Mr Chambers replied : ' You are pursuing from your own point of view a very proper line of inquiry but you will understand that it 's not something I can help you with . '
The conversation continued thus : Reporter : ' You appear to be her brother and I am intrigued to know if that is accurate and what indeed has happened to your sister . '
Mr Chambers : ' The answer is you probably < cite > are </ cite > intrigued ' ( laughs ) .
Reporter : ' I am writing an article about her .
I hope if the Israeli intelligence services had assumed someone 's identity , your sister 's , you might be able to guide me on that . '
Mr Chambers : ' It 's a very fair line , but , there one is - well - it 's probably really best I do n't say anything . '
Contacted a second time he would only say that he hoped that ' time has moved on ' .
An intriguing response , indeed .
But , then , in the world inhabited by ' Penelope ' , a world of international espionage , of Mossad - trained death squads , and of life - long glances over one 's shoulder , what else should we expect ?
The magic that is cheese only really needs four ingredients to happen : milk , salt , rennet ( or some other coagulant , as I discussed earlier ) , and microbes .
Like everyone , I used to be vaguely aware that there were " good " bacteria and molds that grew on and in cheese , and that 's where my interest ended .
But there 's a real variety of microbes that bring us the variety of cheeses we enjoy , and they 're worth knowing about .
I would be a bad scientist if I did n't mention that , since I am no microbiologist , if you want all the details , you should peruse the Wikipedia articles I 'll link to or consult your local library .
Many modern cheeses are made with preselected cultures , consisting of only a few types of microbe , but many traditional cheeses are inoculated using whey or other products from previous batches , meaning that they can be made with dozens of types of microbe , some highly unusual .
This microbial wealth is among the many reasons that traditional cheeses can be so much more complex than modern , controlled - inoculation cheeses .
Modern microbiology has yet to fully explain the role of all microbes in cheese - flavor and cheese - ripening , so the limited selection of controlled inoculation produces cheeses that may be less interesting .
Lactic Acid Bacteria
Lactic acid bacteria are often called " starter cultures " , as they play the main role in converting the basic milk sugar , lactose , into lactic acid , a step which lowers cheese pH and makes the cheese inhospitable to many spoilage organisms and is the first step towards deliciousness .
There are essentially two main families of lactic acid bacteria : lactococci ( sphere - shaped , lactic - acid producing bacteria ) and lactobacilli ( rod- shaped , lactic - acid producing bacteria ) .
Streptococci can also play an important role in initial cheese ripening , and are very important in yogurt - making .
Although many of these bacteria die off after the initial step of cheesemaking , there are varieties that survive and continue to contribute to cheese flavor in many cheeses , especially alpine ( Emmental , Gruyere , etc ) and Italian hard ( Grana Padana , Pecorino Romano , etc ) cheeses .
Propionic Acid Bacteria
These bacteria , and specifically Propionobacter shermanii , are able to digest acetic acid and convert it to sharp , sweaty - smelling propionic acid and carbon dioxide .
The carbon dioxide is what gives Emmental and other Swiss cheeses their characteristic " holes " , and the propionic acid contributes to their complex , especially sharp bouquet .
Interestingly , several species of propionibacteria inhabit human skin , and help produce " unwashed " odors .
Molds ( Blue and White )
Molds love cheese .
Leave any cheese in a fridge without protection and it will quickly be colonized by a fuzzy carpet of interestingly colored spores .
Most of the molds that grow on cheese are species of Penicillium , but some cheeses , like St. Nectaire , develop all kinds of crazy surface molds , most of which are not harmful and in fact contribute to that cheese 's unique flavor .
Only two species of blue mold , P. roqueforti and P. glaucum , give rise to the unique flavor and texture of the hundreds of blue cheese which are revered throughout the world .
These blue molds are capable of growing in remarkably low - oxygen environments , which makes them perfectly suited for the small cracks in the interior of a ripening cheese .
In fact , cheesemakers regularly pierce and inoculate channels through to - be - blued cheeses in order to encourage the growth of these molds .
Blues , like Roquefort , Stilton , Gorgonzola , and Cabrales are some of the most famous cheeses in the world , but blue molds also frequently grow on the surface of goat cheeses , adding color and flavor , but without growing in the interior , as is the case of the unsurpassable Monte Enebro .
White molds , which are found on the outside of all types of soft - ripened cheeses , are subspecies of P. camembertii ( also called P. candidum ) .
These white molds produce enzymes that break down the milk proteins of the curds , leading to the characteristic ripened layer surrounding a firm interior in many of these cheeses .
The flavor compounds that are produced by this enzymatic breakdown are generally garlicky or earthy ; unfortunately , ammonia is also a by - product of this breakdown , and so it is advisable to let these cheeses breathe ( sit uncovered ) in order to allow the highly volatile ammonia to dissipate .
Smear Bacteria
Last but perhaps most notorious are the smear bacteria , which are responsible for the room - clearing ability of Epoisses , Münster , and Limburger .
These smear bacteria are officially known as Brevibacter linens .
They can't live in acidic or deoxygenated environments , and so cannot survive in the interior of cheeses .
Since they need salty ( up to 15 % ) , moist environments to grow , they must be encouraged to do so by continual washing or wiping of the cheese surfaces , a process which results in the development of the characteristic red " smear " surface of so - called " washed - rind " cheeses .
B. linens excels at breaking down proteins into , well , stinky odor compounds , producing oniony or garlicky , fishy , and sweaty aromas .
Some cheeses , like the great alpine cheeses , are wiped only during part of their ripening , producing a muted complexity of flavor , rather than the nasal assault that accompanies many cheeses that play host to B. linens .
The aroma of the washed - rind cheeses is often compared to smelly feet by both fans and detractors , a fact which is easily understood , as brevibacter are ubiquitous on human skin , and grow especially well without interference from personal hygiene .
So , next time you pick up a piece of cheese , think of the huge microbial society that 's gone to the trouble of producing the masterpiece in front of you .
Then you can pretend you 're Godzilla or something when you eat the cheese , with thousands of screaming microbes fleeing for the escape capsules .
At least , that 's what I do .

In news apt to surprise absolutely no one , HTC CEO Peter Chou told Forbes this week that his company would make a Windows Phone 7 Series handset by the end of the year .
For the sake of argument , we suppose there are a couple reasons he would n't want to .
Historically , HTC has pledged loyalty to Microsoft time and again , even making the premium HD2 a Windows Mobile exclusive , but conspiracy theorists might suggest Microsoft returned the favor by denying the HD2 entry to Windows Phone 7 Series .
Also , HTC has been rocking the bejeezus out of Android as of late -- the news that the company 's planning a WP7S phone comes alongside HTC 's claim that the Nexus One was a success .
Regardless , we never questioned if HTC would build a WP7S handset , only when ; there 's no way they 're going to let a lucrative new smartphone market get mopped up by the likes of Samsung and LG
Palin Left Alaska With Debts Equal to 70 Percent of Its GDP
Created : March 30 , 2010 15:41 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
While Greece ’s public debt — which the Goldman currency swaps were designed to help hide — amounts to 113 percent of its GDP currently , it turns out that Greece and its EU partners are n’t the only one keeping debts off the books and using complex accounting techniques to hide them .
Mary Williams
Walsh reports in The New York Times that many states engaged in the same behavior and , like Greece , are about to face a major reckoning .
California , New York and other states are showing many of the same signs of debt overload that recently took Greece to the brink — budgets that will not balance , accounting that masks debt , the use of derivatives to plug holes , and armies of retired public workers who are counting on benefits that are proving harder and harder to pay .
New Hampshire and Colorado attempted to use program - specific pots of state money to plug holes in their general treasuries ; Connecticut wrote its own accounting rules ; Hawaii reduced the length of its school week ; and California made its businesses pay their 2010 taxes earlier to make the budget appear more balanced than it is .
But one thing every state is doing , including Alaska , is camouflaging its debts by not releasing how much its state employee pension funds will owe — or how far behind it is on its contributions to said pension funds .
Less than a year after then - Gov. Sarah Palin ( R - Alaska ) quit the government to pursue other projects , Alaska leads the way in its debt - to - GDP ratio when its unfunded pension obligations are taken into account , followed by Rhode Island , New Mexico , Ohio and Mississippi .
And although Alaska ’s ratio is far lower than Greece ’s , it does give the state a debt - to - GDP ratio similar to that of Jordan and Palin ’s favorite health care resource , Canada , and a higher ratio than Ghana , Cote d’Ivoire , India , the Philippines or Uruguay .
BOSTON – You can warp across parts of Red Dead Redemption 's open world , but you 'd be plum loco to want to .
I played a little bit of Rockstar 's new open - world cowboy game at PAX East on Saturday and immediately grokked how I 'd be playing the game when it comes out May 18 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 .
I 'd be chasing every distraction , just the way I scoured the Capital Wasteland in Fallout 3 .
Red Dead Redemption 's plot is easy enough to find .
On my mini-map , there were a couple of capital letters ( familiar enough to anyone who 's ever played a Grand Theft Auto game ) .
It 's easy enough to tilt the D - pad to call my horse , press Y to mount the steed and pump A to coax my mount to move .
But the last thing I wanted to do was hot - foot it to my next plot point , even though I knew that a smartly - written moment of character building would be waiting for me there .
There 's just way too much to get distracted by in Redemption 's old West .
From where I stood on a small desert rise , I saw a wild horse in the distance , galloping through the shimmering haze .
These , I 'm told , can be lassoed , broken and tamed .
While riding through the brush , I stirred up a mess of armadillos .
I picked them off one varmint at a time with my pistol .
On the way to my goal , I came across a pair of cowboys tearing ass through a shadowy ravine .
I could have put a bullet in their backs , suffering a loss in reputation , but I decided I 'd rather race the pair .
I gave my horse the spur and pushed ahead , just barely edging out the other riders as I rode clear of the narrow pass into the wide open .
Atop a small mesa I found an observation tower and a box of ammo .
Futzing around near the bottom of the tower , I disturbed a crow that had been roosting in its heights .
As the bird took flight , I drew my gun and picked it out of the air .
This triggered a " sharpshooting challenge . "
I stood my ground , bullseyeing birds .
Even without the structure of the mini - game challenge , I felt like I could have participated in this particular flavor of avian cruelty for hours .
I rode my horse down to where the first bird dropped and found its broken corpse in the middle of the dirt road .
I dismounted and plucked a single feather from its body .
This will be good for something later , I thought .
There was a small settlement nearby – barns , houses and a graveyard .
The boneyard was where my next bit of story awaited .
I found Seth Briars there , a raggedy old treasure hunter driven mad by his quest for gold .
The old nut had a lead for me , but wound up walking me into an ambush .
A dozen or so gunmen spilled out of a handful of rickety buildings and took potshots at me from all directions .
I ran for cover , crouched behind a small wall and thumbed the left bumper to bring up the weapon wheel .
I switched to a rifle and proceeded to pick off the baddies at long range .
Clicking the right stick let me break into " Deadeye , " a slow motion mode that allowed me to highlight multiple enemies and take them out in a single hail of bullets .
My path of corpses eventually led to an old mansion .
Inside , I had the opportunity to get up close and personal with my attackers .
Pulling the trigger at close range triggered a contextual kill – I shoved my gun into my enemy 's gut and discharged the weapon .
Blood erupted from the sucker 's back .
My final foe guarded a chest in one of the upstairs rooms .
I walked right up to him and executed him with a single pistol shot to the head .
By now it had grown dark .
I left the scene of the slaughter into the starry night .
The moon hung low in the sky .
A half dozen wild horses galloped through the pale shadows .
The panorama I found before me was a thing of beauty , a stark contrast to all the ugliness I 'd just undertaken .
In less than 10 minutes , I felt drawn in to this rich slice of history that Rockstar has replicated – a place where the harshness of nature and the cruelty of man are at odds with the urge to tame and the desire for progress and for peace .
I 'm thrilled by the romantic notion of living on the cusp of those two worlds and spilling blood as part of the final death throes of the Wild West .
As I watch those wild horses gallop through the night , I know that this is a place I 'm going to want to linger in for a spell .

`cat` may be run quickly enough to read the data before the shell is scheduled to truncate the file .
But depending on the kernel , the size of the file and the load on the system , you will lose data .

The current directory might not be writeable
Lose your data if $ filter fails or is interrupted

Lose all attributes of original file
If we do n't care about atomicity then we can use another writeable dir .
$ filter < file >
/tmp/file.tmp && mv /tmp/file.tmp file Lose all attributes of original file Also if / tmp is a different file system , then : Slower as file written twice
mv still needs writeable dir as it recreates the file
File missing for a while
Data inconsistent for a while
Limited to attributes supported by the other file system
We can get around most of the previous issues by using cp and rm rather than mv as cp does a truncate ( ) ; write ( ) ; on the original file , so all attributes are maintained .
Note this method is functionally equivalent to that used by the sponge utility .
$ filter < file >
/tmp/file.tmp && cp /tmp/file.tmp file rm /tmp/file.tmp
Slower as file written twice
Data inconsistent for a while
If we do need atomicity then we need to have a dir on the same filesystem that 's writeable , so that we can do a rename ( old , new ) which is atomic .
Usually that 's the current dir so assuming that ... $ filter < file > file .tmp && mv file .tmp file
Lose all attributes of original file
If we want to maintain all attributes which is increasingly important with selinux and capabilities etc .
we'd have to : cp - a file file .
tmp $ filter < file > file.tmp && mv file .tmp file Slower as file written twice
If we want to be more efficient , then we would need cp to support only copying the attributes .
I 've proposed a patch to do just that : cp -- attributes - only file file .tmp $ filter < file > file.tmp && mv file .tmp file Note certain attributes are only maintainable by root .
For e.g. non root users updating another user 's file by first creating a new temporary file , will silently change ownership of the original file when it 's replaced .
What if you want a backup though ?
cp -- attributes - only file file .tmp $ filter < file > file.tmp && mv - b file .tmp file
This is no longer atomic as the file is not present for a short while as mv implements the backup like : rename ( old , bak ) ; rename ( tmp , old ) ;
So therefore if you want to support atomic replacement with backups with cp / mv you need to cp -- attributes - only file file .
tmp cp - a - b -f file file $ filter < file > file.tmp && mv file .tmp file Slower as file written twice
We can make the extra backup step in the previous step more efficient by using hardlinks ( thanks reddit ! ) .
cp -- attributes - only file file .tmp cp - l - b -f file file $ filter < file > file.tmp && mv file .tmp file
if -- atomic && -- backup ; then 12 elif -- atomic ; then 9 || 8 else 9 || 8 || 6 fi
Replacing the contents of a file on the UNIX command line using the standard commands is surprisingly tricky .
In the examples below , $ filter is any command that reads from stdin and writes to stdout .
So if one was to implement a general replacement script ( as I 'm currently considering for GNU coreutils ) , one could apply the following logic :
Note there are many other edge cases to consider which are mainly handled within cp/mv , which one can see by looking at the complexity of copy .
c
There is also the general caveat of how to deal with interruptions at various parts of the above .
I.E. if a script implementing the above is killed , are there tmp files left on disk ?
There is also the more general caveat of the variances in consistency guarantees provided by various file systems .
People do n't want to talk about taxes .
Most of us are afraid that a tax increase will impact ALL of us .
The media shies away from such a controversial topic .
Certainly the rich do n't want to talk about it .
And even lower - income people seem to have this sense that they will be wealthy someday , and government should n't interfere with their plans .
So on we go with the cutbacks in train and bus service , and the loss of teachers , the cancellation of after - school programs in low - income areas , reductions in library hours and park services .
Plus , of course , increases in state income taxes , sales taxes , property taxes , gas taxes , cigarette taxes , utility costs , license fees , parking meter rates .
The public rarely hears about one of the major causes of this assault on the middle class .
From 1980 to 2006 the richest 1 % of America TRIPLED their after - tax percentage of our nation 's total income , while the bottom 90 % have seen their share drop over 20 % .
That 's a TRILLION dollars a year , one - seventh of America 's total income , that went to the richest 1 % while 90 % of us went backwards .
But , many people ask , do n't the very rich pay most of the taxes ?
Just federal income tax .
And they pay less than 23 % of their incomes in federal income tax .
If state and local taxes , social security tax , and excise taxes are included , the lowest - earning half of America pays 24 % of their incomes in taxes .
But is n't taxing the rich a form of socialism ?
Since 1980 , if the average working family had received compensation based on its relative contribution to America 's prosperity , it would be making an average of $ 45,000 a year instead of $ 35,000 .
Through 30 years of deregulation and financial maneuvering , the richest 1 % have taken $ 10,000 a year from every American family .
That 's socialism in reverse .
But does n't " income mobility " explain and mitigate the apparent inequities ?
In his book , " Intellectuals and Society " ( Basic Books , 2009 ) , Thomas Sowell claims that statements about inequality are " confusing statistical categories with flesh - and - blood human beings . "
Sowell relies heavily on a 2007 U.S. Treasury Department report about income mobility that states " Among those with the very highest incomes in 1996 – the top 1/100 of 1 percent – only 25 percent remained in this group in 2005 . "
But he ignores the fact that nearly 9 out of 10 of those in the top 1 % remained in the top quintile of earners over those ten years .
They may have dropped out of the most elite 1 % group , but they remained close .
The apple does n't fall far from the tree .
But that is n't even the main point .
More significantly , our economy allows a tiny percentage of us to take an inordinate amount of money from society , at an increasing rate .
Some people may have dropped out of this elite group , but those who have moved in are making even more !
The result is a system in which one man ( hedge fund manager John Paulson in 2007 ) can make more money than the total of the salaries of every police officer , firefighter , and public school teacher in Chicago , while another man stands hungry in the cold .
And any attempt to fix the system is called socialism .
So what 's the solution ?
Several states have implemented more progressive tax systems .
And they have apparently not caused wealthy people to transfer their fortunes out - of - state .
A 2008 study by Princeton University determined that " the ' half - millionaire tax , ' at least in New Jersey , appears to be an effective and efficient revenue - generation mechanism , having little impact on migration patterns among half - millionaire households . " [ 1 ]
Similarly , little adverse effect of higher taxes was found in Maryland or Oregon . [ 2 ]
A study by the California Budget Project revealed that the number of high - income households actually grew during periods of higher income tax rates for top earners . [ 3 ]
Oregon recently passed Measures 66 and 67 , which impose modest income tax increases on the wealthiest residents and raise the corporate minimum tax for the first time in 80 years .
President Obama is right to seek a progressive federal tax structure in which the very rich will return some of the money derived from years of deregulation and shrewd financial strategies .
We need Congress and the media to support this way of thinking .
A wave of coordinated antigovernment protests around Russia this weekend will likely be heard in the Kremlin as distant thunder , and not an immediate challenge to the still - popular Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , say analysts .
But Mr. Putin might be wise to take note of the Tea Party - like " Day of Wrath " rallies that struck 20 Russian cities on Saturday – from the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad to the Pacific port of Vladivostok – because they illustrate a growing willingness among crisis - hit Russians to take their grievances into the streets as well as an extraordinary , Internet - driven ability to coordinate their actions across the country 's expanse of 11 time zones .
" These rallies brought together very diverse – even opposing – political forces , who mainly directed their anger at local authorities and not against the Kremlin , " says Boris Kagarlitsky , a longtime political activist and head of the independent Institute for Globalization and Social Movements in Moscow .
" But the organization was brilliant .
They managed to have 20 events involving a dozen different groups – liberals , environmentalists , Stalinists , human rights activists – and bring them together at the same time and place , " to express a shared , if inchoate , rage against the government , he says .
The biggest rallies , of between 1,000 and 2,000 protesters each , were in Kaliningrad , Vladivostok , and St. Petersburg , where automobile owners angry at new taxes and traffic police corruption joined with liberals expressing outrage over alleged fraud in recent regional elections , and human rights workers who complain the window for dissent in Russia is slamming shut .
Website mysteriously shut down
Authorities in most cities did not overtly ban the rallies , as has often happened in the past , but the independent Ekho Moskvi radio station reported Friday that a website dedicated to coordinating the meetings ( www.20marta.ru) was mysteriously shut down , and remains inaccessible .
A planned meeting in Moscow , which was prohibited by the city 's conservative mayor , Yury Luzhkov , drew around 200 people , who were greatly outnumbered by massive ranks of riot police surrounding the central Pushkin Square .
Moscow police said that 70 people were arrested , most of whom were quickly released .
Though the protests appear to pose no coherent or immediate challenge to the Kremlin , analysts say they are a sign of mounting economic pain and political frustration around the country , and a growing readiness among young people to take their grievances into the streets .
A poll conducted earlier this month by the independent Levada Center in Moscow found that 27 percent of Russians favor the idea of antigovernment protests ; and the largest numbers of them were 18 - to - 24 - year - olds living in big cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg .
" There is a real potential for spreading unrest , and any of these very different triggers we see in these rallies can play a role , " says Nikolai Petrov , an expert with the Carnegie Center in Moscow .
" There is an accumulation of negative feeling due to the fact that the economic crisis goes on much longer than expected , and many local problems are mounting , " he says .
" Local authorities are often very clumsy in the way they manage these protests and , should they worsen , they may prove incapable of containing them . "
Internet petition against Putin
Putin might also want to take note of another Internet - driven protest that 's gaining ground .
An online petition calling Putin's Russia " an historical dead end " and demanding the powerful prime minister resign has now attracted almost 15,000 signatures – in a country where many people remain fearful of the potential consequences for publicly associating their names with any anti-overnment cause .
" It 's really significant that several thousand people are willing to put their full names on this petition , to openly state their position as citizens and declare they are not afraid of persecution , " says Yevgeny Ikhlov , a spokesman of For Human Rights , a grass - roots , Moscow - based group .
" This is a courageous gesture that 's well understood in this society , " he says .
" If it were anonymous , it would be worthless . "
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , who often seems to play " good cop " to Putin 's more hard - line approach , has made several attempts to utilize the Internet as a means of getting the Kremlin 's message out to younger , educated Russians .
Biggest threat from within ?
Despite the apparently growing mood of social protest , the biggest threat to the Putin - Medvedev government might be within the Kremlin .
Although rumors of a falling out between Mr. Medvedev and Putin remain unsubstantiated , many experts believe that the official facade of unbreakable unity may be far from reality .
" Russia has a very rigid , top - down state structure that seems to be fairly invulnerable to challenges from without , " says Mr. Kagarlitsky .
" But it 's not really able to generate long - term stability , and it 's only a matter of time before there 's a split at the top .
The biggest threat to the system comes from within . "
Israel 's ambassador to Norway has complained to press regulators about a cartoon showing Israeli PM Ehud Olmert as a Nazi concentration camp commander .
Miryam Shomrat told the BBC the caricature in Oslo's Dagbladet newspaper went beyond free speech .
Ms Shomrat said it would be open to prosecution in some European countries .
Dagbladet 's editor said the caricature was " within the bounds of freedom of expression , " according to Norway 's NRK state broadcaster .
Ms Shomrat made the official complaint to the Norwegian Press Trade Committee following the publication of the cartoon on 10 July .
In an interview with the BBC's Europe Today , she said however that her protest could not be compared to the outcry in the Muslim world over the publication in a Danish newspaper of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed .
Lars Helle , Dagbladet 's acting editor - in - chief , said the newspaper was taking the complaint seriously .
" But I do not fear that Dagbladet will be found guilty , " Mr Helle told the NRK .
The cartoon shows Mr Olmert standing on a balcony in a prison camp .
He is holding a sniper 's rifle and a dead man is seen lying on the ground .
The drawing clearly alluded to the Hollywood film Schindler 's List , in which a sadistic Nazi commander shoots Jewish prisoners for fun , according to Dagbladet .
